This is a big hurdle for most people looking for a free apartment.<p>There's many different categories of homeless. One of the most difficult to resolve is the long term chronic ones. Pretty much nothing tried has worked. However, pilot programs offering apartments have worked, at least it has reduced the cost of handling them and increased their quality of life. We are talking a small number of people, perhaps a few dozen in a big city like Chicago or New York or London. These are the guys that the police and social workers and hospitals all know by name because they are dealing with them every year for more than 10 years.<p>Given these constraints, do you agree that there is not a risk with moral hazard as implemented?<p>Of course there is the risk that such a program would be expanded to the point where it would become either a moral hazard, or become a substitute for welfare programs that deal with long term structural issues of unemployment caused by globalization and other factors.

I usually tell them to get a terminal emulator that lets you easily manage many terminals open. Open one per directory you want to operate in, for instance. Learn how to switch back and forth between the different shells.<p>But most importantly, don't quit the program to switch back and forth between directories and files. Learn to use your editor of choice properly: how to view directory listings, how to switch back and forth, etc. Vim can do this just fine btw. The choice of tool here doesn't matter so much. Just pick one and learn it. This applies to your choice of terminal emulator, shell, editor, etc.",1298074444.0

It is very specific to the machine it is built for - endianness, structure alignment, and so forth.<p>> Hell, you can translate it to javascript if you're truly worried about absolute browser portability: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/emscripten/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/emscripten/</a><p>Thanks for mentioning Emscripten, I wrote it :) It's interesting though, that a main challenge in Emscripten is exactly to deal with the non-portability issues in LLVM.<p>The reason LLVM is used in Emscripten (and, I suspect, in PNaCl) is not that it is portable - it isn't - but that nothing portable exists which is as good as LLVM in other respects (clean codebase, well-defined assembly language, good toolchain, etc.).",1298073655.0
