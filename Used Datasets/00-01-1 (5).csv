Writing zeroes works, except that any bad blocks that have been mapped out will still contain their last data. A sufficiently motivated ""bad person"" could read those, possibly by performing some ""unmark bad block"" operation on the drive.<p>Bit zones on a disk are analog things, think of writing zeroes as laying a blank piece of paper over a written secret message. You may still be able to read the secret message. In the olden days it was possible to use specialized tiny devices to read the analog the disk's surface and work out the previous data. (This is the origin of the ""erase (7|49) times"" rules.)<p>I rather doubt that modern drives can be read this way after a wipe. There is a dollar reward out for any data retrieval service that can retrieve data from a wiped drive that is, as yet, unclaimed. I think the PR win would inspire that crowd to demonstrate the capability if they had it. That leaves wealthy nations as possible readers.<p>Given the minimal value of an old hard drive, I give them a few chops with a splitting maul if I have a couple, when getting rid of many of them I take them to an ewaste handler and pay him $10 to throw them in the shredder while I watch. That way they get recycled better.",1235703598.0

Also, while that business <i>can</i> reinvest in the state, I just don't see how that can quickly reach the needs of citizens. A corporation saving millions might pay its employees more, who will pay income tax, which will eventually reach a state government only causing further centralization of state powers.<p>>There is a reassessment on sale.<p>Your right. That reassessment is exactly what drives away large new corporate jobs. Imagine company A has a warehouse since 1975. A pays taxes at (1975 level)*1.02^34. This increase is significantly less than actual property values have increased. So when its main competitor, company B, comes to town shopping for a huge tract of land, it's looking at paying reassessment taxes. If they both did the exact same job with the same income, company A stands at a huge advantage solely because it pays so little in property tax compared to B.<p>Warren Buffet nearly destroyed Arnold Schwarzenegger's campaign when he stated that prop 13 was terrible, specifically targeting the reassessment clause. <a href=""http://www.wealthandwant.com/docs/Buffett_Prop13.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wealthandwant.com/docs/Buffett_Prop13.html</a>",1235702326.0

""Dive into Python"" made my head spin, confusingly enough (it is a great book).  \nI did a small project (a deployment system that compiles HTML from a database of Markdown text using Jinja2 templating), coded it up real fast (I was amazed), refactored the thing to read easily and extend well, and <i>just sat back</i>.  Just like that.  \nI all made so much sense, while being so concise, I didn't realize it could be so elegant to write something, something readable, something you do not have to decipher when you get back to it later.  I am <i>absolutely</i> sold.<p>So here's my two cents -- pick a project, a small one, not necessarily something you're going to sell or even release, some repetitive task you have to perform, for instance, and automate that with Python, bring some structure to it and see how that goes.  \nYou might be not as impressionable, but there is definitely immediate gains with this approach (besides scratching your own itch as with my example).",1235701653.0

23,496744,comment,495857.0,496064.0,0,0,Oxryly,,,"It's not that simple.  For one, you want to lose fat weight, not muscle, bone, etc. weight.  How does your body consume or store fat?  It depends on available calories, the caloric composition, and your hormone feedback systems.  Arguably, the hormones exert more control than anything else.<p>It gets more complicated from there:  hormone's respond to what you eat. Eat more sugar, it raises your insulin (a hormone) which will stop the conversion of fat to energy, and indirectly will cause the conversion of blood sugar to fat. If your insulin is improperly regulated, you'll have difficult following the simple formula above.  The same goes for thyroid hormones. They regulate your metabolism.  Another hormone involved is cortisol which reponds to stress levels and can increase your blood sugar levels (cascading over into insulin, for example).  Note that you can run into the non-intuitive case of over exercise increasing your cortisol causing excessive blood sugar causing fat storage. It's not easy, but it is possible.<p>One way to look at it simply is to eat foods that control your blood sugar, and manage your stress levels to avoid excessive cortisol.  Excessive protein and fiber calories won't cause fat to build, going against the above formula. In fact, protein and fiber are excellent blood sugar regulating foods and are therefore good at controlling fat building.",1235701508.0
