In my day-job, I administer MySQL databases, and only vaguely handle anything with PostgreSQL. Replication was an issue when we went down the MySQL path, and I haven't kept abreast of PostgreSQL's development.",1217033620

Is that what you meant?<p>Just to be clear, I believe in speaking frankly about race, so am not objecting to that aspect of your post. But I'm skeptical of attempts to bottle up something as grand as ""intelligence"" into a single metric. For example, I read somewhere that the original Stanford-Binet had to be modified because women were scoring higher than men (so it obviously needed correcting). That's a pretty compelling detail, if true.<p>(I don't remember where I first read this, but a little Googling brings up <a href=""http://www.beyondsatire.us/?q=node/18"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.beyondsatire.us/?q=node/18</a>, which is hardly definitive but does have an interesting author.)",1217033548

7,257263,comment,257242.0,257242.0,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Aside from the reasons listed, not all mp3 players even play formats like FLAC in the first place. Also, even as a generic term -- unless they're iPods, they're ""MP3 players"", so they're probably going to be closely associated with MP3 files until something radically different comes along. It took me a bit to find a player I liked that could play ogg vorbis. (It was an iAudio U2 flash drive, several years ago.) Granted, there are also Apple and Microsoft lossless codecs, but file format fragmentation is part of the problem here.<p>Also, not all music even benefits from the careful encoding that could benefit, say, Beethoven. One of my favorite bands, The Mountain Goats, has recorded about half of their numerous releases on an old Panasonic boombox. Also, some studio music is produced so poorly that a lossless copy off CD wouldn't help much (<a href=""http://www.mindspring.com/~mrichter/dynamics/dynamics.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mindspring.com/~mrichter/dynamics/dynamics.htm</a>).",1217032785

With a bit of planning, that's only about $4-5k of travel per founder.  I'm assuming here that there's only air travel costs and that founders can find places to stay for free while they're in town.<p>It may be that there is much more face-to-face time that happens because people are co-located, but I didn't the impression that the founders all work in one large room or anything similar.<p>Even traveling to SF or Cambridge for 2-3 days a week is something that I think people would be willing to do.  I can even imagine looking forward to the time away from the family!",1217032669
11,257259,comment,256612.0,257005.0,0,0,dejb,,,"I don't think the argument is that the current system of subsidies is well organised. It is simply that the over-production of food probably has some significant national security advantages. Running out of food is even worse than running out of oil, steal or microprocessors.<p>This would only be likely happen in a wartime scenario and it would force you to invade another nation to secure access to food or surrender. Having to do this (invade) when you are already obviously streched to the limit would be a significant disadvantage.",1217032600
