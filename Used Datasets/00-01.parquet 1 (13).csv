United States citizens get passports if they are traveling overseas, and until recently travel to Canada and Mexico without passports was quite routine. So there are evidently plenty of Americans who have had a chance to go look around and learn from other countries. I would be quite happy to hear of more: in many respects, I think four years spent doing almost ANYTHING overseas and living in the local economy of a country with another language is more educational than four years spent pursuing a college degree, but meanwhile plenty of Americans, for business or for pleasure, do plenty of foreign travel.",1230180713

There is no win or lose state, just a fun thing to play with.</i><p>I liked ken's comment about Mirror's Edge not unlocking abilities, but you can't use them til you encounter the appropriate geometry in the environment (or I think, maybe you could use them before, but you didn't need to, as there were simpler more obvious ways to complete the task using abilities that you already knew about).<p>For example: movement in an editor. The cursor keys will allow you to do anything; but the word-movement keys can often do what you need more efficiently. Then, in vim (using it as an example because I know it), you can search to the right using ""f<somechar>"", and there's also F, t,  T, ; and ,.<p>Interestingly, I've only really started to use the latter ones after years, because I'm having a touch of RSI, and I have a need for fewer keystrokes.<p>One could convert vim (for example) from a toy into a game by adding goals. These goals would have progressively greater difficulty such that they <i>need</i> the more sophisticated controls to accomplish them.<p>Having a <i>need</i> for something gives you a motivation for learning it; but it also makes it cognitively easier to learn. When you have a gap or lack in your mind crying out for a solution, acquiring the solution that fits that gap makes you feel ""ah, that's better!"". This makes it more memorable; and creates a strong link from the problem to the solution, making the solution accessible to you the next time you need it - making it useful to you, in practice.",1230179639

You can edit the recorded results if you like, adjusting the commands and the times, then play it back and it will slowly replay all the keystrokes, while echoing the name of each command into an auxiliary buffer like CommandLogMode does.<p>You could play back audio in sync with the replayed keys if the emacs play-audio function actually works. (Crosses fingers.)<p>Actually recording audio for a demo is almost certainly beyond emacs' capability. You'd have to use some audio-recording or screencasting software and edit it all together.<p>The game part might be done by creating a script that sets up a Game buffer, prompts the user (in a second buffer window) to perform an task in the Game buffer, and then just keeps checking the Game buffer to see if it has reached the ""win"" state, at which point you congratulate the user and go on to the next task. You have to also have prominent buttons for starting the task over, or for playing the standard solution for the task so that the student can watch.
