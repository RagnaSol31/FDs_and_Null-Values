3,7892100,comment,7890686.0,7892027.0,2,0,avmich,,,"J manuals (J for C, I think) mention that in J array is a central object, so when you have primitive operations you have more of them, because an array allows you to do more things than a scalar.<p>There is a set of more frequently used operations, and there are others, which provide convenient shortcuts in some cases or are useful in some relatively narrow areas. Basic operations with arrays are: {. - take the first item, {: - take the last item, }. - take everything except the first item, }: - take everything except the last item. Then there is &quot;generalized&quot; sorting operation /: - ascending and \\: - descending, array reversal |. , you can take unique elements of array with ~. , subtract one array from another with -: and apply dyadic operation between elements of an array with / - for example, +/ 1 2 3 makes 6. You can append arrays with , - for example, 1 2 , 3 4 makes 1 2 3 4. You can &quot;zip&quot; arrays with ,. - 1 2 3 ,. 4 5 6 makes array of pairs 1 4, 2 5 and 3 6. Then you also have several built-in ways to partition array - using first or last element of array as separator with ;. , making prefixes or suffixes of increasing length with \\ or \\. , you can group elements of one array by elements of another using /. - for example, 1 1 2 3 3 4 /. &",

The Secretary Problem is a problem of optimal choice (one-sided).<p>As an aside, the best thing about the Marriage Problem is that it shows that it is much, much better to be the side making invitations instead of the side awaiting invitations. So being a guy is a pain in (generally) having to invite the woman, but that power translates into guys tending higher in their ultimate stable matching range than women.  (Surprise!

Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.<p>The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.<p>Aiming therefore at such great things, remember that you must not allow yourself to be carried, even with a slight tendency, towards the attainment of lesser things. Instead, you must entirely quit some things and for the present postpone the rest. But if you would both have these great things, along with power and riches, then you will not gain even the latter, because you aim at the former too: but you will absolutely fail of the former, by which alone happiness and freedom are achieved.<p>Work, therefore to be able to say to every harsh appearance, &quot;You are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to be.&quot; And then examine it by those rules which you have, and first, and chiefly, by this: whether it concerns the things which are in our own control, or those which are not; and, if it concerns anything not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.<p>[...]",1402719090.0
