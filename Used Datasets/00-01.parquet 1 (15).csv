It really means: don't organize your IPC around shared state. The juxtaposition in the second half is not directly related to the first half (except poetically), though it does do a good job of completing the their picture of CSP. Also note: it is explicitly talking about shared (sadly mutable) state.<p>You <i>can</i> always opt not to share memory, but there's no facility to prove or enforce it. It's not dire, with practice you can send values, or never mutate referenced objects. It is very natural for the most part. I've done it, but not in Go.<p>Finally, it's not doom. Even C can do threading after all, and somehow these things don't blow up too much. But there's value in eliminating the pitfall entirely. When people criticize Go for being imperfect, they're not saying it's not going to work, they're contrasting with a more effective solution or lamenting that some design decisions weakened the effort.",1364446498.0

To expose the hardware virtualization extensions to the guest VMM, then they must be emulated by the privileged domain (host). There are software tricks that allow this emulation to happen pretty efficiently (and map an arbitrary level of guests onto the single level provided by the <i>actual</i> hardware). It's not a common use-case, but for a few very specific things it's very useful.<p>There are a few different ways to map I/O devices directly into domains. Some definitely allow for <i>part</i> of an I/O device. For example, many new network devices support SR-IOV -- which effectively allows you to poke it and create new virtual devices (which may be constrainted in some way) which can be mapped directly into guests.",1364445668.0

I'm not sure about the ""skills we need 10 years from now;"" that sounds good but seems like a different issue. The type of knowledge and thinking skills required to be a ""rightly informed citizen"" or whatever you want to call it are really not much different from Socrates' or before. However, educating the masses is no simple task. As for skills 10 years from now .. how about we aim for the fundamentals first then worry about the other stuff.  This reminds of a similar discussion we've had on HN about everyone needing to learn to program and that programming knowledge provides critical thinking skills that will, if everyone was a programmer, allow there to be peace and harmony in the state or something. I don't know if you are going down that road so I don't want to beat it up here but having, simply, programming skills does not necessarily make one better at thinking about philosophical or political issues. There are plenty of programmers that think the Tea Party makes sense.<p>I think even this reasonwell stuff shows where programmers can tend to treat problems simplistically and try to use ideas and concepts currently in vogue in programming culture  (social networking, upvotes, etc) to solve  political debates.<p>Anyway, as far as people needing to better equipped, intellectually, in a democracy, I agree but I don't know how you get there; I don't think the solution is in slight changes to the curriculum, I certainly don't think the idea that is currently in vogue on HN, to dump college, is going to get you there (where ""there"" is greater than 95% if the populace discussing issues with philosophical rigor).",1364445130.0

I've used Go a fair bit (and will continue to do so), but have recently been reading ""Learn You Some Erlang"". So far, I have to say: when it comes to concurrency, hands down, Erlang is better. I don't think many people from the Go side are claiming that Go is better. In fact, I'm pretty sure most just want something similar to Erlang available in a familiar, imperative language. I really hope something similar to OTP emerges for Go; its interface functionality would be useful for that. Process linking and monitoring are absolutely awesome and could only be sloppily hacked into a Go program. However, Go does have some good things: familiarity (syntactically and a lack of surprises), the ability to do some number crunching (something Erlang cannot do), and ""structs"" that aren't hacked tuples (records).<p>Honestly, if the author is treading on 'errors vs exceptions', I don't think he has grasped the big picture yet. I'm not even finished with the book and I can tell you that. In fact, I usually hate exceptions, but with how monitoring works, I've found it quite elegant.<p>One other super important thing to note is that Go's channels don't work over a network.

Data in Erlang is immutable, so processes <i>could</i> use a combined heap, but they still wouldn't have read-write shared memory.<p>However, in my opinion separate heaps was absolutely 100% the correct design decision. The main benefit is not having to worry about the effects of a long-running, stop-the-world garbage collection, which can have catastrophic effects on user interaction, server response times, request queue lengths, etc. An additional benefit is that the language implementers can use ""dumb"" algorithms for garbage collection and avoid a large class of difficult-to-track bugs.<p>Robert Virding talked about these issues at some length at this year's Erlang Factory; hopefully the video will be posted soon.",1364444547.0

This is total disregard for that the rest of the world considers valuable to them.<p>The problem with these languages remain unchanged. The syntax is so strange and esoteric, learning and doing anything basic things with them will likely require months of learning and practice. This lone fact will make it impractical for 99% for all programmers in the world.<p>No serious company until its absolutely unavoidable(and situation gets completely unworkable without it) will ever use a language like Erlang or Lisp. Because every one knows the number of skilled people in market who know Erlang, are close to zero. And those who can work for you are going to be crazy expensive. And not to mention the night mare of maintaining the code in this kind of a language for years. There is no friendly documentation or a easy way a ordinary programmer can use to learn these languages. And there is no way the level of reusable solutions available for these languages as they are for other mainstream C based languages.<p>In short using these languages attracts massive maintenance nightmares.<p>The concurrency/parallelisation problem today is very similar to what memory management was in the 80's and 90's. Programmers hate to do it themselves. These are sort of things that the underlying  technologies(Compilers/VM's) are supposed to do it for us.<p>I bet most of these super power languages will watch other pragmatic languages like Perl/Python/Ruby/Php etc eat their lunch over the next decade or so when they figure out more pragmatic means of achieving these goals.",1364443999.0
