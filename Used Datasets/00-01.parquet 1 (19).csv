Very good way to announce the Amazon purchase to Woot users, then they'll have it shipped directly from Amazon.com showing the shipping/speed/logistics boost that Woot is going to get from Amazon. And they're selling a device that lets people impulse buy ebooks at high margins to a crowd of loyal impulsive buyers. Love it.<p>I'm guessing the Kindle device is already a loss-leader (anyone know?) at $189, but the extra $40 off is well worth the price when they're paying millions for Woot.
