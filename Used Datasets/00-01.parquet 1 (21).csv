In a way you're right, and it's a massive amount of forms on top of a database, plus staggering amounts of business logic. But as it was born before the web, it does not render to HTML, but to it's own display system. Most parts are written in ABAP, an interpreted language, and the source code is stored in the database. A quite usable IDE and a debugger are included. The source code is there, so you can read it and explore how things happen.<p>There's a database abstraction layer, which works around some limitations of the underlying databases.

As another commenter wrote, investors as an aggregate <i>are</i> the market (hedgers, as another listed, are also considered, or could be considered investors who are investing for reasons other than direct belief in the individual companies/stocks).<p>2. Investment banks don't <i>need</i> to be investing. It's not their business, which is underwriting securities or acting as broker-dealers for M&A work. What we've seen in recent years are investment banks with trading divisions, but the act of investment banking is a separate business, and it's the performance of the investment banking team that should be compensating them.<p>3. You talk about option strategies, but for every move you make, say buying a call, another party had to have written the option. For individual investors, your point could still be very accurate. However, at some scale (though ridiculously large these days), this will break down.<p>That said, I do agree with your final point. An individual can beat the market.",1273733042.0

That said, I think there is a good way to have multiple generations under the same roof.<p>I know a guy, an executive, who lives under his parents' roof with his wife, son, and daughter. It's large enough, they eat together a lot of times, the mother and wife split the chores, and his parents love their grandkids. Babysitters are always available. Both the guy and his father are hardcore business types, the father is a college dropout entrepreneur, the son has an MBA. I gather there's some friction sometimes, it seems to work pretty well. That's in Japan, though the same thing happens in a lot of Asia, and to a much lesser extent, the Mediterranean countries still a little bit. Family ties are a lot closer - I remember being in Italy and thinking how cool it was when I saw grandfather/father/son all eating together quite a lot out at a restaurant, having some guy's time.<p>So, I agree with you, especially the way parenting/freedom in the West works. But I'm personally going to try to keep my home in such a way that the kids feel welcome for a long time - ideally they are independent enough to self-emancipate quite young, but can come back and feel very comfortable at home even as they get into later adulthood. A hard balance to strike and tradeoffs involved, but good if can be gotten down well.",1273732574.0

The problem is that you are in a conflicted state that must be manually resolved.</i><p>I think that the point is that file 'foo' has already been merged, regardless of the conflict in file 'bar'. There is no way for you to revert to the pre-update state. In git, your previous commit still exists in the objects store even if it is no longer connected to the tree. And garbage collection won't even clean it out right away because it is still in the reflog ('git reflog'). The point being that once something is committed, it's permanently (barring garbage collection) in the repository. Whenever you make a change to a commit, a new commit is created, some pointers are changed, and the old commit still remains in the repository.<p>> <i>Oh, and somename is never tab-completed but othername is.</i><p>Responsibility for the tab-completion falls squarely on your shell (or where ever you got the tab-completion setup from).

You should be comparing yourself to the compensation of an employee after adding the employer's portion of the social security and medicare taxes back in.

If I were to guess, I'd say that after 5 or so up votes, you're 90% or more to see a higher close; after 20, it's probably more than 99%. However, at 0 votes, you're probably close to 50/50 (again, just guessing based on experience).<p>If you can't exit, then your risk of ruin is way too high to make initial voting worth it.
