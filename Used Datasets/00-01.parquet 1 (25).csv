For that person, it's much easier to find something and/or prevent it early rather than wait until it gets serious.

I mean, what specifically costs?<p>You've got increased wartime pay to soldiers, and pay to defense contractors. Energy costs and munitions. Construction and military engineering...<p>...and then what? It's a counter-insurgency, it's not like the military is unloading cruise missiles or nuking cities or getting aircraft shot down. What costs so much? Once the conventional warfare ended, the military construction/engineering/bases were built, and all the troops and gear were in place, wouldn't the costs be not-so-highly elevated over keeping a standing army and regular training? Just ammunition, increased wartime pay, and defense contractors no?<p>I guess it's kind of an ugly supply chain in hostile territory in the desert, but Saudi Arabia and Turkey are nominally allied, so it shouldn't be too hard to buy/ship food and ammunition through there. There's lots of cheap oil and refineries nearby. Where's all the money going?",1250322694.0

13,764492,comment,763719.0,764129.0,0,0,chris11,,,"Yeah, I agree with you. I don't really see much personal benefit in using brick and mortar video rental stores. Going to one means that I have to take a half hour or an hour out of my day to get a movie. And I can't check the inventory of a store online, so if I'm looking for an older or a more obscure movie, I'm not really guaranteed that it would be available. Plus I would not go to Blockbuster because I wanted to get a brilliant recommendation from a staff member. But I would be more willing to watch something recommended to me by a recommendation engine. And most video rental stores usually charge more than I want to pay.<p>So I really don't see brick and mortar stores competing with kiosks and rental services like netflix. The single benefit a store has is that it is probably one of the fastest ways to get a physical copy of a movie because it is not mailed. But I would not be the least bit perturbed about waiting a day or two to see a movie.",1250321885.0

Because of socialized health care, other countries can focus on prevention, which is much cheaper and effective then dumping money and effort at the point of crisis.<p>A quick anecdote: my friend and I here were laughing because in both cases our pregnant wives went to the doctor about a small concern and were put in the hospital for a week for testing.  But I thought about it later, and that wouldn't happen in America.  You're churned out as fast as possible.  The great side effect, and I think you'll see this on infant mortality rates as well, despite what you've said, is that if health care is free, people use it earlier than the crisis point.

It actually could be fun to write some sci fi short stories with this in the background, unexplained.<p>I'm actually working with this exact idea, more or less, for a [roughly proposed] series of books, the first of which I'm procrastinating upon as I type this. :) Time travel, though, is a rather small part of what is possible with my metaverse model. I assume that the simulations are infinitely stacked, and each one has a 0:1 time-passage correspondence, so that for a ""parent"" simulation, the ""child"" simulation runs instantaneously, no matter the in-sim execution time, thus making Hypercomputation and such possible. All sorts of fun-with-philosophy falls out of that:<p>The protagonists are Star Trek-style ""everything is science"" types, who discover that magic exists (for ""magic,"" read ""simulation runtime bugs."") They go on ""Hard Science-based Fantasy"" adventures using said magic for ten or twelve books, before figuring out that it was (very complicated) science all along. They then care for their own sim for a while, hacking it to fix some kinks (such as the inevitable existence, given probability, of a malevolent entity who has the root password.) Bored of that, they proceed to ""break out"" of their simulation, repeatedly, visiting ""higher planes"" that each have radically different physics and sometimes even logic, but that all share the property that Turing machines can be constructed within them. Eventually, they get to the ""root"" universe (really just a chroot jail) and meet God—that is to say, an AI who was left to run for an infinite time on an analogue computer and thus became omniscient merely by evaluating all possible states of all possible universes (that it could detect from within the chroot.)<p>And that's only the first half of the sequence. 's called ""Infinity's Tale"", by the way. :)",1250321238.0
