10,3995402,comment,3995185.0,3995185.0,10,0,gambler,,,"There is a great presentation [1] by Rich Hickey about simplicity. He makes a point in keeping the words ""simple"" and ""easy"" semantically separate. This post is a wonderful example why that makes lots of sense. None of these examples really show anything that's decidedly simple. They're all about ease of use and backward compatibility (which is a particular case of ease of use).<p>It seems like ""easy"" can be further subdivided into several useful and objective categories. Clearly, libpng was only concerned with some aspects of ""easy"" (portability) and not others.<p>Also, I absolutely hate the kind of fatalism you often see in SE articles. ""Oh, gosh, nothing is really simple, nothing really is bug-free, <i>nothing is really good</i>, so you shouldn't even try.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a>",1337414023

They open their mobile device and look up which venues have people at the moment, so they know where to go.  In fact, it sounds like that's the only thing this app does.<p>The only problem is what rdl said--that some customers might think the cameras are actually doing some kind of facial recognition and storing the results (which you wouldn't get from the regular security cameras already at those places) as opposed to just counting how many customers each place has.  But then again, customers who aren't going to trust the maker of this app might as well assume that the government is also secretly connecting all street cameras to facial recognition software with huge hard drives to spy on us.

18,3995394,comment,3995185.0,3995185.0,9,0,f45s8g2,,,"It's because some people really do like complexity.<p>They like writing 200 pages of documentation.  And some like reading it.  They want complexity.  Keep adding stuff.<p>I remember reading one of the Windows programmers' hero's writing about some massive document of several hundred pages he wrote while on the Excel team at Microsoft and being overjoyed when he learned Bill Gates had actually looked at it.<p>I remember reading a post by some programmer on Sitepoint boasting about his program that was so complex it would make your eyes burn, or something like that.  He was bragging about this.<p>I recall all the people in mailing lists and forums who get annoyed when anyone talks about conserving memory or disk space.  The reason?  Because these resources are so plentiful we can afford to waste them.  That is a truly great reason.  Brilliant.<p>I once had a colleague who said software is like a gas.  It expands to fill space.<p>There are a great majority of prorammers who are not only OK with this state of affairs but they seek to preserve it.  They get defensive when confronted with spending effort to simplify something.<p>There's a lot of discussion of simplicity that is just lip service.  The truth is, simplicity is not easy.  It is not a matter of adding more stuff.  And we know programmers are lazy.  Simplicity, real simplicity - removing stuff, would make many programmers uncomfortable.  It would remove them from their comfort zone.<p>Simplicity is not burying things under five layers of abstraction so that it fits someone's preferred way to model a solution.<p>Simplicity is taking away things that are not essential until nothing further can be taken out.<p>It is cutting things down to size.<p>Achieveing simplicity means reducing someone's 200 pages documentation or their dizzyingly complex program whose source ""will make your eyes burn"".  It may include using compact symbols instead of someridiculouslylongfunctionname.  It means some stuff that someone spent time producing must get cut out.<p>The creators of complexity are not going to be happy with this.  Because they like complexity.  They like verbosity.  It's comforting.  They detest what appears to be cryptic.<p>That is the price of simplicity.  To achieve it in today's programming environment involves offending some people.  As such, we avoid it.  We discuss it, but we really just dance around it much of the time.  Let the complexity continue.  We can pretend more abstraction equals more simplicity.  Be happy, be productive and have fun.<p>Meanwhile the connoiseurs of simplicity are marginalised, often leaving them to write occasional blog posts like this one and to work on their simple projects in relative isolation.  Embedded programmers know the feeling.  Those who appreciate simplicity, and really do trim things down to size, are not the majority.<p>Keep posting those articles on Forth, hoping someday people might catch on.",1337413798

This is only loosely linked to the smartness of its members or the energy and effort they put into developping and running the business.<p>The equation is all about maximizing user interest so that the startup acquires new one, and lowering the barrier to income. Google's business model is a reference example on this.<p>Regarding the difficulty to induce adoption of a new product, there is a known energy barrier for people to change their habit, even if they know their current habit is not good or optimal. This means the startup needs a strategy to overcome this initial bump. There are many. Once overcome, things get much easier.<p>One of the strategy is to exploit people's natural tendency to be helpful and the positive perception of generosity (kickstarter).

It's got a squiggly bend so it's balanced holding dirt. Stepping up a bit further we have things like clocks. Sundials don't work in the dark so we made mechanical clocks. Those of course have bits of complexity to make them easier to read and more accurate. Now consider computers, they're blindingly fast. We really can't begin to comprehend how much the state of a CPU changes in the blink of an eye. Same goes for memory. If we had to track that as many items as bits in real life, we fail hopelessly. To compensate for this power, we created management systems. Of course the management systems themselves fast and large so we have management systems for those too. The very power of computers makes them complex. All we've been doing is desperately trying to simplify them.  Complaining that those simplifications are complicated, ignores just how complicate they would be if we didn't.",1337412313
