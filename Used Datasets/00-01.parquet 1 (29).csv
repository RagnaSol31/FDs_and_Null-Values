It is not out of the realms of possibility that the end result - the video - will be viewed in dozens of countries, with varying levels of bandwidth, across a range of operating system, display profiles and even different devices, some people might watch some today, some tomorrow, some people might download it for the flight ahead etc..<p>So please for the love of God, do not use Vimeo or Blip or other niche video site.<p>YouTube is fine!! Understood?<p>Why not Vimeo? All others developer celebrities use it?<p>To me it seems there is a sheep factor following with Vimeo, it is essentially a crappy off the shelf flash video player, pulling video from their akamai CDN account, with various little tricks in place to prevent you downloading the video. Most annoyingly, you cant skip the video until its downloaded, you cant imagine how frustrating this in in low bandwidth when you mistakenly close the tab. If you want to watch the last 10 minutes of a presentation you have to wait until download, this might\nnot be a problem for those watching from a coffee shop in Silicon Valley, but try South East Asia. This is VHS, without the fast forward. It sucks. Granted work started to improve this 7 years ago, and now\nthe buggy HTML5 player is showing some promise (skip works some of the time), but for now stick with YouTube so we dont have to jump through hoops.<p>Why not blip.tv?<p>Poorer CDN and no player for most mobile devices, Blip for some crazy reason has started developing apps not for specific platform but for specific devices. But at least they got random access (skipping) in place. Works from Android tablet - nope - not invented here.<p>But YouTube is not cool? SomeRailsBlog, Skillsmatter, DevFanBoy1 etc.. have a paid Vimeo account - i should do the same!<p>Look YouTube is fine, if you want to send $50pa to Google you still can. If you worry about the youtube kids leaving childish comments then disable comments or embed the video into you site with disqus etc..<p>YouTube so great?<p>I can skip the video freely, on both the Flash and HTML5 player. No configuration or setting to change. \nI can disconnect from a wifi node and connect to annother, change IP, disable/enable proxy, and then Youtube videos picks up and carries on.

Building something you believe in, working with people you enjoy being around, and getting paid an amount you're happy with, among other things.<p>It shouldn't matter whether or not your work is making someone else richer or not. Just because you believe in a corporate environment it has less influence than a startup doesn't change the equation. You're there to do a job and paid to do just that.

30,3359891,comment,3359433.0,3359839.0,7,0,ootachi,,,"JavaScript engines have many types of arrays. They do indeed resort to ""ugly special casing"" for objects in which all keys are integers: for instance, SpiderMonkey calls them ""dense arrays"". V8 has a similar optimization. Likewise, Lua stores a hashtable part and an array part for all objects.<p>V8 and SpiderMonkey have optimizations for the values, too. When a value is a 31-bit integer (in the case of V8) or any number (in the case of SpiderMonkey), the value itself is optimized to avoid heap allocation. In V8's case optimized values take 32 bits, while in SpiderMonkey's case optimized values take 64 bits. So an array consisting of 100,000 integers will take 400K plus a negligible amount of malloc/GC slop in V8 and 800K in SpiderMonkey.<p>JavaScript also has typed arrays, which allow the programmer to use fine-grained, optimized array buffers. Performing this experiment with a typed array will yield a 400K buffer in all engines that support the feature.",1324021336.0

However, whatever advantage this might give, the fact that it is intelligence over time that matters.  And while the Einsteins of the world may look at a problem and have an instant epiphany, it takes only moments of thinking for every one else to derive the same conclusion.  To really have an advantage, Einstein would need to be in an environment where everyone else can't keep up, where an epiphany is necessary to succeed.  This is not how business works.  In business things are comparatively slow and steady and there is a right course of action that can be discovered in time.  While Einstein might see a strategy instantly, Joe average can spend a couple hours and come to the same conclusion.  In either case it may take months to implement.",1324021249.0
