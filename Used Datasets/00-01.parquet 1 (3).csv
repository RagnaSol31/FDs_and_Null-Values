The stuff is like 1960's !<p>There are basically two main camps, Lisp-1 and Lisp-2 and consequently two divergent major families, Scheme and Common Lisp.  From my recollection, the ""Lisp Wars"" started with hardware implementations, Symbolics vs. Lisp Machines, et al., see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics</a>.<p>My take is that the hardware implementations came at a time when CPU speeds and memory capacities where not up to the demands of integrated Lisp environments.  By the time speed and memory were sufficient to host Lisp, the world of IT got preoccupied with x86 architecture and Windows.  Neither of these being suitable (in 1980's) as a production Lisp hosting environment.<p>In the hands of an expert Lisper, any version of Lisp quickly becomes extremely productive.  The issues of libraries (FFI) and compilation are addressed in different ways, it's like you have a choice!  It's like asking a guitarist why there are so many brands of guitars? Why don't they all use ____ (insert your pref. brand).<p>To research further, I suggest looking-up ""John McCarthy"", ""Guy Steele"", ""Richard Gabriel"", ""Symbolics"", ""Lisp Machine"" on Wikipedia and Google.",1253148895.0

Create a new directory, type 'git init', and you're good to go. This compared to Subversion's insistence to setup a repo directory elsewhere and then checking that out. I save about 3 minutes (including time to ssh to a remote server to create the repository), but those 3 minutes feel very painful so I didn't create repositories until I've written a fair amount of code. Now I create a repository almost from the start.<p>Branching and merging is very useful even for single developers. It's not the number of developers, it's the size of the project.

It turns out that a lot of things don't really require you to run code at parse time.
