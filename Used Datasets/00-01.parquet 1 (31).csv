There are people who don't blink an eye at mastering any data structure or algorithm, don't sweat when it comes to actually coding, and they're human just like you. Plus what if programming became really simple for some AI to do? You ask it ""Make me a triple-A style video game I might enjoy"" and it does so after a short while.

I then moved to Python which I've found to be a great language.  There are a lot of free online books out there.  In terms of investment in time, I just started off doing an hour a day. As I did not have anything specific to do, with any timeframe, this worked well for me and did not impact on the day-to-day activities.

Firms that make very frequent transactions will tend to make a lot of them; as a result, they deal in insane volume and will make up the majority of the sample size.  The statement in the headline is simply saying ""Stocks that get traded often make up the bulk of stocks that are traded,"" which most people would say ""Duh"" to.<p>To see how this plays out, imagine a hypothetical financial world that looks like this:<p>Firm A has $100M under management and makes a transaction every 10 seconds (total: 3 million trades).  They make a return of 10%, $10M.  Each trade is for 10,000 shares (average 0.03 cents/trade profit).<p>Firm B has $1B under management and makes a transaction every 3 months (total: 4 trades).  They make a return of 10% ($100M).  Each trade is for 10 million shares ($2.50/share profit).<p>The remaining 100 firms have a total of $100M under management and make one transaction per firm per year.  They make a return of 10% ($100,000 each).  Each trade is for 1000 shares.<p>(Ignore how everyone makes a profit in this supposedly closed financial system...we can just chalk it up to the Fed injecting money into the economy.)<p>If you average the holding time of each stock <i>by transaction</i>, you have (3 million trades at 10 seconds + 4 trades at 7.5 million seconds + 1,000 trades at 30 million seconds) / 3,010,004 trades = 1019 seconds.  That's an average holding time of just under 20 minutes.<p>If you average the holding time of each stock <i>by volume</i>, you have (30B shares at 10 seconds + 40M shares at 7.5M seconds + 100,000 shares at 30M seconds) / 30,040,100,000 shares = 9,976 seconds, or an average holding time of about 3 hours.<p>If you average the holding time <i>by firm</i>, you have 1 firm at 10 seconds, 1 firm at 7.5M seconds, and 100 firms at 30M seconds, for an average holding time of just under 1 year.<p>If you average the holding time <i>by firm, weighted by capitalization</i>, you have ($100M * 10 seconds + $1B * 7.5M seconds + $100M * 30M seconds) / $1.2B = 8.75M = about 4 months.<p>Note how different the results are depending upon how you perform the average.  The article sounds like it's averaging by transaction (i.e. taking the total number of trades and dividing it by the time period they're traded in), which is method 1.  I'd argue that a better metric is method 4, averaging by firm weighted by capitalization, which indicates how roughly how long firms with lots of money at their disposal are choosing to hold stocks.  In a world like the hypothetical one above, where you have a few high-frequency trading firms, a few giant fundamental-investing firms, and a bunch of retail investors, the results for that are wildly different.",1294562277.0

It inherently does not describe what it represents, reform* not care.<p>When using either term derisively, then that is a whole separate ballgame.
