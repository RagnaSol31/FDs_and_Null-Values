What you said is partially true, especially if your management doesn't really understand development (highly likely.) However, if you are able to look at the work that comes down, and come up with better ways to do it and engage management (rather than just being a set of hands to do their bidding) you can increase your value. You will never be as valued as you would be at a tech company, but you can try.<p>That said, there are a number of small development companies that focus on marketing. Meaning, they are small developer run companies that take on contract code work for marketing firms (mobile apps, HTML5, etc.) and they are by default developer friendly.

Without controlling for other variables, the study finds that higher income correlates with better test scores and concludes that the two must be directly related. This is a flawed conclusion because there are many lurking confounding variables that may influence this supposedly clear-cut relationship.

People will just slowly learn that having a faulty security system on the web is the same as it is in real life. You don't put a curtain as your front door, and you shouldn't put ""Harry Potter"" as your passphrase, especially if you are holding a wand in your Facebook photo.<p>In my case, I use multi-word passphrases with words from a obscure dialect of a tiny European country's language. Being a dialect I grew up with, it has the benefit of being easy to remember, and the obscureness of it means the phrases itself are more or less a random string of characters to any brute-force attack. Not exactly a ""best practice"" for anyone but myself, but I'm happy with it :).",1331205387.0

An insertion sort does this n times.<p>For a simple array/vector that's:<p><i>search: O(n)</i><p><i>insert: O(1)</i><p><i>total takes (O(n) + O(1)) x O(n) = O(n^2)</i><p>For a linked list:<p><i>search: O(n)</i><p><i>insert: O(n)</i><p><i>total takes (O(n) + O(n)) x O(n) = O(n^2)</i><p>There we go, the algorithm takes O(n^2) for both data structures. The theory already proves that a linked list has absolutely no advantage over an array when using this algorithm. On top of that, iterating over a linked list is slower than over an array for various reasons, even thought they are both O(n). So that's where the difference is coming from.<p>The example he uses is clearly a wrong use case for a linked list, it's plain wrong to conclude that the whole data structure should never be used.",1331205378.0
