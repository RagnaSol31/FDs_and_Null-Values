As such, I feel I should bring your attention to my own forever project[2], which has been <i>years</i> in the making from the idea stage. I am not planning on launching it any time soon, but the project, <i>Pony Forum</i>, is relevant to the discussion for a few reasons:<p>1. As another modern take on forum software, it allows us to conceptualization modern forums from multiple perspectives.<p>2. My approach is <i>entirely</i> different than Atwoodsjust look at the screenshots(!).<p>3. All of it is open source, available for your immediate perusal and comparison at GitHub.<p>4. It is based on Django, increasing the potential for some hilarious fanboy wars.<p>The project should be fairly easy to set up on dotCloud or locally. Here is how to do it locally, IIRC: https://gist.github.com/ndarville/4753982.<p>I submit this project not because I plan on launching it soon, but because it makes me happy that Jeff was able to draw so much attention to something so great and yet so abandoned. It means the iron is hot as ever, and the the time to discuss the future of forums is now.<p>As you can tell by comparing both of our projects, Atwood and I only agree on the state of forums, and the urgency of doing something about it.

Nothing in Smalltalk makes achieving liveness easier than say Java or, more obviously, a language with very encapsulated state like Erlang, and definitely not various visual languages where you get liveness for free (Quartz Composer!). It's telling that Granger et al are basing Light Table on Clojure/Lisp rather than Smalltalk (it will be interesting to see what Bracha does with Newspeak, however). Also consider various game editing engines (Unreal, Unity) that offer live scene scripting capabilities in whatever scripting language and C++ they support.<p>Smalltalk was crazy innovative, while Self (Smalltalk's only real successor) gave us the first live graphics toolkit (Morphic). But the future is still being invented, and it will be a much better experience than Smalltalk ever was.",1360580875.0

136,5200239,comment,5197387.0,5197387.0,3,0,lucasr,,,"Firefox for Android developer here. First of all, thanks for the feedback. Just a quick reply/update on some of the points raised in the post:<p>1. We're currently working on a new iteration of the tablet UI which will replace the sidebar on portrait with a horizontal scrolling strip that goes away when you select a tab (see meta bug 817675). The sidebar will not be ""stuck"" by default anymore and will slide away once you select a tab (see bug 817728).<p>2. We mitigate things like this with anti-phishing/malware protection and the identity status icon. However, this is not guaranteed to cover every possible case. Anyway, I filed bug 839994 to get some discussion going.<p>3. I agree that the current approach is not ideal if you want to browse through your desktop/mobile bookmarks very often. The current UI is more oriented towards finding your bookmarks through the awesomescreen search. Two points about this: the UX team is working on a new design for bookmarks/reading list. It will definitely involve an overhauled UI for accessing bookmarks. In the shorter-term though, we'll be working on a new iteration of the start page that gives you quick access to your bookmarks from there (no extra taps). Work on some of these changes has already started. For instance, you can now 'pin' sites on your start page.<p>4. This is fixed in Aurora/Nightly builds (see bug 786982). You can close the last tab. You'll see the start page when you do so.<p>Hope that helps. We're an open source project. Next time, I strongly suggest you to file bugs. We're happy to clarify and re-discuss design decisions whenever necessary.",1360580807.0

When your code editor is part of your website/app I think there is a lot more scope for improving the editing process.<p>With the current code on github I'm in the middle of implementing git functionality, just struggling with the push/pull side of things, ssh keys specifically.<p>I did have a concept in place for live editing of css without constant round trips to the server by passing data over cookies. This was some time back, I've since realised HTML 5 has much better ways to achieve that communication. That was when I planned to have the css editor in a different browser window but it might be easier to move the css editor panel onto the front end as a small panel like firebug/inspector. I've got code completion for PHP and WordPress so don't see why css can't be auto completed as well.<p>I kind of thought creating an editor built with PHP, HTML, javascript and css would make it easier for people to get involved and create a really good editor that was moldable by any develope but as yet no one really seems to get excited about a Web based editor and probably think I'm wasting my time but I'll plod on..",1360580667.0
