Would totally solve our issues.<p>details:<p>We just moved a fairly large Rails 2.3.4 app to 1.9.1 this week and have run into a number of 'incompatible charset encoding' issues.<p>My client is running a site that sends middle american students to middle american colleges. There's not a foreign character or thought in sight (which is a separate issue). However, our content writers occasionally use MS Word and a ""smart quote"" slips into the uploaded content.<p>When that happens, our rails HAML layout is in one encoding, and the partial that renders the smart-quote-bomb text from the database are now in different encodings, and the page errors.<p>The solution is to write a custom sanitize() method on string that forces encodings and gsubs away smart quotes. The consequences of missing one in 1.9.1 are just higher than in 1.8.7.",1273111190

Even if they did, trying to determine a utility function for a consumer would still fail.

It's certainly true that any person's utility function is at least partly unknown to them, and in any case changes over time. As a result it has little value as a <i>predictive</i> tool.

Ludwig von Mises attacks this head-on in <i>Human Action</i> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Action"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Action</a> ).<p>It's undeniable that at any juncture, the action that a person takes is based on some judgment, conscious or not (and quite possibly mistaken), that the chosen action delivers a greater utility than its alternatives.<p>Thus, the hypothetical postdoc-cum-bartender is deciding -- for reasons that we don't know, but real all the same -- that he would prefer to do his research over bartending, even to the extent of giving up $60K to do so.<p>Who are we to second guess his decision? Precisely <i>because</i>, and not in spite of, the fact that his reasons are inscrutable, we can only assume that he's making the best call he can. By what right can we override it?

The right solution about this would be to fix the fonts, not to switch to another encoding with its own font.<p>Having one encoding (Unicode) that is able to encode just everything would simplify everything.<p>Btw., you are speaking about space efficiency. Afaik, most Asian characters can be encoded as 2 bytes in UTF-8. You cannot get it much better. And the space required for text is in most cases much smaller compared to other media.

I didn't see any software crashes. The tablet, on the other hand, did have quite a few hardware problems. But that's because it was literally made just this demo. The tablet is encased in a clear plastic case that looked like it was hacked together in some lab. One of the Adobe employees told me it had ""a motherboard and NVIDIA card"". Some of the hardware connections were loose apparently because when I would set it down on the table a bit too sharply, some of the buttons would fire sometimes sending me back to the home screen. The touch screen didn't seem the best quality as someone else noticed. It wasn't very responsive. Not sure if that was a hard drive or software problem.<p>On the Droid, I watched a movie preview on Yahoo Movies and it played flawlessly.<p>So as for me, from what I saw today, I'm cautiously optimistic about flash on phones/tablets.

Is Unicode not capable of encoding the full Japanese language? What information would you loose by encoding with Unicode?<p>The problem is that SHIFT-JIS, and other regional east asian encodings, codify variations of characters that Unicode combine into one. The Japanese in particular dislike this conflation of characters that they feel should be separate. This process of combining characters was called Han Unification:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification</a><p>Now imagine that you're a Japanese user who feels that three similar ideograms are in fact sematically different, but a standards body has decided that the differences are merely stylistic and has combined them into one form: I'm sure you wouldn't be as willing to lay your language at the feet of Unicode and swear allegiance to the one true encoding.<p>Also consider that UTF-8 is optimized for efficient encoding of Western languages: a japanese text may be in practice four to eight times the size of a sematically similar version in a western language. SHIFT-JIS presumably does not suffer from this problem.<p>> This seems to be a much better solution than this encoding nightmare. Esp in a language like Ruby, I want to have it simple and straightforward.<p>Except that languages are not really that simple or straightforward. I appreciate the flexibility of Ruby 1.9's encoding system. The only thing really broken right now are the tools that wycats mentions in this post.",1273108043

We <i>defined</i> P to be a certain way, and as a result of that definition, we also demonstrated that it cannot do what we defined it to do. That's the fundamental problem.
