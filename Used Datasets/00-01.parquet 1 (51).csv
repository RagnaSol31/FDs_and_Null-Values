The one from 1999 has run since then with absolutely no issues, and I have not been gentle on it in the least. The keys are still accurate and responsive, and the only trouble I've ever had with it is when I spilled a bit of water into it (it dried out and everything was fine).<p>The other Advantage hasn't quite been perfect: one of its keys drank a bit of soda early in its life, and since then it's been problematic. More recently, another keyswitch started to die, either being unresponsive or bouncing badly (3-10 detected keypresses for one actual keypress). I sent it back to Kinesis and they replaced basically every key on the keyboard (replaced the left and right main panels and the left F-key panels; the top right panel was fine). The cost for this repair was $80.<p>Now I have basically one brand-new and one 11-year-old Kinesis, which gives me an opportunity to feel how they wear over time. The new keyboard takes slightly less force and the keys bottom out more crisply, but on the whole I'd say that typing on the new keys has not made me at all dissatisfied with the feel of the old ones; in fact, the one with the older switches is on my desk at work, and I use it at least an order of magnitude more than the one with the new keyswitches.<p>On the whole, my experience with the Kinesis has been excellent. Comfortable to type on, amazing position for the modifier keys, respectable longevity, and excellent customer service will keep me a Kinesis customer for the foreseeable future.",1312729087.0

But how many of us would have called all of the shots on that list correctly back in 2006?<p>Furthermore, it is human nature to suffer from an anchoring bias when looking at a list like this one. We immediately assign more weight to the 2 or 3 ""disastrously wrong"" predictions in the list of 10 than we do to the other 7. Hell, we probably assign 99% of the weight on that list to the Facebook prediction. It's the most visibly and obviously wrong. So it anchors our perception of the entire list.<p>I doubt there's anyone out there who gets his predictions right 100% of the time. And I bet there are plenty of highly successful prognosticators with at least one or two hilariously bad calls on their track records.<p>I'm not defending this list or its author, per se, but just pointing out that everyone gets it wrong sooner or later.

The strange thing is that there are some reasons not to get an electric car (if you need to make extremely long trips often, the potential battery replacement issue after ten years) and rather than discuss these they make up reasons and fake failures.
