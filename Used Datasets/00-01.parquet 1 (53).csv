14,1478119,comment,1477644.0,1478026.0,0,0,btilly,,,"In truth if you're using a decent algorithm, then breaking it is effectively impossible anyways.<p>But that said, techniques for breaking encryption rely on identifying redundant information in a message.  The less redundant information there is, the harder this is to do.  Sure, the known header on a ZIP is useful redundancy.  But the amount of introduced redundancy is much, much less than the redundancy you got rid of by moving from a document in English to binary gibberish.<p>Underlying this is a fundamental fact of information theory, which is that messages with a high information density look like white noise.  A slight mistake in the message you have results in something that looks like another potentially valid message rather than something that is obviously wrong.  This makes it much harder to verify that you're on an intermediate step towards properly decrypting the message.<p>Therefore increasing information density makes an attacker's life harder.  Compression increases information density by a lot, and so makes the encryption harder to break.",1277996073.0

25,1478108,story,,,8,12,jpdbaugh,Ask HN: What are your gaming habits like?,,"I would imagine that like many people on this site I have a long history of being a bit of a ""hardcore"" gamer.  When I was younger and in middle and high school I was the kid who got all of the gaming magazines, read forums, and got addicted to Counter-Strike and Warcraft III.  I just really enjoy games.  However, I am starting to think that they are comparable to TV in terms of being a waste of time.  Granted, I do still enjoy the occasional game such as Demon's Souls but a game I really find great only comes along once in a while.  This wouldn't be a problem because I really want to limit my time spent gaming and focus on working on development and potentially start-ups, but I am finding that I still feel the urge to buy games and especially read news about games.  I am even contemplating building a new PC for Starcraft II.  I am just worried that I have a compulsion really.  Games really seem to limit my development time because there is just only so much time I can look at a screen in a day.<p>So I guess my real question is, did you give up gaming to become a better programmer?  And if so, what sort of things did you replace it with?  I am the kind of person who needs some sort of competitive hobby and I having a hard time finding one.",1277995829.0

Now instead of having to try every key looking for your zip header from offset 0, they have N places to start. There are techniques to mitigate this problem as well, but it's much more of a hassle. In any case, SOME simple compression is generally the order of the day with stenography message passing; you only get a few bits per pixel (usually not even a byte per pixel) so space becomes a premium.<p>Perhaps known-plaintext attacks are how the FBI managed to produce an example of a message with hidden data in it. To me, it seems like such a thing would be very difficult to prove. Anyone with sufficient sophistication to carry out such an attack probably has the sophistication to hide their ability to do it (via, say, hidden truecrypt volumes as workspaces). Because the FBI & DHS has leveled some pretty absurd allegations at suspected terrorists in the past, including random doodles being secret attack plans, simple home movies being terrorist scouting videos (“Do you see the way the camera flicked towards that trash can? That's signaling the terrorists that this trashcan is a good place for a bomb.”), and innocuous phone conversations being elaborate code systems. In all cases, the DHS and FBI experts swore that only someone hyper-trained could <i>ever</i> detect the hidden messages; a normal person could not even if they were told it was there. It was BS, of course, but people can be so afraid of terrorism that they're too scared not to give that kind of argument credibility.",1277994909.0
