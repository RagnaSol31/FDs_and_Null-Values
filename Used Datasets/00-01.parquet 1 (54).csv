My friend ordered it, and it wanted you to enter a price as soon as you downloaded it. That meant you would have to go through the download process again if you wanted to pay $0 at first and then more later, which seemed kind of backwards. In my opinion, it would have made more sense to have the songs as streaming mp3s on the site, and then allow the option to buy the album after listening to the tracks.<p>It's also too bad that they are effectively punishing those people who bought into this business model. The tracks ended up being somewhere between 128 and 192 Kbps mp3s (I don't remember exactly what, though, something like 154 maybe?), and they will now be selling the CD through the usual outlets for the normal price, with additional songs that weren't available in the pay-what-you-want offering. This means that fans who went out and bought the low-quality, less-songs album will have to pay yet more money to get all of the album's songs and CD-quality music.<p>All of this would have been fine (in my book) if they told everyone from the start that they planned on doing this, but instead it seems like they are capitalizing on the loyalty of their fans, getting more money out of them than they would have otherwise.<p>I don't think that we can really consider this a win for the pay-what-you-want business model until an entire album is offered in a lossless format (flac built-in on Windows like it is on Mac, anyone?), with an easy interface for listening to the music before buying the album. This might be a good area for a startup to target: a site to facilitate the streaming and financial aspects of this kind of business model.",1194451052

2,77015,comment,76717.0,77012.0,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"If your definition is ""that which causes terror"" then it is over-broad, including everything from chemical warfare to late night Alfred Hitchcock movies.<p>\nYes I can make up whatever definition I want, not in some effort to ""get my way"" in the argument, but simply as a way to disambiguate the conversation. Words with overly broad meanings lead to sloppy analysis (hence the relationship to hacking)<p>\nWar is not honorable at all in my opinion, and it's not a game that should be played fairly like some inter-collegiate hockey game. It's a messy and horrible business and no amount of weaseling or moralizing can make it any better. The goal, as best I can tell, is to make the other side want to stop fighting before they do the same to you.<p>\nHaving said all of that, it only takes one party willing to use force to make all parties use counter-force, so war is going to be with us for a long while. So it's simply not enough to throw our hands up in disgust and cast a pox on the whole affair -- we need to be intimate with it. The same way we are intimate with cancer, or terror, or death, or any number of other cruel realities in life.",1194450613

Even lexicographers are subject to political whim, I'm sure, so you can make up whatever definition you want. <p>We should understand at minimum that it is not <i>more</i> honorable somehow to attack from a greater distance, using more elaborate machinery, using different words to describe the same results, etc. None of those is morally positive.",1194449977

The problem with a conspiracy theory is that you have rebuttal-proof circumstantial evidence: there is literally nothing I can do to convince you that there isn't a conspiracy, except to point out that everyone else who sees conspiracies like this is wrong. As you put it on your old blog:<p>""Don't see purpose where there isn't.<p>Or better still, the positive version:<p>See randomness.""<p>This doesn't seem to be a discussion of politics. It sounds more like psychology to me: you're very surprised that reddit is behaving in a way that you wouldn't have predicted, and so you're creating an extra phenomenon to explain it, instead of revising your original theory. It's a little pre-Copernican.",1194449127

10,77007,comment,76717.0,77003.0,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"So you're saying that even though we DID warn them, it doesn't count because there's no way the warning could have been heeded? Sounds a little self-serving.<p>We killed a lot more Japanese civilians in conventional bombing than we ever did with the A-bomb, not that most people know that. I guess it was fine to continue killing them with one kind of bomb, but not with another?<p>Glad to use a weasel word. It was called for. It's a tricky definition, but I'm happy with it. I'm sure that others will disagree, hence my concern at even posting it. But I'm a fan of the way language works, both in politics and user interaction, so I thought it was germane.<p>For those wishing to engage in a good political debate (probably not me, as people have a tendency to down-mod me for days after I express political opinions as a way of ""paying me back""), the use of force in wartime is a good one. There was an interesting editorial along those lines in the Wall Street Journal yesterday commemorating the death of one of the pilots that flew the A-bomb missions.

14,77003,comment,76717.0,76899.0,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>use of the a-bomb doesn't qualify, as there was nothing stealthy</i><p>""Stealth"" as used here is a pathetic weasel word. Such rhetoric comes up all the time in order to demonize the tactics used by the poorly-equipped, in contrast to the expensively-equipped.<p>But, FYI, the Japanese had an air-raid system which normally functioned whenever bombers were detected. In the case of the atomic attacks, the alarms weren't set off because one bomber does not signify a bomb-run. Hence, they were as ""stealthy"" as anything could be.<p>EDIT: To head off the argument ""But we warned them,"" it is pretty clear that no one is going to evacuate entire cities on mere warnings. Completely impractical.",1194448150

TechCrunch picked it up from AP and basically dropped the whole thing verbatim into their post. I'm sure the Journal Constitution got most of it from a press release from the company mentioned. Wonder how much value they added before putting it on the AP wire.",1194448024
