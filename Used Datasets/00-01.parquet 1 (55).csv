It is very possible for inflation to run rampant while nominal wage growth trails far behind.  This is probably the most likely scenario.  Have fun paying off your devalued debts with an income of $0, because you're unemployed.<p>In the intermediate term, asset deflation will probably be the dominant force, even if consumer staples continue to inflate somewhat.  The very high general inflation is in store for later.",1222444689.0

There was never a substantial fund; insurance premiums were simply deposited at the treasury.<p>If a few more large banks fail the treasury will have to come up with the money to cover.

Which means inflation.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that in the event of bank failure you have no legal guarantees of a timely refund from the FDIC.  They may take many months to reimburse you.<p>In any case, there are much safer ways to store your money than at a bank.  Directly own equities, such as GLD and currency ETFs.
