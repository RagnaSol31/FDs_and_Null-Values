It was all about the Apollo missions and was really one of the best Moon landing documentaries I've watched.<p>Mostly because May is full of boyish excitement all the time :D<p>And to cap it all the U2 is just extraordinary. My Dad (ex RAF) was in the states on training once and saw them flying. They glide off the end of the runway and just shoot vertical into the air in seconds. Great stuff.,1249574350.0

He wants to learn statistics, not necessarily an <i>application</i> of statistics. I see what you're getting at, but before one can ask such a question, one must know if the answer will involve statistical theory and that's a big jump. Learn the basics first, then look for applications lest you can't see the forest for the trees.<p>The other problem with this approach is that while you may get depth, there is very little breadth. I find that when learning something for the first time, I want to go wide and shallow. Then once I have a basic understanding I can figure out where I want to learn deeper.<p>OTOH, maybe you just learn things differently from me!<p>I just gave my friend (a PhD in Operations Research) his basic Statistical Theory book back. I also wanted to get a better understanding of statistics, but that stuff was putting me to sleep too easily :-(",1249574320.0
