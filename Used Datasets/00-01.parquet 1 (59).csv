The person-hours you spend on the internet can have an influence but it's a much smaller factor on ad click rates then other demographics like age, gender, educational level, etc.   No disrespect to people who sew, but you compare ad click rates on a sewing blog vs a javascript blog with the same traffic and I'd wager the sewing blog has a much higher click rate.<p>And as such, I'd highly doubt, at least until Chrome actively courts hardware manufacturers, that Chrome Ad click rates compare to IE.  IE is the default web browser for many computers and ad clickers are more likely just to use the default web browser that comes installed on their system (the whole addon toolbar business is based on the fact that users won't (or don't know how to) switch their default search engine back once it's installed).",1260979052

That's not a problem for IO bound workloads but does not scale well over multiple CPUs for CPU bound tasks that do most of the work in Python-land.<p>I not sure dropping the GIL is the best solution.

The compilation and linking is no longer automatic because you have to specify your dependent library specifically, but you can put it anywhere you want and it won't conflict with a different version of the same name.<p>One way to simplify this is to customize your library builds and associate a unique pkgconfig .pc file with them. When you build your application, reference the .pc file for the library version you want.

For compute bound tasks, it is often productive to split computations into long-running processes.<p>There are two reasons that the discussion goes beyond what you suggest, I think. One is detailed in <a href=""http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/09/27/Concur-dot-next"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/09/27/Concur-dot...</a> where the wide finder project is a way to explore relatively easy ways to split a log-searching task into effective threads on a multi-core machine.<p>This is really a hard problem, as evidenced by Tim's long series of articles detailing various forays into clojure and other languages.<p>Your comment ""Hardware should handle multiple cores"" reflects the opposite of what I think chip manufacturers are thinking.  They run into the performance barrier, so they build a chip with more CPUs on it and hand the problem off to the compiler team and the rest of the software world.<p>I would take it another step further in challenging hardware manufacturers to look at the broader problem.  There was an article recently that noticed that for Lisp, the effective performance gain over a decade or two went up by 50 where for C-family programs it went up by several orders of magnitude.  To me this implies that hardware isn't going in the direction that supports higher-level computing.<p>Remember when the 360 instruction set came out?  The 7094 people looked at it with some sense of dissapointment.  And where are the nice instruction sets as evidenced by the PDP-10 and family?<p>Perhaps this implies smarter cores so that we don't have to do so many of them.<p>But in today's world, it seems that the languages that work well with multiple threads have a language construct that is required to make it work--libraries don't do the trick.  The clean channels of GO and the constructs in Clojure point the way.  Maybe the GIL-fix approach is truly doomed.<p>So I agree with your closing sentiment.",1260978525

The true relationship between x and y is mediated by another factor, call it A, that takes values of +1 or -1 with equal probability. The true process relating x to y is y = Ax.<p>>It is a simple matter to show that the correlation between x and y is zero. Perhaps the most intuitive way is to imagine many samples (observations) of x, y pairs. Over the sub-sample for which the pairs have the same sign (i.e. for which A happened to be +1) y=x and the correlation is 1. Over the sub-sample for which the pairs have the opposite signs (i.e. for which A happened to be -1) y=-x and the correlation is -1. Since A is +1 and -1 with equal probability, the contributions to the total correlation from the two sub-samples cancel, giving a total correlation of zero.<p>It seems to me that this doesn't quite make sense. Sure, the correlation of the average of the numbers is 0, but notice that |x - y| <= |2x|, or that |y| = |x|.
