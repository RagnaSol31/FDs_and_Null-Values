0,41303,story,,,11,8,jmpeters,What's the best online payment processing solution?,,"I'm looking for an online credit card payment processing solution that can handle recurring monthly payments. I'm open to linking off of my site to a hosted provider, so long as I can sufficiently customize the look-and-feel. I'm also open to a lower-level code-it-yourself type of solution. Of course I don't want to spend too much time on this, and I want it to be cheap. :) Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences.",1186768690

It <i>does</i> look like Hitler's basement (ie bunker).<p>It looks like they're in a wartime bunker, probably with bombs going off overhead, all the while blissfully demoing web applications.
