Browsers would do best if they focused on a sane approach to ACLs.<p>Browser plugins like SafeScript for example one basic way in which things could be better for users. What SafeScript lacks is reputation information on resources to help non-technical users make decisions about what to trust and what not to trust.<p>e.g. Alice and Bob are friends.
