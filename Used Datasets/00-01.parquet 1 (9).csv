There are countless posts similar to yours on HN, and if you dig them up, you'll find the same consistent and good advice in all of them; just do it.<p>Your ""great idea"" may or may not be as great as you imagine, but the only way to find out is to try, and if you do try, you'll learn something. I might be a home run, but then again, you might just get in some batting practice. Both are good outcomes.",1302923673

59,2453053,comment,2450856.0,2450856.0,7,0,nsfmc,,,"I understand the desire for structured packages, but even in languages like python that have 'the python way' or what have you, there are still plenty of packages that don't quite fit. This isn't a problem with python, it's a largely philosophical/religious issue that has much to do with the idiom or mindset of the package (or likely the maintainer) at hand. But still, i don't see this as a problem that <i>javascript</i> has to address rather than say, a problem that <i>libraries</i> have to address.<p>You see this all the time in even jquery packages: are they $.pkg.method(elts) or $(elts).pkgmethod() or is it $(elt).pkgmethod(spec) or .... and so forth. Part of it is a matter of taste even if sometimes it goes against 'the jquery way.' Again, this is so religious that it's often not even worth fussing over.<p>Blaming browser vendors or our ecma overlords for package standards seems like a bit of a straw dog because <i>javascript</i> isn't a package distribution mechanism, it's a programming language. If you want to build <i>apt/npm for browser js</i> via require.js+jquery or your combination <i>du choix</i>, then by all means, but this isn't a failing of the language just as brew failing to install mutt is <i>not</i> a failing of ruby.<p>Certainly, there's bound to be some overlap in packages, but this happens everywhere and who cares? underscore+jquery seems like a strange example especially when the two are <i>complementary.</i> If the goal is to have a ""lightweight core"" with ""components that deliver specific, isolated functionality"" i mean, aren't we there <i>right now?</i> And for where we're not, as mentioned by other commenters, coffeescript and friends certainly seem to be fighting the good fight.<p>I'm all for innovation, but i could do without ""enterprise javascript"" (isn't that was es4 was and, i mean, i'm not exactly losing sleep over <i>that</i> decision). For proof positive that we're already getting the 'roll your own' strategy, check out the modernizr 2 beta (or, the less modest jq-ui).<p>If the point of modern js is that people are working together and optimizing, then yay!! but if the point of modern js is that we need to abide by some static discipline where each function only accepts a single spec object and conforms to some require.js loading protocol then, umm.. thanks but no thanks.",1302923542

69,2453043,comment,2450973.0,2452738.0,6,0,shasta,,,"I think the reason that S-expressions haven't gone away is mostly because of the way they mesh with macros, but anyway the sub-optimality of S-expressions as a syntax wasn't a part of my argument there (I don't like them, but I don't hate them).  In that quote, I meant there that all code, even S-expressions, is a human readable expression that defines the thing you're interested in.<p>Note that it's considered poor form in Lisp to make a square macro that multiplies its parameter by itself.  That should be a function.  Why?  Because numbers have the structure you want them to have.  A function that takes a number and multiplies it by itself is just simpler than a function that takes an expression for a number, and pastes it together with an astericks and then returns that to be evaluated.  And because the function has a better structure than a macro, it's more composable.<p>The thing is that this same situation exists with most other uses of macros.  In a language with staged computation and maybe a little well tamed syntax extension, I think there would be no place for macros.  You can do better.",1302922816
