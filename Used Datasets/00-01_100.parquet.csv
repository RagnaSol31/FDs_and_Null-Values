And it is funny no matter if you love or hate PHP.<p><i>I can’t even say what’s wrong with PHP, because— okay. Imagine you have uh, a toolbox. A set of tools. Looks okay, standard stuff in there.<p>You pull out a screwdriver, and you see it’s one of those weird tri-headed things. Okay, well, that’s not very useful to you, but you guess it comes in handy sometimes.<p>You pull out the hammer, but to your dismay, it has the claw part on both sides. Still serviceable though, I mean, you can hit nails with the middle of the head holding it sideways.<p>You pull out the pliers, but they don’t have those serrated surfaces; it’s flat and smooth. That’s less useful, but it still turns bolts well enough, so whatever.<p>And on you go. Everything in the box is kind of weird and quirky, but maybe not enough to make it completely worthless. And there’s no clear problem with the set as a whole; it still has all the tools.<p>Now imagine you meet millions of carpenters using this toolbox who tell you “well hey what’s the problem with these tools? They’re all I’ve ever used and they work fine!” And the carpenters show you the houses they’ve built, where every room is a pentagon and the roof is upside-down. And you knock on the front door and it just collapses inwards and they all yell at you for breaking their door.<p>That’s what’s wrong with PHP.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/</a>",1399942181.0

121,7736034,comment,7735912.0,7735912.0,6,0,exstudent,,,Any talk of Beats Music adding any value whatsoever to Apple is ridiculous. Beats Music is little more than Mog (a nearly valueless online streaming service) + 6 months of development time. Mog was very close to being out of business when Beats bought them as the service was extremely lack luster.<p>There is no tech and the licenses will not be transferable in an acquisition.<p>Maybe the headphone business holds some value to Apple but Beats Music certainly does not.,1399939462.0
