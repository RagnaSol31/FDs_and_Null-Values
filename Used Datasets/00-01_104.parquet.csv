So now, in an international collaboration with existing sleep-study cohorts spanning the U.K., South Korea, and China, Pack is in the process of gaining access to somewhere between half a million and a million participants. The next step is to sequence the twenty or so CLOCK genes (the genes that are involved in regulating circadian rhythms) that have been identified, to look for both the mutations Fu and Pack have found and any new variants that may affect sleep physiology.&quot;<p>Prediction: like all other human behavioral traits, sleep length will turn out to be influenced by multiple genes, each with small effect.
