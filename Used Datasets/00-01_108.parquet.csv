It's unavoidable that if you say ""you sound racist"" that that attributes a trait to the person rather than their behavior, and is not much different than saying ""you are a racist."" The rule of thumb is address the behavior rather than the person, which is why the corrective response is supposed to be something like ""wow, what you said sounded racist"" It's a subtle but important difference. Then you are inviting the person to ask themself internally ""did I mean what I said?"" or ""do I want to sound racist to other people?"" instead of going on the defensive because they as a person are being labelled a cultural undesirable. If you make a statement about the person themself there's no avenue forward for discussion or correction, you just made an enemy.

I currently use a paid plan at Dropbox so I can put them all up there but it's kind of a waste since I hardly ever pull many of them down again.

By contrast, Jim Crow -- institutionalized, legally-sanctioned racism -- was the law of the land for 100 years prior. No matter how far we've come, that can and still does leave an impression. A case in point would be Lee Atwater's Southern Strategy; a major party's electoral strategy more or less explicitly hinged on exploiting racism. Or lookup sundown towns.<p>So what's the problem? It seems perfectly logical and uncontroversial to suggest that the US citizenry, including black people, would still have widespread problems with race, subtle or overt.

My father died when I was a child, and with half an income, my mom was forced to work several jobs to support herself and 5 children.  The only place we could afford to live was the ""ghetto"".  My siblings and I worked hard each day, with no electricity on some days, no running water on others.<p>Even with this hard work, only 2 of my siblings have managed to excel to middle class or beyond. None of us have ever been arrested or addicted to drugs or alcohol.<p>Why did the 3 children advance, while 2 are still struggling?  It is because when my father died, my younger 2 siblings were 3 and 4 years old.  We moved to the bad neighborhood the year after, and they grew up with no realistic model of ""success"" with which to strive.  The model they were exposed to was that of my mother's new role - take on as many back-breaking jobs as possible just to barely scrape by.  My younger brothers work VASTLY harder than I do, with little to show for the effort.<p>I tell this story as a contrast to your analysis. While poverty breeds desperation (you are definitely more likely to get robbed of your luxury items while in a bad neighborhood), it also adds a grit that is hard to describe.  I saw children of Crack-addicted prostitutes making sure that they got themselves and siblings to school each morning.  I saw good, honest kids who had little expectation from themselves, or from the world at large.  And they achieved (and received) their expectations.<p>I think its easy to romanticize any situation, but I would seriously implore you to reconsider your preconceived notion on the inhabitants of these low income neighborhoods.  The more widespread this belief, the fewer intelligent people willing to work to fix these difficult issues.",1349481607.0
