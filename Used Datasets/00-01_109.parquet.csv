I can see a market for high-end restaurants, cake shops and confectionery shop to propose custom-made pieces.<p>What I wonder is how long it takes to print various pieces. The Pro version of the printer has a large printing volume of 10x14x8”.

Señora Severina Murillo had played around it as a girl, fifty years before. It was maybe five meters (16 feet) in diameter, and maybe a meter and a half (5 feet) deep. It made strange noises, underground noises, sounds like rocks falling. The kids found it warm, and their sticks never reached the bottom. Storm waters drained through it in the winter, and sometimes there would be a mist, but it was never hot, not so Sr. Pulido noticed. He’d stash his yoke and plow there, sometimes, when he didn’t feel like hauling them all the way back to Parícutin village. He and his brother would sometimes try to fill in the hole, but no matter how much material they threw in to it, they could never fill it. A depression had formed around it the previous August. But no one thought much of it.</i><p>Part I: <a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/rosetta-stones/2013/02/20/paricutin-here-is-something-new-and-strange/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/rosetta-stones/2013/02/2...</a><p>Part II: <a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/rosetta-stones/2013/02/28/paricutin-save-me-from-the-dangers-in-which-i-am-about-to-die/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/rosetta-stones/2013/02/2...</a>",1408235608.0

119,8188058,comment,8185021.0,8187967.0,14,0,philwelch,,,"Read it in context. Hedonistic utilitarians believe in the alleviation of suffering and the delivery of pleasure (in the sense of such things as comfort and intellectual pleasures as well as baser pleasures). This is in the tradition of John Stuart Mill, and many English thinkers, including socialists such as Orwell, take this premise for granted. The phrase &quot;the greatest good for the greatest number&quot; is commonly used as a description of this kind of hedonistic utilitarianism. The type of socialism that Orwell subscribes to is meant to be an attempt to achieve this end.<p>By my reading, Orwell is giving Hitler a bit of credit, not only in the fact that he rejects this premise and emphasizes patriotic and militaristic virtues above quality of life, but that he could move an entire nation to agree with this vision. What Orwell means here is that people don&",
