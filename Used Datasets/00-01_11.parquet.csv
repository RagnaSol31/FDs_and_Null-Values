Growth in the booming industry shifted away from these companies, once the darlings of the stock market, to private operators in offshore locations like Antigua and the Isle of Man.<p>But now, executives of some of the European companies whisper excitedly that they may soon get a second chance in the United States. Meanwhile, a number of European countries that have long maintained barriers are moving, under pressure from regulators, to legalize, and tax, online gambling.<p>“There’s still a lot of gambling going on, where there’s no revenue coming in to the governments,” said Gavin Kelleher, an analyst at the research firm H2 Gambling Capital in Ireland. “They realize they could use the revenue.”",1240792945

These\nare different entities.<p>The topic is NPR.<p>The numbers that you cite are not numbers for NPR.<p>They are not even number for NPR member stations.<p>They are aggregate numbers for public broadcasting stations ... <i>including those not affiliated with NPR</i>.<p>Getting the truth out of NPR's reports can be tricky.  They haven't filed an annual report in four years, and the financials are split up between NPR, Inc., the NPR foundation, the CPB, and various member stations.  You have to read a LOT of documents to figure out some of this stuff.<p>Let's start with NPR's financial documents.<p><pre><code>   http://www.npr.org/about/statements/fy2008/fy08nprincreport.pdf\n</code></pre>\nI note $2.5 million in membership dues (individual donations) out of $172 mill total.  Thus, individual subscribers and pledges make up 1.45% of NPR's budget.<p>$68 million comes from station programming fees.  What are these?  These are fees that local affiliates pay to National Public Radio, Inc.  Where do those dollars come from?  A typical affiliate gets two thirds or more of its budget from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The CPB is a shell corporation / funnel that connects federal dollars to NPR with a cut-out step.  See the CPB financials here:<p><pre><code>  http://www.cpb.org/aboutcpb/financials/budget/\n</code></pre>\nThe CPB gets $400 million per year from taxes, takes 10% off the top for operations, and funnels 90% of the money to local affiliates, which then funnel most of the money back to NPR.<p>The data that you cite about the sources of funding are not for typical NPR affiliate stations: first, it includes many stations that aren't NPR stations, then it excludes many stations that <i>are</i> NPR stations (they mention this in a footnote).<p>Where else does NPR get its revenue?  Grants, contributions, and sponsorships total $52 mill.  Let's be generous and say that half of that comes from private sources (in fact, most of these grants are coming from other government funded organizations).<p>A big contributions to NPR's top line is from the NPR Foundation, which gave 15 mill in 2008.  ...but look back at the 2005 numbers, and it was just 1.7 mill.  Why the huge (1,000 %) increase in money from the NPR foundation?  Read the NPR Foundation's reports and the Consolidated reports<p><pre><code>   http://www.npr.org/about/statements/fy2008/fy08nprfoundationreport.pdf\n\n   http://www.npr.org/about/statements/fy2008/fy08consolidatedreport.pdf\n</code></pre>\nand you can see that <i>they've been investing in highly leveraged hedge funds and interest rate swap contracts these past few years.  To put it mildly, this doesn't look like sustainable money.</i><p>Putting aside the non-sustainable NPR Foundation money, the federal government makes up $90 mill of NPR's after-removing-the-Foundation revenues of $152 mill.<p>So, where does NPR get its money?<p>* federal dollars: 60%<p>* individual contributions: 1.5%<p>* advertising, misc: 38.5%",1240791670

I already knew most of the concepts through my experience with Pascal, including pointers, which are harder to use than to understand. What I did have trouble with was Windows as I just couldn't figure out the API. What solved it for me was one of those old 'Game Developers' series of beginner's books. It gave detailed instructions on for a 'hello world' Windows application. After that, it was pretty easy to get the hang of it.<p>I don't use C much anymore (haven't since Highschool.) When I do, it's with GCC and I and the environment is still the hardest part.<p>Moral of the story being that C is pretty easy. I learned it with some very basic references. The hard part, supposedly, is pointers, and those are much harder to use than to understand. Basically, everything is done through them, without the usual abstractions that you would get with say, Java. You mainly just have to make sure you always have the right number of asterisks and ampersands.<p>One book I can suggest is <i>Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</i> by W. Richard Stevens, (revised version) which gives a very through introduction to UNIX from a C perspective. C is interesting in that it is almost a different language depending on which system you write it on and you'll spend more time learning system calls and UNIX paradigms than C syntax and pointers.",1240790688
