As the end result, since 'build' doesn't enforce dependencies (and as a result can't reliably trace them), they leak, and developers put manual ""drains"" into build files, reducing system parallelism. They try to upgrade manifest-based builds, but nothing came out of it as far as I know. Automatic incremental builds do not work either.<p>It took me 12 hours to build Windows in 2001, it's still takes approximately the same time to build Windows now (or so they tell me).

In fact I cannot believe it is even here in Hacker News.<p>""Any time you have worked long hours, it is a sign of a broken process.""<p>This is a such a horrible generalization. Successful people always work hard/long hours to make something succeed.  Imagine telling your kids that to be successful you should work just 40 hours and no more. They will be easily steamed rolled by other kids that are willing to work harder/ go the extra mile.<p>Here is a relevant piece from: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html</a><p>>>Now for the matter of drive. You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode's office and said, ``How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?'' He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, ``You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.'' I simply slunk out of the office!<<<p>>>What Bode was saying was this: ``Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.'' Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don't want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took Bode's remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done. I don't like to say it in front of my wife, but I did sort of neglect her sometimes; I needed to study. You have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done. There's no question about this.<<<p>Yes, sometimes it may mean that working long hours there is something wrong and the title should reflect that rather than just generalizing.<p>I remember there was a study done at one point that the best piano players had worked longer hours per week practicing as opposed to the so so piano player.<p>You want to work 40 hours and be happy? Good! But I doubt you will be able to achieve greatness like that. Achieving success requires sacrifices.<p>Edison is another example of a guy that would work really long hours. Look at everything that he accomplished. You want to be mediocre, work 40 hours. You want to be great like Edison, work your ass off. Don't listen to the little people that tell you not to work your ass off. That is the road to mediocrity.<p>Now, if you are saying that you want to have time for family  and be another cog in the machine, 40 hours are great for you.\n</rant><p>edit - OK, after further reflection I think that what the title means is that IF you are just a cog in the machine of a large corporation AND you are working long hours then something is terribly wrong. If that was the original intent  then I completely agree. Is OK to do it once in a while but if it is normal then something is terribly wrong.<p>Now, for academics, athletics, other competitive fields and even startups at least in their earlier faces you still have to work long hours or the other guys will steam roll you.

We didn't have the 'post-desktop era' when laptops became the most common form-factor for personal computers.<p>Tablets and 'mobile devices' are different form factors. Different form factors often result in different hardware needs (we didn't have track-pads and batteries before laptops did we?). Those who are able to get these form-factor and hardware built and usable first experience an initially high sales volume.<p>Compaq led the portable computer world for a few years when it was first introduced, Sony led the walkman market, etc. etc.<p>Tablets are not the final form-factor, and the market is in it's infancy. Isn't a tablet just the extension of the PC market, rather than a completely new market?<p>When I think 'post-pc' I think of a time when we'll be interacting with any object we touch, without needing to think it is a device of this sort or that.",1313712029.0
