This is exactly the problem with education--kids feel like its the teachers responsibility to force them to get something out of it. It is <i>your</i> responsibility, no one else's.<p>Furthermore, I took analysis in college and I gained a great deal from it. It made me a much more precise thinker, mathematically and otherwise. Your lack of growth from the course is no ones fault but your own.<p>Edit: thinking about the issue a little bit more I realize that its not as clear cut as its ""your fault"". There is a big problem with how math is taught, especially at the younger grades. My issue with your blaming the course and the teacher for your lack of growth is that once you're at the college level you shouldn't need the teacher to do a song and dance to keep your attention. You're supposedly there for one reason only, to further your own education. Thus the responsibility is on you to get as much as you can out of every course. If the content of the course didn't match your expectations then the problem lies elsewhere, not in the material or how it was taught.",1302483379.0

I mean, how do you know what was in US flour in 1914? It was legal to mix it with chalk dust and cornstarch not very far before that, and I think it still was in 1914: <a href=""http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20810FB3D5C11738DDDA90A94DA405B8885F0D3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20810FB3D5C1...</a><p><a href=""http://www.rsc.org/education/eic/issues/2005mar/thefightagainstfoodadulteration.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rsc.org/education/eic/issues/2005mar/thefightagai...</a> claims:<p><pre><code>    To whiten bread, for example, bakers sometimes added \n    alum () and chalk to the flour, while mashed potatoes, \n    plaster of Paris (calcium sulphate), pipe clay and even \n    sawdust could be added to increase the weight of their \n    loaves. Rye flour or dried powdered beans could be used \n    to replace wheat flour and the sour taste of stale flour \n    could be disguised with ammonium carbonate.\n</code></pre>\nAnyway, so at the time, I think there were already a lot of food additives in use. They just weren't systematically vetted for toxicity the way they are today.<p>> However, yesterday when I opened a box of flour that I'd ordered from the internet, I realised that it made me feel kinda snobby. Why do I order flour off the internet? Protein content. Read this:<p>Thank you! That was awesome! I had no idea.<p>> carboxymethyl cellulose, carageenan, guar gum, xanthan gum, agar, pectin or maltodextrin.<p>It's true that those are common additives, and as you say that they are generally not unhealthy (those are all fiber, protein, or a mixture of the two, aren't they? Except maltodextrin, which is a starch), but they are usually a tiny fraction of the food.<p>> Real, good food that is made the proper way doesn't need to be thickened, bulked up or stabilized.<p>I don't agree. I use cornstarch, arrowroot, or even white flour as bulking and thickening agents when I make real, good food the proper way, and I often use milk, mustard, or egg as stabilizers. I've used lemon peel as a stabilizer too when I made blackberry jam, because it contains pectin. I don't know how you propose we should make blackberry jam without adding stabilizers?<p>I don't know of any reason to believe that the more popular food additives you list are any more dangerous than the traditional ones I usually use. I just don't happen to have them in my pantry or have experience cooking with them. (Indeed, many traditional additives like sassafras and lead sugar have been discovered to be toxic in the last couple of centuries, but to my knowledge, there still hasn't been a systematic testing program.)<p>I recognize that you're probably a lot more experienced at cooking than I am, so maybe I'm totally off the wall here.

I'd go so far as to say that Judith Butlers work looks like the sort of thing when you try to fit reality into harsh black and white qualitative logic, when you could easily look at circumstances quantitatively, say ""continuous bimodal distribution"" and be done with it.<p>More practically, the brief synopsis of Judith Butler's works I've seen seem to leave no room for the reality of Gender Disphoria or cases like David Reimer's.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer</a>\nand in the Googling I've been able to do all I can find is either transgendered people being annoyed at ""Gender Trouble"" or people who have read it saying that they don't see how transsexuality can exist.
