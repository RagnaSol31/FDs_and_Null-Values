3,3686667,story,,,3,6,spung,Trademark Woes,,"Hey HN, just wanted to vent and share our recent experiences lately with trademarking.<p>We had a very relevant and favorable name for our startup. We've purchased the domain name, built the technology, worked on design and marketing/messaging, and purchased business cards. Only months later after all that work and talking to customers and mentors to develop our product did we start the process to trademark our name. We're fortunate to have access to a trademark attorney, who told us that our name has a big chance conflicting with another trademark recently granted which lists what seems like every internet software good and service under the sun, only a few letters off but pronounced very similarly. Overall, we're fortunate to not have incorporated yet, but I think it's more the attachment to the name and the time spent developing our messaging that's got us down.<p>After getting over the initial stage of feeling bummed we have to abandon that relevant name, we spent a week brainstorming new names that sounded unique, domain was available, and a uspto.gov search turned up no concerning results. We narrowed it down to a few favorites, and decided on our favorite one. We were so excited around this new name, started brainstorming how we could leverage a play on the name for marketing, design, and focusing the company around a cool character mascot we began sketching. Spoke to the trademark attorney today and he found another trademark with goods and services described as a desktop CMS application and selling prerecorded video/audio recordings for lessons in marketing. At first we said no, that's so different from what we're doing! But then he showed us a similar application for a different spelling of the name we wanted, along with the letter for rejection by the trademark office, which explained:<p>The goods and/or services of the parties need not be identical or directly competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. Rather, they need only be related in some manner, or the conditions surrounding their marketing are such that they would be encountered by the same purchasers under circumstances that would give rise to the mistaken belief that the goods and/or services come from a common source.<p>Now we're back to square one. We're thinking for this round we need to brainstorm names that are obscure, possibly in a different language, or a word that means nothing at all.<p>Does anyone have any similar stories or advice to share? Going through this frustrating process, I'm surprised any startup is able to choose any name with common words in them. Do many companies just go with a name once they secure the domain and hope for the best?<p>Thanks for any feedback.",1331341171.0

It was cool at launch, and true there are some areas where it's legitimately superior to FB and Twitter, but overall it's only marginally better at best, not enough to get most people to switch.<p>Worse, since launch they don't seem to have rolled out many improvements, despite the clamor among its users for solutions to various problems.<p><i>> Asked about what Google+ actually is, Gundotra answered that, at its simplest, it is a social layer across all of Google's services. For Gundotra, what was missing on Google before Google+ was its ability to really understand its users and their connections. The challenge, in Gundotra's view, is that most people don't actually quite understand this.</i><p>Actually, people don't care.  They're not using G+ in order to help Google understand them and their connections, they're using it to connect, learn, grow, and enjoy themselves.  But as good as the idea of circles is, there are still shortcomings in the service that impede this, and which Google hasn't addressed (hopefully they're in the process of learning from their copious amounts user feedback and fixing it all, but no idea what's going on behind the scenes).<p><i>> The general feeling one got from watching Gundotra was that in his view, those who don't quite get Google+ are probably not using it right and not looking at it in the right way.</i><p>That's unfortunate.  The right way is what is natural, intuitive, and emergent.  If Google didn't quite predict all of that exactly, G+ needs to adapt, not the other way around.  Again, maybe they're doing exactly that behind the scenes, and just aren't done yet.  I hope so, it's a great service with a lot of potential if they can just nail the remaining issues.<p><i>> As for a full read/write API that would give developers access to the stream and allow them to post to it, Gundotra noted that he doesn't quite want to do it yet. In his view, just opening up an API would pollute the stream.</i><p>I grok his concerns, but what they really need to do is provide the tools for users to micro-manage their own streams.  Hashtag filtering for circles would be a <i>huge</i> step in that direction, and give users complete granular control over what they see and from whom.  For example, if I want to see Sergey Brin's posts on computer science but not his skydiving vacations or pictures of dinner, hashtag filtering on my CS circle would facilitate that.<p>Side note - amusing article in the sidebar: <i>""Study: Two-Thirds of Search Engine Users Dont Want Personalized Results""</i>.

Java EE layers abstraction on top of abstraction. App servers like WebSphere use a ton of memory before you've even deployed your app to the server and they charge you an arm and a leg (yes I know glassfish and jboss are free). Java code is verbose and ill-suited to crafting systems which generate html. The Java enterprise camp was championing the idea that web applications should have JSP talking to session beans, which talk to entity beans which then talks to your actual data store. By the time you've coded it all up you realise that it's slow before you've even added any business logic. Things have improved since then, but they lost my trust a long time ago. Spring seems to love having programmers take java source and translating it into XML so it's much more verbose than java (quite a feat in itself) and hides some of the most critical code from the IDE. The ""benefits"" provided by such approaches are marginal at best. The ironic part... I'm a huge fan of Java the platform, just despise the culture of bloatware which has sprung up around it. The world is moving on to lightweight solutions which don't require app servers which generate stack traces so long that they span 3 screens.",1331338969.0

Life is about the management of bullshit, and the bullshit level is the same everywhere.<p>I think I'm in your camp.  I left the research world after finishing a PhD, but before I did a post-doc.

The academic job market is dismal, and third-tier universities all over the country are staffed with graduates of top-tier PhD programs.  You have to be a true exception to land a good professorship these days, and the ivory tower is littered with the corpses of the brilliant people who failed to reach the top.<p>I had always been eager to become an entrepreneur, but back when I was right out of college, there was no such thing as YC, and definitely no such thing as a college kid getting venture capital to try out an idea.  So I went to grad school.  Years later, I'm looking down the barrel of a crappy academic job market, but the startup world had become much more vibrant.  So it was compelling.<p>That said, there's absolutely no way that your average startup is going to be as intellectually fulfilling as graduate studies in a field you love.

So gene therapy is not really that different from catching a viral infection.<p>Gene therapy is also not as permanent as some people might believe. Gene therapy will not be passed down to someones offspring - not unless it were deliberately targeted to their gamete (sex) cells.
