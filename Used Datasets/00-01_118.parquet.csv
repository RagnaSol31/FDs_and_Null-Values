3,2976330,comment,2976139.0,2976139.0,54,0,randomwalker,,,"Wikipedia lists close to 40(!) distributed social networks. [1] None have achieved a meaningful amount of adoption.<p>About a year ago I became interested in why this is the case. I'm an academic computer scientist with a strong interest in the startup/web tech scene (see profile for info). My colleagues and I have been studying not just decentralized social networks, but the more general concept of decentralized architectures for personal data. This includes ""personal data store"" efforts which are popping up all over the place, with similarly dismal adoption, ""infomediaries"" which were the rage in the late 90s (before the dot com bust ate them up), etc. Overall, we've looked at around 80 companies, projects, and proposals.<p>If the amount of reinvention in this space is surprising, the almost wanton refusal to learn from others' past mistakes is shocking. These projects seem to do the same things wrong and fail for very similar reasons, chief among them building more technology when it's not really technology that's holding things back.<p>There is the widespread  but often unstated and always unexamined  belief among the participants  that moving to a decentralized setting is a magic cure-all for the problems that ail today's status quo, such as privacy and interoperability. Sadly, this belief is simply wrong.<p>I certainly sympathize with the urge to pat these guys on the back for trying, but is it really courage or foolhardiness? If 10,000 amateurs have tried to solve P =? NP and failed, do we encourage the 10,001th guy to give it a shot as well, or do we tell him to learn some math and CS first, and gain an appreciation for why the problem is hard and probably not worth taking on unless you really really know what you're doing?<p>[Our study is not out yet, but feel free to contact me if you're interested in discussing this.]<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network</a>",1315529889.0

8,2976325,comment,2976216.0,2976216.0,2,0,TuaAmin13,,,"My $0.02 as a storage administrator (primarily NAS)<p>It sounds like your ""data security"" isn't my data security.\n-""robust, efficient, zero-maintenance offsite storage""\n-""offsite vs local, cloud storage robustness vs hard disk robustness""\nWhen I say data security I mean that my data is encrypted and locked down six ways from Sunday.  ""Robustness"" isn't security.  ""Offsite"" doesn't mean security.  I've got turnstiles, card readers, locked cages, and passwords standing between you and my local data.  ""Cloud storage robustness"".  That's security from failures, not necessarily security from hackers which is what data security means to me.  You say it's encrypted but there's no mention if this is encrypted storage or if it's encrypted information transfer.<p>Other than you needing to re-evaluate your buzzwords, it sounds like you have a cloud SAN rather than a cloud NAS.  That does sound different enough that you could definitely have a niche to pursue.  There are programs that work better with SAN storage than NAS storage, but at some level I'm wondering: If I'm running my own MSSQL server (or something else I'd host in house that needs SAN storage), why would I pay for a local server but remote storage?  Why wouldn't I just have a remote server with remote storage or a local server with local storage?  I'm not immediately seeing the use case, perhaps you can paint me a word picture.  Sure 256TB is great, but if you need 256TB you probably have more than enough money to buy your own storage or you have some crazy financial regulations or something that would require you to keep it in house.  On the smaller scale, I run in to the ""Why am I paying to keep a local file server around to distribute this remote block device?""<p>Again, a solid use-case or pain point may turn me in to a believer of why I need this product. From what you've described I'm not seeing it, but I like the technology potential.",1315529797.0

I think this is exactly that kind of incident.<p>From my pov, when I come to a person about an issue and they respond with ""as I noted in the other thread..."" it can come across as somewhat gruff and dismissive.  I totally get quickly clearing out a ticket and dealing with it simply, but the brevity and tone of the response made me unsure about how I flagged the issue.  I immediately wonder if I've frustrated the support guy by giving him further information about the issue.  It's certainly an inconvenience to get a dup, perhaps the support guy doesn't welcome updates on tickets?  I'm left to wonder whether I've overstepped by supplying more info, and worse, I have to question if GitHub support cares about my response or if it's just been put in the bug bin of despair.<p>So, all things considered, you guys are doing fine, but maybe are thinking like devs rather than support people.  Perhaps that is appropriate for GitHub: devs are your target market.  Actually, my biggest beef with your support so far is I never was able to clear out a question about image linking in markdown files in a GitHub repo.  Right now everyone in my startup has to add raw blob link to every single link, and this just seems like the wrong pattern.  Why should I have to prepend <a href=""https://github.com/.../../blob/master/.../images/IMAGE.jpg?raw=true"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/.../../blob/master/.../images/IMAGE.jpg?r...</a> for every image I want to link in our flat file wiki?

X starts working to reduce the idea to practice.<p>At time 4, Y comes up with a similar idea, and also starts reducing to practice.<p>At time 10, Y gets it all working, writes up and files a patent application.<p>At time 15, X gets it all working (poorly), writes up and files a patent application.<p>Under first to file, Y wins. Under first to invent, Y is presumed to be the one deserving the patent, but X can initiate an ""interference"", which is an administrative procedure in the patent office to determine who has the earlier priority date. If X can prove that is him, he wins.<p>To prove this, X has to be able to show that there is some time before time 4 where X had conceived of the idea and had been continuously working diligently to reduce it to practice from then until time 15.<p>Proving this can be difficult and expensive. It depends on how good X was at keeping accurate, verifiable records.<p>EXAMPLE 2<p>X comes up with the idea at time 0. X starts working on reduction to practice.<p>Y comes up with the idea at time 4. Y starts reduction to practice.<p>At time 6, X takes time off to work on something else (maybe he needed money to pay for a sick kid or something, so had to take a regular job for a while). He gets back to working on the invention at time 8.<p>Y files his application at time 10. X files at 15. Y wins under both first to file and first to invent, because X lost his priority date of time 0 when he stopped working. His new priority date is time 6. Since Y was working diligently from time 4 to filing, Y's priority date is 4.<p>EXAMPLE 3<p>Same as example 2, except X files at time 10, Y files at time 15.<p>X wins under first to file. Y wins (after an interference) under first to invent. Note that in this example the guy who thought of the idea first loses under first to invent and wins under first to file.<p>The take away here is that under first to invent, the patent doesn't necessarily go to the first person to think of the idea, or to the first person to reduce it to practice. The advantage goes to the person who spent the longest time working on it in their last continuous period of diligent work before filing, so it can have a lot to do with what other things are going on the inventors life...and to make use of that advantage the person better have good documentation.<p>First to file is likely to ""right"" at least as often as first to invent, with a much smaller burden on everyone involved (and remember, this only even becomes an issue when you have two or more inventors with overlapping claims).",1315528007.0

It ended up spewing .DS_Store files all over my employer's company dropbox folders.,1315526521.0

I don't know if that cuts into market share, but I would be curious how much niche ""artisan"" grocery store food sales are affected by people who just make their own. Microbrews might be a good place to start looking as well.",1315526510.0
