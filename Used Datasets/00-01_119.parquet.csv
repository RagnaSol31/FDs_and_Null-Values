They should be forced into financial prudence.""</i><p>If you're going to make this claim, you have to defend it with facts.  Right now, you're just making a very wordy assertion, based on an extremely loose understanding of the situation, and a big helping of ideology.<p>Here's a history of Washington state spending since 1999:<p><a href=""http://fiscal.wa.gov/FRViewer.aspx?Rpt=Recast%20History%20Expenditure%20Statewide%20Summary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fiscal.wa.gov/FRViewer.aspx?Rpt=Recast%20History%20Ex...</a><p>Since you seem very sure of yourself, perhaps you'd like to tell the rest of us which lines are ""irresponsible"".  Be sure to defend your choices.<p>(As a former resident of Washington, my opinion is that one of the huge problems in state has been the abuse of the initiative process to both lock up tax revenue for particular uses (just like California), and also to knock out important sources of revenue (like property taxes and the vehicle registration tax).  In a state that <i>already</i> has no income tax, it becomes extremely difficult to satisfy even reasonable growth in spending when other important sources of revenue are eliminated or capped at arbitrary levels.)",1285030775.0

It's completely unsourced and suspect even to a casual look. I won't nitpick each entry, but a couple stood out to me.<p>The Yak-4 was a contemporary of the British de Havilland Mosquito. The bomber variant of the British aircraft entirely outclasses the Russian airplane.<p>As for the M-4 Molot, of which it's claimed ""Though there were truly only 18 aircraft in prototype stage, the hoax of circling the same 18 planes fooled the unsuspecting US,"" I think it wasn't a good plan to parade the small force as if it were much larger, prompting the deployment of the B-52 fleet, which really could deliver an intercontinental strike, and practiced it daily.<p>Finally, I'm going to pick on the Tu-160.

I notice my county, in southwestern Utah, is at the 2% mark, but my own limited experience suggests that might be a rather conservative estimate. A couple idle speculations as per the study:<p>1) I know many people who have responded to the recession by attempting to start a business (usually involving a depressingly harebrained business plan). These people often fall victim to Kelly Felix-inspired ""make money on the Internet"" or other affiliate marketing schemes. I could imagine some of these people, when being surveyed, saying that they did not currently desire a job.<p>2) Many adults, and recent high-school graduates, who otherwise would not be attending college, are attending college now, thanks to the high availability of student benefits and lack of other options. I don't think the study factored these people (I don't know what criteria one could use to do so anyway), but if it had, I'll bet the resulting unemployment rate would be higher nationwide.",1285027321.0
