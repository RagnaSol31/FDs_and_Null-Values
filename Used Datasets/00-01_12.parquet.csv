6,330621,comment,330470.0,330568.0,0,0,jamiequint,,,"I agree with your point <i></i>in the very early stages of a company<i></i><p>Networking for the purpose of getting to know people can be useful, but during the early stages of a startup if you are out talking to people your goal should be to understand your target market better. Otherwise, don't worry about networking instead of coding until you need to raise money.<p>I completely disagree with this point...<p>""Someone focusing on suit type endeavors when that someone is an engineer/geek/hacker/techie/[insert name for us here] is irresponsible in that it amounts to a gross misallocation of resources.""<p>What do you plan to do if that person doesn't exist? Wait to sell your product until you can hire one? Get another co-founder to go out and raise money? PG talks about Sam Altman pitching phone execs the early days of Loopt to great success, and his background was CS not sales.<p>""any double digit IQ'er wearing a suit can network, but not everyone can design and code and troubleshoot, which is what creates value.""<p>There are two fallacies here.<p>First, the fallacy that everyone can network equally well. Some people are incredible at networking, they can network so well that they are a valuable asset to a company for that reason alone. (See Keith Ferazzi) Everyone can ""network"" but only certain people can make their network pay very well.<p>Second, that only coding creates value. A great product still doesn't sell itself. What do you think Apple would be without brilliant marketing? You can have the best product in the world technically, but in terms of market value you have nothing if its not sold.",1223859228

What's the common variable?""<p>Sounds like OP has some personality issues that need to be worked out.  And, I got a distinct ""mad with power"" vibe, as well.  Early stage company founders do not need a boss.  If they do, they're already doomed to failure.  It sounds like this fellow just likes the idea of being chief of something, and isn't all that good at it.  Many nerds have started companies without management chops or a good personality, but they made up for it by producing code that solved a problem.  I'm getting the distinct impression the OP (who may or may not be strong on the code front) is definitely weak on the management and personality front, but wanted to spend all of this time managing and ""networking"".<p>I don't claim to be an expert on this stuff, but I am a nerd, and I do produce (when it's my place to do so, though in my current startup, I produce far less code than my co-founder), and I think I would have ditched this startup, too.  Nerds, in general, aren't good at being bossed around, and the kind that start companies <i>definitely</i> aren't good at being bossed around.<p>But, I agree with you.  The guy probably <i>does</i> actually have a good company in him (because dedication and a healthy appetite for risk are the primary requirements...everything else pales in comparison).  He just needs to keep assessing how he can do things better next time, particularly when it comes to interacting with co-founders.",1223858931

18,330608,comment,330470.0,330568.0,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>IMO, where value exists, everything naturally follows, including people/companies that want to network with value.</i><p>This is overly optimistic about the capacity of your fellow man to recognize value.  Sometimes you just have to tell them what the value is, and if you don't have a network, you have no one to tell.  Sounds ridiculous to nerds like you and I, I know, but if you spend a little time in the corporate world you'll begin to see how much major purchase decisions are made based on what a trusted individual recommends.  A lot of times the ""trusted"" individual is a vendor with a vested interest in selling something.  This actually works better in the long run than you might think, because most people work in the same business for many years, and if one vendor screws them (while seeming very nice), they have time to learn and change to another vendor (probably also someone they've spoken to before).<p>But, I do think the OP does have some prioritization issues.  It always comes back to the product.  If you don't have a great product, you don't have a company worth networking for.",1223858465

The best we can do is to 1) not missallocate more resources (via a ballout) and 2) end the system that credited the debt bubble. Here's how to do that:<p>End Fractional Reserve Banking<p>Allow banks only to lend their deposits. This also eliminates the need for central banks - let people use 100% deposit banks when they want deposit security. This will prevent large debt bubbles (speculative investment bubbles) and the resulting massive misallocation of resources.\nEnd Inflationary Monetary Policies<p>Never print more money. Period. Use smaller denominations as slow deflation occurs due to an increasing population. This will keep prices in line with value and allow people to save without making high risk investments.,1223856068
