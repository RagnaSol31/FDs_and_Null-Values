Shannon built a wearable computer in the early 60s to try to predict roulette, and they would go to Nevada casinos to test out the theory and practice.<p>The book's web site is here - \n<a href=""http://home.williampoundstone.net/Kelly/Kelly.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://home.williampoundstone.net/Kelly/Kelly.html</a><p>A simple explanation of the Kelly criterion is that if you have an edge (ie bet $5 and win $6 on a fair coin toss) you should bet edge / odds. The edge in this example is 0.1 (50% * -1 + 50% * 1.2), the odds are even money 1:1. The Kelly bet would be 10% (the edge) / 1 (the even money odds) = 10% of your bankroll. (corrected)<p>If you bet 0 each time, the expected growth rate is 0, if you bet 100% each time, the expected growth rate is 0, because eventually you will lose your whole bankroll.<p>10% is big enough to matter, but not so big that a losing streak will eventually decimate your bankroll.<p>If memory serves, when you bet the Kelly amount, you have a 1-p probability of eventually experiencing a p drawdown, ie if you have $10, you have a 10% chance of ever getting as low as $1 before resuming the expected long-run growth rate.

That political feat was lauded as the ""Minnesota miracle,"" and got our then governor on the cover of Time magazine as a can-do, innovative governor. With special funding adjustments for high-poverty areas and special funding for school districts to promote racial integration, the inner-city school districts of Minneapolis and St. Paul, the two largest school districts in Minnesota, actually get MORE funding per pupil than most other school districts in the state.<p>But after a generation of this experiment, the results are disappointing. On the whole, schools anywhere in Minnesota are probably better than schools in most places in Mississippi, which is why many observers are guessing at the macro level that funding makes a difference.<p>But within Minnesota, both the Minneapolis and St. Paul districts are laggards in academic achievement, and most disturbingly to people like me who hope for all school pupils to learn and thrive, the ""achievement gap"" between ""white"" pupils and ""pupils of color"" is wider in Minnesota than almost anywhere else. That last observation is especially disturbing because Minnesota has no history of de jure school segregation or of impairing the civil rights of black people. (The first black graduate of the University of Minnesota graduated before my late grandfather was even born.) Something is seriously awry in the Minneapolis Public Schools, despite adequate funding, and when I read in the local newspaper, as I did a few months ago, that a union-endorsed candidate for the Minneapolis School Board has NEVER lost for as long as the schoolteacher union has been organized as a collective bargaining unit, I think that more than just funding levels are a problem here.",1304294483.0

Today, I might come up with a better algorithm, but back then, all I could find was a brute-force approach.  The most complex puzzle I had seen at the time was taking hours to run.<p>The program was written in VB6, and it was just wasn't mean for CPU-intensive programs like that.  If I were to write that program again today, I'd be looking at optimizing the code for speed, starting with the language.<p>So yes, the question -does- matter.  Sometimes.",1304294469.0

Right side had too many font styles, not enough whitespace, ""towards center"" justification (which makes me think of web equivalent -> rotating flaming skulls!), no clear path for my eyes to follow.  My biggest complaint is utter lack of left right (horizontal) balance.<p>Maybe that is good print design (a subject I quit paying attention to in the 90's).",1304294430.0
