They did this by taking the RNA out of some HIVs and replaced it instead with a sequence to look for a specific antigen on the cancer cells.  Then they took the HIVs and introduced them to the T-Cells and let them get infected.  Since the original nasty RNA wasn't present, it won't replicate, but it will make some T-Cells that target the antigen on the cancer cells.  After reintroducing to the patient, their immune systems then pick up from other signals that we don't full understand that some T-Cells are attacking this antigen, so it should make more of them.",1313108928.0

This is why I believe that the university system is the first credential employers look for, graduation means that you can solve problems and you are able to manage yourself, when nobody is there holding your hand.<p>That said there is a back door for computer programming that lots of other fields don't have, that being, you can get very good in your mothers basement. You don't need access to expensive equipment like oscilloscopes and function generators like you for EE or access the hospital if you are training to be a doctor.<p>But form what I understand you if you go this way you will need to be really good, and have a lots of experience or get lucky and land a job where your can apply your skills and build on them.<p>From my generalist view point here, if you want to be a player in the tech industry you need to be doing it as your hobby too, and further look at every opportunity you get to push to learn more, expecially off hours, when you are not getting paid.<p>With respect to making money doing something the wordpress thing is really easy to do, once you get an understanding of html, css, and programming in php you can do some pretty powerful stuff. This is a valuable for lots of companies that don't have a web presence. So if you are going to do it then, build your own site, and use it a testing ground for new things that you see as neat and find on the web.<p>And finally, whenever you get the chance help others do it! Open source your projects, let others build off your projects, help them when they ask you about it, understand other peoples projects and add value where you can. You will learn a ton and get the chance to provide knowledge to others.<p>Good luck!",1313108211.0
