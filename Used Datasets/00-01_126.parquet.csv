It would be significantly more complicated to dissolve the whole European Union and dealing with a political and legal mess that would ensue.

It doesn't take a lot of research to find out who benefited the most from the Euro. Hint: not any the ""poorly run smaller economies"".",1363481976.0

(<i>De Rerum Natura</i> is a Roman philosophical poem from the mid-first century BCE. Lucretius and his poem are getting a lot of press recently because of a book called <i>The Swerve</i> by Stephen Greenblatt.)<p>The linked guide to PhDs made me smile, and it rings true to me for non-sciences.

But of course if your definition of ""knowledge"" only makes room for numerical or quantifiable or experimental subjects, then you may disagree. I arguably expanded the world's knowledge of <i>De Rerum Natura</i>. My work has been cited at least once that I know of in subsequent work on the Epicureans, and not by me.
