5,1447569,comment,1447098.0,1447098.0,0,0,siglesias,,,"With all respect to Mr. Swartz, I find it hard to fit the world of Toy Story, broadly speaking, into a widely-stretched political framework, although it is a thoughtful and fun read. Here's how I differ in my read of TS3.<p>Swartz starts by connecting the dynamic between Andy and Woody & company to feudalism, which is tempting at first glance (because loyalty is at play), but upon closer scrutiny there is no economic exchange or significant obligations to the ""loyalty"" apart from merely being present as a toy. Instead of the toy-master arrangement being one of servitude, indentured labor, or military obligation, the duty of the toy is in fact inverted from any such duty: they simply have to ""be,"" which doesn't require any work. The toys' purpose is pure: to love and to be loved. The relationship forces us to ponder how we relate to the non-human things around us: our iPods, the planet, animals--how we form relationships with objects, and what consequences arise, both within our minds and out in the physical world, from our regard (or disregard) for those objects. That there is an unconditional dominance of the toys by humans is granted, and, in the conceit of the films (with the exception of the moment with Cid in TS1), immutable.<p>Sunnyside Daycare, however, IS rife with political undercurrent (as it relates a power dynamic unto itself among the toys), but I disagree that it is being presented as a ""libertarian paradise"" (if such a thing can even be said to be possible). The reason, of course, is that there is a thinly veiled communitarian, possibly communist sense of mutual obligation: that is, the massage and sewing shops are exactly presented as examples of the ways in which the toys in this community are meant to ""help"" each other--self interest is ostensibly not at play, not among the toys anyway. In any event, we see the system quickly unveil itself as a totalitarian police state, with Lotso at the top, and we see quickly how his oppression becomes untenable for Woody & company after they attempt to exercise their option to leave. What ensues is a classic depiction of imprisonment (creatively, in my opinion, the movie's low), along with an interesting interlude that comically reexamines the sexual power inversion that Barbie enacts over Ken to trump his military authority.<p>Bonnie's house doesn't in any substantive way represent a ""mixed economy"" but instead represents a reincarnation of purpose for the toys once they've exhausted their use to Andy. Bonnie is, simply put, a younger Andy, and along with that represents a new abundance of love and time that will reinvigorate the toys with a sense of purpose and belonging. The moment at the end of the movie is the very profound recognition, via the transference of toys, that youth, and with that life, is fleeting. Andy recognizes that the joyous youth within himself hasn't died, but has merely been passed on to the very capable Bonnie. With that there is a third layer of meaning, that many have picked up on, that relates to the paternalistic relationships present both within the movie and its audience.<p>With the advent (some would say inevitable advent) of consumerism, we have become a more materialistic society, and we imbue meaning to more objects in our lives than ever before. Toy Story forces us to examine how we distribute our own sense of self worth, and, in many ways, pieces of our own identity among the various artifacts strewn about our houses. Perhaps there is even a subtle critique of this materialistic culture hidden somewhere in the Toy Story franchise--do we think twice before we swap in our iPhones anymore for a new model? Has society forced us to discard our regard of what we own in hopes that we constantly sell on eBay, REown, and repeat? There's rife economic and sociological commentary here: we all feel it. The political interlude, in my opinion, while funny, isn't nearly as interesting as its relentless focusing and refocusing on what we consider garbage, and why.",1277081882.0

14,1447560,comment,1447002.0,1447002.0,0,0,chipsy,,,"In my opinion, the main source of replay instability comes from the timing model. I just dealt with this yesterday, in fact: I have a puzzle game running the Box2D physics engine, and had to rework some of my architecture to make it run deterministically each time the player restarts, since the gameplay is predicated on testing a configuration, resetting, and adjusting it.<p>Representing time in a game requires some way of slicing a time delta into discrete slices that you can run processing on it; so in the end every timing model comes down to ""use a time delta directly within your simulation code"" or ""chunk it into frames and store or drop the remainders."" The latter option is almost a given if you want your results to be stable and deterministic, it's just a matter of _when_ you apply the frames.<p>In my case, before the refactor I had each segment of the simulation(AI, spawners, physics, etc.) running independent frame chunks from the same dT. The problem is that in a loop that looks like:<p>ai.update(dT);\nphys.update(dT);\nspawns.update(dT);<p>If dT is large enough, then AI will run multiple times before ever hitting physics, causing some bizarre behaviors that may or may not be acceptable(in my case, not).<p>My solution was to change it to:<p>while (dT>fixdT)\n{\n  ai.update(fixdT);\n  phys.update(fixdT);\n  spawns.update(fixdT);\n  dT-=fixdT;\n}<p>This way, no one piece of code can race ahead of the others, but the option is still there to let some things run only every n frames(including fractional amounts).<p>Another thing I had to do for stability was a full reset on everything. Pre-refactor, I let Box2D stay ""warm"" and just removed all bodies, but this turned out to affect determinism - and proved worse for start times than a cold restart, anyway.",1277081609.0

100,1447467,comment,1447428.0,1447428.0,0,0,jasonlbaptiste,,,"I'm going to go and replace 3 years with a ""short time frame"".  Some things to focus on:<p>-  Market opportunity-  a million dollars isn't a lot in the grand scheme of things, but it certainly is a lot if the market opportunity is not large enough.  Even if you put Bill Gates and Steve Jobs as founders in a new venture with a total market size of 10 million, there is no way they could become too wealthy without completely changing the business (ie- failing).<p>-  Inequality of information-  find a place where you know something that many undervalue.  Having this inequality of information can give you, your first piece of leverage.<p>-  Leverage skills you know-  You can go into new fields such as say Finance, but make sure you're leveraging something you already know such as technology and/or product.  Someone wanted to start a documentary with me.  I said that would be fun, but it would be my first documentary regardless of what happened.  There was a glass ceiling due to that.  If I do something leveraging a skill I know, I'm already ahead of the game.<p>-  Look in obscure places-  We're often fascinated with the shiny things in the internet industry.  Many overlook the obscure and unsexy.  Don't make that mistake.  If your goal has primarily monetary motivations, look at the unsexy.<p>-  Surround yourself with smart people-  smart people whom are successful usually got there by doing the same and have an innate desire to help those do the same.  it's the ecosystem that's currently happening with the paypal mafia and can be traced all the way back to fairchild semiconductor.<p>-  Charge for something-  Building a consumer property dependent upon advertising has easily made many millionaires, but it isn't the surest path.  It takes a lot of time and scale, which due to cashflow issues will require large outside investment probably before you are a millionaire.  Build something that you can charge for.<p>-  Your metric shouldn't be dollars-  If you're going after a big enough market and charging a reasonable amount, you can hit a million dollars.  Focus on growth, customer acquisition costs, lifetime value of the customer, and churn.<p>-  Get as many distribution channels as possible-  There is some weird sense that if you build something they will just come.  That a few like buttons and emails to editor@techcrunch.com will make your traffic explode + grow consistently.  It fucking won't.  Get as many distribution channels as possible.  Each one by itself may not be large, but if you have many it starts to add up.  It also diversifies your risk.  If you're a 100% SEO play, you're playing a dangerous dangerous game.  You're fully dependent upon someone else's rules.  If Google bans you, you will be done.  Replace SEO with: App store, facebook, etc.<p>-  Go with your gut and do not care about fameballing-  Go with what your gut says, regardless of how it might look to the rest of the world.  Too often we (I) get lost in caring about what people think.  It usually leads to a wrong decision.   Don't worry about becoming internet famous or appearing on teh maj0r blogz.  Fame is fleeting in the traditional sense.  Become famous with your customers.  They're the ones that truly matter.  What they think matters and they will ultimately put their money where their mouth is.<p>-  Be an unrelenting machine-  Brick walls are there to show you how bad you want something.  Commit to your goals and do not waver from them a one bit regardless of what else is there.  I took this approach to losing weight and fitness.  I have not missed a single 5k run in over a year.  It did not matter if I had not slept for two days, traveling across the country, or whatever else.  If your goals is to become a millionaire, you need to be an unrelenting machine that does not let emotions make you give up / stop.  You either get it done with 100% commitment or you don't.  Be a machine.<p>-  If it's a ""trend"", it's too late-  This means the barriers to entry are usually too high at this point to have  the greatest possible chance of success.  Sure you could still make a lot of money in something like the app store or the facebook platform, but the chances are significantly less than they were in the summer of 08 or spring of 2007.  You can always revisit past trends though.<p>-  If you do focus on a dollar amount, focus on the first $10,000-  This usually means you've found some repeatable process / minimal traction.  ie- if you're selling a $100 product, you've already encountered 100 people who have paid you.  From here you can scale up.  It's also a lot easier to take in when you're looking at numbers.  Making 1 million seems hard, but making $10,000 doesn't seem so hard, right?<p>-  Be a master of information-  Many think it might be wasteful that I spent so much time on newsyc or read so many tech information sites.  It's not, it's what gives me an edge.  I feel engulfed.<p>-  Get out and be social-  Even if you're an introvert, being around people will give you energy.  I'm at my worst when I'm isolated from people and at my best when I've at least spent some time with close friends (usually who I don't know from business.)<p>-  Make waves, don't ride them-  There was a famous talk Jawed Karim gave from youtube.  He described the three factors that made youtube take off.  I think they included (1- emergence of flash, so no codecs required 2- one click upload 3- ability to share embed).  Find those small pieces and put them together to make the wave.  That's what youtube did imho.  The other guys really just rode the wave they created (which is okay).<p>-  Say no way more than you say yes-  I bet almost every web entrepreneur has encountered this: You demo your product / explain what you're doing and someone suggests that you do ""X feature/idea"".  X is a really good idea and maybe even fits in with what you're doing, but it would take you SO FAR off the path you're on.  If you implemented X it would take a ton of time and morph what you're doing.  It's also really really hard to say no when it comes from someone well respected like a VC or famous entrepreneur.  I mean how the fuck could they be wrong?  Hell, they might even write me a check if I do what they say!!!!!  Don't fall for that trap.  Instead write the feedback down somewhere as one single data point to consider amongst others.  If that same piece of feedback keeps coming up AND it fits within the guidelines of your vision, then you should consider it more seriously.  Weight suggestions from paying customers a bit more, since their vote is weighted by dollars.<p>-  Be so good they can't ignore you-  I first heard this quote from Marc Andreessen, but he stole it from Steve Martin.  Just be so good with what you do that you can't be ignored.  You can surely get away with a boring product with no soul, but being so good you can't ignore is much more powerful.<p>-  Always keep your door/inbox open-  You never know who is going to walk through your door + contact you.  Serendipity is a beautiful thing.  At one point Bill Gates was just a random college kid calling an Albuquerque computer company.<p>-  Give yourself every opportunity you can-  I use this as a reason why starting a company in silicon valley when it comes to tech is a good idea.  You can succeed anywhere in the world, but you certainly have a better chance in the valley.  You should give yourself every opportunity possible, especially as an entrepreneur where every advantage counts.<p>-  Give yourself credit-  This is the thing I do the least of and I'm trying to work on it.  What may seem simple+not that revolutionary to anyone ahead of the curve can usually be pure wizardry to the general public, whom is often your customer.  Give yourself more credit.<p>-  Look for the accessory ecosystem-  iPod/iPhone/iPad case manufacturers are making a fortune.  Armormount is also making a killing by making flat panel wall mounts.  Woothemes makes millions of dollars a year (and growing) selling Wordpress themes.  There are tons of other areas here, but these are the ones that come to mind first.  If there's a huge new product/shift, there's usually money to be made in the accessory ecosystem.<p>-  Stick with it-  Don't give up too fast.  Being broke and not making any money sucks + can often make you think nothing will ever work.  Don't quit when you're down.  If this was easy then everyone would be a millionaire and being a millionaire wouldn't be anything special.  Certainly learn from your mistakes + pivot, but don't quit just because it didn't work right away.<p>-  Make the illiquid, liquid-  I realized this after talking to a friend who helps trade illiquid real estate securities.  A bank may have hundreds of millions of assets, but they're actually worth substantially less if they cannot be moved.  If you can help people make something that is illiquid, liquid they will pay you a great deal of money.  Giving you a 20-30% cut is worth it, when the opposite is making no money at all.<p>-  Productize a service-  If you can make what might normally be considered a service into a scaleable, repeatable, and efficient process that makes it seem like a product you can make a good amount of money.  In some ways, I feel this is what Michael Dell did with DELL in the early days.  Putting together a computer is essentially a service, but he put together a streamlined method of doing things that it really turned it into a product.
