Thats why I chose XUnit as an example: classes are groups of tests, while the actual tests are written in methods. So it makes sense to defer (or at least to be able to defer) ""broken parts"" to have a better understanding of how much is exactly broken. And ""just have to use"" is sometimes not that easy if for example your task is ripping out a whole subsystem and fitting a new one. You would really like to see progress there instead of ""tiny feature Y is not provable by your compiler, so I won't tell you whether feature X,Z and B work"". So I am interested in whether only a part of the compilation unit makes sense. Ruby does that: I can tell my test suite that I fully expect this test to be broken at the moment and that I want that reported. In Java, I'm lost until I satisfied the complainer - ehm - compiler.<p>Thats actually the reason why I know more then one Java and C shop that use Ruby/Python/similar for their test suite.",1300668807.0

Just one example - but I don't claim to have ""the"" or even ""a"" solution. One aspect, though: I think fossile fuels and nuclear power are both limited resources (or is nuclear power a perpeteum mobile?).

To me it sounds about right, depending on what you are asking for.<p>Of course, we all have very little information about your request for quotes, so we're all just guessing. All we know is that you ""need help with the front-end"" on a ""pretty standard web app"", which really could mean anything.<p>You might need some or all of:\n- coming soon page, home page, signup page, faq, about-us, policy pages, testimonials, etc\n- plan descriptions, comparison page\n- system settings, notification settings, etc\n- password reset form, new email form\n- billing updates, payment profiles, billing history\n- a whole set of email designs\n- some kind of viral marketing component, like referral rewards\n- methods to control growth to a level you can handle\n- a custom front-end for whatever value you provide (the actual app)\n- a dozen other things specific to the cargo industry\n- inline notifications\n- all the up-to-date and greatest design guidelines etc.<p>You may have provided a well thought-out, detailed RFQ with specs, but if you did not and need your designer to do needs assessments, create a series of unique pages for different functions, cut it up, and code it, then you might be getting a fantastic deal at $10K. If you didn't provide detailed specs, the designers might also think you don't know what you need and may be checking if you are serious before spending a lot of time trying to win a project that will likely need a lot of extra communication and planning work.<p>I do that when regular people (people who don't follow HN) come to me with great ideas for web apps, like a friend who wanted to create a simpler version of quicken online.  My stock quote is $5 million dollars, but of course, that includes the front-end, back-end, client support systems, and marketing components as well.<p>Seriously though, creating a great custom UI for an admin is hard work, and even the prettiest looking designs might have loads of subtle road blocks to a good user experience, which can be a component towards the success and failure of your startup.  Working on a tight budget and/or time-line increases the chances of user roadblocks, while an experienced designer with a history of creating custom solutions for different clients is more likely to create something users will enjoy and want to use.  Give them a good working budget so they can fully devote their creative juice to you for a few months, learn your goals, and create the best solution.<p>Also, a couple of simple pages can make a huge difference in how valuable your application is to your clients or end users.  One project I am working on requires a 'simple' admin for adding, editing, and deleting produce for a grocery store. The client asked me to reproduce the design modal he knew and understood from his 10 year old admin (which I created), which is the same thing he asked for and got from the other new designer, who I replaced.<p>In discussing his business, I found out he spends 3 hours a week maintaining 1,000 items of produce. The thing is, he's also adding 10x the inventory, which turns 3 hours of work a week into 30 hours. The <i>requested</i> design unknowingly required a full-time staff person, which he couldn't afford, which means he wouldn't have met his goal of adding the new inventory. Instead, I spent much more time designing a single page admin that will let him maintain his inventory in a small fraction of the time and <i>all</i> his goals get met - because of the design.<p>Sites like Themeforest can't make decisions like that, but are a great starting point for UI prettiness. How many design issues are there like that in this project?  Nobody really knows know until they interview you, so we don't have a clue if $10,000 is a good deal or not, or if it is not nearly enough.<p>While they might be priced out of range of some boot-strapping startups, a really good designer brings a great deal of value to your project. If you can afford it, it's worth it.<p>Good luck on your startup!<p>John.",1300667688.0

The cost to human health of not using nuclear power is higher than using it, in two ways. First, the fossil fuel sources which  are the only scalable alternative cause demonstrably more harm, both to the environment and to carcinogenesis, than xenon radionuclides detected 50km from Fukushima. Secondly, the malaria and dysentery pathogens that ride alongside lack  of electrical power infrastructure reliably kill 1.7 million people every year.",1300666233.0

Last time I checked (last year) there was not even a list of applicants. I'm curious, how would an ""open"" process differ from a ""closed, non-public process?""<p>Waste their time? They read applications so they can find the ones they think are going to make them a lot of money. It is a necessary step needed for them to make money. I'm not sure what your point is. You feel bad they have to read applications they themselves solicit in order for them to make money? Should someone else read them for them and they do nothing during the application process?<p>Getting their ideas vetted? Y Combinator gives zero feedback to applicants, leaving them in the dark as to why they were rejected. How does that help? Any vetting process I ever saw gave a ""report"" or at least some information as to why or why not a candidate was approved or not. Y Combinator does neither. As you said, they spend enormous amounts of time reading the applications (for their benefit) but zero time providing any feedback whatsoever for the applicants benefit. What does that tell you? Does that sound like an entity who is truly trying to help the developers? What do you take away or learn from that? What value does that have?",1300665743.0
