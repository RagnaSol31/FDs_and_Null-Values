Reclaiming file descriptors makes those file descriptors available for subsequent use.  Closing database connections means the resources dedicated to those connections are made available for reuse as well.<p>All of those things are resources and fit nicely with the name of the idiom:  Resource Allocation Is Initialization.  Resource management is 100% about side effects.<p>Not that there's anything wrong with using RAII for things that aren't normally thought of as resources (such as locks) but there's certainly nothing strange about using it to manage a finite resource such as memory.,1335055957.0

19,3873513,comment,3872862.0,3873441.0,5,0,cheald,,,"I would argue that once an API is published and put into use, it becomes a list of facts about the interfaces in the program. You <i>cannot</i> change an API without undermining its entire purpose. In that sense, it is factual, in that the API class paths and signatures are effectively routing information between a client program and the API implementation. They describe the means by which you give data to a library and give data back.<p>An API may be entirely as functional (though not necessarily as usable) if no creative thought or effort goes into it. You could have all your API methods be called api1(...), api2(...) and still have them function. Creativity and skill are a very useful component in making APIs, but I would argue that they are not requisite, as evidenced by the dearth of uncreative APIs created by unskilled programmers who have still managed to create libraries and services that we use on a daily basis.",1335055682.0

This is bad news for Android, because it shows that a developer can build a massively successfully product that the world goes crazy for without even using Android. You could argue that Instagram wouldn't have sold for $1 billion if it hadn't gone to Android and seen an immediate spike in activations. But, the truth of the matter is that Instagram was fielding offers from Facebook before it was on Android.<p>But then we have reports that it was Instagram's explosive growth on Android that triggered Zuckerberg's insanely fast purchase of it:<p><a href=""http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-04-14/tech/31340760_1_mark-zuckerberg-android-users-facebook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-04-14/tech/31340760...</a><p><a href=""http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/zuckerberg-did-instagram-deal-by-himself-whittled-systrom-down-from-2-billion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/zuckerberg-did-instagram...</a><p>> Two days before Zuckerberg approached Systrom, Instagram released a long-awaited version for Android-powered devices. Millions more users downloaded the free retro-styling photo app within days, adding to the already enormous iOS user base and taking it beyond the 30 million mark. Unable to wait any longer, Zuckerberg got on the phone and invited Systrom to his place. After three days of talks, the deal was done.<p>The reports would seem to indicate that it was the enormous growth Instagram experienced <i>because</i> of Android that spurred Facebook into making a fast acquisition. If Android isn't relevant anymore, that's an odd way to make the point.<p>> Android: It has been a complete and utter disaster in the tablet space.<p>This point is a little easier to support, because by all measures, Apple is dominating the tablet space. However, I don't know that it's possible to say that this is a tolling of Android's decline - Apple was dominating the smartphone space until the Nexus One, too; the N1 marked the start of the ""viable iPhone competitor"" phase of Android phones. In 2010, Android marketshare went from 9% to 42%.<p>Google is rumored to be working on a canonical ""Android Tablet"" to be released sometime this year. It'll be interesting to see what happens after it is released.<p>> The success of the Kindle Fire shows that you don't need Google's approval to create a great Android product. This is only going to lead to more companies doing the same making Android more fragmented and causing Google to lose control over its mobile operating system.<p>Android is open source, and has already been ""fragmented"" by every carrier's handset already. It's arguable that this has contributed to its growth, rather than retarding it. HTC Sense, Motorola's Motoblur, and Samsung TouchWiz are all very different facets of Android. Everyone throws around ""fragmentation"" like it's some kind of killswitch for Android. Does the author even understand what kind of fragmentation he's talking about?<p>> on the three biggest carriers in the U.S., the iPhone is outselling Android.<p>Wow, this is some shoddy reporting. ""Verizon reports that half of the phones it sold last quarter were iPhones. This means that iPhone is outselling Android on Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint, nevermind that we have no data for the latter two and the assertion is pure unsupported conjecture"". This alone should be sufficient to reject the article, but...<p>In Q42011, Verizon sold 4.3m iPhones, out of 7.7m smartphones sold (~55.8%). Q1 2012 sales were 3.2m of 6.3m, or ~50.8%. The iPhone 4s was released in Oct 2011, and each iPhone release always sees a sales spike. Given that the iPhone isn't likely to have another new release until Q4 2012, and that the iPhone's sales percentage saw a relative ~10% drop quarter over quarter, I'm not quite sure how to interpret that as ""iPhones are booming, Android is dying"".<p>Sales of the iPhone have certainly surged in the past 3 months, but at the expense of RIM and Windows phones, not Android phones.<p><a href=""http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/smartphones-account-for-half-of-all-mobile-phones-dominate-new-phone-purchases-in-the-us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/smartphone...</a><p>It's difficult to interpret this data as ""Android is dying"", when Occam would suggest ""New iPhone releases (and the subsequent price drop on older models) always have a spike effect on iPhone sales"".

Most people I know get upset spending any more $75-100/mo on a monthly transit pass, but are willing to pay $400/mo on car expenses since they ""own"" the car.  As a result, I don't think really good systems will ever emerge except for where there is massive subsidization, and even those cases suck.  For instance a few years ago when I looked San Francisco MTA had a budget of $750MM but only sold $110MM in tickets.  The only bright spot I see are company run shuttles.<p>The other problem I see is that most people appear to be irrationally scared of cycling in cities/urban areas, even though most city cycling occurs at really slow speeds.  I have been a cyclist in San Francisco for five years with only a few minor incidents.  Whenever I talk to people who aren't cyclists about commuting in the city, they often respond as if I have an impending death clock over my head.<p>For people who think cycling is a major health boon: it really isn't unless you're commuting >5mi/each way or doing a lot of climbs.

Strongly.<p>Following your dreams, not working too much, spending time with family and friends, saying what you think, and being happy, might belong at the top of Paul Graham's todo list.  He's already succeeded at what most people struggle at: making a living.  He may have forgotten that getting by is hard.<p>What's so wrong about being a ""cog in a machine""?  Large organizations exist partly because scale and specialization are useful.  People aren't ""cogs"" out of perversity, but practicality.  Sometimes your comparative advantage is in being a good cog.  And sometimes being a good cog is admirable.  Example: surgeons who specialize in one and only one procedure, doing it exactly the same way every time, have a low failure rate.  They save more lives that way.  Are they creative?  Nope.  They follow somebody else's rules.  They make themselves as mechanical, as repetitive, as possible.  And the guy on the operating table lives.<p>Paul Graham is in a <i>very unusual profession</i>, where risk-taking is much more of an ideal than it is anywhere else.  Also notice that he makes money off of telling other people to take risks.  The more people decide to be entrepreneurs, the wider a pool he has to draw from.  ""Follow your dreams"" is a useful meme for people like that; if a hundred people follow their dreams and fail and ruin their lives, PG never hears about it, but if one person follows his dreams and becomes a billionaire, PG might get a share.  This isn't meant to vilify the guy; there's nothing wrong with making a living by inspiring people.  And I'm sure he would say that he's fighting dangerous opposing memes against ever taking risks.  I just think you can't take posts like this at face value.",1335052862.0
