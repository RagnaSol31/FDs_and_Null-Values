Also, listening to my favorite music is distracting.  To concentrate when working on something difficult, it helps if I choose music according to these criteria: 1) no singing in the music, just instruments  2) listen to music I don't love, but moderately like, such as jazz, classical, or trance.  (I love vocal trance, but if I want to stay in the zone, I listen to instrumental trance).",1319417887.0

Some people might consider this a useful bit of work; some might not. I could argue that huge amount of our entertainment sector provide no value; people could just watch older material, read old books, and so on. New entertainment is generally just a rehash of older stuff anywhere, so where's the value?<p>> What the ""efficiency is killing jobs today!"" argument really comes down to is that it is a dodge by those who promoted the bad policies to blame something other than their bad policies for the unemployment, and by those who have flawed ideas about how jobs create the economy rather than the economy creating jobs.\nThis is an interesting point, because its not where I'm coming from at all. My perspective comes from the science-fiction idea of a post-scarcity society, where just about anything can be manufactured with little time or effort. This is the direction I believe we're headed, and fairly soon (whether through micro/nano-assembly, an intelligence explosion, or what have you. There's a variety of scenarios like this often considered in conjunction with the singularity and the like).<p>The problem with getting to a society where just about anyone can have just about anything is just that: getting there. When you have advanced enough assembly technology or automation that you can build a lot of stuff and replace a lot of human components of the economy, you have a lot of unemployment without having reached the point where unemployment is something that no longer matters. In that situation, without some kind of government intervention or something similar, I don't see how the people that can't find work are supposed to survive.<p>""They need to work out how to do things that people want."" Yes, this does sound glib. I'm very much short on ideas as far as what this might entail. You seem to be approaching this with the mind of an entrepreneur, who spends their time trying to do exactly that. Most people don't. I'm tempted to say a lot of people can't. They aren't going to say, ""well, I'm unemployed with no useful skills, so now I'm going to go learn to do x, because x is a growing job market."" These people don't have a clue what the best places to specialize to get a job are, or what they would need to do it. What they WILL do, however, is start complaining, or protesting, or drinking, or something similar.<p>I guess the funniest part of this is that people will try to improve themselves, to a point. I provide free computer use tutoring at a library as part of one of their programs, and I see a lot of immigrants that barely speak English and older folk that have no idea how to use a computer, that come to learn how to apply to jobs online, or send emails, or some similar computer-related task. But these people will never look at the world and say, ""what need is there out there that I can fulfill?"" The most obvious problem here being they don't even know how to determine what people would want; much less what they would do about it. Just because you may be smart enough to do this in no way means it should be applied to people in general.<p>And I'm not blaming you for this, or even turning to for an explanation; your understanding of the situation doesn't fit with mine, so I question it. And I'm not going to blame reality for the situation either. Certain European countries provide their citizens with free education, even through college; and with enough money to live on when unemployed, and they seem no worse for the wear. This seems to illustrate that it is in fact possible to have a functional market economy even when the government is effectively redistributing a certain degree of wealth for the good of society.",1319416291.0

It's this type of wording that can give life to stupid ideas such as 'you can run a business without making a profit'.<p>I also lose respect for business leaders who try and paper over their success with motherhood statements like 'I wasn't in it for the money', when clearly they enjoy the trappings of wealth.<p>People should be proud to state they are chasing a profit, proud to make profits, proud to have successful, profitable businesses.  It's impossible to make profits without providing value for other people.  Profits (for the most part, over the long run) are just a recognition that you're productive and are providing something of value.<p>My take on this particular piece is that a focus on <i>short term profits</i> is a mistake, and that a focus on long term value through great products and innovation is the right choice.  Because long term value creation should necessarily result in profits.<p>But I just wish more people would have the gumption to say 'I made a big set of money hats for myself, my investors and my employees, and I feel great about it'.",1319415986.0

However I think there is something else that has to do with technical people running their businesses that is worth mentioning.<p>Being a technical person in sales can be bloody scary, I run a software company and at the beginning I was scared to death about both sales and marketing. So much so that I would avoid it, and only do it when absolutely necessary.  Which lead to basically working on whatever came along.  Not ideal, and I was basically working for myself, with no real growth.<p>While working at a co-working space I met a fellow entrepreneur who had a sales and marketing company mainly focused on lead generation and online marketing. I hired his company to help with new messaging for our company. However this engagement quickly turned into sales coaching 101: how to build a sales funnel, effective proposal writing, understanding buying signals, targeting ideal customers, the whole works.<p>The whole time we worked through this process I was learning and understanding, and becoming less and less scared. One of the books that he recommended to me was 'Customer Centric Selling', it's a good read and I think is ideally suited to technical folks finding themselves in sales roles.  It talks about sales as a process, and not a ""who you know"" connections mystical black box. you know.. Like the VP of the 100 million dollar company wanted to do. Connections always help, but the process is there to make sure that the optimism that the sales people will undoubtedly assign to each deal can be measured and verified. I find you don't get into these situations where a sales person feeds you a loaded forecast with nothing to back it up.<p>As the founder you need to know what works for your business, and don't hire a sales person hoping they will have magical powers and be instantly able to sell your product/service. Learn and create the process yourself, then hire a sales person and have them execute and refine your process. You know your business best.
