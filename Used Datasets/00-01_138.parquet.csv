The GPU was mostly OK, but its vertex throughput always seemed rather poor, particularly if you supplied lots of vertex attributes. The CPU on the other hand was pretty fast, with short pipelines and low-latency RAM. (I was always under the impression that the Wii was at heart just a Gamecube with a higher clock speed and some extra RAM, so I figure the same principles would apply.)<p>While working on this game, I got some code that a colleague wrote for another product to pre-generate all the GPU commands offline, so things could be drawn with 0% CPU overhead.
