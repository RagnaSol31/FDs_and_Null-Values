It will only do it tactically insofar it helps the business. It will cut any resemblance of balance or benefits when it can justify. A company is not set up as a societal institution.

Brown snakes 99% of the time hear you coming and all you see is them taking off at high speed away from you. Death adders on the other hand lie still waiting for their prey to come to them so don’t move. Since they are camouflaged that can be really hard to spot in the leaf litter. When I would go exploring in the bush around my home I would always take my dog and make him lead the way - he would bark and let me know if a death adder was up ahead. Of course there were a very high rate of false alarms (goannas mostly), but I would rather a 100 false positives than have one false negative bite me.",1439686439.0

Establishing that there seems to be a decided minimum effort required to educate a child to any degree; but that past that point there are examples of other countries having /more/ success with less funding spent (than the US).<p>I think more granularity of data in that statistic would be useful; is this money actually being spent on the child or is it instead being squandered within a bureaucratic structure?
