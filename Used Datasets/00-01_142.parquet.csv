You can run anything you like, and it's fast and lightweight. We start our virtual machines in less than a second, and all traces are gone as soon as computation is complete.<p>Our first demo (live at ubalo.com) lets you enter arbitrary code (currently in Ruby, soon also in Python and R) and see the results immediately; your code runs in a secure, protected container.<p>Next week we'll be pushing more features to the public, but we want you to break and comment on them first. Drop us an email (https://ubalo.com/signups/new) and we'll add you to our priority list - licenses start coming out next week.<p>We're looking for high quality examples for our front page.

By that I mean, he/she only needs to talk to 1 or 2 people in order to make a decision. A small company has this sort of environment naturally but a ""big"" company can somewhat duplicate it by having a small team with a great manager.<p>The reality is that large companies tend to have organizational reasons not to hire the sort of people that they <i>say</i> they want. \nFor example:<p>They express the desire to hire the top 1% but of course they can't or don't want to <i>pay</i> a salary in the top 1% - perhaps they've never paid that much for a developer or maybe it wouldn't be fair to the less talented or more exploited devs already on the payroll.<p>They <i>say</i> they want ""smart people that get things done"" but they aren't prepared to give them someplace quiet to think or resources they need.<p>Heck, sometimes it seems like HR's job is to keep the best people out. Do they really want someone exceptional even brilliant? ""Oh no, we couldn't hire him, he doesn't have a degree.""",1321574400.0
