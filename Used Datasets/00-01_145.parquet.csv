Some of this money may yield patents. A liquid market means that a company can take some of these patents (which may be worth nothing in an illiquid market) and convert them into cash. Liquidity increases return on a firm's investment into R&D and so may have the consequence of incentivizing corporate research spending.,1275439381.0

That said...]<p>> <i>Optics is, more or less, a solved problem. We hit hard physical limits long ago.</i><p>This is only true for cameras which are designed around a principle of light passing through a “generalized pinhole” (i.e. go through a lens and are collected as a two-dimensional image in a single frame at the back, without doing any fancy math; the kind of set-up required by, for instance, a process based around film or our current types of digital sensors).<p>Look to biology though for inspiration and it quickly becomes clear that visual information can be captured in all kinds of ways, with all kind of crazy “eye” designs.<p>There’s a huge amount of information stored in the light rays passing through a camera which is currently not captured, and the cameras of a few decades from now will blast through all of those “hard physical limits”. We’re going to get much better approximations of actual light spectra coming in, along with information about polarization and distance to the subject; simulate any lens, any aperture, any focal length in software because all of the relevant data will be captured. (In my dreams, anyway, or even maybe my somewhat-informed guesses; we’ll see how well technology actually advances.)<p>Anyway though, our typical current digital cameras don’t even hit the limits given the traditional/obvious camera design approach: for instance, we currently have three different colors of pixels each of which filters out a different set of wavelengths, meaning we are only capturing a “third” of the information we need to make a metameric match from each point, and just tossing out a bunch of the other photons. That right there is worth a something like 2x improvement in data captured per area.<p>One last thing: even before we get crazier camera designs, improvements in computer processing speed are going to make it possible to create high-resolution images out of an image captured over time (i.e. a movie processed into a still): we can see the beginnings of this already with those panoramic cameras I’ve been seeing TV commercials for.",1275437894.0

I can manage my schedule, I've no boss, damn I'm my own boss. I can choose who I work with and I get to meet very cool people all around the world. Unlike being stuck in a office, with people that you probably don't even like. Also, I can work in any place in the world, as long as I have a computer + internet connection. Take that you in-house Senior Software Engineer (just kidding)<p>- However, isolation is your worst enemy, you better have friends you can hang out with at the end of the day, or this can really be a very lonely life.<p>Organization, you MUST BE FREAKING organized, you must really know you. You need to record everything, working hours, projects timelines. To-do lists will help you a lot on this. Always create for the next day before you go to bed.<p>Freelancing is great, but there will be times where you will have no projects and no money getting in. So put aside money enough for you to live for at least 4 to 6 month. Have a network of friends who do also freelance, we trade a lot of projects and it's a great help. You can also create a product but just remember that this takes time, and time is money.<p>Forget bidding boards, really, get the hell out of there. Do you really want to value yourself/compete against to some guy who codes for less than $10 an hour ?\nInstead, find job boards, contact clients directly, just don't spam anyone.\nIf you are good at this, look at yourself as a brand, have a a great portfolio, brand yourself, and price yourself for how good you are. You may not get that ""I need a wordpress ninja for custom plugin"", but if you are good at it  you  can get much more reliable clients, and by reliable I include, awesome connections, work, steady projects and cool apps to build.<p>Last but not least...<p>Instead of trying to be a swiss army knife, focus on what you are really good, and apply yourself, and be the best you can.

This brings in more money (in a harder currency), keeps more of that money in the domestic economy, and also allows the government to inflate away some domestic debt as the economy improves by raising interest rates.<p>None of these options are available to euro members, any more than they are to individual US states. So to repair their state balance sheets in a federal monetary environment, they must make politically unpalatable like raising taxes or cutting services, and don't have much flexibility in terms of repricing their external trade. That means pissy voters and a somewhat slower recovery, because trade gains must come from either reductions in base costs or improvements in quality, both of which are harder to realize than to talk about.<p>On the other hand, these latter things represent fundamental economic improvements, whereas currency revaluation is something of a sleight-of-hand that taxes people indirectly and leads to inflation. But for a politician, that's highly preferable to telling the voters that they are likely to get less and pay more. So, less fun and freedom for euro-zone politicians who have to implement austerity programs and persuade their electorate to deal with financial reality, but (in my opinion) better for their economies over the longer term, as they'll make needed reforms while the Czech Republic and Poland only go through the motions of doing so and carry forward their structural problems.<p>Sorry that 'summary' is so long - not much of a time saving :-/",1275437429.0

Of course this will be proved wrong in time but, I don't think that current desktop apps, /just written for parallel/, will ever use 50 cores.",1275437182.0
