Sure it'll kill the infection, but it could well kill you too.<p>Go nuclear, it's the lesser of the evils. Existing infrastructure can be cannibalized for it (access to roadways, rail or river, cooling pools, cooling towers, etc.) even if the power plant itself cannot be. Furthermore, the totality of all nuclear accidents <i>in the world</i> has caused less deaths than coal soot alone. Disregard the fact that coal contains radioactive compounds that are being vaporised and inhaled.<p>Interestingly, I know here in Canada at least, that many of the nuclear plants have become their own sort of nature preserve.",1288832374

I screwed up HS to the point where no good university would accept me, and spent 18-20 doing web dev and not really growing.  I realized I had to get out of there.<p>My advice: go to whatever 4-year, brick and mortar university will accept you and WORK HARD to prove your HS transcript is not an accurate assessment of your abilities.  Live on campus.  Then transfer to the best school you can that's going to give you the most opportunities for growth.  I ended up at a big research university where you could get involved in research as an undergrad, and loved it.<p>Another thing: hang out with the right people.  I think people, to a certain extent, are just a product of their peer group.  If you're surrounded by smart, motivated people, it's going to rub off on you.<p>If you have a choice, I'd recommend not starting at a community college.  It's harder.

Nasdaq had just broken its own record, hitting 5,048, \n  and the majority of investors thought the dot-com phenomenon would last\n  forever. \n\n  Peter, however, privately disagreed, believing that the dot-com era was \n  going to crash spectacularly very soon. He already realized what the\n  market came to know shortly thereafter: There was very little substance to the\n  majority of dot-com “superstars.” Nonetheless, he capitalized on the\n  opportunity presented to him, raising $100 Million to fund these hard times\n  for PayPal, closing this large deal in only three weeks. The closing was\n  March 31, 2000. This was critical as the very next day, the Nasdaq began\n  its famous freefall, crumbling by 67% in less than 18 months!

Good companies have revenue of $1M/year per employee. Great companies have _profits_ of $1M/year per employee. Do you think you contributed $1M to your company's bottom line last year?<p>Remember that the goal of all for-profit companies is to generate profit, and that profit is either returned to its shareholders (known as dividends) or re-invested in the company with the hopes of raising the value of the company (and hence the share price). You can get a piece of that pie by taking your hard-earned money and investing in the company you work for. Some companies even let you do this at a reduced price (stock options) or, if you're lucky, include a stock award as part of your compensation. If you're not a shareholder, you shouldn't expect to see any part of the profit: you haven't taken on the risk of investing in the company. (Yes, some companies do have profit sharing as part of their compensation, but that's typically a different way of saying ""you get a bonus if we can afford it."")<p>Granted, many of these concepts are non-existant when you're working for a start-up (where generating revenue, let alone profit, is stalled for months or even years), but the end goal is the same.",1288829053
