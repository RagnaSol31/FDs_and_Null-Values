It's the absolute engine of your business.<p>If you're writing a B2C app, doesn't matter about the platform, then what biz is there to dev? In a similar sense, you need marketers, not salesmen, because your problem is  getting a call-to-action out to your potential market as effectively and efficiently as possible. You can't do that door-to-door at scale.<p>But if you're doing enterprise software, the converse is true.

Not really, that Carbon becomes the plant itself.  The amount of C's that a plant pulls out of the CO_2's is nearly equivalent to the plant's dead weight.  This is important to understand, because old growth forests don't actually remove net CO_2 from the atmosphere, they just fail to release it.  If you cut down the forest, the dead plant matter starts decomposing and/or burning and then CO_2 and/or methane goes back into the atmosphere.<p>Or at least, that's how I understand it.",1286326592.0

Years ago, people generally just had to survive by doing whatever it was that provided for their families.  They grew crops, raised animals or hunted, and some were craftsmen.

21,1762244,comment,1761530.0,1761530.0,0,0,shadowsun7,,,"This isn't accurate. Most of this is true, but not for the reasons the thread author gave in his piece.<p>Why should a business/non-technical founder learn to code? The answer to this is simple: so that you have better ideas. Or, put another way: learning to code gives you the ability to <i>implement</i> your ideas. And implementing your ideas forces you to recognize, after some time, what works and what doesn't.<p>Hackers who start their own projects tend to have a framework in their heads for figuring out which ideas are good/may work, and which ideas won't. And they know this because they've failed enough times to figure out what isn't good for a project. Whereas most business 'wantrepreneurs' I know don't have that. They don't have that because they've never implemented anything, and so how do they know if their idea's a good one or not?<p>It's interesting to note that you don't have to learn to program to get this framework in your head. Learning to program is simply the most efficient (and cheapest!) way of doing it. Prominent counter-examples come to mind: Steve Jobs never really learned to code, but he grew up in the valley, and chose to mix around with hackers (Malcolm Gladwell, in his book <i>Outliers</i> points out that as a teenager Jobs approached the CEO of HP to ask for parts). So it's probably safe to assume Jobs absorbed such a framework by osmosis - spend enough time around people who make product and you begin to see for yourself what works, and what doesn't.<p>Jason Fried has also been brought up in this HN thread. And I suspect that it's no different for him: Fried is no programmer (though he's a web designer). But he was willing to pay people to implement his ideas. He paid DHH, after all, to build Basecamp. And that's another hack - you don't need programming ability to learn the framework - in this particular case all you need is implementation (which you can pay for). And if the project fails, you learn from it. Either way you gain things to add to your internal framework. (Derek Sivers also springs to mind - he hired contract programmers to build CDBaby, if I'm not mistaken).<p>Gaining that framework for sussing out ideas is likely to be the most important reason a non-technical founder should learn to code. Because it's going to help in so many little ways - you learn to detect technical bullshit, you gain a feel for what features to implement when and why, you attract better programming talent - because how else are you able to attract co-founders if you reek of incompetence and/or naivety?",1286325974.0

83,1762180,comment,1761984.0,1762113.0,0,0,grellas,,,"Excellent points.<p>I'll add a few points from a California law perspective:<p>This is one area of trade secrets law that often catches employees by surprise. Most employees who have substantial contact with customers (e.g., those doing sales) merely assume that the information relating to those customers belongs to them. In the past, they used to keep such information in a day book, today perhaps on some electronic device. As such employees interact with the customer representatives, they often develop close relationships with them, sometimes becoming personal friends, etc. From this, they come to assume that this network of contacts is a personal asset that they can take with them wherever they go for future business purposes.<p>The law sees it differently, however, even in California where restrictive covenants are normally highly disfavored. The legal theory is generally as follows: as long as an employer pays the salary of the person who is interacting with its customers, the information gleaned from those contacts - to the extent it is not otherwise publicly available in convenient form - becomes confidential, proprietary information belonging to the employer. This can sometimes include the identity of the customer itself, though not when it is widely known in the industry who such customers are. Even in such cases, however, the particulars associated with those accounts - i.e., the names and contact information of actual customer representatives, information relating to a customer's buying needs or to pricing or to any similar item that is or may be valuable for an employer to know concerning the relevant market and which is <i>not</i> publicly available - do tend to be treated as employer-owned confidential information and any former employee who attempts to use such information to the competitive disadvantage of the former employer can potentially be sued for misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition. The theory is that the employer makes a significant investment in assembling such information by paying the salaries of its sales team and the like and no employee should simply be able to rip it off for nothing and use it competitively against the employer who paid to assemble it. This is where many employees miss the point: they see their contacts as belonging to them (""these are my customers"") when in reality they may be quite restricted in what they can do with such information as long as they obtained it while being paid a salary by some employer.<p>Of course, in traditional sales and similar areas, the lines tended to blur in economic reality. For example, an employer hires an experienced sales person in x industry. The very purpose of doing so is to gain the benefit of that persons substantial contacts. When that sales person is hired, the customer information he brings with him does <i>not</i> become the property of the employer simply because he happens to have gotten that job - indeed, all such information continues to belong to him and is merely being made available for the benefit of his employer during the term of the employment. On the other hand, if that very person then works for a decade in that position and thereby obtains a much expanded set of customer information because of things done on that job, that expanded information set can be treated as proprietary information belonging to the employer. Thus, in theory at least, once that employee leaves that job, he can freely use all his pre-employment customer information but may well be restricted in using the information he learned while employed on that particular job.<p>One can posit all sorts of variations on this arrangement by which complications are injected (e.g., if someone is an independent sales agent and not an employee, who owns the information? or if an employer makes the information company-wide on a database without placing special restrictions on who can use and for what purpose, is it still to be regarded as ""confidential""?). The lines can easily blur, making it hard for an employer to claim that certain information is ""proprietary"" and belongs to the employer.<p>In our modern, inter-connected world, LinkedIn and similar services have created a real problem for employers seeking to enforce these traditional restrictions on an ex-employee's use of customer contact information, in some cases making it virtually impossible for an employer to stop such contacts.<p>This piece discusses some of the legal attempts being made by employers to block use of LinkedIn, etc. as a way of making contacts with customer representatives of the former employer. Basically, such services have thrown this area of law into chaos and this is the employers' attempts to restore control consistent with the past practices of a much less inter-connected world, i.e., to use contract language as a way of <i>legally</i> reasserting control over a situation that was practically out of control.<p>In states like California, this is likely a losing fight but perhaps not so much in other states where restrictive covenants are more strongly upheld. It will be interesting to see how this develops over time.",1286324387.0

You see, by entering the password, you are demonstrating that you have access to the encrypted information, and demonstrating that you have that power is technically self-incrimination. The password is one piece of information that you can't be compelled to divulge, and <i>the fact that you have the password</i> is a separate piece of information, and you cannot be compelled to reveal either. This is also a really important piece of information too, because in order to stick you with any legal consequences associated with the encrypted information, they generally have to prove that you have control over or access to the information. If a file is encrypted it is still possible to reasonably  doubt that you have access to its contents despite having access to the physical drive it is on.<p>While it is (currently, as far as I am aware) untested in the court of law, it <i>may</i> be possible to compel someone to use or divulge their password if this does not incriminate the person to do this. I can think of two ways this could happen: a) access/control to the encrypted information has already been proven, so the testimony is of null value b) the prosecution is not allowed to use the fact that you know the password in court, and takes the gamble that they can prove access/control some other way (possibly by using contents of the information).<p>This is, of course, assuming that passwords are classified as ""testimony"" and therefore protected by the 5th Amendment. If the password is ever recorded on a physical medium such as a piece of paper, that piece of paper is probably not testimony, but rather evidence. This means that, like the key to a safe, it is protected by the 4th Amendment rather than the 5th, and you can be compelled to give up the paper via a warrant. This presents quite a quandary in deciding which is more secure: a 16-character semi-mnemonic memorizable sequence, or a 128-character random sequence that must be stored on a USB stick?<p>(IANAL, but I've studied the topic as a layman)",1286323871.0

I could really benefit from a tool like this but Linux seems to be lacking in this department unfortunately.,1286323499.0

Rails is a framework that is much larger than Ruby the language, so understanding why certain things work the way they do is a very important part of learning it.<p>I feel particular empathy for you because I absolutely <i>hated</i> the 'Agile Web Development with rails book' too.<p>Here's my suggestion ... Get 'Simply Rails 2' (I'm assuming the project you're working on is in Rails 2 not 3) ... work through it, then move on to 'The Rails Way' by Obie Fernandez.<p>If you're really serious about it, getting through the first one should set you up for success ... Obie's book will take a while go go through, because you're going to keep reading and re-reading things as you code.",1286323491.0

In the finals, we had investors offering us as much as $50,000 on the spot (which was the coolest feeling).  We didn't accept any money because we felt we weren't ready to, which was good because the business dematerialized due to internal struggles.  The main guy was the stupid idea, no tech knowledge type and thought he ran everything and was the reason we were getting traction (when all he did was sit around thinking up dumb ideas that the rest of us refined, curated, and implemented).",1286323214.0
