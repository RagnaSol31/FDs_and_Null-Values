Likewise, a sale or IPO aren't the only ways to derive value out of the startup, but they're the ones that get the most focus, because they're the fastest way to get the desired results (lots of money). I think that this point of view was pretty clear in several of the talks at SS08.<p>Do I necessarily think that that's the only kind of ""startup"" that exists? No, not at all.
