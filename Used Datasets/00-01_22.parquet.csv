But it only made sense just because the technology catered to that solution. It may be the case that, as with computer technology, market and materials drive costs of solar technology to zero. Then you might have peer cooperatives set up for sharing the load of home power consumption. Panels might become so cheap that whole neighborhoods go off the grid, or install their own distribution system. Decentralization of power generation becomes more economical than centralized power generation.<p>I watched some alternative energy documentary one time that had one of the contributors suggesting that half of all the roofs in Cali would have to be covered with panels to take care of the state's power needs. Uh well, ok.",1248569995

He also used thousands of other forms of Middle English that have long since passed into oblivion. Remember that Chaucer wrote in the <i>1300s</i>, when, for example, the word ""knave"" meant, simply, ""young boy."" A lot has changed since then. Relying on Chaucer as authority, then, is a real stretch.<p>Setting aside Chaucer, only scattered evidence exists of ""they"" being used to refer to a singular antecedent.<p>In Indo-European languages generally, the principle of <i>concord</i> is thoroughly ingrained - singular nouns, for example, need to be matched with singular verb forms and plural with plural. This is a transcending principle that is central to the grammar of all Indo-European languages.<p>For this reason, it <i>is</i> jarring to our ears to hear, for example, ""Sally went to the store and, after shopping, they [instead of she] returned home"". It is like saying, ""Sally are a liar."" Both violate the rule of concord and plainly sound jarring and illiterate.<p>In the strong pull to abandon the synechdoche of using ""he"" as a part representing the whole (of any form of singular antecedent), modern grammarians are really straining to find an alternative (as is the point of this article), but using ""they"" to represent the singular is such a blatant violation of the principle of concord that it will not fly as ""good English"" unless one is prepared to undermine a principle that affects not only pronoun usage but lies at the heart of grammar generally.",1248569460
3,723900,comment,723486.0,723677.0,0,0,defen,,,"The copy of ""The Age of Gold"" by H.W. Brands sitting in front of me says you are wrong about married women's property in 1850's California.  From the soft cover, pg. 283, regarding the constitutional convention held in Monterey in 1849:<p>`A proposal to permit women to keep control of their property upon marrying led to discussion of the relative merits of the common-law and civil-law traditions.  ""I am not wedded either to the common law or the civil law"", observed Halleck, ""nor, as yet, to a woman; but having some hopes that some time or other I may be wedded, and wishing to avoid the fate of my friend from San Francisco [a crotchety old misogynist], I shall advocate this section in the constitution, and I would call upon all the bachelors in this convention to vote for it.""  Enough did to win the measure's approval.`<p>So unless there was a constitutional amendment created a few years after the constitution itself that I'm not aware of, married women actually <i>were</i> allowed to keep their property in California.  Indeed, the text from the original 1849 constitution states, in part:<p>`Sec. 14. All property, both real and personal, of the wife, owned or claimed by marriage, and that acquired afterwards by gift, devise, or descent, shall be her separate property; and laws shall be passed more clearly defining the rights of the wife, in relation as well to her separate property as to that held in common with her husband. Laws shall also be passed providing for the registration of the wife's separate property.`",1248569220

By my reading none of them say anything of the sort.<p>All the results I know of don't apply to computers any more than they do to humans, who reason no less algorithmically than computers (even if our algorithms are currently more subtle); these results tend to say that certain magic cannot be performed without invoking new classes of computation, which has absolutely no bearing on whether computers can do the type of practical research humans have been engaging in for our entire history.",1248569085

This time, I'll source myself and provide links to official statistics and the actual law this time, as you're mistaken on a few counts.<p>> 1) ...The validity of a prenuptial agreement is measured at the time it was signed, unless extraordinary circumstances justify re-evaluating it at the time of divorce...<p>This is simply not true. For instance, here's the California legal code:<p>""Any provision in a premarital agreement regarding spousal support, including, but not limited to, a waiver of it, is not enforceable... if the provision regarding spousal support is unconscionable at the time of enforcement.""<p>California Family Code, Section 1612.7, part c. Convenient link here:<p><a href=""http://law.justia.com/california/codes/fam/1610-1617.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law.justia.com/california/codes/fam/1610-1617.html</a><p>That hinges on the word ""unconscionable""? In the real, practical world, that means that SUBJECTIVELY THE JUDGE DOESN'T THINK IT'S RIGHT BASED ON AMERICAN VALUES. Yes, that's actually how it goes.<p>Edit: Here's the legal definition and some discussion of unconscionable for curious people. Practically, it leaves it up the judge's... conscience. Subjective.<p><a href=""http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Unconscionable"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Unconscionable</a><p>> 2) Spousal support -- does not include money for the children.<p>Correct. If the woman sues for full custody, and gets it, she gets more than equalization of income. Therefore, pressing for full custody and no father's custody rights = more money. Big problem.<p>> Interlude: Nas. Nas is a millionaire. He had a kid, with a woman, and lived a lavish lifestyle. B/c of that, on divorce, his wife and kid get to continue living a lavish lifestyle via alimony (wife's standard of living during marriage) and child support (child's standard of living during marriage).<p>Right, I think that's crazy. He had her to host parties for him, cook for him, keep the home, help him keep his finances. All of that is gone. His quality of living will go down, it is shot, he no longer receives enjoyment of having his child around to play with when he comes home from a hard day. She's used to living a $150,000 per month lifestyle and thus deserves to keep it? He's used to having a supportive wife behind him, that keeps the home, that helps, that he can bounce ideas off of. That's gone. He should pay her close to $2 million a year because it'd be a shame for her quality of life to go down while his is getting shot up? The system is crazy.<p>> Lesson to learn: If you're rich, live a normal lifestyle and you won't pay (relatively) much in support.<p>So then you live modesty, and save, and invest, and the assets are split 50/50 if you divorce instead. Not much better.<p>> 5) The divorce rate for...<p>A lot of the statistics overlap and there's a lot of noise there, but divorce rates are high here. For instance, ""The National Center for Health Statistics recently released a report which found that 43 percent of first marriages end in separation or divorce within 15 years. The study is based on\nthe National Survey of Family Growth, a nationally representative sample of women age 15 to 44 in 1995. Bramlett, Matthew and William Mosher. ""First marriage dissolution, divorce, and remariage: United States,"" Advance Data From Vital and Health Statistics; No.323. Hyattsville\nMD: National Center for Health Statistics: 2 1.<p><a href=""http://www.divorcereform.org/rates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.divorcereform.org/rates.html</a> (first one in Google for ""divorce rates"", looks relatively unbiased and cites sources)<p>The divorce rates are high in the States. Subjectively, I think it'd be a good thing if they were lower and would lead to more individual happiness and a stronger society on the whole. You can debate how high the rates are when controlling for certain statistics, but they're clearly really way too damn high (again, in my subjective judgment).<p>> 5) Harsh divorce laws discourage divorce.<p>Yes and no. Harsh divorce laws against both partners discourage divorce. Harsh divorce laws against one gender increase divorce. One quick and dirty way to figure out which side a country's divorce laws are slanted is to look at who initiates divorce proceedings by gender.<p>United States? Over 2/3rds initiated by women. It's close to 70%.<p><a href=""http://health.discovery.com/centers/loverelationships/articles/divorce.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://health.discovery.com/centers/loverelationships/articl...</a><p>I tried searching divorce rates by country to find the statistics for you, but I couldn't find a link - so this is going off personal recall, but I remember seeing some crystal clear statistics. Divorce rates close to 50/50 in much of Continentinal Europe, slanted 70/30 men in many Islamic countries, and 70/30 women in the USA and UK. Those are just numbers - but my subjective judgment call? Things are messed up here. I ended my original comment with a statement that wasn't quite right. I'll amend it:<p>If the laws were made less brutal <i>to men</i>, I think you'd see more people marrying, marrying at an earlier age, having more children, and paradoxically - I think the divorce rate would go down.",1248567732
