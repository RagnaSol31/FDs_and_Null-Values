I can tell you were building financial models for a living, because you think ROI is the most important question for entrepreneurs ;-)<p>For startups, the most important things are good products and good markets. Successful angels and VCs know that, and will invest based on product and growth, NOT financial metrics. Thus, in very few VC pitches will you ever see stats on ROI or payback rate, that's more something you'd seen in the accounting or I-banking world. (I know this from personal experience, having spent the last year at a silicon valley based VC and seeing dozens of pitches)<p>So if entrepreneurs are primarily focused in the world of products, features, etc., then the key thing is to figure out the metrics that measure how these products tie to external market value. So things like conversion rates in funnels or cost per acquisition become super important, because the features are the steering wheel to your revenue engine. As a result, the spreadsheet model is mostly focused on things that are granular enough to relate to product and functionality, rather than things like valuation multiples or ROI or other overly-broad financial metrics.",1232412538.0

I had an Apple Store some 20 minutes away from my home, and I asked if I could just bring in my broken laptop and walk home with a new one. Less hassle for everyone. Nope.

That's the up-front investment required - VC, loans or digging into your own pocket.<p>So that's the first important yet unanswered question: what is the up-front investment before the business can sustain itself?<p>The second is to calculate the ROI for the above investment, but with a twist: calculate the average ROI at every time period, taking into account all periods before the period being calculated for, but ignoring all future periods.  This will provide you with a very important result: you will see that the average ROI remains negative long after your business becomes profitable.  You will also see in which time period your ROI reaches an acceptable level - a very important factor when risk is considered.<p>Yes, it's just a model driven by assumptions.
