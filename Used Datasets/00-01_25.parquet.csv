Hardcore programmers might deny it but interface design is as important to most software as the database structure, code architecture and algorithms. You can hardly call yourself a software developer if you are unable to develop a key part of software.<p>I am a programmer first and foremost (well, strictly speaking, a journalist first and foremost, but I won't go into that) and used to be terrible at design. But I worked at it, completing tutorials at sites like psdtuts.com and trying to keep up with the latest design trends at showcase sites such as webcreme.com. It was a couple of years before I could create anything I was happy with, but now I design all my software, and I have to say that it is so much more fun turning your own interface ideas into code, than doing it for someone else's ideas.",1242435161

Use this as a starting design.<p>2 - Read smashing magazine for typography and layout tips.... actually just read it all the time. It's a great resource.<p>3 - As with code design, keep your interface simple. Initially avoid gimmicks through JS, just make something that is clean and works.<p>4 - Release the best interface you can to your users and ask for feedback. Some users offer great feed back others don't. Don't be afraid to ignore some feedback but most feedback has a kernel of truth to it.<p>5 - As with code, iterate quickly and ask for more feedback.<p>6 - Don't ever think you can't design, everyone starts somewhere, everyone makes mistakes. Stop procrastinating and get on with it.<p>7 - Sometimes there is necessary complexity. Apple are famous for simplicity but if you've ever used Final Cut Pro you will know that complex things are actually complex.<p>Good luck.",1242434862

40,611616,comment,611511.0,611511.0,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"pg has frequently suggested ""simple"" as a substitute for ""good"", using Google as an example.  I think this is the best you can do, in the short term, if you don't have a designer that shares your vision.  Tweaking simple designs is much easier than tweaking complex ones, so if you do simple now, when you have a few thousand dollars to spend on a good designer, you won't have to undo what you've done in the meantime.<p>I've actually found that easier said than done, in a very large, very mature, codebase.  The more functionality your software offers, the harder it becomes to make the UI simple.  I've spent some time learning about design and UX in the past couple of years, diverting some of my mental resources over to the task (the only new programming language I've learned in that time is JavaScript, but I've also learned a lot about UI, user testing, making gradients and buttons, grid systems, CSS, browser bugs, etc.).  There is enough programming to keep it challenging, and enough new tools involved to give me (a lifetime nerd with an affinity for how computers and software work) a relative advantage over creative folks just starting out with design for the web.  I've been avoiding admitting to myself that one of my primary roles in the company is design...but it's become that by necessity.  I finally broke down and bought the Adobe CS4 Web Design Premium bundle, so I have the same tools all the real designers are using.",1242432780

PC/mac is one of these; but there's also vi/emacs, Windows/Linux, programming languages, and even Holden/Ford (apparently). The so-called religious wars, that tend to bring out emotions. Probably because people identify with the product, and so any perceived slight is taken as a personal attack, therefore there's a wish to defend against it or to counter-attack, grabbing whatever means are available.<p>I've noticed that I've strayed into the area myself: without realizing it, I've used Mac/PC to make a point (about integrated hardware/software vs. modular components - the former is needed in the earlier years. It's an idea from Clayton Christianson, of the innovator's dilemma fame.) I wasn't attacked, but I got some odd responses... eventually I realized that it's just a touchy subject.

It can be a rough experience, and is not for the risk-averse. It's also not as easy to work at a startup, because your duties are less well defined, and doing a bad job has a real impact on the company's bottom line. If you want to do the same thing day in, day out, nine to five, you need to work for a big company.<p>At Startup House we believe that internships at startups can be just as rewarding as internships at big companies, for individuals who are interested in challenging themselves and thinking on their feet. Startups typically do not offer the same sort of side benefits to interns (corporate apartments, structured mentorship, events for interns, having a community of interns), and that's where Startup House comes in.<p>Startups, for many, offer more interesting opportunities, such as the ability to work closely with management. Startup House makes working for a startup even more attractive by providing the side benefits of an internship, community, events, activities, housing (limited by availability - and a lot more fun than living on your own), and dinners with entrepreneurs.<p>Our program is meant for those who would be interested in startups anyway. We seek out individuals who demonstrate an interest in technology, entrepreneurship, and enjoying life, in order to build a supportive community of interns across multiple startups.
