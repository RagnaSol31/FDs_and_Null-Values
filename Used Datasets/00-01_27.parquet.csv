Or they might conceive of it like a movie, with a Hollywood-style marketing push. Or it might be treated as ""entertainment software,"" with a focus on having the best technology and the most features. All of these are not really correct, but we can fool ourselves into thinking they're correct because entities outside of the industry(namely, IP owners and other hardware/software manufacturers) will bring their money and their world-view/assumptions to the table, and through sheer trial and error game devs have found a few ways to satisfy these stakeholders and make something that can potentially turn a profit, even though the historical record indicates that the ""value"" the stakeholders brought to the table usually wasn't a contributing factor in the biggest hits.<p>But once you start down that path, the top-down directive forces the development team to start doing unnatural things that work against product viability and realistic ship dates. Soon, everyone's dissatisfied and it just becomes a hellhole where the team works as individuals, takes their paychecks, and ""looks out for number one."" But a lot of people want to work in the industry, and they'll take bad money over no money.<p>It's the same problem as in startups as a whole - find an original, scalable game concept. Work on making it marketable. Then you can start spending big to make a refined, feature-heavy implementation.",1279933183.0

If you view the ""Custom"" install of Xcode, there are five parts:<p>1. Essentials (1.75GB)<p>2. System tools (56.8MB)<p>3. UNIX Dev Support (563.7MB)<p>4. Documentation (Zero KB - sic! More seriously, it's a download at next boot, hence zero KB of stuff is installed immediately from the disc. Why they don't report the size of the later download, I don't know.)<p>5. Mac OS X 10.4 Support  (Zero KB - again, sic!)<p>By default, 1-4 are selected and 5 is deselected. But here's where it gets interesting: you can <i>only</i> deselect 2-5 manually. 1 is a must. Care to guess where Xcode lives?<p>Here's how Apple describes ""Essentials"":<p>> <i>Installs Xcode, Interface Builder, Instruments, Dashcode, Quartz Composer, GCC 4.0.1, GCC 4.2.1, llvm-gcc 4.2.1, GDB, and other developer tools. Also installs the Mac OS X 10.5 and Mac OS X 10.6 SDKs. All content is placed inside a location chosen by the user (default is /Developer on the boot volume).</i><p>I feel like John Belushi in the old ""All I wanted was a pony, but nooooooooo"" skit.",1279929783.0

The difference, I believe, is that re2 doesn't support backtracking, which changes the worst-case time from linear growth to exponential growth on the input length. (For the snobs, that means that re2 regexes are regular expressions. Python's aren't.)",1279929773.0
