So to take an example from a googler at a recent conference say you have an online store that has a bunch of categories.  Someone wants to buy a red bag and they go through bags then to red and pick item 5.\n/bags/red/5<p>Someone else goes to red things then bags than item 5\n/red/bags/5<p>You end up with duplicate content issues and the possibility of having your search engine score split between the two pages.<p>With canonical you can say on both pages that /items/5 is the real url and thats the one that will get the search score + be indexed most likely.,1239581079.0

I ranked highish on an IQ test book, 130-150 (however reliable that is).<p>I love your hypothesis of what IQ measures, though unfortunately I don't think it's true. But do I think the ""skill of breaking down problems"" is one thing that actual accomplishment measures. It also seems to me that even a 230 IQ person is limited to what they can grasp instantly, if they lack this skill. Perhaps if their high IQ removes their motivation for acquiring this skill, it might explain why the accomplishments of some high IQ folk aren't commensurate with their IQ.<p>230 IQ sounds awesome, but just what can such a person grasp at once?<p>Is it like someone with very long legs, so a step for them is a giant leap for anyone else...? If so, it isn't much good if they can't string steps together. If they can't combine their steps, a crawling baby will effortlessly outdistance them.",1239580980.0
