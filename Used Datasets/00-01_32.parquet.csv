1,1053974,comment,1053614.0,1053747.0,0,0,robotrout,,,"At the risk of hemoraging more karma, let me make the following observations.<p>1) The MMR study consists of 288 children, 192 of which were hand-picked to match 96 autistic children.  It strikes me that for a condition that is diagnosed in 1 out of 120  children, a population of 300 children is a bit sparse.  Is that blasphemy?<p>2) The MMR study (which the other high karma poster is also quoting, it's the same study) is, after all, an MMR study.  That means that of the 30 or so shots <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/downloads/child/2010/10_0-6yrs-schedule-pr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/downloads/child/2...</a> that a child is forced to undergo in the US by age 6, the Measles-Mumps-Rubella shot has been shown apparently (with a sample size of 288 kids) not to correlate with autism.  I'm not sure why MMR was singled out, but for many of us, it's not any one vaccine that's the issue, nor is it thimerosal (although I'm glad it's out of there), it's the sheer number of them and how fast they are imposed on young bodies.  Many more of them, I may add, than when you were a kid.<p>I feel that you are not going to be swayed from your position that all is well in vaccination land.  I wonder if you have children.  When you have a new son (boys are diagnosed at a rate of 1 in 70) we'll see if you aren't more willing to be critical of one or two studies that are quoted so often it seems like there are 50.<p>My original point still stands.  Fund a study of non-vaccinated children.  They exist.  I have two of them.  Compare their autism rate against the general population.  Use a sample size that is actually meaningful, and you'll shut up Jenny McCarthy, and you'll let me sleep easier as well.",1263516806.0

I ran a BBS, then stopped coding and did marketing in the entertainment industry for 10 years, then went right into IT security.

Why then does this earthquake mean that we should fix Haiti's water/sewage. Why not fix Somalia's instead?<p>Given the comments about Haiti's resources it seems it should be quite rich monetarily, certainly enough to pay for the rapid construction of Hospitals and the like. Yes, we'd want to help with skilled workers if sufficient don't exist locally for the timescales sought.<p>I don't think (hope) that the parent is saying we shouldn't help Haiti, just asking why only help them or help them in preference to others that are suffering as much.",1263513931.0

For one, the suffering has been universally afflicted on all Haitians. This will strengthen their bond more than anything. Even if warlords and gangs form their own fiefdoms throughout the country, the humanitarian efforts, whenever they're ready a year or ten from now, can always tap into that shared Haitian identity, forged through an equally-endured hardship.<p>An earthquake has no one to blame. Probably as many Somalis died as in Haiti (though not in one day) but we only have ourselves to blame, and each victim left a blood debt on his killer, which ""must"" be avenged (or it has been avenged, and now the victim's family are awaiting reprisals)",1263513693.0
