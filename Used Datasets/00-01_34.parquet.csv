28,816526,comment,815513.0,816395.0,0,0,keeptrying,,,"Thank you for sharing that.<p>The way I look at it is that its a long journey where the biggest problem is basically the beliefs that you have. I think you have to really grow out of the beliefs that are holding you back. (By ""you"" I mean everyone ... not specifically you :) ...<p>Ie you have to have the mental courage to call yourself out and change to have success. For eg: I've always said that I can never play politics but I realise that when I start my own firm, I will probably have to at some point. So I study how the guys at work do that.<p>I've abhorred schmoozing to get anything but at some point I might have to do that to land a big client.<p>If you realise this is the kind of commitment its going to take, I think you'll have better success.<p>Essentially some particular thing is stopping you from making money. This could range from:\n1. Your product is not useful\n2. Your bliefs arent congruent to what is real in the world\n3. Your relationship with your business partner isnt helping.\n4. etc.<p>IF you think about it, it really could be anything. And running a business is a process of finding whats wrong and fixing it.<p>So you basically have to keep realising whats working and whats not. This becomes really hard when it comes down to your beliefs. And I think thats what holds back a fair number of entrepreneurs. They are unwilling to change their beliefs.<p>Eg: They see no one is using their product but they still believe it will work out. They see no revenue from their keywords and still they use the same ones.<p>Anyway I hope this process is what will make me sucessful. But even this could be wrong :) ...",1252629471.0

I don't think this has been the case for some time, and certainly not in the five+ years you've been doing your pro work.<p>And for the kind of people I am talking about, yes, 5000 copies or less is the goal, and $3000 is terrible, terrible money to lose. That's the ""indies"" I mean, not the ""indies"" I read about in Entertainment Weekly or on the Sundance weblog.<p>BBS Documentary got reviews in Wired, Film Threat, and a pile of other locations without paying for a distributor or out to other such organizations. As a result, I sell a bunch less, but all the non-production costs go to me, not to someone who gave me a nice dinner four years ago.<p>I'm going to give you a pass for indicating IF enthusiasts would tolerate a standard definition film because they once or currently liked games with scant graphics.<p>Like I said, different worlds, and in my world I really do think Blu-ray is a cancer and that this sort of treatment needs to be pointed out.",1252627253.0
