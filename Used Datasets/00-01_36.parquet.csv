Launch is expected at earliest in 2011.<p>Planning was started after the 2004 Asian tsunami. In 2007 the upfront costs of an emergency alert system were estimated at 1,5 to 6 million euros. At that point the Ministry of the Interior decided to mothball the project.<p>This year we've had record breaking storm damages. It's likely that development of such system will once again be a priority.<p>In Finland, mobile emergency alert system is seen as an alternative to current national emergency broadcasts (tv, radio - similar to EAS). Currently the system is very stupid - single bear sightings are pushed nationwide in every broadcast media. It's mostly a matter of too lax regulation on the use of emergency broadcasts, but ultimately a new, more localized delivery method would be needed. This would mean SMS emergency alerts pushed through local cell towers.<p>For further info on the Finnish project: Google ""hätätekstiviesti"" and Google Translate.",1284683502.0

They say they must be able to offer each other assurances that they won't lure away each others' star employees if they are to collaborate on key innovations that ultimately benefit the consumer.<p>Some economists believe that banning such agreements could harm Silicon Valley's open, collaborative model.</i><p>If the existence of an agreement isn't disclosed to the employees, then the model is not really what it is always held out to be, but something more akin to private industrial policy. I don't believe this is any better for consumers than for employees over any length of time. I've personally felt (as a consumer) that tech & internet development have stagnated in the last year or two, notwithstanding the existence of new things; perhaps this is why.<p>Settlement or litigation, this is probably going to set off a wave of cross-hiring because firms will no longer have the security of the agreement in place when negotiating employment agreements, and turning away a candidate from another firm with good skills may look suspicious. Good for engineers, good for the local economy, probably good for innovation; not so good for CFOs and CIOs who like sleeping at night.<p>I'm guessing companies will settle rather than fight; but if not, it'll set off a sector-wide feeding frenzy in the market. This should make the rest of the year interesting. It's partly political, to be sure, but slow wage growth in a period of generally rising productivity per capita has been a source of discontent for quite a while now. There is a lot of pent-up frustration, and also a lot of companies sitting on cash reserves in search of a market signal; neither situation is sustainable.<p>Incidentally, Microsoft, IBM and Genentech are all said to be in the clear.",1284683366.0

Let them know without going into excruciating detail that it's better FOR BOTH OF YOU (be sure to emphasize the benefits of not relying on someone who doesn't want to be there).  In the long run the client/friend will respect you more for being honest and saving them from someone who will do sub-par work.<p>And as someone who would similarly struggle with this type of problem, I can definitely say you should rehearse what you want to say beforehand and stick to that.<p>Best of luck!",1284682282.0

At $2 profit per sale they are going to need each and every voucher holder to make four additional purchases just to break even.<p>Seems like this was doomed from the start. I think the real problem here is that the small business owner thought Groupon was working for them. They didn't realise that they're the ones being sold the product.,1284681801.0
