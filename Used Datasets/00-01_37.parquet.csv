Within the consequential morality a single cigarette isn't such a bad thing, but that is narrow perspective.

If you're constantly evaluating whether breaking the rules is likely to pay off this time, you're probably going to break the rules too much, or spend too much time processing about it.  Deciding on a set of morals you will not break (except in extremis) frees your time and energy to do things that will pay off, at very little opportunity cost.  Further, if you communicate that you've done this, either explicitly by discussion or implicitly by refusing to do things ""just this once"" that are wrong according to the rules you chose, you'll lower the transaction costs of others interacting with you, and thereby people will trust you and interact with you more.

The theory of the article is that the children who are buying stocks right now are going to enjoy a superior rate of return at the expense of the retirees.  I don't think that's true.  Corporate profits expanded to an unusually high percentage of economic output in the past decade and a half, and I would expect that to go down.  Even if you anticipate that the corporate profit fraction remains constant, and that earnings will be twice their current level in a couple of years, the stock market still would have a 14 P/E ratio, which is historically a bit high.

They sell their kits and parts for 3 times the price of other onine stores and the generic models that they re-brand are not even very good to begin with.<p>Ask yourself if you really think its reasonable to pay $150 for 2 x 3.7v batteries that connect to a hot wire and an LED because there really is nothing amazing or expensive about the technology that make these work though due to the newness of the product, Smoking Everywhere and other heavily marketed brands have been able to tempt consumers to part with big money at mall outlets and elsewhere.<p>The kits go for $10 - $15 wholesale from China and fierce competition online has sellers giving them away for as low as $35 sometimes or for an average price of around $50. There is also a far wider range of devices online as suppliers are having Chinese manufacturers create more advanced modifications to best compete. The best e-cig out there right now would you believe is one you can make on your own from a cheap flashlight!<p>I've become very taken with e-cigs and have quit tobacco effortlessly for almost a year now using them. The FDA though is very confused about them. They are stopping some imports but allowing others...some say it's do to with the packaging (don't market them as cessation devices!- nearly all the chinglish manuals do). Hong Kong recently outlawed them even for export so this has hindered supply in recent days. I set up a slinkset site to follow the news at <a href=""http://www.e-cignews.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.e-cignews.com</a> you can also find a list of all the stores there. I swear I add at least 1 new one a day.",1237507643.0

It allows the text to refer to figures and details within those figures (e.g. ""In Fig. 3, roller 22 is mounted on support 24."")  It's originally built to prepare patent applications (see teampatent.com and ask for a beta account) but has wide applicability in other fields.  It's collaborative like Google Docs, runs on Amazon Web Services so it can scale, and is built exclusively with open source (with a Python backend) so we have flexibility on how to deploy it.
