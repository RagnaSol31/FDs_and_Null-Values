China could not have done this without WTO and U.S. approval.<p>There are many human rights problems in China, but it is unfair to say they throw _all_ these issues aside.  I known many Han Chinese that openly support Tibetan culture and wish to see it preserved.<p>Environment damage has been a calculated cost and there are many in China that push against it trying to say its time to pull back.  A few years ago, I was walking up to a subway station in the Shanghai suburbs.  There was a group of local college students with a huge banner urging people to protect the environment.  They were asking people to sign the banner.  I stopped and said hello and signed.  The students were thrilled to have a foreigner sign, but the banner already had hundreds of local Chinese signatures on it.  There were no police harassing them and the students seemed at ease in their public protest.<p>Sure, the playing field is not level.  This is by design and China is fairly transparent about the mechanisms they will use to protect or lock in economic growth.<p>Look at a different trading partner with the U.S.; take a look at Mexico.  NAFTA was promoted as a ""trade highway"" to U.S. voters.  Most would take that to imply the highway goes in both directions.  But if you have done business in Mexico or travelled there outside the confines of a resort, you'd notice that U.S. goods do not move into Mexico as freely as Mexican goods move out.  In English, we always distinguish something that is ""one-way"" by being sure to say so.  But, I never heard a U.S. politician talk about the one-directional nature of NAFTA.  I think much of our problem with China is that most simply don't know what the real deal is and some of us are just starting to figure it out.",1263601701.0

If they're calling way too many pages (which is the reason for the block in the first place), this will thrash your server.<p>Now, if you followed the above but then added the IP to a static blacklist if it resolved to an MSFT host - and a whitelist if not - then the system should work without too much of a performance hit (except a small one upfront).<p>Of course, at that rate, it would probably be easier to just submit a batch job to generate IPs in that range for blacklist and whitelist.<p>Anyways, your rhetorical point still stands :-)",1263601668.0

I read TC daily, and when you mention smaller startups(within other stories)...they are a direct competitor to the site being discussed.<p>Here it's way out of the left field. ""When we think of images, we think of <art galleries>, another good company working with images is <facebook>. Now back to our story about this cool new invite site...that uses images for the site background.""<p>+usually the smaller site is already launched. Or you say something like ""blahblah, which is still in private beta""...this one just reads differently. It reads like Quora is Yahoo Answers. In fact replace Quora with Yahoo Answers and it's a perfect fit.<p>2. The buzz is just among a few techies. The guys from whom I found out about them, don't seem to be active users...yet they praise it all the time. Calling it the best site and super addicting. But the first guy has only 2 Qs(last one a week ago) and the other has 3 As(last one also a week ago).<p>Yet both praised how addicting the site was. That's why I tracked down an invite...wanted to find out what the buzz was about.",1263600520.0
