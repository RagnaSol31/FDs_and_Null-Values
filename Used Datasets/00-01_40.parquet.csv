The ""fire"" instead of ""hire and fire"" partially reflects that the unemployed aren't useful to employers. Yes, a sizable chunk is due to lower production due to the recession.<p>Remember how this is the ""man-cession""? This means construction and manufacturing. Productivity is up (and not only because people work harder to not lose jobs) due to a well-needed gutting due to having a good excuse. This is some painful creative destruction.<p>Instead of pouring money out piecemeal, stimulus needs to address the structural issues: modernizing the workforce/education system, rearranging (cut/add) regulations, and useful infrastructure (e.g. not just fixing potholes).",1283648181.0

These people won't comparison-shop based on the internal processor speed, or the hard disk capacity.<p>Apple got stuck in a spec race with the iPhone, and they don't want to have to do it again with the Apple TV, because spec races inevitably up prices—more speed, more capability, more storage—when what they want the ATV to be is a <i>commodity</i> that every TV has hooked up to it, so people can use their <i>computers</i> (specifically, their <i>Apple</i> computers) to stream things to them.<p>They want the ATV to do <i>as little</i> as possible, not as much as possible, just to act as a little adapter that brings your TV into your wi-fi network.

They pick you.<p>The business behind it is actually kind  of interesting.  The girl will audition, they get accepted and then they pay a house fee (usually around $100) to work there.  Sundays are typically house fee free.  Everything else is based on tips and the girls have to tip everyone: bouncers, house moms, makeup (if they don't do their own).<p>And it's really a scaling issue.  I'm guessing (and I'm just guessing) that the median income for a stripper in a particular area is directly related to the median income for that area.<p>Also, a lot of girls travel to work, between NYC, Vegas and Los Angeles.  Also, Miami is pretty big.<p>You don't need to be a super model to work at the ""top flight"" clubs in NYC either.  I have photographic evidence of that.  You do need to have some hustle to make a lot of money though, and a casual disdain for men doesn't hurt either.<p>I would most certainly NOT recommend it as a career for people.  I think it has the capability of ruining healthy sexual attitudes in people.  It certainly made my relationship much harder.<p>That being said, a lot of these girls have very few options that provide the sort of income and lifestyle flexibility that stripping offers.  My ex-wife supported her entire family with it.  Could she have done something else?  Maybe, but she didn't finish high school and her family required her support.  What career can someone in her situation take on that offers 90K+ for 4 days work without a high school diploma?<p>It's really interesting too because the entire perception of stripping is so culturally rooted.  Where she is from (Japan) it's no big deal.  It's another job, like being a hostess girl.  Not something you wear on your sleeve, but not something you necessarily are ashamed of.

I'm sure it was read because it seriously clashes with the NY state of mind, but I saw some pretty supportive comments on Twitter from Californians and New Yorkers alike. I would never want my office to be in France where you get to work at 11, go to lunch and have a few bottles of wine from 12-4, and then take off at 5. I'm glad Sarkozy raised the retirement age to 62 though. I just don't want a culture swap, but it looks to be one of the many directions our melting pot could take. My french roommate used to put the eggs in the cupboard! Crazy!<p>If I saw one of my employees put the eggs in the cupboard and then take a nap in my New York office, my brain would implode.<p>I'm not suggesting to operate like a sweatshop and I'm aware that manufacturing power in the United States is quite volatile right now, but even when people focus on those right-brain activities, the earth still spins and capitalism still exists.

Straubhaar, in the 20th century ""[t]he United States rose rapidly from virtually nothing to become the most politically powerful and economically strongest country in the world"", by following the economics of some fuzzily defined American Way where ""every man was responsible for himself -- in good times and bad. No one could count on government assistance"".<p>Then the good professor argues for a return to these good old times. The historical reality begs to differ. Far from being ""virtually nothing"", the US manufacturing output was the first in the world as early as 1890:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_United_States",
