Physical resources are going to be tougher to acquire and more expensive and major scientific advances are going to be more difficult. It won't surprise me at all if the cheap, easy growth of the 19th-20th centuries turns out to be the exception, not the norm.

There <i>is</i> a such thing as a bad developer.  There are people doing programming who really have no talent for it, or for some other reason are just <i>really</i> bad at it.  Sometimes it is due to lack of experience.  Sometimes it is due to the person not caring at all.  And I am sure there are plenty of other reasons.  It doesn't mean that a person can't get better, often they can get <i>much</i> better, but people <i>do</i> write code that sucks.<p>Understand, I think I am now <i>much</i> slower to be harsh toward other people's code than I used to be.  In fact, I regularly give people the benefit of the doubt.  Why?  Because I've worked for that megalomaniac that wants done yesterday what can't possibly be done in a month's time.  You know, the one that thinks that because his work consumes his entire life, and causes him to neglect his family and other responsibilities, so should yours.  I've worked in multiple high-pressure situations, where no one cares what the code looks like, as long as it is done tomorrow.  And you know what?  Sometimes in situations like that people slap together whatever they can (as fast as they can) with duct tape and chewing gum, whatever it takes to get that unreasonable person (or people) off of their back.  The results are often ugly, and you can argue whether the person could have done it better in the same (or even less) time.  But I think it is worth cutting the other guy some slack.  Thankfully, I no longer work for the megalomaniac (and haven't for many years) :-D<p>However, getting back to my original point, there is code that sucks.  It may not be as prevalent as some think that it is, but believe me, it is out there (even after giving the other guy the benefit of the doubt).<p>Geez, what's up with me and the parenthetical kick today (perhaps I've been writing too much Scheme code recently).  :-)  <- got one last one in there.",1280624113.0

Although I'd love to be able to organize tabs better, I don't care about that nearly as much as I care about the performance of my system when that many tabs are open.  (a)  Memory usage (b) risk of some plugin or javascript on a page causing firefox to start eating 99% of my cpu.<p>Theoretically those two problems can be solved concurrently, but still-- favicons, hotkeys, and the ability to drag and drop solves most of my problems with tab organization.  I use alternate windows only when really necessary.<p>What I'd really like is to have a second, isolated firefox process that I can run alongside my main one with as much functional independence as possible.  One process will be for the relatively safe, familiar, and stable, text-oriented type sites with minimal advertising (hacker news, gmail, wikipedia, python.org, clojure.org, paulgraham.com, etc.), and the other process will be for heavy sites, new/risky sites, or otherwise problematic sites (eg if I have a youtube tab open I can't ctrl-PgDwn past it, when I hit that tab I have to stop and use the mouse-- a pain in the ass).<p>While Chrome's process-per-tab model is really nice, they're still all tied together and there's a risk of losing everything sometimes.",1280623431.0

49,1564478,comment,1563858.0,1564081.0,0,0,pg,,,I've been meaning to go through everything I've written and collect the mistakes.  IIRC I was wrong about the low end of the age range here.  It was also a mistake to advise people to work for an existing co for a couple years before starting their own.,1280621598.0

I shared a few on my blog (<a href=""http://reddit.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.blogspot.com</a>) during the startup, but we lucked into Chris because he went back to his PHD after doing YC that first summer and had 2 spare bedrooms, which Steve & I promptly moved into when summer ended and PG talked us out of moving back to Virginia.<p>Chris generally just made us feel guilty for ever needing to sleep (since he was helping us part-time and PHD-ing at Harvard the rest of the time -- oh, and he met & dated his future wife then, too!)",1280621452.0

Explaining the cost and benefit of refactoring work to clients can be a hard upsell, and IMHO helps separate great clients from not-so-great.",1280621345.0

I mean, really.<p>I don't disagree that often I fail to understand why someone did something a certain way, on the first reading.  But after I understand all the logic, and have run test cases etc., the fact that code is poorly structured, buggy, full of duplication, excess global variables, etc. is sometimes unavoidable.  When that happens, I have to conclude that it does indeed suck.",1280621094.0

I, for example, now only read about 6 physical books a year, but spend a lot more time reading online. I probably read the equivalent of a small book every day, it's just that this happens in the browser and thus instead of stacks of unread books I have heaps of unread tabs.",1280620944.0
