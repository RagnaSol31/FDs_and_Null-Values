(university was the last time I looked at any QM though, so I'm a bit rusty on the specifics) Maybe they mean doing so <i>during</i> the entanglement process, in which case the benefit is that you now have two particles holding the wave function of the result (or rather a related one holding the same information), and being atoms, they could represent the quantum equivalent of mass storage.

In this economy, with the chances of buyouts being close to nil at the moment (let alone IPOs), it just makes sense. And for very small startups, founders should ask themselves why they would dedicate so much energy to something they can't expect to get paid for until they've built up a huge audience.<p>Conversely, and this is especially true for small startups, if you can build something for which a thousand or two people are willing to pay $20-40 / month, then that's a pretty attractive income. This could easily help you ride out the economy and be around when potential acquirers have more budget to spend, if that's your goal.<p>One other nice thing about this trend is it pushes focus away from marketing to the new-app-crack-babies that love to try every new thing for 5 minutes. They will give you some nice early feedback but don't really represent your target market, either in terms of demographics or loyalty.",1232669830.0

It may instead be the anticipation that the noise and movement is someone who is about to pull you out of your flow. Even if it doesn't happen that often, the psychological jolt that occurs every time it does is enough to make my mind resist concentrating when potential distractions are around. Noise-canceling headphones do nothing against a tap on the shoulder.",1232669606.0

I grew up in North Carolina where lots of families move to raise kids.  Growing up, I saw growth of epic proportions.  Families would migrate in droves to the triangle area from places like Ohio, Massachusetts, and New Jersey (this is still going on and the whole region is having some pretty serious growth problems).  From what I gathered back then, and looking back on it now, I would say that good schools, good climate, nice people, safe area, reasonable cost of living, good colleges in state, and a nice outdoor environment are all paramount.  These are mostly the reasons that people move to areas like where I grew up ( Cary, North Carolina).",1232669578.0
