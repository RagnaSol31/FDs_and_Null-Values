You have exchanges, queues, and bindings.\nWith a bit of practice, it's fairly simple to grasp the concepts.<p>""AMQP is quite unusual in that it starts low on the stack, building on protocols like TCP rather than HTTP""<p>This person has obviously never built anything truly high performance.  Using HTTP would add a lot of latency, and he complains about message speed?\nSure 0MQ is the fastest, but with RabbitMQ you get <1ms latency.<p>""People who today read the AMQP specifications tend to make one main complaint: the protocol is too complex.""<p>I wonder how many of these people actually use it.\nHe goes into a bunch of useless analogies but doesn't actually discuss WHAT'S complex about it.\n(Usage wise, NOT implementation wise.)<p>A protocol doesn't HAVE to evolve.  JSON being an example.  \nBut, in the end, AMQP isn't perfect, but it can still be used to build good software.<p>This person knows very little about building messaging software, and he admits it himself.  \nI'd take his complaints with a huge grain of salt.<p>You can use something like protobuf to get really fast de-serialization if you really want encoding.",1283472946
