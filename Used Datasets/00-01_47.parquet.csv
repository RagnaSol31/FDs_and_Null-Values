It is a fact that interop between GNOME, KDE, and whatever else is so poor that the only way to achieve usability today is to pick one platform and stick with it completely.

29,256078,comment,255729.0,256022.0,0,0,donw,,,"Well, my nominal work is as a system administrator, and I've been working with Linux since about 1998.  In fact, until 2005, Linux was my primary computing platform.  So, I would claim to have tried at least one or two Linux distributions over the past ten years.  There has been a very marked improvement in the user interface over that time, and of them all, I would say that Ubuntu is probably the best of the lot.<p>My point still stands.<p>Firefox is built on GTK, whereas KDE is built on Qt.  Audacity uses wxWindows, and xterm is just raw xlib, if I remember correctly.  OpenOffice has its own widget toolkit, as does VLC, and since I was a WindowMaker user, that's GNUStep, which is yet another widget toolkit.<p>All of these toolkits behave differently, and even though the situation has improved, they still don't interact terribly well.  For example, cut-and-paste was, and still is as of the last time I tried Ubuntu, still not terribly functional.  Sure, it worked with the X clipboard, but the behavior was subtly different between applications.  This is something that even Windows has had working well for nearly fifteen years.<p>This is a very real problem.<p>International support isn't terribly good across the board, either.  The situation has improved a lot in the past year, with Ubuntu and Debian now doing a decent enough job out of the box in terms of Japanese input and translation, but still nowhere near as good as it works on my Mac desktop.<p>Speaking of which, I can not think of a single piece of open-source cross-platform GUI software that I use at all.  Of course, I use a ton of stuff on the command line, but not a single application from my Linux/X Windows days has made it on to my Mac.<p>Mostly because they don't use native widgets, and so even if they look like a Mac application, they behave differently in subtle yet highly annoying ways.  For example, in any OS X application, I can highlight a word, hit a key, and then have that word fired over to the Dictionary.  I use this regularly, yet even the latest build of Firefox doesn't support it.  It's a built-in feature of the OS, and works just fine in any application that uses Carbon or Cocoa, yet not in Firefox, because they've bundled their own widgets with the application.<p>And this is my point.  Even when Linux apps <i>look</i> like they're all part of the same platform, through appropriate use of themes and skins, they still don't feel as if they are integrated together.<p>OS X has only one set of widgets, although there are two primary APIs for developing applications -- Cocoa and Carbon.  Cocoa is for applications written in Objective C, whereas Carbon is for C, C++, and Java.  Carbon mostly exists to make porting applications easier, and to provide Java applications with access to native GUI widgets.<p>But, no matter which API a programmer choses to use, the application will behave like all other Mac applications.  Copy and paste will work the same as it does everywhere else.  So will all of the neat tricks under the 'Services' menu.<p>So, there's my complaint.  GUI Applications on my Mac all act the same.  GUI Applications on a Linux box don't, and coming close usually requires quite a bit of fighting, even for something as simple as entering text my second language.<p>Linux (and FreeBSD) are great server environments.  I would be hard-pressed to even consider using OS X for anything other than a file and print server.  But I won't use it as a desktop platform anymore, because it's simply too much of a pain in the ass, too much of the time.<p>I would love to see this change.",1216946130

And when I think, ""famously good"", I think, ""Will expect salary that is commensurate with output, will expect to work on interesting projects, and has his/her pick of jobs.""  And yet, the latter is who I want to hire, because I know the difference it makes in quality and productivity.  If I can hire a famously good hacker for about 1.5 times the industry average, I'd consider it a good deal.<p>But I use the term because I know what it means...I'm not sure if it'd be meaningful to folks reading our job ads.  So I'd probably be more explicit about what we're looking for.",1216944662

A marker that those who use it are from a more civilized age (the 1980s) when songs were sung instead of spoken, when mistreating women was something you did in the privacy of your hotel room rather than the subject of your lyrics, and when writing songs about how awesome you personally are was considered a little gauche.",1216944556

If your business should happen not to work out the first time, you walk away free and clear and can easily start another business.  If you've borrowed money and your business fails, you still have to pay back the loan.  This is an amazing gift: if you fail the first time, your net worth may be zero, but at least it won't be negative.  [<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html</a>]<p>If you do decide to borrow money, you do not need to have built up your credit score.  All you need to do is talk to a lender who has the intelligence to look at your actual situation.  (As Dave Ramsey likes to put it, a credit score is lending for dummies).  To get a mortgage for a house, for example, to qualify for the best rate, all you need is to have paid your rent for two years early or on time, to not to have bad debts, and to find a bank that does manual underwriting.  You do not need to have borrowed a dollar before in your life.<p>A VISA debit card will give you exactly the same level of protection against theft and fraud as a credit card will.  Look it up on their web site.<p>There are a few minor inconveniences to not having a credit score.  For example, yes, I did have an insurance company initially want to charge me a higher insurance rate because I hadn't ""established my credit"".  But all I had to do was call them up and explain that I didn't have a credit score because I didn't borrow money, and if they didn't give me a good rate I'd go to an insurance company who would look at my actual situation.  And they gave me a reasonable rate.  A five minute conversation.  (If you want to be an entrepreneur, this kind of negotiation is trivial).<p>So if you don't need to ""build your credit"", why is everyone you know (and all the comments here on Hacker News) saying you should?  Propaganda from the credit card industry is pervasive (their advertising budget, iirc, is second only to the auto industry).  They have spent a great deal of money, time, and effort coming up with plausible sounding reasons why you should buy their product (credit), and ensuring that everyone has heard of them.<p>Your ""credit score"" is in fact a measure of how much profit you are making for the credit industry.<p>Maximizing your credit score isn't going to help you, making products or services that people want is what is going to make you successful.  Don't spend your time optimizing the wrong thing.",1216944379

Actually calculus warps your mind as near any branch of mathematics does. Programming is tied with mathematics very closely and programmer should clearly understand what abstraction is, how to abstract, how to prove, how to create proper aims. And nothing would tell about it as much as mathematics.<p>2. math logic.<p>3. philosophy and rhetoric. At first sight it may seem boring, but actually it's not. Speech of a good programmer should be constructed well. When you work with guy, who even can't explain you what how his program works, it's not very good. Especially when that guy works in a big team. \nRhetoric can <i>teach</i> you how to speak well, philosophy may <i>show</i> you well-constructed speeches.<p>4. Foreign language. If you're not a native english speaker, english is first language you <i>must</i> to learn(at least to be able to read technical literature and some papers).",1216944316

Since they are at least looking for the right type of programmers... I can see that perspective.<p>It's always possible that some horrible HR person posted the job. I've talked to some horrible HR people at Microsoft and Google in the past (when they were ""cool"" places to work with super smart types).<p>I think the most obvious move is to interview and talk to the people you will be working for/with. In many cases the specific project or team is as important as the company.<p>The job ad is just to get that initial interest.
