Carry on.  :)  You should read John Holt at some point.<p>I think homeschooling is easier the younger you start.

13,584347,comment,584169.0,584169.0,0,0,bendotc,,,"Hi niels_olson,<p>I wasn't homeschooled at all. I went to private school through high-school (around Charlottesville, VA, in case you're in that area) and then did public university.  I went to school with some home schooled students. Some were good, some had issues. Most of them had at least a few social issues, but then, I think any way you sliced my high-school population, the majority of a given section had some issues; such is the nature of being in high-school.<p>The point is, this doesn't really tell you anything useful. I could tell you what my gut tells me about homeschooling, but that's not going to be especially useful either. Instead, I'll share two things that I think might actually be of some use to you on this issue.<p>One: you're asking a community of amateurs. The people on this website are, at least taken in aggregate, a standard deviation or two above the norm at what they're good at. However, I have met very few people who're particularly smart at everything. Instead, people are usually smart about a small number of things. The most wise people are usually wise enough to know they don't know squat about the rest.  Therefor, I would suggest that there will be lots of well-meaning, reasonably smart people here, I'm not sure that the people who actually know what they're talking about are going to come out over the people who don't know enough to know they don't know what they're talking about.<p>And what makes it worse is that studies show, if you don't know much about this, you're going to have a hard time telling the know-it-alls from the know-nothings.<p>Two: you're asking a self-selected group about their experiences, and as we all know, the plural of anecdote is not data. Again, a lot of people on here are smart, and on top of that, highly (self-)motivated, people. These are good qualities that I'm sure you want to give your children, but you're probably likely to get more success stories about <i>anything</i> with a reasonable success rate here, given the population you ask. If I ask a room full of millionaires how many people eat raisin bran and I get a number of positive responses, I can't then conclude that iron and dietary fiber have a greater-than-average incidence of financial prosperity.<p>I'm not suggesting that it's not worthwhile to hear what people have to say about their experiences; I'm just urging you to take what you read with a grain of salt and to seek out data about homeschooling. Try to find non-biased studies on it, compare the costs to comparable options (Montessori, local alternative private schools), and then ultimately apply your best judgment.<p>Good luck!",1240966078
14,584346,comment,584169.0,584271.0,0,0,ggchappell,,,"Well, yes & no. The main problem is that high school is a very artificial environment in which a student has very little freedom.<p>Consider bullying. I had to deal with bullies in jr. high & high school, because there simply was no way to avoid them. But after high school, I didn't go where the bullies were. Problem solved. Yes, there were bullies in elementary school, but they weren't really capable of doing much damage yet.<p>And there is a flip side: teenagers are protected from the consequences of their decisions. This is another reason for bullying: the bullies get away with it. But in the adult world, violent people can be fired, jailed, etc.<p>And bullying is just one issue of many.<p>So, yes, peer influences can be a problem throughout life; however I definitely do <i>not</i> see the adult world as being more dangerous, if you can't figure out how survive in the teen world. Certainly my own experience does not support that idea.<p>See also PGs essays on high school. I don't mean that he is supporting my ideas; rather he provides a good explanation of why high school is <i>different</i> from ""the real world"". Thus, I don't see that figuring out how to survive high school really gives one much in the way of practical life skills for the long term.",1240966037

My ride through public school was a bit bumpy but overall I did OK, and made several life-long friends in the process.  I was exposed to homeschoolers in college and while they were hard working and serious students, they just didn't seem to have the same academic chops as their public/private schooled peers.  This was not because they were dumb, or received poor instruction from their parents; they simply struggled adapting to some of the requirements of institutional learning.  Namely, they had poor time management skills and didn't function well in groups compared to their peers.  These students had no exposure to public schooling outside of kindergarten.<p>With that said, the most critical phase of your child's education will be early childhood, namely grades K-5.  A solid foundation during this period will pay significant dividends throughout their academic career.  I'd  consider weighing your options in terms of specialized private education if you're determined to give them the best start possible.<p>However, if your objective is religious and you desire to shield your children from the ""secularism"" in public schools, then by all means home school them.",1240964963

64,584291,story,,,2,5,gaoshan,Working remotely... from China. Advice?,,"I'm going to be working (web development) from China for the next few months. I've done this before so let me explain how I did it and then ask if anyone has any advice on how you would do it.<p>I frequently need access to SSH, FTP, our version control stuff (Vault... yuck), and then basic chat, email and web access. Working from China means dealing with pretty bad lag at times though that isn't a major issue as I am not dealing with video or gaming or remote desktops or anything heavy like that. I will sometimes run into the Great Firewall but have no trouble doing what the Chinese do (using anonymous proxy servers or setting up Tor) to get around such things. Tor and proxies slow things down pretty bad but they are better than nothing and are only needed occasionally as the sites I am accessing are rarely blocked. In addition to Tor and random anonymous proxies I have also tried using Hamachi. It worked to a certain extent but was eventually blocked (I suspect) by the Great Firewall and frankly, it just gives me visual access to my home desktop... something I would really rather access via SSH anyway as SSH is fast and my Unix-foo is adequate. So, that is what I have done in the past, now...<p>What sorts of advice do you folks have for how to work as effectively as possible from within China? I will not have access to a private company's network so that is out of the question. My access comes from the wireless I have set up in my apartment in China (Hangzhou... sweet city) or from access at Starbucks (yeah, I know... perhaps I will carry a small bottle of Massengill in my bag).\nSo, have any of you worked from inside China? If so, where? Any practical tips you have are most appreciated as I will have a reasonably heavy workload (mostly PHP, MySQL) this summer and will want to be as efficient as possible. Thanks!",1240963682
