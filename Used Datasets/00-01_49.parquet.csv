Europeans evolved to get a lot of proteins from cows milk, but natives are lactose intolerant and so would not have been able to drink milk (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/000-Year-Explosion-Civilization-Accelerated/dp/0465002218"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/000-Year-Explosion-Civilization-Accele...</a> ).  Europeans also evolved to deal with farm animal borne diseases, having natives try and use European farming techniques (with animals) may have been a death sentence.  And even if the natives could have adopted farming, very few people will give up their old way of life and ancestral lands voluntarily, without putting up a fight.

9,1051634,comment,1050522.0,1051609.0,0,0,Tichy,,,"Why does it even matter who was ""evil"" and who wasn't? The fact remains that one party killed off the other. It seems clear that among the killers there were some ""evil savages"", but of course not every European was evil. It doesn't even make sense to think in such generalizations. However, if some actions were ordered by ""the state"", then it seems to me to make sense to hold ""the state"" responsible for it. Whatever kind of entity the state is - of course not everybody in the state endorses it's actions, but they still benefit or suffer from it. I suppose you can not hold a soldier in a war responsible for killing, because he was ordered to do so and presumably had no other choice. But that doesn't validate wars - and if said soldier later lives on the farm of the person he killed, it seems fair to ask some questions.<p>I don't think in modern times if you murder somebody, the court will be very interested in whether the victim was a good or a bad person.<p>Also I have to admit I still don't understand what you are going on about - if the European invaders where not evil, ruthless and completely without moral compunction, how were they capable of doing the killing?

Thanks for going all ""think of the children"" on me man, where if I'm not with you I'm for murdering the natives. You are (apparently) representative of the moral absolutism problem I am talking about.<p>I'm not defending the extermination of native American natives.<p>The problem with this article is that it cast native American society as a utopian paradise, and the white European invaders as evil, ruthless, and completely without moral compunction. This sort of historical revisionist ""blackwashing"" doesn't help anyone - because it has not fairly represented either side. The natives were not utopian societies, nor were they savages deserving of murder. The Europeans were not ruthless monsters, nor were they benevolent conquerors. To represent this situation as black and white is both ignorant and unproductive.<p>By ""blackwashing"" I mean skewing the facts and injecting calls to emotion where it doesn't belong, to try and make something seem worse - where whitewashing is the opposite (skewing the facts and injecting emotion to make it seems <i>better</i>)<p>[edit] Also, to address specifically why the moral absolutism is a problem: by casting the Europeans as ruthlessly evil, you have removed any deep introspection into <i>why</i> the murder of the natives occurred. You've transformed a complex human situation into a fairy tale - where the bad guys need no explanation. You've also effectively discounted the possibility that bad things can happen for relatively benign (or at least, not overtly evil) goals.<p>Not to mention dehumanization is inherently dangerous - even if the person you're dehumanizing is the ""bad guy"".",1263429303

I'm installing a lot of VMWare systems at ""true"" MS shops, which choose VM for the same reason as MS (market leader, no one ever got fired... etc.) where hyper-V is still perceived as immature product. In MS shops license cost usually is not the decisive factor, and VMware is perceived as the best technology(aksi the most expensive). It is true a lot of those places run Hyper-V as well, but they don't usually host production systems on it.<p>My take on it is: MS is quite good at making development tools, Exchange, Sharepoint, systems management software etc. (generaly high level stuff) The further they are kept from the hardware the better.

I'll leave the rest of this thread alone, but to add specifically to the pieces about Mashery...<p>Mashery has really big clients and really small clients.  We built our solution on AWS very shortly after it launched and know ""the cloud"", really really well.  We have clients with APIs that exist on EC2 or in their own cage.  Some clients are beta programs, some crank hundreds of millions of calls through us.  Working with us isn't so much about size, but what value you'd get based on your need.<p>We don't just provide a Portal.  But yes, we do provide a full solution for managing API's: portal, developer management, limiting, caching, authentication, analytics.  Things we think are important for people managing API's, big or small, science project or commercial.<p>Integration with Mashery can also literally be typing in a URL - but usually you need more if you want to expose an API, especially if you want it to be commercial.<p>We have clients that run commercial API programs.  There aren't too many big examples out there where people are charging per call and needing a toll booth as it were.  The day will come though so I'd agree.",1263427889

If you had the capacity to stop their slaughter would you? Or would you perform the same terribly acts simply because it lead to a future that you are comfortable with?<p>Everybody knows that the past is the past and can't be undone. But that doesn't mean that we should lie to ourselves about it. What really matters is what we do here and now in the world. If you condone such actions in the past then it is natural that you will condone them in the present and future as well.,1263427843

If you had many IPs, chances are they would be from a small group of ranges and the entire ranges would get blocked.<p>For years the way I worked around the firewall from Shanghai was to run SOCKS proxy through an SSH tunnel to my U.S. server.  This works because its not advertised as such and China does not want to block all SSH/SSL traffic.<p>China is not trying to block everyone.  If you're well educated, tech-savvy, and have a credit card to rent a server outside China, you can get around the firewall.  Its that simple.  If you read Chinese, as most do in China, there are many avenues of (sometimes transient) data sources which carry just about everything you could imagine.  The information is out there, you just have to work a little harder to find it.   China, just like various interests that control U.S. media is going after the broad strokes.  In China they use the GFW, in the U.S., advertisers simply tell the top 4 media companies to not talk about certain things or else their ad money will dry up.
