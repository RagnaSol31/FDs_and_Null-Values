Torvalds makes a very good case for not using C++ in the Linux kernel. At the very least, it seems like hiding memory allocation in kernel level code is a recipe for disaster. Of course, one could argue that you can use malloc in C++ just as well as in C, but then are you really writing C++? It seems as though you're writing C code  in C++. In fact, many of the language ""features"" that C++ offers seem to be Very Bad Ideas(TM) in the kernel.<p>In addition, as Linus responded earlier, anyone who has written a modicum of C code knows that you don't need the complex language features of C++ to write modular, object oriented code (in fact, I'd argue that C++ is a blight upon OO and should probably die a horrible death, but that's neither here nor there).<p>Most notably, however, is simply that it is not the Linux team's responsibility to defend their use of C over C++ -- given the amount of code that must be adapted, it is more appropriate for the C++ devs to argue what heavy benefits <i>C++</i> has in its favor (such that they merit the transformation of a complex and significantly large body of code).<p>I would actually say the C++ dev's view is more political than technical: advocating the switch to C++ ""just because,"" implies a political (or religious) reasoning, while the Linux team's view seems much more technical.",1246755440.0

Google ostensibly hires all of the ""best talent"" in the industry, yet what do you see of it?<p>If the government takes on some policy of allowing the world's ""best and brightest"" to immigrate, you're not necessarily getting the people who would have produced the most value. Instead you'll get people who have tons of qualifications and degrees.<p>Let's say France had this same immigration idea back in 1980.

It's probably prohibitively annoying to write mainline kernel code, like a device driver, in C++. There might not be anything to prevent you from loading a whole C++ subsystem, though.<p>I'll head some other commenters off at the past and note that MacOS X xnu has a C++ device driver interface, but is still a C-code kernel.<p>Linus is right about the exception handling and allocator issues. C++ exceptions are a misfeature in userland code; it's even more important for kernel code to be able to handle problems gracefully and explicitly, and unwinding stacks through functions running at different interrupt sensitivities and holding different locks seems like an disaster waiting to happen. And, unless my C++ has gotten rusty since Alexandrescu's book came out, nobody likes the C++ allocator interfaces --- which you'd certainly have to dive into to handle the kernel's various different allocation strategies.",1246754313.0

Our team had 39 people including 1 of the CEOs.  We did quite a few ""physical games"" to build team skills, trust, and overcome personal barriers, including firewalking.  One of the games was climbing a 50 foot ladder and jumping off (tethered, of course) to catch a trapeze.  38 people did it.  The CEO could not.  He climbed halfway up the ladder, started crying, and climbed down.<p>It was stunning and a little embarrassing.  We had been deferring to this guy for 4 days and there he was in front of us, totally exposed, probably for the first time in years.<p>There were many guesses about what had happened; I never really found out.
