By common cultural and legal convention (and in my firm opinion), the accumulated wealth of most countries partly belongs to all who are citizens. You’re suggesting that the rest of us cede complete social and economic control to those who own property. Such is the typical libertarian utopian ideal, but in practice the result is a sort of quasi-aristocratic society with sharply limited opportunities for those at the bottom.<p>If you change your perspective, recognize that every fortune depends just as much on the context and the society it was built in as it does on the individual who built it, that our definitions of wealth and property are essentially arbitrary human constructions, defined to be whatever we can mostly agree on (through our institutions of government), and decide that the accumulated wealth created by all our ancestors should ""rightfully"" (another human construction) belong somewhat to all of us, then suddenly inheritance in general becomes a way for some people (the rich) to take our property (that is, your property and mine and everyone's) and give it to a few people that they personally selected.<p>Now, in practice, there's some kind of balance between these positions (full inheritance or no inheritance), because again, our culture and laws in a republican society are based on what we can agree on. In America, there's more of a cultural and legal emphasis on inheritance and personal wealth than in any of the Scandinavian countries, for example.<p>But for someone to say that the very concept of broader societal input into inheritance is ""morally repugnant"" is in my opinion a pretty narrow and socially destructive morality, and I’m glad I don’t live in a country where a small elite has enough power and influence to impose such cultural definitions through force.",1278721147.0

After I thought about it a while I realized we lost because we were wrong.<p>Imagine an alternate reality, very similar to our current reality. It has computers and computer networks, but for some reason, it never occurred to anyone to invent email. Networks are used for file transfers and web browsing and stuff like that.<p>Finally, someone gets the idea for email. Are they going to make it plain text? Of course not. They are going to want email to be an online alternative to regular postal mail, and so are going to try to match the features of postal mail.<p>Postal mail is often generated by composing in a word processor, printing the result, and mailing it. It is not limited to plain text. It can have bold and italic and colors and different typefaces and sizes. It can have embedded photos and graphics. It can have attachments (other printed itms, or a CD can be dropped in the envelope).<p>Email is going to have to support all that to be a viable alternative to postal mail. And thus email in this alternate reality would very likely start off as HTML email (or perhaps as .doc email).<p>Now back to our reality. In our reality, email was invented early in the computer age, when the technology simply didn't exist to match the graphical and formatting capabilities of postal mail. Hence, it was plain text--as that is all the technology could reasonably handle.<p>Well, we've got better technology now.

Running python on other vm's is a fine idea but the most effort goes into cpython NOT jython or others.
