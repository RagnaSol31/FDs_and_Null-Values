I think its overambitious to expect someone to completely turn their back on their view of their country in a few months after they have spent 20+ years of their lives in what they see to be a functioning society. It took two hundred plus years after the Enlightenment for all of our oh so Great Countries to finally rid themselves of kings and colonial rule.<p>As cabalamat says, I don't think there is anything more you can do to teach someone from China about Western values than having them completely immersed in our civilization. Some of our values <i>must</i> be crossing the waters, mustn't they? - if they really are self evidently superior?<p>I think collaboration is the <i>best</i> we can do - with the scientists and business men themselves, the people that actually matter, who's opinions people over there <i>respect</i>, not through the government.

Of his arguments, one of them is very strong: governments will not sit still for anything that undermines their economic power. Topics related to his other three claims have been discussed at great length and detail by Bitcoiners. There is no inherent connection between the use of Bitcoins and a gold standard - nobody is trying to persuade world governments to use bitcoin as a backing for the value of their fiat currencies. Bitcoin is an alternative. Security issues relating to cryptograhic protocols and implementation are a risk, but not as catastrophic as he suggests; Bitcoin has already dealt with a number of security problems successfully. As for Bitcoin not working offline, I am unconcerned - Paypal doesn't work offline, but that hasn't doomed it to failure, and for that matter, a number of ""physical bitcoin"" ideas have been worked out.<p>All that said, the argument ""governments will make it criminal"" has been my perspective for a long time, and why I don't use bitcoin personally.

Depending on your neuron model, you'd probably be able to simulate as many neurons as is in the human brain if you threw it against, say, Google's server farm. The brain is modular, so you should be able to parallelize it relatively easily. The reason no one has done that yet is that we don't yet know enough about how to connect those neurons the way they are connected in the brain. (The Blue Brain project aim to have this figured out by 2019 though.)",1304900497.0

For instance, if someone knows you like an esoteric thing, and they know you have a lot of bitcoin, they can look at people buying things from public addresses (most shops or established bodies have permanent addresses for receiving) that are associated with esoteric thing, and say it's likely that you were purchasing at least some of that. They can do other filtration and process-of-elimination things to find out who is using what, or where something comes from.<p>Additionally, if the wallet of one who you've traded with in the past is compromised, even if they were using single-transaction addresses, the attacker may be able to fill in some missing links in the chain, especially if the wallet's owner has recorded anywhere a translation from btc address to useful memo/accounting data. Imagine if UBL used btc and the Feds got his wallet; everyone downstream would be hunted with some serious prejudice.<p>I should clarify that in bitcoin, the entire transaction chain from the time the block is generated until the last time it is used is recorded forever. Once you send from an address to another address, that transaction is ingrained in btc for the remainder of its existence, and every coin you receive has a long history that shows all of that.

I think Google's server farms distributed around the world fall into this category (they enable lower latency, faster responses).<p>But there are many other sources of competitive advantage, such as a network effects (but this didn't save MySpace) Perhaps the two most important ones are marketing (both how well known it is when growing and its PR image once established) and continuous improvement (facebook keeps adding features).
