47,925134,story,,,8,8,hotpockets,Ask YC: Publish the bubble list?,,"I was hoping YC might be interested in an experiment.  The idea being to publish a list of runner-ups to YC, and have them be adopted by HN.  A primary goal being to increase the number companies which have some form of “YC approval”.  Since picking winners out of a stack of excellent applications is such an imperfect process, these companies that just miss the final cut are probably just as good as the ones who make the final cut.  By publishing a bubble list (the top 10 or 20 companies that just missed the cut), these companies gain the YC seal-of-approval, and a level of recognition.  I’d like to propose that they then become adopted by HN, where they can lean on the HN community for strategic advice, constructive feedback, and  networking---many of the things YC provides.  This could foster some friendly competition with YC, where the HN crowd supported companies and the YC supported companies race to the finish.<p>Obviously, there would need to be some form of permission granting process so that the bubble list companies agree to take part.<p>Some of the benefits I see: \n1. Good will towards entrepreneurs; you double the number of “winners“.  Less rejection letters.\n2., Winnowing that last pile of 40 applications to 20 becomes easier, perhaps enjoyable.  Its not “which great team do we have to reject” but “which great team will go to the bubble list”.\n3. Friendly competition.  HN vs. YC.\n4. Fun (At least for me :), hopefully for others)\n5.

And quotes through him were generally only 10-20% more than the website price once you had removed all the Server CALS and Office licenses that got added to every machine you asked for.<p>But of course he wouldn't sell you Latitude or whatever they were calling  their low end machines because you were now a medium size customer.

I like another book<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Israel-M-Gelfand/dp/0817636773"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Israel-M-Gelfand/dp/0817636773</a><p>for slightly more advanced math learners, including those I teach in the more experienced section of the math classes I teach in my town. Below is a set of quotations and links about math education I send out to parents of newly enrolled students in my classes:<p>LINKS ABOUT LEARNING MATH AND OTHER SUBJECTS<p>I was first introduced to a mathematician writing about how to teach math when a parent told me a decade ago about the article ""Basic Skills Versus Conceptual Understanding: A Bogus Dichotomy in Mathematics Education,""<p><a href=""http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/american_educator/fall99/wu.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/american_educator/fall99/wu....</a><p>by Professor Hung-hsi Wu. His writings have been very influential on my thinking about math education.<p>A link that furthered my process of pondering how to teach mathematics better was Richard Askey's review of the book Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics by Liping Ma.<p><a href=""http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/american_educator/fall99/amed1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/american_educator/fall99/ame...</a><p>Another review of that excellent book<p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf</a><p>is also food for thought.<p>Professor John Stillwell writes, in the preface to his book Numbers and Geometry (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1998):<p>""What should every aspiring mathematician know? The answer for most of the 20th century has been: calculus. . . . Mathematics today is . . . much more than calculus; and the calculus now taught is, sadly, much less than it used to be. Little by little, calculus has been deprived of the algebra, geometry, and logic it needs to sustain it, until many institutions have had to put it on high-tech life-support systems. A subject struggling to survive is hardly a good introduction to the vigor of real mathematics.<p>"". . . . In the current situation, we need to revive not only calculus, but also algebra, geometry, and the whole idea that mathematics is a rigorous, cumulative discipline in which each mathematician stands on the shoulders of giants.<p>""The best way to teach real mathematics, I believe, is to start deeper down, with the elementary ideas of number and space. Everyone concedes that these are fundamental, but they have been scandalously neglected, perhaps in the naive belief that anyone learning calculus has outgrown them. In fact, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry can never be outgrown, and the most rewarding path to higher mathematics sustains their development alongside the 'advanced' branches such as calculus. Also, by maintaining ties between these disciplines, it is possible to present a more unified view of mathematics, yet at the same time to include more spice and variety.""<p>Stillwell demonstrates what he means about the interconnectedness and depth of ""elementary"" topics in the rest of his book, which is a delight to read and full of thought-provoking problems.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387982892/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387982892/</a><p>Richard Rusczyk, a champion math competitor in high school and now a publisher of math textbooks, among other ventures, has written an interesting article ""The Calculus Trap"":<p><a href=""http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Resources/AoPS_R_A_Calculus.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Resources/AoPS_R_A_Calcul...</a><p>I particularly like this article's statement,<p>""If ever you are by far the best, or the most interested, student in a classroom, then you should find another classroom. Students of like interest and ability feed off of each other. They learn from each other; they challenge and inspire each other.""<p>which is one reason to encourage able math learners to learn together.<p>Another good article about a broader rather than narrower mathematics education is<p><a href=""http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~mustopa/thurston_edu.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~mustopa/thurston_edu.pdf</a><p>by William Thurston, a Fields medalist.<p>""Another problem is that precocious students get the idea that the reward is in being ‘ahead’ of others in the same age group, rather than in the quality of learning and thinking. With a lifetime to learn, this is a shortsighted attitude. By the time they are 25 or 30, they are judged not by precociousness but on the quality of work.""<p>I recently read an issue of the MAA Focus newsletter of the Mathematical Association of America, and in the newsletter I saw a link to an article by a math professor<p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf</a><p>who is very concerned about the quality of elementary mathematics education in the United States. She provides many interesting examples of ways elementary teachers can think more mathematically about elementary mathematics and thus teach better.<p>A very interesting article about overcoming learning challenges and thriving from them<p><a href=""http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2007/marapr/features/dweck.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2007/marapr/feat...</a><p>reports the work of psychologist Carol Dweck, who shows how ""growth mindset"" can make learners smarter.",1257466145.0

I respect this <i>tremendously</i>, but...<p>> When I mention this, and when I call out the CEO specifically, people call me arrogant, young, naive, and stupid.<p>...then you've got to be ready for this. You're going to get it your whole life if you keep acting the way you're acting. It upsets people. They think you're acting out of your place, and you haven't put in your hours and earned your stripes and who the hell does this <i>kid</i> think he is? I went through a similar thing when I was younger and went into business.<p>Here's one of my favorite quotes, it's by Bertrand Russel:<p>""Conventional people are roused to fury by departures from convention, largely because they regard such departures as a criticism of themselves.""<p>Okay, so step 1 - you've got to be willing to accept that you're going to provoke reactions like this if you keep acting as you've been acting, questioning authority and the way things are in a very confrontational way. And when people confront you, they won't fight fair and fight your arguments, they'll pull anything out of the hat they can to discredit you or get under your skin. It's going to happen more often rather than less as you go forwards.<p>So if you can accept it, and keep on going, you can do some things. So I support you as someone who dropped out of high school and went into business quite young, and got called all sorts of nasty things too, and I admire you character. With that said:<p>> Fixing AA.com would be ridiculously cheap and simple...<p>This is where you go wrong. No, it probably wouldn't. You can get all the mileage you're currently getting, and a lot more credibility by changing that statement to, ""Hell, maybe there'd be a lot of bureaucracy to cut through to fix AA.com and it'd cost some coin, but it's possible and it needs to be done."" --> Lots more credibility. Doesn't lose much bite.<p>When in doubt, fake the modesty. You'll get much more mileage out of life. Later you might learn that some things are more complicated than they initially appear, but you're going to get better mileage anyway if you sympathize with the difficulties people are likely to face trying to make change. And if you're a little extra nice and sympathetic, and it really would be cheap and easy, then your suggestions sound even more palatable.<p>So - I'm with you, and keep on trucking man. Maybe add a touch of sympathizing with difficulties people face (guess/fake it if you can't see any potential difficulties) and your critique is much more likely to be received well.",1257466111.0
