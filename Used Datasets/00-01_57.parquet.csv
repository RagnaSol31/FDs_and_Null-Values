It is extremely simple to deal with: if I ever feel sick, I show up at a Kaiser facility and pay a $10 co-pay.  If I need tests, I walk down the hall and pay a $20 co-pay.  There is no billing, no headache, no mess. Everything is in one facility and integrated.  The doctors, nurses, and NPs seem competent, if somewhat busy.<p>That said, I've heard that people with rare and specialized conditions have a harder time navigating the Kaiser system, but I'm not sure that it's any worse with other healthcare systems.<p>Overall, it has made me a believer in the HMO model when properly executed.  And it appears that it takes complete integration for it to work right: the joy of Kaiser is having everything in one building and managed through one system.",1273452744.0

I see contact information for the University of Montreal press officer (for follow-up on this press release), but I don't see any citation to anyone's study, and it is not at all clear who constituted the 2003 study population.

I'm a mathematics (and computer science) major at a large, middle of the road university and I can say my experience has been exactly this. I gave my full rant in another comment ( <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1312043"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1312043</a> ). Basically, real mathematics takes a lot of mental resources, so in order to appeal to the masses universities have to make the material mind-numbingly stupid. Remember: it would be unacceptable to large corporations if only 1% of the current engineering graduates were graduating, regardless of how much smarter that smaller group would be.<p>> Of course most smart people I knew would more or less blow off the homework and just ace the tests, and thus they would often end up getting a B- even though they probably understood the material better than anyone else.<p>My Calculus II class graded mostly on the stupid homework (from James Stewart's book, no less) and <i>attendance</i>!<p>Unless you care enough to work hard in highschool and have enough money to go to a school like MIT, ""higher"" education is a huge joke.",1273451185.0
