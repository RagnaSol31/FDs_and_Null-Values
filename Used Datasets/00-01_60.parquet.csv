The idea of ""contributing"" (the way its currently thought of) will have to go away completely. Private ownership is a social construct. In a post-scarcity world our ideas of private ownership will have to change. Society will simply not allow the owner of Acme robot company to literally own everything (because he has a monopoly on labor). A more communal-based society will necessarily spring up. No one will stand for a monstrously imbalanced society.",1331427583.0

For example, we continue to blame the poor for their own poverty, despite putting up barriers at every turn for them.</i><p>Or people blame the blacks for being poor and ""underachieving"", not understanding that they started off in the US as slaves (much worse than anyone starting off as a poor migrant), and were still under segregation rules and heavy racism until at least the 60's.<p>Slave parents aren't exactly a guarantee of success. Sharecroppers parent's (the next generation) aren't either. Then, if you play your cards correctly, you end up with country and urban dirt poor parents, and maybe a small percentage of them can get to middle class --while still seen under suspicion by the wealthier and more white middle and upper class.<p>That a few people can overcome those things and be, say, even the first black President, doesn't mean that statistically everybody can --you don't judge a population by the outliers. The truth is, if they can get to college or get rich, for example, it's a far greatest achievement than the children of a 3rd generation immigrant achieving the same thing.",1331427550.0

There's no correlation between how close the password is to the stored password, and how close the bcrypt hashes are to each other.  You really only care about one thing... does it match or not?  And if it does, you might as well check if it matches the full hash and not the first 8 bits... since you'd only be sending back a binary indicator to the client's browser.<p>You still end up lagging because of the time it takes to do the hash check, and if I were typing in a password I would hit enter and not wait for either a neat grid or a checkmark.  If the password is wrong when the user has voluntarily submitted the form, that's when you break out the red warning, but it shouldn't take any longer to do that than to display a green checkmark.  The difference is one requires the user to press enter first, the other doesn't but requires testing every single intermediate stage the password goes through.<p>Finally, I'm not thrilled with the idea of a page sending incomplete passwords to a server, which may well be compromised, before I press enter.

People do. People do in the sense that more and more an entertainment get views, more it will cost to a subsequent user to play it. The only thing that a creator can do is stopping the price growth at a certain point - of course.<p>So what does it give.<p>First, in the absolute, you can have a play for free as you might had noted, and got to wait around 60 minutes for a next play - ie megaupload.<p>Also, at the beginning - right after the creators has published his/her creation, the price of a play is around 1c (cent). It is mainly for two things:\n1) no way we pay more than 1c for craps and this is the biggest problem in entertainment.\n2) we want mass-entertainment, we are in 2012.<p>If the entertainment is good, it gets views and its price growth - please note again that the creator can choose to stop this growth at the current point - so in a sense he/she is fixing the price of its entertainment, only if it is good enough to do so :) Again, two things:\n1) supporting creators and creations at their beginning is cheaper and it's a good thing\n2) we all like big productions unless their are craps and with this system, we can have big productions.<p>And, why paying per play? Because acquiering has not any sense today. Just an example of how nonsense it is: when you get a game, you play it either 3 plays or 3 years... \nIn addition, acquiering requiere in the end a higher price. So I think the best is to pay according to  the rate we truly consume, not more, not less.<p>Why do the creators can't choose the price and the business model? Because I think entertainment takes a business-free system. Also, I would like a competition based on quality, not on business skills. In the other side, most creators are not able to setup a free-to-play, freemium, subscription-crap, blabla, business model.\nToday, creators have to make something free or they have to work on entertainment factories - as I call them.<p>I want creators to get the most of their money back on townportal. I mean, there is no way a distribution system keep a 30% fees.  \nI've fixed the fees to 10% for the moment. This is a bit to high I think. Ideally, I would like it at around 5%. The thing is I don't know what could be the charge of such website. I will make my possible to push them down at maximum and why not - in fact, I hope! - reach the 5% (if townportal.net live of course).\nSo for the moment, you get 450 gold for $5 and, for the moment, you can play to each entry for 1 gold.<p>If you like this project, it's cool because I like it too.

They did some modeling that shows that it might be possible to use CaMK2 to store information on microtubule lattices. That's purely simulations that show possible interactions between two proteins. No experiments were performed and they did not set out to break the brain code. There are no experiments that show information encoding in microtubules. CaMK2 is known to be involved in plasticity (in spine shape modifications via actin dynamics), but microtubules are assumed to be in the dendritic shafts only thus isolated from phosphorylated CaMK2. It would be worth to investigate further though.",1331424974.0

Although creating an effective shortcut-prevention system may be challenging.  See a bunch of stuff written by Eliezer S. Yudkowsky and his friends.<p>Also, when he writes<p>""It seems like the most important motivations of human civilization are related to near-term goals. This is probably a consequence of the fact that motivation writ large is still embodied in individual humans, who are driven by their evolutionary psychology. Individually, we are unprepared to think like a civilization. Our faint mutual motivation to survive in the long term as a civilization is no match for the ability we have to self-modify and physically reshape the planet.""<p>To me that is implying a fairly obvious and typical line of leftish reasoning that for most of my life I assumed was self-evident and didn't require elaboration.  After deliberately 'exposing' myself to some 'right-wing' thought and 'extreme' 'left-wing' thought, I now realize that aspiring for collectivism is not an adequate solution.<p>What happens with self-interested individuals in our capitalist society is that they aggregate power and resources for their own individual use.  Unfortunately, something very similar happens in collectivism: power and resources are still aggregated in the hands of a few.<p>In other words, both systems tend towards centralization.  Theoretically, the collectivists will aim for redistributing power and resources for the good of the many, but there are a couple of practical problems: they are still living in hierarchical societies and so have strong motivation for enriching themselves and the controllers cannot see enough detail to know what is really best for the rest of society.<p>Command economies don't work because of general problems with centralization and lack of distribution and the limitations of the types of technologies employed.  A peer-to-peer network is more robust than an internet with only a few backbones.<p>Unfortunately, capitalists don't realize that their system also leads to monopoly and centralization.<p>I believe that we do need wholistic measurement and analysis of things like global resources and human equality, and a common principle of supporting the collective good.  But at the same time we need to decentralize and distribute production locally.  We need local decision making that operates on the basis of a global information schema with wholistic data.<p>A system can't be efficient or evolve without being localized, but it also can't be integrated without an accurate shared knowledgebase and an egalitarian perspective.",1331424454.0
