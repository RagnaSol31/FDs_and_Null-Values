64,1269362,comment,1269032.0,1269275.0,0,0,_delirium,,,"I can see some of both sides. From the kernel developers' perspective, wakelocks solve a special-case problem: they only work on systems where frequent suspend/resume is possible (e.g. ARM/SoC style devices), have tight kernel/app integration, and accepting them means basically forking the power-management support within the kernel, with one system for Android-style devices, and another system for everyone else. They'd prefer a more unified power-management API, but solving that problem in a way that works for everyone is a lot harder. AFAICT, nobody on either side has put much effort into solving that general API problem. Not sure who to blame for that, but in theory, the maintainers of the current power-management API could've put forth a counter-proposal for how to accommodate Android's concerns in their framework; or Google could've put forth a revised proposal for how to merge wakelocks-like functionality with the existing power-management API.<p>Some of it might just be a mismatch between how the kernel process works and how Google usually does things. The convention is that when you submit an API-changing patch upstream, you're proposing: I think <i>all users of Linux</i> should have this new API, and you have to be prepared to defend the API design, modify it in response to criticism or concerns, etc. Ideally, you're supposed to get feedback from other potential users before you actually write the code, as opposed to designing everything unilaterally and presenting it as a done deal. From what I can tell, Google's approach was just a one-off: here's what we propose, and btw we already shipped it. Basically, skipped the step where they were supposed to first propose it and ask for feedback.<p>An approach that might've gotten more positive results would be, before sending off the patch, send a short design proposal with something like: ""Hey, for our needs we're thinking of the following API, because [explain why existing APIs are insufficient], and [explain rationale and use cases for this one].

If you have 1mil invested, and you are making 1 mil a year, that's pretty goddamn impressive.  If you have 750 million invested, and you are making 1 million a year profit, well, gee,   I could do better than that buying bonds.<p>Now, Both AAPL and facebook have the P/E ratios they have because people expect them to make more money in the future than they are making now.  For instance, if I was to sell my company (and I've had a few offers)  it looks like I'd get about a year worth of revenue.  This is pretty typical when buying ISPs, because nobody expects exponential growth to go on for any period of time.<p>Just sayin;  It is a reasonable and well-established idea to look at how much equity is invested when looking at a company's profit margins.    It's also reasonable and well-established to look forward at how much profit the company is expected to make in the future, too, which is why facebook is valued as it is by some people.<p>(there is, however, a great degree of uncertainty in projecting what profits a company may make in the future, which is why there is a great deal more controversy over the value of twitter than over the value of AAPL.
