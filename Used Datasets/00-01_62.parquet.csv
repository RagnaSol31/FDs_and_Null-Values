Sure, a lot of people teach themselves to build websites or mobile apps, but ask them to, say, search/filter their results and it's pretty easy to see there's not a whole lot of scientific thinking going on. Learning Computer Science is very different than learning to code (i'm not saying it doesn't happen, but from my experience most casual coders don't care very much about the theoretical underpinnings - and don't often need to, with modern languages).",1307926535.0

Its multiple return means that while it can't return ""Maybe Foo"", it usually returns something like ""Either Error Foo"", with the multiple assignment taking the place of a rather primitive pattern match. Also a go function is typically structured like a primitive Either monad - it returns with an error immediately if it gets one, or else it returns from the end with a value.",1307926509.0

Doing so obviously dramatically changes the complexity of reservations. It is a feature that more traditional rental operations can offer only because they have very large centralized inventories.

(Well, the kid in that thread seems a bit more proficient and forwards thinking than I was, but ey, same sort of deal.) Anyway, I've been playing around with technology soon, and am a college freshman now (doing engineering and physics and such).<p>One of the commenters in previous link said something along the lines of: ""Work on your skills, then you can later earn money consulting at $100/hr"" or something along the lines of that. I'm curious about two things:<p>1. What type of skills should I be working on? What are valuable skills if you're doing consulting?<p>2. I've done some consulting/freelancing, but I haven't really been able to raise my rates above $30/hr or so. Then again, most of the consulting I've done has been for startups and their like - most of which can't afford high rates. How do you get consulting/freelancing gigs? (Mine have been from distant family friends and HN Who's Hiring)<p>[Addendum: For the record, the reason I'm interested is because even though I probably won't need to go into debt to pay for college (scholarships help a lot, a bit parents, a bit saved up), working at higher rates would still help.

No matter how you slice it, it winds up leading to a less efficient allocation of parking spots than the current one spot per car model, it increases the probability of a pissed-off customer who finds that the car from his local spot has semi-permanently vanished to four hundred miles away and nobody is currently planning on one-waying another one in, and it wouldn't necessarily lead to enough increased revenue to make these two downsides worthwhile. In fact it might well lead to less revenue, since someone making (say) an overnight round trip could just book two one-ways instead of a return and wind up saving money.",1307925214.0

Even though nuclear energy does not produce greenhouse gasses and <i>seems</i> to be clean, it is by no means a renewable energy source. For most Germans, clean energy is certainly not the goal, but sustainable and renewable energy is. The article totally confuses these two things.<p>Also, a majority of Germans believes that nuclear energy is just too dangerous to be handled by humans. (Yes, we are pussies in this regard.)<p>The commitment to phase out nuclear energy does not mean to be less commited to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In fact it only means that you have to be more focussed on your goals than before.<p>Personally, I heavily doubt that the cut of 40% in greenhouse gas emissions until 2020 (compared to the level of 1990) will work out. But it is nevertheless good to have these ambitious goals. They have probably led to better legislation to encourage the use of renewable energy than in other countries. On some level these goals put pressure on politicians to do something. If they lead to only 5% reduction, I would already consider it a success.<p>If that scale for success seems stupid to you, you are right. But this is the measurement of success I put on politicians. I don't expect much from them. That's what I learned from the past. Most of them can only think until the next election. 2020 is just too distant to be important for most politicians.",1307924429.0

61,2647718,comment,2647301.0,2647301.0,5,0,Jd,,,"When I was 15 (1997) I was pretty decent in C/C++, Java, Pascal, and HTML/CSS. There weren't really webapps yet, or at least any way to deploy them, and not any way I knew of to work remotely or ask questions of other programmers like there is today -- so I didn't make much money at it and ended up working bagging groceries at my local supermarket instead. So definitely you have a huge heads up on my generation just by what you have. Simply asking this question (including the useful advice I'm sure other HN contributors will offer you) is a great step forward for you and a huge one for mankind.<p>I think the most important thing for you to do, however, is follow your passion. If you are passionate about math, complicated computer science questions, creating apps that make people happy, or something else. My pops strongly pushed me toward MIT but I ended going somewhere else and doing something other than engineering that I ended up finding a lot more passion for and that, even though I haven't (yet!) made a gazillion dollars in silicon valley, I've learned a few other human languages and enriched myself in a number of other ways.<p>So my advice more generally is don't be super narrow if you don't want to be. Get out there and experience the world and other things if you are excited about that. Don't worry about making a flashy web app, unless you have a vision that requires a flashy web app to be executed upon. There are a lot of people in this world doing a lot of different things.<p>Anyways, it may be true that your ideas suck. Ideas can be big (usually they also require large teams for implementation) or small (and potentially growing from an existing need you have yourself or an observed need of a community -- e.g. no apps for cats on iOS). If you need an idea, observe a community, know a market, ask people more specific questions, then execute.<p>Do you need to make money? If so, how much? That's a good question to ask yourself now since there is often a tradeoff between coding for cash and pursuing other interesting problems (things like Project Euler certainly don't hurt either way).<p>However, potentially the most useful piece of advice I have for you is go social. I didn't do that myself until later in my career, but I found it helps tremendously. Find a project that you are excited about and start contributing code (even if it is a very minor way). Your code will get better much faster if other people are reading it and esp. if other people who know what good code looks like critique it. In fact, probably the folks who contribute to such projects will be more valuable critics than profs at Stanford or wherever else you end up (not that it isn't a bad idea to get a good education, but remember that's not all there is to the world).<p>Good luck!",1307924262.0

But when they venture outside, such as this case of trying to give a quick overview of what makes a technology company successful over the long term, it's obvious that they're out of their depth.  Similarly, when CR rates something like bicycles or even high tech gadgets, it can be a little embarrassing, because a lot of time they focus on the wrong attributes out of unfamiliarity.<p>On the other hand, I think we could put together a pretty august panel of experts on the topic of tech company success out of HR readers, and end up with no suitable conclusion, and ultimately do no better than this Economist article.",1307924229.0

Often, especially if you're using map and filter a lot, you need utility functions that convert other functions or methods to taking a single parameter. In particular, you often want to bind some data to the function once, and then apply it repeatedly to different objects. In the above example, we needed a function that multiplied a particular field of an object by 3, but what we really want is a factory that's able to return for any field name and amount a multiplier function in that family:</i><p><pre><code>  def multiply_by_field(fieldname, multiplier):\n    """"""Returns function that multiplies field ""fieldname"" by multiplier.""""""\n    def multiplier(x):\n        return getattr(x, fieldname) * multiplier\n    return multiplier\n\n  triple = multiply_by_field('Count', 3)\n  quadruple = multiply_by_field('Count', 4)\n  halve_sum = multiply_by_field('Sum', 0.5)\n</code></pre>\nOther languages (most prominently Haskell, though you can convince most Lisps to do it through the clever use of macros) have built-in support for doing this with whatever function you want, and it's called partial function application. It's a rather useful technique and it saddens me that it's not supported as such in more languages claiming to support functional programming.",1307923913.0

And so instead of designing two separate sites, let's design something that looks good on (a) and (b), and also has an intermediate state that we pass through when resizing the window between (a) to (b). Nobody would actually care for these intermediate states (because, frankly, who does routinely browse on a desktop at 500px in width?), but since we <i>can</i> generalize, let's do it. And also let's call it some fancy name and put some theory behind it.<p>Point being - I don't see a point in responsive layouts.<p>There are two extremes - the desktops and the small-screen mobile devices. These cover 99.9% of all users.
