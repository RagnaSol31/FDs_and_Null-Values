If the police forces of the US even showed <i>some</i> inclination of willingness to police the actions of their own, then we wouldn't have most of these problems.<p>Here in Seattle we've had an unprovoked shooting of a homeless man, to which the officer involved was allowed to resign gracefully, despite all parties agreeing that the was no provocation nor justification. Another officer body-slammed an innocent man (without warning, provocation, or identifying himself) into a wall so hard he is now in a vegetative state. This man <i>remains on the force</i>. Similarly, another officer was caught on store surveillance taking his rage out on a teenager in a convenience store, stomping on his face, after a failed drug bust next door. That officer remains on the force also.<p>Not all cops do these things, but they are all guilty of covering up these acts and ensuring that, even if they do get out to the public, that no real consequences occur for the officers involved.<p>I will have zero trust for any police force until they have proven their ability and willingness to police <i>themselves</i>.<p>> <i>""Try to find a case of word vs. word (no other evidence) and the man was found not guilty.

Rather, it's pretty clear:<p>What constitutes infringement of moral rights?<p>VARA grants two rights to authors of visual works: the right of attribution, and the right of integrity. The right of attribution allows an author to prevent misattribution of a work, and to require that the authorship of the work not be disclosed (i.e. remain anonymous). The right of integrity bars intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of a work if that distortion is likely to harm the author's reputation, and prevents the destruction of any work of recognized stature. Therefore, if I paint moustaches on a painting by a famous painter such as Roy Lichtenstein or Frank Stella, I will have violated the artist's moral rights under VARA. If I paint moustaches on an Andy Warhol painting on the other hand, I will not have violated Warhol's VARA rights, because VARA protection ends with the death of the author.<p>Source: <a href=""http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property/library/moralprimer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property/library/moralprimer.ht...</a><p>You may say that ""pixelizing"" the photo caused no harm; the photographer obviously had a different opinion; to wit, that his ""right of integrity"" was harmed.

It seems inevitable under the capitalist system that increasing automation in all fields will widen the wealth gap considerably, as the most productive people become many times (perhaps many orders of magnitude) as productive as the least. The difference between someone who performs a task and someone who can program many cheap machines to do the same thing will grow much, much wider as machines become cheaper to buy and operate. The owners of those machines will become extremely rich unless wealth redistribution becomes more common. Large social changes or revolution seem like they'll become required.<p>At some point, though, once every type of work can be done by machines, wealth could probably be redistributed in such a way that noone had to work very much.

I haven't been working on it in quite a while so I really don't speak for the current team.<p>First off, I'm super proud of these guys finishing off this work. It was a long time coming.<p>As for why we chose XMPP over SIP: The team had made the choice to base the core IM product on XMPP before I joined.  That decision was based on the ease of implementation and interoperability.  XMPP for IM is much simpler than SIP/SIMPLE.  The easiest answer here is that it was the most logical fit to the product we had built at the time.<p>My personal opinion of SIP is based on a 6 year old snapshot of the technology.  Things have undoubtedly changed in the meantime.  Based on that snapshot, I wasn't a fan at the time.<p>- It is an amazingly complex and confusing technology.  It is worth noting that SIP is the longest IETF RFC out there.  Meanwhile, the core XMPP spec is easy to understand and implement.  It is also an IETF standard. Extensions are well modularized and documented.<p>- The security is hacked on after the fact and, at the time, was unevenly implemented. In basic SIP, one unauthenticated UDP packet makes a phone ring.  XMPP security is based on TLS and DNS and is a required part of the core.<p>- Federation was a patchy mess and showed SIP's telecom roots.  You pretty much had to get the lawyers involved to do anything.  Federation in XMPP is a DNS SRV lookup.<p>The world has moved forward since then so hopefully this provides some context for the decision at the time.",1308874985.0

The one thing missing is key-value observing between my DOM elements and my data. I was hoping the jQuery datalink API would have matured, but the scope of the API is limited and the implementation is somewhat confusing to me.<p>So I decided to start writing one that initially assumes Backbone (since it has events built in). Since Backbone's controllers aren't traditional controllers, I linked the DOM element via the View to the Model the View represents. There are quite a few assumptions being made in the implementation and lots of room for improvement in the API, names of things, and performance.<p>If you clone the repo, you can just open index.html since I pre-built the JS for the time being.
