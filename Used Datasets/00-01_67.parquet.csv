It doesn't matter what gold costs right now if the USD experiences further free-fall, which is not out of the question.<p>This is generally the same reason there are buyers of sovereign debt (i.e. Treasury Notes) at a negative interest rate.<p>If the Eurozone collapses, as is more possible every day now, then that's a case in point for diversifying away from Euros. Some other choices in this <i>Great Recession</i> are USD, U.S. Treasury Notes, Japanese Yen, Swiss Francs, etc, none particularly attractive right now. The Chinese Yuan isn't a viable choice because it is pegged to the dollar.<p>[Edit:] The point is to deal with the current high risk of currency free-fall, <i>not</i> your normal everyday investment ebb and flow.",1266281904

Yes, the animations and scrollings are probably smoother - that's actually what I hate about Apple stuff. I don't care about fancy animations, I want to get things done. The smooth animations of Apple things just make me feel cheap, like a marketing whore. Not to say that Android isn't pretty, but I am guessing iPhone fans would have trouble adapting.<p>The Nexus is the first real mobile internet device I own - might be part of the excitement. But I am actually surprised how well everything works. I was expecting Android to remain in perpetual beta state, but it seems very usable to me.<p>I know I should be more excited about iPhone development, because of the huge money making opportunities. But I just can't. iPod and MacBook have been sitting on my desk for a year and I could not really get started. Getting a Nexus just made click and I feel enthusiastic about coding once again. Ever since I got it last week, I spent every spare minute on coding for it. Unfortunately I hate Java, but for the time being I try to see how far I can get with HTML+Javascript, otherwise, maybe some of the JVM languages can be made to run.",1266281858

A robot truck will most certainly be marked distinctively so the human drivers know there's a computer at the wheel.

Possibly, driving a robot truck down a street would even reduce the <i>human-on-human</i> accident rate.<p>And the robot truck companies would be insane not to protect themselves. They would be wise to take a page out of the commercial aircraft industry's playbook, and instrument the hell out of each vehicle. Continuous engine telemetry and redundant camera views of the immediate vicinity recorded on a 30-minute loop, frozen after a crash and a core dump of the ""driver"" appended to the record for crash reconstruction.

If you have an idea that doesn't exist already, it's probably for a seriously good reason or it does exist somewhere and is performing poorly enough that you can't even find it after browsing 10 pages deep on a keyword search. What i learned from Ben Horrowitz, was that you need to find something that does work and has current market share (and market size), and make it 10x better. Making things 10x better and going after a defined market is the way to go.

Trying to reduce the crew further would be chasing diminishing returns.\nWhile it's possible to build a vessel that navigates itself from port to port they will at least need some engineers on board to fix equipment when it breaks. It wouldn't be safe to leave a robot ship drifting powerless in mid-ocean. The crew is also able to do a lot of routine maintenance during transit. Without a crew, the ship would have to spend longer in port just to have enough maintenance time.",1266279800
