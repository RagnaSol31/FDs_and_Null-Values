16,2593588,comment,2591535.0,2593575.0,2,0,kenjackson,,,"Your point (1) is wrong.  From 2010, before the iPad:<p>""A report in the Wall Street Journal notes that in the 2010 Apple fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 26, iPhone and related product revenues came to $5.6 billion, 36 percent of Apples revenue total. That compares with $4.45 billion for total computers and $3.39 billion for iPods. The iPhone, clearly, is largely responsible for doubling Apples sales over the past three years. Even though computer sales are up sharply at Apple, iPod sales have been roughly flat over the same period.<p>The associated increase in gross profit margin is even more impressive. The iPhone carries higher margins than do other Apple products, so the gross revenue of the company has increased from 31 percent to 48 percent over that same three-year period. ""<p><a href=""http://iphonetouch.blorge.com/2010/01/27/apple-gets-more-revenue-from-iphone-than-from-macs-or-ipods/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iphonetouch.blorge.com/2010/01/27/apple-gets-more-rev...</a><p>Apple only made 33% of their revenue from their computers.  And even moreso, as noted in that article, the iPhone carried much higher margins than their other products.  I don't think its any stretch to believe that margins on the iPad are similarly large.<p>IOW, even if the iPad cannibalized all of their Mac sales, they were on solid ground, because its clear their revenue and margin growth was not the Mac, but the iPhone and eventually the iPad.  It was obvious that iOS was their key platform, not OSX.  Nothing is a sure shot in business, but this was about as easy a call as it gets.<p>On (2) we were explicitly not talking about disrupting an industry.  We were talking about Apple disrupting itself.<p>I don't think it was at all gutsy for Apple to sell iPads.  The market math just made too much sense.  WebApps are gutsy for Apple now, since it undermines their huge app ecosystem.  New devices that build on their iOS platform are not gutsy nor disruptive (unless they do something like give iOS away for free and make money just from the appstore).",1306543853.0

52,2593550,comment,2593265.0,2593265.0,1,0,guygurari,,,"At least part of the problem is in communicating great discoveries to the general public. Let me give an example. In the last few decades, Cosmology transformed from being a speculative, mostly theoretical field to a precise, quantitative science. Experiments that measured the Cosmic Microwave Background (WMAP in 2001 and others) enabled us to form a history of the universe that is backed by evidence. Measurements of supernovae (1998) showed the universe is accelerating (an amazing fact by itself) and from this we understand its future behavior.<p>Within Cosmology, I think the theory of inflation (Guth, 1980) deserves special mention. Its purpose is to explain what happened before what most people think of as The Big Bang, and it does so successfully, agreeing with highly nontrivial experimental tests (with data collected by WMAP and others). The fact that we can say something meaningful about what happened before the big bang, and then check it experimentally -- isn't it just mind blowing? What's  fascinating is that inflation requires quantum mechanics and general relativity to work together to produce the effects we measure in the microwave background -- the very effects that are later crucial for the formation of galaxies. [1]<p>And yet, no one I talked to outside the physics community is even remotely aware of any of this. We are making great strides toward understanding where we came from -- the very origins of the universe -- and yet almost no one seems to notice. Wouldn't surprise me if there are similar examples in other fields.<p>[1] The basic picture is that the microscopic uncertainties of QM are amplified by GR to become cosmic-scale perturbations, which later collapse (due to gravity) to form galaxies.",1306542117.0

That is because they have been through startups over and over again, these people understand the work that goes into the company months/years post-idea-conception.<p>I would say a good portion of the people who are reading this site won't fall into that category. As a matter of fact, very few people do. Most of us are just budding entrepreneurs trying to our feet wet and trying to find our way to ""make it"".<p>If you feel you fall into the latter category more than the former, read Manu's post with a grain of salt, it's _not_ really meant for you.<p>I'd argue (with my limited knowledge) that it's more important for young entrepreneurs to know that ideas are a dime a dozen. By the time you come up with it, 10 other people have thought of it as well. What separates great ideas from good ideas is that you have a clear competitive advantage that can allow you to out-execute those other 10 people. This competitive advantage can be your passion, skill set, domain knowledge, connections, etc.<p>So if I have to sum it up, and to modify Manu's post to fit the eyes of the budding entrepreneurs:<p><pre><code>  It's not the idea that matters, it's the people + the idea that matters.\n\n</code></pre>\n- my 2c",1306541852.0

Very frequently, as stated in the article, some ideas are ""dead on arrival"". This is because founders don't have the proper frame of reference, they're expertise is lacking, or they've made some concept framed early on their baby - that is, unable to let go. Ideas need to be vetted. Like getting your first customers, in whatever you do, you need approval from something or someone to know that something is there, and you need it fast.<p>You can't be in your basement grinding with one other person for four months just to find out you misappropriated your customer base, or the problem your software solves, only to find out there's nobody has that problem, nobody cares, or some amalgamation of that and many other factors.<p>I see this elsewhere as well. People want to be a model their whole life but never had a hope from the getgo. They want to be an architect but their frame of reference is so off they'll never have a chance. Not saying that work can't make up for a lot of it, but I'll never in the NBA. Talent dictated that. There are several other dictators that create the same boundaries as well.",1306541803.0

Let me try again on a few points.<p>Are you saying that one statistical error in a probabilistic model makes the entire model wrong?  Then you'd equally have to say that one logical error in a categorical model makes it equally wrong.  And manifestly, there are many logical errors in all grammars. So I'm not sure what your point is here.<p>I'm interested to know: I quoted Chomsky: ""That's a notion of [scientific] success that's very novel. I don't know of anything like it in the history of science."" Do you agree with him?  If so, do you judge all the Science and Cell articles as not being about accurately modeling the world and only about providing insight?  Or do you think Chomsky meant something else by that?<p>I understand that there are two goals, accurately representing the world, and finding satisfactorily simple explanations. I think Chomsky has gone too far in ignoring the first, but I acknowledge that both are part of science.  I further think that statistical/probabilistic models of language are better for both goals. This is obvious to me after working on the problem for 30 years, so maybe it is hard for me to explain why.  I think Manning, Pereira, Abney, and Lappin/Shreiber do a good job of it. Also, I don't see how a system that successfully learns language could be anything other than statistical and probabilistic. I agree it is a long ways away ...<p>-Peter Norvig",1306541069.0
