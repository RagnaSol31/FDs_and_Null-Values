Now, you have two options: one, do you go with Google or Facebook, or YP.com, or some other company probably from ""California"" that you just don't trust; or two, go with your local newspaper who has a very similar product and who you've done business with your entire life?<p>These people are our customers.  I've actually heard folks say ""I don't trust those California people""--wrap your mind around that and get back to me.<p>The truth is that by partnering with newspapers Seeing Interactive has a potential sales force of 30,000 trusted-local reps.

I've had a very successful career so far and I haven't left a job yet without the people I was working being very sad about it.<p>It seemed like a good job and I got no warning signals going into it. The trouble I'm having is that there is no work for me to do there. That's a bit of an exaggeration but not by much. I mostly sit around all day and try my best to keep myself busy optimizing SQL and reading some documentation.<p>I've been there over a month and while having asked for work repeatedly I'm told there either is nothing or that I will get some bugs assigned to me--then the bugs never come unless I complain more. I'm happy to get any work I don't really care but it seems weird that they even hired me. They're continuing to hire in my group and I've been wondering why exactly. I also have had no one explain to me anything that's going on in this system. Normally they have an orientation process but for some reason I wasn't given that when I started.<p>So I'm left with little to do all day and no real knowledge of the system so it's hard for me to come up with work on my own. So I guess my question is:<p>- Is this even close to normal for a start-up?<p>- Should I seriously consider bailing after such a short period of time?<p>I'm not really looking for direct advice but just help processing what's going on.
