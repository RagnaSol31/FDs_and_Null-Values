She just took the ""wrong"" seat.</i><p>Ah, the intellectual inconsistency of conservatism, where condemnation or condonation is so dependent upon the arrow of time. Urging caution to slow down the rate of societal change is valid; fallacious arguments to further that goal are not.<p>At the time, the same cryptofascist arguments were bandied about for dear Rosa - she's upsetting the system of segregation between seats, she's destroying the value of the bus lines because white people won't want to ride them, she's delaying the bus and inconveniencing others, she's destroying the value of all businesses that rely on serving white customers, etc etc etc.<p>But since Rosa Parks is in the past, we embrace Rosa Parks and claim her as part of our American Heritage, responsible for helping usher in an era of freedom and equality. She was guilty of breaking the law, but consciously and respectfully submitted to the immutable system. But the system was wrong back then, so we no longer consider her a criminal.<p>But Aaron Swartz? He's guilty of stealing (hold pinky to mouth) <i>millions</i> of dollars. For a straightforward downloading of too many articles combined with an upsetting mens rea. Use the vague modern-witch hunting laws to lock him in the clink and throw away the key!<p>I agree that Aaron Swartz is guilty - of breaking into a closet.

23,4530903,comment,4530217.0,4530431.0,4,0,sethladd,,,"If Dart, at first blush, looks familiar, then we've done our job. :) We freely admit that our job was not to make the world's most pure or esoteric language. Dart is a tool to get real jobs done and to be easy to use for a wide range of developers. Our hackathon experience shows that our learning curve is low.<p>That being said, if you poke around and try the language, you'll see quite a few significant improvements and exciting features. I wouldn't say it's ""slightly better"", I would say there are some significant enhancements.<p>Some significant improvements include:<p>* Isolates for shared-nothing concurrency. Shared-state threads are error prone.<p>* Optional types. You don't always need to prove the entire world is validated by some ceremonial type checker. Web programming especially is a workflow where you want to ""write some code, hit reload"" and iterate as fast as possible. Also, sometimes you just can't express what you want with your type system. Optional types is a way to say ""I was going to cast to Object anyway, so let's dispence with the pleasantries and just use var.""<p>* Everything is an object. No more ""some things are primitives, some things aren't.""<p>* Arbitrarily sized integers. 'nuff said.<p>* Not everything has to be in a class. Dart has top-level functions. This makes utility libraries significantly easier to use.<p>* A package manager as a native part of the ecosystem. This encourages 3rd party developers to share code early.<p>* Significantly faster start up. Go ahead and print out all the classes that are loaded when you run a simple Hello World program with the JVM. We'll wait. :)<p>* (related to the above) All Dart programs actually start running with main(). Turns out, this is not the case in JVM, due to how statics are initialized.<p>* Snapshots. Load code and libraries from a serialized binary heap. Significant startup performance improvements.<p>* Compile-time constants. These are canonicalized, and make for easy way to share data across isolates (they are immutable, for instance).<p>* Named optional parameters, with default values.<p>* All exceptions are uncaught.<p>* Throw any object. So you can throw ""This is a crazy one-off error""<p>* Dartdoc comments can have markdown. This is awesome. :)<p>* A file can have a mix of classes and top-level functions.<p>* Lexical closures!  (no more need for anonymous inner classes)<p>* Operator overloading.<p>* Method cascades. See <a href=""http://www.dartlang.org/articles/m1-language-changes/",

If a baby formula manufacturer includes melamine in baby formula (happened with Chinese baby formula a couple years back), but is able to get the FDA to rate it safe, it's not just the FDA's failure - the manufacturer has the best information about what's going into the formula, the regulator has much less, and the buyer has next to nothing to go on, except for a little blurb about how it was made.<p>Many of the banks have claimed that since the regulators rated these things well, why should they be held accountable? The buyer is supposed to be educated if they're playing in this league, caveat emptor (this is a pervasive attitude in banks). I think that's bullshit, because when the banks securitize this stuff, they're abstracting away the underlying layers, and it's effectively closed source.

For an everyday most common 5,000 words that may be ok but anything outside of that would require the invention of many new words when English likely already has them.  They don't really mean anything in English either - for example ""quantum mechanics"" are just two words, and have to be learned even for English speakers.  When coming from another language you may as well use whatever words others are already using.  You can see that happening when other language speakers adopt English words.<p>There are other factors - English speakers readily adopt words from other languages as needed.  This makes it a lot easier to expand.  Compare with the Acadmie franaise: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise</a><p>Look at what people all over the world are constantly bombarded with - Hollywood's output is shown (and popular) everywhere. As are words like Coca-Cola, McDonalds, Nike and Apple.  Even Bollywood is including increasing amounts of English in its output.  Popular entertainers in various countries have also taken to singing some or all of their songs in English.<p>Look at generating input.  There is a bias to a reasonably small number of symbols.  A 500 key keyboard isn't practical (although variations exist).  Having many modes and switching amongst them isn't that pleasant either.  We already see people dropping case from English where is it mostly cosmetic.  (Of course voice recognition is always around the corner but isn't practical in many environments and has always been around the corner.)<p>It is acceptable to speak English ""badly"" - did I tell you about the time that:  the mat cat sat upon?  I've heard from speakers of other languages that just getting the gender wrong in a sentence is enough to make it extremely hard to understand.<p>My prediction is that the number of speakers of English as a second language will continue to climb since it is the most friction free way of communicating in many circumstances, and that will rapidly lead to their kids adopting it as a first language.  Heck all the people I know who have a non-English language as their first language have their kids speaking English as their first language.<p>TLDR:  English makes a very good lowest common denominator",1347840283.0
