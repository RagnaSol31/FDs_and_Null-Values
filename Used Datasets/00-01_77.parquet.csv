All we're really using the fusion for is to create heat, and there are many ways to get heat inexpensively (solar, geothermal, coal, natural gas) that don't involve temperatures of hundreds of millions of degrees, that don't require superconducting coils, liquid helium cooling systems, ultra-high precision machined tungsten tiles, structural materials that are vaguely defined, completely unsourced, untested at the correct neutron fluxes, and rely upon rare earth elements, liquid lithium systems from which we're supposed to do tritium recovery (lithium is really reactive, tritium bubbles up and is explosive and diffuses through walls and embrittles them), liquid lithium <i>walls</i> on the inside of the chamber; high vacuum vacuum pumps, giant particle beams and incredibly non-linear and poorly understood science. You're comparing that to coal and mirrors and holes drilled in the ground and wind, all of which ultimately go into some kind of turbine (which is half or most of the expense!)

The default for strings is to parse them as numbers (""10"" + ""20"" yields the number 30), and a string that doesn't start with a number defaults to zero.<p>If Perl does anything wrong here, it is in not throwing a type error at runtime but just silently coercing the number.

You don't get the distribution or sales channel of the App Store (which in spite of all it's faults is still a very valuable thing). If you're developing games, you're going to be giving a cut to whatever sites you're hosted on, etc.<p>Actually you can use Open source tools to develop flash apps, like OpenLaszlow.

All I know is that there are existing apps I want to use, and I want to use them on my iPhone.

We're talking about the web, and the web is increasingly used from machines that aren't desktops or laptops. Flash may be installed on 98% or so of desktops and laptops, but if you include ""all devices capable of using the web"", Adobe's share is much lower and is actually shrinking, and not just because of Apple's products. In terms of who you can reach, Flash is on much shakier footing than most people realize.<p>And yet there are still flash apps that I want to use that aren't available on the iPhone.<p>Please understand my concern is not whether this decision was a great decision for Apple. I'm only concerned about whether or not Apple is serving my needs, and whether or not blocking flash is a way to increase their profits or my enjoyment.<p>And frankly I believe at least part of Apple's intentions in blocking flash is to lock you in their own proprietary platform: the app store.",1264983521.0

The article is based around the fallacy we've seen time and time again, of throwing more cryptography at a problem that cryptography alone cannot solve. In the end, a crappy password is a crappy password. Successfully discouraging your users from using a crappy password has much better repercussions (for the user, for you, and for the web in general) than switching from a hash-based authentication system to bcrypt. Use bcrypt for additional security, but do not use it in an attempt to solve the problem of crappy passwords that the article falsely claims bcrypt solves.<p>To be more technical, bcrypt, like PBKDF2 and other schemes of that nature, add a significant amount of additional computation by iteratively applying a primitive, but still maintain a relatively small circuit size (in comparison to the primitive itself, which is usually designed to fit onto smart cards and the like). Creating and using algorithms which are ""memory-hard"" or require larger circuits reduces the number of circuits one can place on some area of silicon and drives up the cost of an attack. In other words, mounting an attack on bcrypt or PBKDF2 is still cheaper and potentially much faster than we'd like it to be (which is the reason those algorithms are ""tunable""--you scale the number of iterations up as computers become faster). This, along with some example memory-hard functions was the topic of Percival's paper, ""Stronger Key Derivation via Sequential Memory-Hard Functions,"" which correctly cites Bernstein as the source of emphasis on practicality in measuring an attack not by computational complexity, but the cost of launching the attack.
