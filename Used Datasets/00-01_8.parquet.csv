Our teacher was an idiot, and had trouble solving the more difficult proofs at the end of the homework.  Day after day I would go up to the board and write down the solution to the problem he couldn't solve.  Then, I would get an F for not turning in my homework, which I rightly considered to be a waste of my time, and the people who copied down my answers would get an A's.  That was when I decided I had enough formal mathematical education.  I taught myself the math to do AP chemistry in high school and tested out of pre calculus in 2000 in college.  I am currently teaching myself calculus from Michael Spivak's Calculus.  You couldn't get me back in a math class, but I love learning math.",1212368099

7,206319,story,,,1,2,LPTS,The Y Combinator Problem,,"I thought I'd see if anyone had thoughts on this.  This is a slightly modified version of something I wrote in response to Umair Haque's recent article discussed here:  http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=203400<p>In order for any of the other hacks Haque is concerned with to work, someone needs to hack the VC system and the networking system. Here is why hacking the VC system is essential to get any of these other large scale hacks to work.<p>The incestuous networks that surround most VC culture and the amazingly stupid way people pitch to VC's almost guarantees that no interesting solutions are funded. Trying to fit the correct solution to a huge problem (or even an adequate discussion of the intricacies of the problem necessary to understanding it well enough to evaluate the idea) into a VC pitch is impossible. Any presentation that attempts it will be a wreck.<p>I propose we call this the Y Combinator problem(1). These people turn solving the worlds problems into a game show that guarantees no deeply needed ideas get through or are discussed seriously. The idea that an idea without implementation is worthless kills innovation and is deeply flawed. It's true most of the time, but, it's not true in exactly the most important cases where the ideas involve solving a huge problem. Trying to fit a deeply needed solution to a huge problem into a pitch to a VC is like asking a potential Tolstoy to pitch ""War and Peace"" as a Haiku (2). The complexity of the problems that most need solving guarantee it is impossible to pitch them in ten minutes or a couple paragraphs of text.<p>Indeed, the truth reveals itself that most VC's are satisfied with this good enough system and are not interested in putting the effort to get the best ideas and support them however needed, to solve the biggest problems. If they would they would apply a fractional percentage of the effort they put into paperwork into refining their fatally flawed process, the other solutions would just fall out of that. In fact, it is obvious that they actively inoculate themselves from the best ideas.<p>It's exactly parallel to what happened in physics between Einsteinin and Newtonian conceptions of physics. The Newtonians were right enough to be right most of the time, and they were happy to just keep on doing newtonian physics. But the world isn't like that, and there are problems they will never even possibly solve.<p>Also, you must take into account the personalities of the people prone to solve these problems. The same obsessive interests, divergent thought processes and lack of social ability that makes for the most creative problem solvers makes these people unsuited to implement their ideas in the real world (in the same way that Einstein did not do the experiments to confirm his theories and got help with math. A quote: ""Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater."").<p>If you are serious about getting the best answers to the big problems, you need to remove the barriers to entry for the kind of people who solve the biggest problems, and create a channel for them to pitch. You want people who think in pictures or paragraphs or kinesthetic sensations (for example, Einstein said he thought with his muscles, and that violin playing related to problem solving). VC's should solve the Y combinator problem by creating a way for people with big solutions to huge problems to pitch their idea however they think it should best be pitched (have them write or show, then give the good ones coaching and whatever types of help they need, and find businesspeople who actually want to work with the best ideas to manage the rest.) You need the philosophers and visionaries that are excluded by the design of the good enough system that ends up calcifying it's mediocrity into the economy.<p>Until someone solves this fundamental issue, none of the other big problems with will be funded as easily as myspace apps to sell ads to 15 year old girls.<p>Solving that problem is the best way to start hacking the industrial economy because it will unleash a torrent of creativity that has been restrained by illogical restrictions that cripple the people historically shown to be most likely to solve the big problems.<p>(1)  As someone or another I read said about Cory Doctorow, Please don't read this as I have a problem with Y combinator.  I don't.  I have a Y Combinator problem\n(2)  How about:\nfive hundred people /\nblah blah blah blah blah blah blah /\nThank God it's over<p>See. It would never get through.",1212367242

9,206317,comment,206107.0,206156.0,0,0,stcredzero,,,"There was some talk about letting multiple images of VisualWorks Smalltalk share memory.  that way, you could put the Class Library and all that jazz into shared memory, which would be shared by multiple instances of the VM and image which would hold runtime state and stuff like the account data you mention.  If you then wrote a facility to save the shared and non-shared stuff separately and in two different files, then you'd have it.<p>Also, there was a variant of Smalltalk built in the days just before and after the ParcPlace/Digitalk merger that was designed to be usable for writing quick and dirty admin apps.  The minimal image was tiny.  Something like 45k.<p>In any case, there doesn't need to be any barrier to non-image based development in such a virtual machine.  Just about any virtual machine has an image in memory.  Image based development is about being able to code in the debugger -- about having absolute runtime power over all aspects of the development environment.  If you don't need 100% of that, then you don't need image-based development in any virtual machine.<p>(Because Smalltalk went whole-hog into having this absolute runtime power over everything, even the dev environment, the image became a strange loop, and could not be rebuilt from source due to these chicken-egg paradoxes.  But since you already have an image, it doesn't matter.  Example: nil is an instance of UndefinedObject, a subclass of Object, whose superclass is nil.)",1212367058

But I think it's worth pointing out that in another current article on HN (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=205869"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=205869</a>), Freeman Dyson has some interesting things to say about it:<p><i>Q: Does any of that [concept of ""The Singularity""] resonate with you?<p>Dyson: Not at all. The technical tricks these people are talking about are only a small part of the human experience. They vastly overestimate their own importance. I look at the world in a very different way. It's partly a matter of being old, but I look at the subway networks in cities, for instance. They also have the N-squared law. If you have a subway network with N routes, its value to the passenger is N squared. That's fine. But once you get to a certain number of routes, like 20 or so, there's very rapid growth, followed by saturation. This will also happen with chips. To some extent, it already has. It's true that the price per megaflop is going down according to Moore's Law, but what you can do with the processing power isn't increasing at the same rate.\nI remember doing a study on the cost of nuclear power in the 1950s, when people thought it would be very cheap. We studied what the economic effect would be if the cost of electricity were zero. The answer is, ""Not much."" It costs far more to use electricity than it does to make it. There's about a 5 percent drop in the GNP if electricity is free. So cheap energy is all it takes. The same is true of computing power.</i>",1212366669
