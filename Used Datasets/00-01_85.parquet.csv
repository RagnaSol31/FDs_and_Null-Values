Are you arguing that the analog output of a (filtered, idealized) DAC would look different depending on whether the dac was running at 44.1kHz vs 192kHz?  If so, I don't think many people would agree with you.<p>Any difference in the ""timing"" of the output wave would have to come from energy that falls above nyquist of the slower sample rate.  So, while I agree with you that the timing would be sharper, this is exactly caused by ""higher frequencies"", not by some other sort of timing improvement.",1330995571.0

7,3669174,comment,3668310.0,3668853.0,2,0,blackhole,,,"I am not getting these things mixed up, because the sample rate is related to the maximum frequency that can be stored, and lo and behold, look at all these people claiming that those higher frequencies matter. 44.1 kHz sample rate can only encode tones up to about 22 kHz, whereas 192 can encode  frequencies of up to 81 kHz, and those people up there are arguing that these higher frequencies are exactly why 192 kHz is superior. Now, if you want to say that sampling a tone at 44100 times per second somehow won't sound as good than 192000 times per second, I'm not saying that isn't possible, but I don't really take that claim seriously at all.<p>The fact is, simply distributing music in lossless format carries the vast majority of audible improvements. Arguing over whether or not its 24-bit or 16-bit or making a chunk of sound last 5.2 microseconds instead of 22.67 seems incredibly stupid to me, because you're better off simply improving the mix itself then fiddling over such microscopic differences. These things only become relevant if your mix and performance and recording equipment (or synths) are absurdly close to perfection. This becomes even LESS relevant in an age of indie-musicians.",1330995408.0

It means people 'hear' differences because of subconscious cues and preferences that have nothing to do with the audio, like preferring a more expensive (or more attractive) amplifier over a cheaper option.</i><p><i>The human brain is designed to notice patterns and differences, even where none exist. This tendency can't just be turned off when a person is asked to make objective decisions; it's completely subconscious. Nor can a bias be defeated by mere skepticism. Controlled experimentation shows that awareness of confirmation bias actually increases rather than decreases the effect!</i><p>Doesn't that completely negate his conclusion, that there is no point to distributing 24/192 music?

They get decent at like 3 languages, stagnate, and become dinosaurs. That's why so many systems suck when those guys retire and the new guys come in. I think that sucks and it should be avoided but my point is, what does make you a real coder/programmer/whatever you want to call it?

I have a deep respect for everyone here who I know knows far more than I could hope to know but at this moment I'm a little disgusted by how out of touch everyone seems.
