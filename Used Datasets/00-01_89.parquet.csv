They couldn't care less if our manufacturing doubled in terms of dollars of output. What they really want is a return to the highly paid, unionized, tradesperson.<p>To them robots making Chevy trucks matters just as much to their lives as nerds writing software. As productivity increases continue, demand for noncerebral labor declines as a ratio for demand of cerebral labor. Even if the average tradesperson is better of today than 40 years ago (they have cars with AC, for example) they want their <i>relative</i> standing to increase. They used to be paid, say, half of what the engineer made, now its a fifth. That really, really pisses them off, so they take it out on China.<p>Combine that with the fact that 40 years ago ""mom"" stayed home, converting (tax free) raw ingredients into delicious food, as well as watched the children and mended the clothes. Now they buy less healthy instant food and need to find a way to pay for daycare, as well as a second car to get to work, and if they are American, substantially inflated healthcare costs.<p>I'm not envious of their position.",1297040393.0

An applicant may have used C for 20 years and be a ""C expert,"" but have poor application/system design sense.<p>Many hiring managers (and their technical staff) I've talked to lately have been only superficially interested in the technologies (languages, frameworks, etc.) I've used, and much more curious about how I go about solving problems and designing overall solutions.  Several have flat-out said they're hiring smart, motivated, creative people, and are happy to train new hires on parts of their technology stack with which they're unfamiliar.<p>So I agree that an accomplishments-based approach might make more sense.  I think it's useful to still indicate what technologies you've used, as it can show things like technical breadth, and a willingness and desire to learn new things.  But, ""I'm a C expert of 20 years, and I can fill in function bodies based on other people's designs like a pro,"" is much less impressive than, ""I just started learning Ruby 3 months ago, but I designed and built Complex System from scratch with it.""

This means that the 'radio bubble' is not a bubble, but two nested spheres with only about 100 light years of space between them.

From the abstract:<p>""Attempts to model interstellar colonization may seem hopelessly compromised by uncertainties regarding the technologies and preferences of advanced civilizations. If light speed limits travel speeds, however, then a selection effect may eventually determine frontier behavior. Making weak assumptions about colonization technology, we use this selection effect to predict colonists' behavior, including which oases they colonize, how long they stay there, how many seeds they then launch, how fast and far those seeds fly, and how behavior changes with increasing congestion. This colonization model explains several astrophysical puzzles, predicting lone oases like ours, amid large quiet regions with vast unused resources.""",1297038575.0

The last 3 jobs have been 50%, 50% and 33% raises. Confidence does sell, but you also have to produce your value [2]. I'm not at the top of my pay-band for folks of my age and experience, but I am slightly above median for Denver.<p>2000 and 2001 were terrible years for developers. You'll hear them described as all sorts of terms, including ""dotBomb."" It took me 8 years to get my salary back to the same dollar amount I was making in 2000. And that 8 year period included 2 years I was out of work (23 months spread over 3 gaps).<p>There is a saying that goes ""make hay while the sun shines."" Aside from the obvious agricultural meaning, it also means that you should make as much as you can during the rich years, and put some aside for the lean years [3].<p>My estimation is that there are really 2 job pools. One for junior level skills and one for senior level skills. There is a large gap in salaries. When execs and politicians whine about a shortage of experienced workers [4], they're complaining that the senior pool is too expensive. However, all their options of making colleges produce more workers, or opening the visa flood gates will only serve to increase the quantity of folks in the junior pool. It takes time, training and effort to move yourself from the junior pool to the senior pool. But it will be up to you - no company will do it for you, and indeed, with the constant demand for workers who can ""hit the ground running"" that shows that companies want the benefit of the senior pool without contributing to the succession from the junior pool.<p>Notes:<p>1 - Companies who ask what you are making now will usually try to limit you to 10-15% raises with your new position. Part of this is a cultural dislike for people moving up too fast. Victorian literature was full of tales of people who tried to move to another ""station in life"" and were found out then sent back to the lower classes they came from. This is the sort of mentality you'll find during interviews.<p>2 - Confidence will get you in the door, but you have to get work done to keep your job.<p>3 - This is not limited to retirement savings. By age 28-30, you should have about 6 months income saved up for the times when you will be out of work. By 35, you should have more like 12 months saved up. That is your lifeboat and the only way you can survive the ups and downs of the industry. Developers over 40 who get laid off can find it takes 6-12 months to get a replacement job.<p>4 - Mostly they want protection from the free market, but usually what's happening is that they think they need senior level workers but are only willing to pay junior level wages. So they want some sort of bailout from the government.",1297037788.0
