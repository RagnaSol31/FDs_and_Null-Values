The chip stores card's private key that is used to digitally sign a (purchase) transaction. Each transaction  is a multi-message <i>exchange</i> in real-time between the terminal and the bank and it includes an unique ID generated by the bank, which is covered by the signature. This effectively prevents a replay.<p>The private key cannot be read from the chip without the use of a tunneling microscope or other hardware exotics. In fact it is not untypical for a chip to have a built-in protection against key retrieval that is set to physically fry the chip. The PIN is used to tell the chip to do the digital signing. No PIN = no signing.<p>That's how it works in general. This application of the smartcard technology is almost 20 years old, so while there are some variations one could still call it sufficiently <i>mature</i> :grin",1293325011.0

There is a considerable amount of research that suggests when income tax on top rates is high, workers prefer non-cash benefits, rather than money. Recall that in the USA, during the 40s and 50s, the top income rate was 91% on all income over $100,000 (roughly a $1 million in todays money). Because of this, most top stars did not seeks payment in excess of $100,000. Instead, they sought benefits in to go along with their $100,000. The big tax cuts of 1982 lowered top rates to 36%. This  made it much more rational for top workers to ask for high amounts.",1293324936.0

How much would you expect their average salary to be? No doubt it's significantly less than for most engineers, who don't verbally perform as well, but hit close to the (low) ceiling of the math portion. Income vs. verbal IQ within the same education class is probably all over the map because of this, and no doubt significantly confounded wrt cause-and-effect.<p>On the other hand, I would expect there to be a strong benefit to verbal intelligence within each profession.<p>TLDR: The link hardly proves that a higher IQ does not cause higher income.",1293322995.0

Consider that those consumer goods may have been purchased before an economically catastrophic event such as an illness or a layoff, or they may have been a gift from someone who is willing to purchase consumer items, but not willing to provide the household stability that they require.<p>Also consider that, second-hand, these items are not particularly expensive, and even if they were sold, they may only provide a heating bill for a month or two.
