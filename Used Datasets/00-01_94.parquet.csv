It's only a problem if you want the exponentation function to be continuous, so you escape the problem by leaving it undefined. You could place similar unbased requirements on complex exponentiation to make it seem incorrect. For instance, real exponentiation always gives a positive value for positive base, while complex does not, so e^(i pi) = -1 is wrong. I agree that this is ridiculous requirement, but leaving 0^0 undefined because the math is not as we want it to be (e.g. exponentation is not continuous) looks just as ridiculous and silly to me.<p>On the other hand, putting 0^0 = 1 makes it consistent many combinatoric formulas, and is also consistent with cardinal exponentation, where nobody objects to 0^0 = 1, when you look at 0 as the cardinal number.",1314233286.0

They probably have a few new products ready to release within a year as well, maybe TV or something else.  The next 5 years I don't see them stalling.  The iPhone and iPad have too much momentum.  But the big question is from year 6 to 10.  Apple needs a product leader, someone who will lead the whole company to rally around the latest and greatest new apple product.  Hopefully Tim Cook can fit into that role, with help from Ive, Schiller, and others.  Another hopeful note is the leadership institute Jobs has set up inside Apple with ex-business school profs archiving all of Jobs exploits and training then next generation of leaders.  However, I think really nobody really knows what Apple will be like from year 6 to 10.  But I'll be rooting for Apple and hope they continue to make revolutionary products.",1314232230.0
