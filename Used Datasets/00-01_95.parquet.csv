Whatever system they put into place is going to be around for many years. I would be surprised if they don't deliver in iOS5. Probably integrated with the multi-tasking switcher since notifications are points at which you might decide to multitask or switch applications. Makes sense to group them together. The trickiest part is figuring out how to do Growl/HUD style notifications. WebOS is the high water mark for this. Android's system is not so good. The notification tray itself is fine but the HUD of a new notification is easy to miss. If you can't memorize what all the tiny icons are for you just have to check the tray constantly instead.,1299544330.0

In non-specific order:<p>1) The overall balance of the page has good white space but a lot of the controls like drop-downs or the maximize window links are just floating.  You should consider using some color on them or make them more button-like.<p>2) I like the idea on the hourglass logo.  If you're going to be 100% exclusively focused on women's fashion, I think you could play off the hourglass with a red dress with a hourglass figure..<p>3) I would move the price and buy now buttons up the page significantly.  I have a large monitor but on a smaller monitor, I'm pretty sure that's below the fold and people are missing the most important element.  Also, include the % discount like (75% Off!)<p>4) Way too aggressive on the registration layover.  I got it about 2-3 times while moving around.  Also, you should clean it up a lot, the graphics and text look a bit spammy. Also, as best practice, always include an ""x"" to close overlays.<p>5) There's a lot of font action happening, mixes of script font with serif and sans-serif.  I don't know what the target audience is but if it's upscale, I would stay away from the script font you're using on the right side banner and use the elegant font from your logo.<p>6) The box edges on both sides of the page are not aligned and the same width so it looks a bit messy.  Should be an easy fix.<p>7) I got an error alert when I tried to share using Facebook but it still opened up the Facebook share page just fine so maybe just some scripting issues.<p>E-commerce is a hot space and congrats on having a working and live product!

However, Word is certainly easier to use, and tasks such as inserting an image inline can be done through a few clicks rather than Googling to determine the best package for floating images, creating some code, and continually recompiling into dvi to see if the result is acceptable (and then copying and pasting the ur-example into new documents for the rest of time).<p>(Perhaps an actual competent LaTeX programmer would disagree with the above, but that's how I and most of the people I know use it).<p>I prefer LaTeX over Word (or OpenOffice, since I run Linux), but this is because I tend to create documents in plain text first, and if I decide they need to be presentable it's easy to throw some boilerplate around that text and produce a nice-looking document.
