I completed my degree after the 6-year mark and I'm certainly not the only one to do so.  These statistics erroneously include people like me in the dropout category.  A more accurate method of measurement would be to track each cohort of students from entrance through graduation and chart a histogram of the elapsed time from initial enrollment to graduation.  Once you've collected these histograms for several cohorts, you're then in a position to construct a model of the statistical distribution.  Then you can make accurate estimates of the true dropout rate by fitting the known graduation data for a given cohort to the model to estimate how many of the students are in the tail of the distribution that will eventually graduate.",1281574778

The lack of constant data transfer, combined with a small screen, undoubtedly helped battery life.<p>I am not saying that the W810i was not a good phone for its time, but rather that it was not made to deal with the modern mobile landscape of real-time status updates, push email, and monthly OTA firmware upgrades.

But startups can learn an important lesson from [the fact that] in the software business, you can't afford not to have a hacker-centric culture.""<p>I think Yahoo made the correct decision on both counts. As far as depending on a bogus source of revenue, all new advertising mediums are massively undervalued at first, then massively overvalued, and then only eventually even out. It would be a huge mistake not to plan your entire business model around this cycle. Yahoo did this, and they made literally billions of dollars because of it. Sure, if they had chosen to go into a different sort of business they could have perhaps extended their reign, but it's hard to argue that they made the wrong choice.<p>As for not having a hacker-centric culture, I think they made the right choice here as well. Every time Yahoo bought a startup, their stock rose more than they paid for the company, meaning every time they acquired their tech through a buyout the execs took home massive paychecks. Whereas every dollar they spent on elite programmers was money out of their pocket.<p>I think the lesson here, if anything, is that you can make mostly the right decisions and your business can still decline over time.<p>Incidentally, I heard a great story about one of the Yahoo sales guys. Apparently he bought his own inventory at the end of every month to meet his quota, because the stock he was getting vested was worth more than the 100K or so he was required to fork over each month.

But so far the only companies smart enough to do this are companies smart enough not to need to.""</i><p>Yahoo did do this through the Inktomi (Yahoo Search, 2003-2010) acquisition. I've worked in that organization and learned a tremendous amount from the people. At that time the hiring bar had been considerably raised from what Graham describes (I have no idea whether that was the rule or the exception at that time, I was there 8 years later), nobody was shy of rejecting weak candidates. Much of the knowledge did diffuse to rest of the organization and it's important to note that along side the ""dot-com-wannabe-millionaire-vesting-in-peace"" crowd the essay describes, there <i>was</i> plenty of genuine technical talent (anyone who has worked there can attest to presence and influence of hackers).<p>Unfortunately, for many reasons, that talent has slowly bled out. There was also a great amount of friction between Search and rest of the organization e.g., resistance (by Search engineers) to dog-fooding of what was often inferior technology. Search was, however, able to maintain a different platform, remaining on Linux, with their own platform/software stack, but were some ""wtf"" moments like porting and forcing the adoption of a custom user space locking library from FreeBSD when Linux already had futex (on the other hand, the fact there was a custom locking library built in a ""media company"" does say something).<p>The other key mistake made is that they would position bright, capable new hires in areas that weren't directly correlated to revenue and treated as cost centers. That just seemed highly illogical to me. It's a mistake that's often difficult to fix: once young graduates are used to working on glamorous projects, it's much harder to get them to work on more mundane, but revenue critical projects such as advertiser systems. Google's strategy of a uniformly high hiring bar (vs. some teams hiring people other teams  rejected for roles involving the same skill-set) and assigning hires to business priority projects (while allowing individuals to transfer if the project wasn't their cup of tea, with proper incentives in place for some projects) seems to be (at least from an outside point of view, I've never worked at Google) better.",1281572474

But from what I've seen so far, it's more exciting: an abstraction over the OS that factors out the machine-your-own-screws details of C <i>while otherwise leaving the model intact</i>. That is, instead of a top-down design that replaces the OS's low-level ways with something else and then maps between the two, it's a bottom-up design that attempts <i>not</i> to change anything important about the way the lower level works. This I think is what Ryan means when he says he's suspicious of abstraction. The result is something more like ""the ability to write C programs in Javascript"" than ""a better web framework"". This strikes me as powerful and capable of evolving in some interesting directions.<p>Bottom-up design is not common. But it should be.
