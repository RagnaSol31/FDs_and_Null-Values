They both have strengths and weaknesses, but I see Zimbra as the better professional solution. The search in Gmail is great, but no amount of tags can replace good old fashioned folders in Zimbra - especially if you subscribe to a bunch of FOSS project mailing lists - I just don't need to read it all that often but when I do I want it in one place. The calendaring system in Zimbra is useful for scheduling meetings as well.",1236302744.0

I don't read Digg any more, so I can't speak to the accuracy of its summary, but I still do use reddit, and I have to say that the list is missing at least two popular reddit topics:  hating Israel and hating police.  And hating Digg very rarely comes up.<p>I'm not really sure who the target audience of this article is, but I can't imagine that it's HN.",1236302722.0
