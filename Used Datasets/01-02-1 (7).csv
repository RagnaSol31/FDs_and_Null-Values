For example, Digg.com only has two ads on the front page. One above the fold, one below. I don't mind it at all. Just think, where your competitors have cluttered and frantic designs, yours could be clean and clear. \nOne other point. People may pay for ad free versions because the ad version is incredibly annoying and cluttered and hard to navigate. If your free version is nicely done (which I recommend), you can run ads site wide without annoying anyone and use memberships to get repaid for the things that really cost you money.",1208915951.0

Suburban homes are cheaper than their urban counter part in terms of floorspace and acreage which is important if you are raising children. I've never met a family where both parents worked in order to afford their home and I'm not speaking of very wealthy people either.<p>What suburbs offer is a quiet, out of the way place, with lots of room, which makes family life much easier.<p>Then again, I live in Virginia so I might be confused. There's no distinction between city/suburb/rural county around here, and one never really existed.",1208915684.0

I'm thinking not just of investors like eBay but in particular their employees.  Since lots of starup employees decide where to work based on where they will be able to cash out their options, how does a company like Craigslist keep its employees on board?",1208914318.0

More bright children who have proven that they can learn things on their own should be homeschooled.<p>Aren't there often socialization problems associated with home schooling? I don't know a lot about the topic, so I could be dead wrong. But overall, I would be more comfortable sending bright kids to a solid school with a good gifted and talented program where they can spend time with other kids their own age than home schooling them myself or having them skip a bunch of grades.<p>Is this a misconception on my part?",1208913183.0
