15,91627,comment,91575.0,91614.0,0,0,brianr,,,"That calculation assumes that the risk-free rate is 5%, and that you will get $1 per year forever (i.e., considering the company to be an annuity that pays $1 per year forever). A more general formula is:<p>Value = (Annual revenue) / (interest rate - growth rate)<p>The interest rate here is the interest rate that takes into account how risky your business is--the rate you'd be able to borrow at, the ""cost of capital"". Let's say you could get a loan (secured only by the assets of the business) at 15% interest, and that you expect to grow by 5% per year. Then per $1 of annual revenue:<p>Value = $1 / (.15 - .05) = $1 / (.1) = $10",1198200237
