1,142121,comment,141898.0,141968.0,0,0,nostrademons,,,"One way to think about CC debt: if you fund your startup with credit cards, you need to <i>guarantee</i> that you'll grow earnings by at least 20%/year, just to keep up with interest charges.  If you can't do that, you're personally on the hook for any shortfall, and have to make it up yourself out of future job income (after compounding, no less).<p>There're very few startups where revenues are certain enough to take this risk.  Most likely, your startup will never make anything, and then credit card debt for a startup is no different than credit card debt for a spending spree.  That's why startup founders are wary of debt financing.  If you <i>can</i> guarantee that level of earnings growth (perhaps you have customers already lined up, and just need to deliver on a well-understood technical problem), then it can make sense.",1206064472.0

My friend can be kinda abrasive at times - not really arrogant, but more an ""I'm right, damnit, and I'm going to be pedantic about it"" personality.  His first assignment was copy-editing some client reports.  He came back with a long list of grammatical mistakes in the report, along with a lesson on proper grammar, for the fund manager.  The fund manager said, ""This is excellent - keep up the good work,"" and made sure my friend got his hands on all the reports going out...",1206064071.0
