5,211828,comment,211540.0,211825.0,0,0,neilc,,,"In what sense do are those sites ""service businesses""?<p>The <i>whole point</i> of the service vs. product distinction that PG was making is that a service business is less scalable: its revenue is basically linear in the number of employees that it has, because a human being has to do more work for each new customer. That is <i>not</i> the case for product businesses or for Reddit or Octopart (or most other web startups) -- if Reddit's traffic increases 100x overnight, they don't need 100x the employees to capitalize. Craigslist is an example that makes the difference pretty clear. Whether you want to call them ""product businesses"" or not misses the point.",1212889596

If the victim could figure out what was happening before their files were completely ""ransacked"", they could simply shut off their computer and take it to the shop to extract however much of their data wasn't yet encrypted. If the value of what was encrypted so far was less than the ransom, why pay?<p>Also, another aspect you have to consider: strong encryption algorithms usually have large implementations, which means large viruses. Virus transmission rates are logarithmically proportional to their size (a virus that can get sent from one computer to N others in half the time spreads twice as fast each generation, and therefore exponentially (2^t) faster over time.)",1212888721

Why reimplement draggable, modal windows? What does that get the user? Must we really duplicate all the worst excesses of GUI interfaces just because we can? There are some really brilliant moments here (e.g. the ability to add pictures directly from Google Image Search) where the designers clearly bothered to think about how exploit the strengths of web-app-ness, but a little more of that and a little less slavish devotion to the GUI paradigm would not have gone amiss; there's too much ""look what we can do."" Just because you can doesn't mean you should.<p>Also, the author of the linked post claims that it is responsive, which it certainly is not for me; it feels very, very sluggish, 1+ second delays for mouse clicks to register.",1212887517

26,211807,comment,211630.0,211664.0,0,0,simonw,,,"I disagree. Achieving smooth animation without a library is extremely difficult. If you look at what the modern libraries actually do you'll see that they have two features which are tricky to implement from scratch: frame rate limiting and easing. Frame rate limiting means that if you are running lots of complex animations at once the libraries will drop frames to ensure that all animations complete in the allocated time. Easing gives you a pleasing speed-up / slow-down effect during your animation which makes them look far more natural. This is a fair amount more complicated than simple animations set up just using setTimeout.<p>Of course, you can roll that stuff yourself - but why duplicate all of that effort?<p>Also, DOM manipulation with the regular DOM is amazingly inconvenient when compared to manipulation using a library such as jQuery. The DOM is a pretty verbose API with a lot of weird quirks (removing a node: ""theNode.parentNode.removeChild(theNode)"") - jQuery provides a much more sensible API, which in turn means that I find myself using DOM manipulation a lot more since it isn't such a pain to do.",1212887401

33,211800,comment,211630.0,211630.0,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"It really depends on whether you like Javascript or not, and whether or not your new library-based code has to play nicely with non-library javascript.<p>jQuery is an interesting language.  But I feel like it's no more ""javascript"" than C is assembly.  It uses a lot of conventions and syntactic sugar that is not standard in the language.  It's a cool and elegant, but there's a learning curve at both ends; first, you need to learn it, and then it becomes so habitual that you forget how to write ""regular"" javascript.<p>YUI, on the other hand, feels a bit more like plain old JS, which some people like and some people don't.  The main problem with YUI is a lack of overall consistency in naming and whatnot.  YUI 3 is coming out soon-ish, and addresses a lot of that stuff quite nicely.  YUI does a really good job of not cluttering up your environment with too much gargbage--everything is under one global YAHOO object, so it's a friendly neighbor.<p>Avoid prototype at all costs.  It monkeys around with the core object types, and adds scores of globals, which pretty much ensures that, unless ALL of your code uses prototype, and always will, you'll get unexpected behavior in some cases.<p>YUI was built first and foremost for use at Yahoo.  It'd be hard to find a library that's more play-tested or scrutinized for performance than that.  Personally, I find the core YUI libs a lot more useful than the widgets.  They tend to be a bit over generalized in a lot of cases, and I can usually get better results by rolling my own.<p>Disclaimer: I'm a webdev at Yahoo, and I've been using YUI since its pre-OSS days.",1212886876
