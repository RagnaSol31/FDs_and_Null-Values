This is pretty low-tech, all things considered, and I'd like to enter the future. Right now at best I have a hodgepodge of things that I will try to upload to Google Docs or suchlike. Not so pretty!<p>Where to start? I could set up from cron scripts and buy Amazon S3 space, but that really doesn't seem to be the most elegant solution (perhaps for some software projects, but not for a personal basis).<p>Options I'm familiar with are, most prominently, Mozy (mozy.com) and Carbonite (carbonite.com). I guess using something like Dropbox could fulfill this need to some extent as well.<p>Would love to hear feedback about these services for automated backups and any other alternatives I should consider.<p>Thanks!",1290909574.0

We can imagine people on either extreme of realism/idealism arguing (A) that 1 = 1 is an invention of our mathematical system, or (B) that <i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i> is merely the discovery of the pre-existing fact that that pattern of paint is pleasing.<p>Likewise, as things stand now, I can copyright a map. There’s an obvious argument against this: I didn’t <i>make</i> what the map shows, and I can’t <i>own</i> the fact that land is the shape it is.

And I also tried to make the point that I'm being nonpartisan, too, it is simply that right now I lack the ability to name a name of an organization on the left that is actually trying to clean house rather than further entrench the current power structure. If I could you better believe I would.<p>But much of what you outline is actually happening to some degree, and events have forced me to admit that my previous cynicism was too much; if the ruling elite do manage to take civilization to hell in a handbasket, I can no longer say that <i>everybody</i> sat passively by and let it happen. ""Most people"" would still be fair, but there were people who saw it coming and however misguided you may think they were in their efforts, they actually did try to do something to stop it.<p>(I have to say ""civilization"" because the same basic disease seems to be everywhere, just not equally concentrated. Claiming that one country or another has more or less is just another distraction technique.)<p>(My position is that I'm a libertarian, but also a pragmatist. I would love to see a popular leftist movement rise up on the basic platform of ""We want to care for people and we believe in a much more powerful and muscular government than this 'jerf' asshole thinks is wise, but it does no good to anybody to offer them unlimited health care and amazing retirement benefits and protected jobs for life and all this other great stuff if the government then goes bankrupt in five years, at which point all those guarantees become void. First we must make sure we can afford the things we want to do, <i>then</i> we can do them."" In my opinion if you really believe in liberalism and leftism then the absolute most important thing for you to do right now is join hands with whoever it takes to make government spending sustainable, because without that basic foundation the government will not be able to do anything you want it to do, when it no longer exists. I'll happily argue about how much government is wise after we've made sure it'll still be there in twenty years.)",1290908781.0

If Comcast operates the real resolver and all you do is aim your computer at it, you have little opportunity to ""disagree"" with the results they feed you.<p>Secondly, regardless of how much noise people may be making about DNSSEC's impending deployment (and it's been impending about as long as IPv6), the prospects for widespread DNSSEC adoption aren't great.

50,1946362,story,,,10,8,zonked,Ask HN: Working on Startup projects at night and weekends,,I have lately been bitten by the entrepreneurship bug. I have a couple of ideas in my head which I would really want to get started with now. I work for one of the tech giants in Seattle and was planning to work on these ideas as a side project at nights and on the weekends. Do you think it is a practical approach or should I consider leaving my current job and take a real risk? One thing that concerns me the most is that I would not want these ideas to end up as just another school projects(with focus on just the technical learnings) and want to focus on creating a quality product and it give it a real shot with a quality business idea. Do you think this all can be achieved with side projects? Please share your experiences/suggestions.,1290907709.0

If you haven't paid for a colo inside their datacenters you can't well expect to use the usual HFT tricks of putting in requests for things you don't want and then never making actions on them because your 40ms latency to the exchange will mean that the guys in the colo have acted on your move. I heard someone say that they got a colo for 10,000 a month (sorry, I don't have a source for that) so that kind of edges you out of really good HFT. Another thing to know is that you are running around like a chicken with your head cut off trying to grab pennies off a railroad track that is running bullet trains (I love that analogy). i.e. very dangerous. Slight mistakes can cost you hundreds of dollars ever 20ms until you hit ctrl+C in your script!
