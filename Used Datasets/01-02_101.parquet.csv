I'm sure there's some good stuff for people but buried under all the usual platitudes.<p>""Don't outsource"" may have been right for fab.com but its not always good advice. Simple websites that are just retail stores care about brand, real technology companies that actually do something that hasn't been done before often outsource with good success.

2,4622347,comment,4622142.0,4622142.0,17,0,mkramlich,,,"What excites me the most about SpaceX and Elon Musk is not so much the superficial/ostensible meaning of what they're doing (private contracts to deliver payloads to space) but the following. The fact that a foundation is being laid for a situation where basically a single guy, a private citizen, namely Musk with his personality and talents and passion, can one day slam his fist down and say, ""That's it. Fuck it. We're going to Mars."" and then make it happen. Putting humans on the surface of Mars. Or an asteroid, whatever. As completely private missions, if desired. Without getting bogged down by a flaky showboating Congress, by NASA budgets, by legacy bureaucracy, etc. Because they're building (incrementally) a complete in-house stack for taking people off-planet and (eventually) to other ones, and back. Yes you have to make the money work. That's doable. But more importantly it reduces their exposure to bureacracy, government and BDC inertia. And it's not a baby-vs-bathwater situation. They can hire away the brains from NASA and other space companies, where needed, where possible, so it's not like they're losing out on all that accumulated experience and best practice. But they do get to start from scratch and make it much easier to greenlight new ""risky"" projects and Get Things Done.<p>Planetary Resources excites me for similar reasons. Though I don't think they have quite the same degree of talent at the top in a single guy as with the case of SpaceX. But still, very promising team, vision and approach.",1349575106.0

I suggest testing out a few different company cultures prior to graduating. You are clearly smart so I'm guessing there will be few jobs that you can not do. Three years ago, I thought that I would be in med school right now but took a much different route that some people still don't understand. I mentor a handful of MBA students as well as college students regarding this very topic. I would love to talk to you and share a few details regarding the company that I mentioned. Right now you are in a great position to test out a few jobs that you ""might"" be interested. I highly recommend doing this while in graduate school. I am happy to walk you through examples of how this can be done. Please feel free to email me at bethwoltman@gmail.com if you would like to discuss this in more detail. I included a small snapshot of my background for frame of reference. I don't recommend taking this path but hopefully this will give you an idea of what I am referring to.<p>My unconventional background: Pre-med/Community Healthcare undergrad, Senior Financial Consultant that participated in taking previous employer through an IPO, recruiter for an international organization, business development for a consulting/advisory firm. I taught myself computer programming which was the foundation for my first software company. I also own another company that is in the computer processing/engineering space but is rather unique; customers include traders, various investment funds, recruiting firms, and individuals in the healthcare industry.

However, when you lack both, the short is a better trade.<p>Aside: In your example, if you buy the puts for 30 cents per share, you are paying 24 cents in theta.  Now, if you plan on selling before then, you don't pay the full penalty.  However, If you plan on holding till expiration, your breakeven is 2.20 (just to get back the premium you paid).  Now, if the equity fell to 2.20 and you shorted directly, you'd do far better than breakeven.<p>The people buying 2.50 weekly options that expired last Saturday would have lost all of their money.  They may have been correct in their general directional prediction, but the contracts expired worthless.<p>I did not have a timeframe and I only had a rough price target.  All I knew was that it was going to have to fall hard (2.40 price target) at one point before earnings.  I could have bought long-dated puts, but at that time they were <i>far</i> more expensive and even the $3.00 puts were more than .60 cents per share (which would mean I'd just barely show a profit).<p>As another stark example of the quirks of pricing, check out the Oct20 AAPL puts.  Many of the deep out of the money puts lost MTM value because its become less likely that the price will fall far enough.  So especially if you come into the trade early, you end up paying quite a bit in theta.",1349574685.0

Then it augments the maps with proprietary data gathered by users running Waze software on their phones and from people manually contributing corrections to the Waze data set. Waze has gamified this process by awarding achievements for the number of miles driven with the software running and for contributing corrections (e.g. road changes and mistakes).<p>Apple's Maps would benefit from buying Waze because Apple would get access to 1) Waze's accumulated modifications on top of TIGER, 2) Waze's software for collecting and distributing realtime changes to maps and 3) the talent of 80 employees that have deep knowledge of mapping software.<p>The maps from Nokia or TomTom might be better now, but the problem is they may have very inefficient ways of keeping those maps up to date and distributing the updated map data. For example, most GPS units have static map data which get a bulk update once per year. Whereas Google Maps and Waze can get updated maps in near real time along with live traffic information.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.waze.com/faq/",

Gold would be the obvious example.<p>>why is it desirable for a currency to be a non-commodity currency?<p>One of the most important tasks of a monetary system is to regulate the money supply. This can be done via various methods. This can be done with monetary policy as in the case of the US dollar. Or it can be done by leveraging a commodity with a (hopefully) predictable market, as with gold. Or it can be done, as with bitcoin, by creating an artificial process which is <i>provably</i> predictable.<p>Now, when you use a commodity, you have a problem which is that you are hoping that no new developments will come about that completely throw off your assumptions about the market. If you were using precious aluminum as a currency in 1850, your economy would have collapsed in 1886 when the HallHroult process was invented, causing rapid inflation. That's a supply side problem.<p>But a demand side problem is also possible. Imagine if indium had been our currency, for example. Indium is a rare element and was rather useless until the latter half of the 20th century. The rapidly increasing demand for indium as a <i>useful</i> commodity would have caused severe deflation.<p>A fiat currency system works on the assumption that there is no market effect of demand for the money outside of its function as money. In the case of American currency, this assumption is mostly true, but there are small exceptions such as coin collection which have a negligible impact on the money supply (a collected quarter is effectively 25 cents taken out of circulation). If the assumption were rendered totally invalid, the Fed could completely lose control of the money supply.",1349573780.0

47,4622301,comment,4620276.0,4620276.0,10,0,ghostoffuture,,,"Perhaps I can add my experience in this. I was very good at programming in college. I was one of those guys that left the labs under the hatefull gaze of the entire lab section having finished his assignment early. And boy I loved it too. I was so happy having finished a large programming project or a large engineering design assignment. After getting an interesting assignment I would literally skip on the way back home daydreaming about how I will write it. I was not at the best university, mostly because I was an immigrant so I was not able to get good grades/sat scores, but it was a very decent state school.<p>But while in college I saw that most powerful people in america were lawyers of some kind. These were the days of the Clintons, btw. Then I got into my stupid head that perhaps I should go to law school. You know in order to join the power elite and make a difference and all that.<p>By that time my english was very good, and being naturally intelligent (I will not bore you with false modesty), I got into some of the very best law schools in America. I chose one and did very well there and got jobs at some very prestigous top law firms. Basically, for a while I had the promise of a career that most lawyers would dream of.<p>But now this is all in shambles and I am thinking of getting back into engineering or something more closely related to technology.<p>Oscar Wilde said something very wise (paraphrasing): ""I used to have the life of my dreams and I was happy; now I have the life of everybody else's dreams and it is incredibly tiresome""<p>So my advice is if you are one of those natural programmers by all means do it, and do not ever think about what other people say about ""what would you be doing when you are 50."" Yosef (the author of this article) is one of those people, and to him the answer is very simple and very happy: ""programming"".<p>You see this question of ""can you see yourself as a programmer when you are 50"" does not have much to do with ageism or the labor market but about people's inner feelings and desires. Some people are horrified to see themselves as programmers when they are 50, not because of the market but because they secretly loathe it. And to see themselves doing it when they are 50 seems like a life sentence. For others, it is the most natural thing in the world.<p>I remember when I was a lawyer I once had an especially good stretch. Some of our top clients complimented my work. This is a big deal because those clients spent crazy money on fees and it is very rare for anyone to complement a lawyer's work. I thought to myself ""wow keep going and you will be a partner in no time"". Then I thought about life as a lawyer, doing the same thing over and over again, for the rest of my life and it was the most depressing thing ever. It was horrifying and the thought about multi-million dollar salaries did not help (although now in my much more perilous situation those salaries sure seem nice). I got into a serious depression and that badly affected my work thereafter.<p>So my advice is, if you are good at programming, if you are one of those few for whom this stuff just clicks, go for it and do not listen what anyone says about markets, or ageism etc. Note that those that are really good at programming are very few. Even among programmers, I would say that those to whom programming is annoying and a little scary greatly outnumber the ones that have real talent for it.<p>So people will generally give you many reasons to move away from it, but those are their reasons, not yours. If you are part of this select group just count your blessings. And here are some of these blessings:<p>1. You know how rare it is to have a passion and talent for something, and at the same time have that something be valuable and useful. Think of all the brilliant and passionate people that are into disciplines where only a few thousand people in the world get a decent income. Think of all dancers, screenwrights, directors, painters, poets, chess players, etc.<p>2. You have a wonderful differentiator of skill and ability: things either work or not. When I was a lawyer I had to compete with so many hacks. When I would stay up nights writing complex documents, trying to phrase every single word just the right way, when I would stress out for hours about a particular phrasing or argument, they would slap something together quickly and with no second thought. And their work would look like mine to the client. The consequences of bad legal work are uncertain and tend to be much delayed.<p>3. Your craft requires very little investment. Again, you have no idea how lucky that is. Even startups that require capital, get it mostly for salaries. There is no expensive equipment to purchase, etc. Marx thought so much about how to connect workers to their means of production, and in the end came up with a theory that turned out into a complete disaster and caused untold tradegy. If he only knew that some day there would be a sub $500 means of production that can create wealth worth millions he would not go into silly plans about dictatorship of the proletariat.<p>There is more but I have rambled enough. Heed my advice. If you are one of the  lucky ones, ignore what the less lucky ones are saying and do not squander your good fortune.",1349573273.0

This is a new era for space exploration because this is the first time private money will start rolling into space exploration programs.<p>The problem with government funded programs is they are underfunded, limited in scope and often have no competition that would push them forward. One of the reasons why Apollo programs were so successful is because Americans and Russians were trying to out do each others and that created a healthy environment for amazing new tech to emerge. The problem today is that no country really cares about space exploration anymore... at least not to the extent they used to.<p>When you allow free market forces and commercial competition to do their thing, you end up with all sorts of great things that otherwise never would've been.
