How does my belief that God intervenes by the Holy Spirit, say, slow down science. I'm trying to think of a mechanism. [Getting OT] Why is it a bad thing to slow down science - what objective moral law requires that scientific enquiry proceeds quickly without thorough inspection or introspection?<p>Certainly many of the greatest ""Western"" scientific thinkers were inspired by God and the concept that knowledge of the creation leads to knowledge/understanding of the creator has been probably the greatest single driver of scientific discovery in the last couple of millennia [speculative I know].<p>Galileo had to do nothing of the sort. The church felt there was not enough evidence to confirm Galileo's findings (research funded by the Church) and so intervened to prevent publication. Ironically he was sort of wrong, we can choose any point as a centre no reference point is any more valid than any other. It is equally right to say the Universe revolves around one point as it is to say that of any other.<p>Stem-cell research is an interesting question but one I know little about. I suspect that the variance in attitudes within the Church, say, is little different to that outside it's corpus. I think the stop here is around agreed moral values WRT human life as opposed specific beliefs.<p>Finally, I'd like to see these figures showing that there are less people than previously [""waning""] that carry out religious practices or use faith in questioning morality. The ascendency of irreligion, for example, does not required the decline of religious behaviour. It sounds like propaganda - I'd be happy to be proved wrong either way but I suspect population studies will bear out that religious practice (faith is currently impossible to measure IMO) is not growing as quickly as it has in the past. Indeed it is possibly growing more slowly than global population growth.",1286761751.0

Teams I have been on in the past won extremely competitive autonomous vehicle competitions. Our robots crashed all the time. ALL THE TIME!<p>There is <i>nothing</i> deterministic about how autonomous systems work. In fact our algorithms were by definition random number generators! We randomly generated ""hypotheses"" and then had heuristic tests that figured out which was the most likely trail and then chose it. It worked well, 99% of the time. But that 1% was a killer.<p>Mind you, since we were winning we were doing better than the other solutions which tried to be more deterministic and use maps or things like that. We were basically stateless which reduces some of the feedback associated with getting messed up in some of your estimations.<p>The problem is all at the low level, not the high level.<p>Give a robot a perfect map and it is easy to find a way around safely. The problem comes determining what the hell the camera is seeing (lasers are a lot easier, but not as flexible and more expensive). That is why the bulk of the effort is focused on computer vision not path finding, path finding algorithms are simple.<p>Sure actuating the pedals is fairly trivial, but to call autonomous systems ""deterministic"" is scary to someone who knows how fickle they are. I'm a huge advocate of self-driving cars, but we are not there yet, and when we get there we need to do a pile of peer review on the code (which better be open source).

34,1778477,story,,,3,0,anon_for_this,Ask HN: proportion of effort spent on defects?,,"I'm currently working as a contractor in a small team that is re-writing a legacy business application (implemented in VBA on top of an Excel & Access platform) in .NET & Silverlight.<p>As a team we are observing a _very_ high defect rate, significantly higher than on any of our past professional and personal projects.  On average in any fortnightly iteration, we're spending around 10% of our development time correcting defects, of which ~ 50% are regressions in previously accepted functionality.<p>Worse, these figures are from a triaged-defect rather than a zero-defect environment; assuming the cost of fixing defects remains on average the same, and assuming that we fix _all_ our defects before release, we're looking at a truly incredible 22% of total effort that will likely be spent on defects.<p>The reasons for this are varied, and many are technical.  In particular, the .NET / Silverlight / WCF RIA / EF4 tech. stack is notoriously awful in terms of TDD & automated UAT.  We can get some of the way using AgUnit, Moq and StatLight but it's still slow & awkward, and the EF4 architecture is not conducive to mocking (but very conducive to mockery ;-) ).<p>We _had_ built a nice automated UAT harness on White, but several defects in White made our harness next to useless for inspecting what we needed to inspect on the page.  (One of my biggest gripes with any web technology that doesn't produce HTML is that I can't test it with Selenium).<p>The way I see it, 22% is wildly unacceptable, and even 10% feels very high to me.  This is the first time I've explicitly gathered this '% of effort' metric but it's the first time I've felt the need to ... I've built complex projects in a mix of .NET and RoR in the past, and defects (especially regressions) have only ever been a very minor concern.<p>Anyway, there are several changes I'd like to make (technical and methodological) in order to lower this figure, and in order to drive those changes I'd like to be able to point to some numbers to back up my gut feeling and past experience.<p>Hence my question: what has been the experience of other HNers in terms of proportion development effort spent on defects?<p>Actual numbers seem quite hard to find by Googling ... I get the feeling that few shops are willing to openly discus the figures (I'm posting anonymously for this one myself).<p>(On a related note, I now believe that part of the problem is the decision, which I endorsed at the time, to re-write.  I'd now prefer to treat the VBA codebase like any other legacy system; test, refactor, incrementally replace components with .NET, ... but that's another story and will probably be the subject of a forthcoming article.)",1286761248.0
