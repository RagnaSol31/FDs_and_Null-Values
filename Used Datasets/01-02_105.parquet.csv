My team at edX recently migrated away from Highcharts to nvd3 for this very reason. The state of charting is such that good packages are expensive. There are some mediocre packages for free.

See &quot;join&quot; - assumes your input files are sorted by join key.<p>4) As others have said - you almost invevitably want to run sort before you run uniq, since uniq only works on adjacent records.<p>5) sed doesn&",
