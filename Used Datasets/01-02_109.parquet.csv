But one comment:<p>>  Google was the first company that enabled people to figure out whether advertising actually worked.<p>Not quite. You know those late night TV commercials for ginsu knives? They've always used a different phone number on each channel so that they know which ad worked. Billboards for lawyers? Same deal.<p>Google didn't invent performance marketing.,1336183174.0

It doesn't matter what sample size you decided to pick at the beginning. A Bayesian method should yield reasonable results at every step of the experiment, and allows you to keep on testing until you feel comfortable with the posterior probability distributions.<p>If 10 customers have converted so far, and 30 haven't, then you would expect the conversion rate to be somewhere between 10% and 40%, as evidenced by this graph of the Beta distribution(10,30):<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+BetaDistribution+10+30"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+BetaDistribution+1...</a><p>You then do the same with method B, and stop testing once the overlap between the two probability distributions looks small enough.<p>Anscombe's rule is interesting, but it seems rather critically dependent on the number of future customers, which is hard to estimate. The advantage of the visual approach outlined above is that it's more intuitive, and people can use their best judgment to decide whether to keep on testing or not.<p><i>Disclaimer</i>: I am not an A/B tester.",1336183031.0

Priceonomics has a history of writing quality blog posts of interest to this audience. This post acknowledges the folly of talking about a funding and proceeds to spend most of the time supplying very useful information about the process. Asking for more detail about intended fund usage is unnecessary. Everyone already knows basically what the funds will be used for.<p>And you know what? Raising money is worth celebrating.

27,3931096,comment,3928929.0,3931040.0,1,0,aaronjg,,,"Just sent you a copy of the paper. If you plan to use the result 'forever' then theoretically you would be willing to sacrifice a huge (infinite) amount of suboptimal performance now, so that you get the correct answer in the for when you decide to pick the winning idea. It would be very important to have the correct winning idea, because it is going to run for eternity.<p>In practice, we don't actually ever run the winning idea for ever. We do website re-designs periodically, we test new ideas, business needs change. So we can pick a reasonable value for k based on these constraints.<p>Alternatively, you can get better performance by _not_ picking a stopping criteria, and dynamically choosing which homepage to show. As soon as one idea appears to be doing better, you start showing that to more users. By choosing the appropriate adaptive sampling strategy, you can reduce regret to be less than if you have a constant sampling strategy. However, for many people the adaptive strategy may be more trouble to implement than it is worth.<p>The most important takeaway is to _not_ use repeated significance tests to determine experiment termination time. Either use the Anscombe bound with an appropriate k, or fix the sample size before starting the experiment.",1336182418.0

34,3931089,comment,3930081.0,3930508.0,18,0,btilly,,,"That is because the jury system has been emasculated.<p>The Constitution in large part tries to lay out a minimum effective government, with as many checks and balances as possible to prevent that government tyrannizing the people.<p>Trial by jury was yet another check.  If Congress and the President pass an unfair law, the courts are obliged to enforce it.  But nobody can question a jury to know why they came to the decision that they did, and so juries are free to declare someone innocent if the law is bad.  This is called <i>jury nullification</i> and is an honored part of the jury system.  Surviving documents make it clear that this was the reason that the jury system wound up in the Constitution.<p>But the check has not worked as designed.  In the 1800s employers sought, and got, anti-union laws.  Juries refused to enforce them.  The companies were clever, they sought and got laws requiring judges to misinform juries about their rights.  You are only to decide on fact, you are not to decide on the law, etc.  When they tried cases using unpopular laws and juries had received these instructions, the juries convicted people.<p>Those jury instructions have been modified over time, but still exist in some form.  So much so that if someone states the honest truth it sounds radical.  And that honest truth is that the jury system is supposed to a protection from bad government, and not a fairer way of determining the facts.",1336182023.0

I don't find either version offensive and I don't see any problem with a silly quip implying my father uses a version control system unlike the one being described.<p>EDIT: It occurred to me that my story goes even deeper.<p>The syntactic template ""Not your father's X"" is a reference to a well known ad campaign by General Motors. ""Not your father's Oldsmobile"" the slogan went. It was clearly an attempt to remove the strong association with an older generation that the brand had among younger buyers. It couldn't have helped that the nickname for the brand was ""Olds"", but that association was also somewhat based in fact: the car was indisputably a favorite among old people. Once at a family reunion I noticed that most of my aunts and uncles drove Oldsmobiles, with a few Buicks thrown in for good measure.<p>Note that another effect of this campaign also worked to <i>discourage</i> the perception of Oldsmobiles as appropriate for specifically male buyers. Clearly they wanted all the buyers they could get. So ""Not your father's X"" seems constructed to actively remove gender stereotyping, not reinforce it.<p>Apparently the ad campaign didn't work well enough, as GM stopped producing new cars under the Oldsmobile brand a few years ago.<p>Indeed my father did have an Oldsmobile for a few years, during which he had a software startup. However, he had inherited it from my grandmother when she died. When the AC broke in a way that was not economical to repair my dad went back to driving Toyotas and he gave me the Olds. So that actually <i>was</i> my father's Oldsmobile (but I associated it more with my grandmother).<p>That reminds me, I've been meaning to ask Dad what kind of source code control system he's using these days...",1336181904.0

In a nutshell, we are offering to scan any web application with a suite of leading commercial black-box web-application vulnerability detectors (whose license costs would total $50k annually), give the developers the output reports, and help them interpret these reports if they wish.  In exchange, we ask you to participate in a 1-2 hour study/interview about their engineering practices w.r.t.  security.<p>Basically, we've gotten licenses to use 4 of the leading commercial black box web application vulnerability scanners: Acunetix WVS, IBM AppScan, HP WebInspect, and Qualys Qualysguard, because of our previous research paper on the topic:  http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5504795&tag=1\nWe would like to understand something about the Web application engineering process with regards to security, so we reached out to Stanford affiliated startups to see whether they would like a free, fairly comprehensive security evaluation in exchange for answering some questions about their security training and whether they include any security considerations in their development process.  We've gotten about responses from about 20 such groups at Stanford, but we'd like an even broader sample, which is why we are reaching out to you.<p>What it will ""cost"" the participants:\n* 1-2 hours of time for an interview/survey.  We will ask questions about their security background/education and their application engineering process w.r.t. security\n* permission for us to send up to about 2GB/day of network traffic at their applications, for a period of up to 3 days\n* small misc. requests, such as creating an account for the scanner in their application<p>What you will get:\n* A security assessment by state-of-the-art commercial scanners\n* Vulnerability reports from all of the scanners we run on their site\n* Our help in interpreting the reports, should you want it<p>Also, our study is aimed at gather aggregate statistics and data, so we promise not to disclose/publish any vulnerability data associated a named site without the site developer's permission.<p>If you or the your startup have any questions, feel free to email us at jbau at stanford and frankw2 at stanford.<p>We would love your participation.<p>Regards,\nJason Bau\nPh.D. candidate, Stanford Seclab",1336180811.0
