1,471685,comment,471579.0,471579.0,0,0,sanswork,,,If it's an option for you relocate.  I'm desperate for PHP/Ruby developers in Sydney and I know when I was last in Toronto it was the same way.  We just can't find decent developers that aren't already in a great job.  Even if moving isn't an option try finding cities with real shortages and looking if you can telecommute?,1234058332
2,471684,comment,471660.0,471660.0,0,0,wheels,,,"I think the flipside of this is people liking to belong to groups.  Most of the time belonging to any group with a properties that are essentially homogenous across the members involves some suspension of disbelief.  Once people have made that leap and accepted whatever core values those are, they in turn define themselves in those terms, ignoring the fact that they weren't rationally vetted or arrived at through independent thought on the way in.  Then if you've got some logisticians among the group, they'll go to great lengths to systematically rationalize the things that they mostly accepted because they're a part of that group.  (I certainly do.)  This goes from anything from political activism to religion to free software.<p>This of course isn't necessarily bad or wrong -- in fact I think society would scarcely function were for it not for a modicum of such behavior -- but it does mean that people aren't having these debates in the way that they would another debate -- because they've already <i>know</i> the answer, they're just trying to convince others that their opinion isn't stupid and wrong.",1234058309

Those using COBOL on a mainframe who have bigger problems?  Almost anyone running a web server and processing requests is already able to take advantage of a 16 processor system.  Databases are already good at running on these boxes, but faster IO and more memory are probably better ways to achieve marginal improvement in the DB space today (said as no expert).<p>I understand the use cases for (1) really big simulations that are written in a single-threaded way and (2) desktop apps.  I'm not an expert in either of these, so I can't comment.<p>What I find idiotic is the presumption that a large percentage of server processes can't run well as-is on multi-core boxes.  I'm a Java guy (pragmatically, not by religion), and anyone running on a J2EE server w/o some single-threaded homespun thingy can probably scale up reasonably given more cores presuming that they can already scale horizontally.  Yes, there are exceptions -- mostly with poorly-designed in-house software, but it's the two cases listed above where the most work likely exists.",1234058304

For example, oppression is often begun to be fought by the oppressed joining together under a shared identity.<p>In general, people typically take on an identity — or keep one that they find themselves with (upbringing) — to feel that they belong in some group of people. But I don't think that sticking some big label on oneself is necessary for belonging. One can belong in the group of one's friends and family just by being one anothers' nearest and dearest, not through being fellow <i>x</i>-ists or <i>y</i>-arians. And being partial to one's nearest and dearest as such isn't in itself harmful, only mutually beneficial to those involved, and beneficial to others since a group of mutually supportive individuals reduces the demands those individuals might make against those outwith that group.",1234058101

I have an identity within Y Combinator, with my family, with people that went to my University, in the countries I have lived in etc. These fragments of my identity all give me strength, it means I would help people out that have similar identity to me and I know people in those groups would help me. Beyond aid, it also give me purpose and meaning.<p>This balance between the good and the part parts of having Identity are important. I don't think one should just try to blindly minimize identity. Maybe just try to keep an open mind in discussions about Identity.",1234057996

Second, he can connect sentences to meaning, so for example, when I enter the room he'll greet me, when I leave the room he'll say goodbye. If he's hungry he'll also tell you that (actually, he is hungry most of the time :)) And I think that crows have a similar intelligence level like African Greys, so their potential is really huge.",1234056697
