Microsoft can't bundle it, since they would be charged with monopolistic practices.<p>Your OEM provider installed a Norton trial, that also has nothing to do with Windows. Windows 7 only creates 2 Program Files if you're using a 64bit operating system. The (x86) is the 32bit programs, whereas the Program Files are native 64bit, it makes it a bit clearer when uninstalling or organizing your system.

Do you think we're little children who can't think for ourselves?<p>As the old adage goes, ""keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"". If Al Jazeera is indeed ""the enemy"", then all the more reason to make Al Jazeera widely available!<p>Plus: when Al Jazeera started, the staff was almost entirely made up of BBC MiddleEast service people. So while they worked for BBC, they were unbiased; but the moment they started working for AJ, they became biased and completely untrustworthy!!<p>IMHO, this opposition to Al Jazeera comes from the fact that they (AJ) don't tow the 'company line'. There's a carefully crafted  story around which news is reported in the US (""US = good; Middle-Easterners = uneducated religious bigots; Israelis = poor victims who can't do no wrong; etc."" ) ; unfortunately for AJ, they refuse to follow this line and hence piss off powerful people here.<p>And before someone starts putting words in my mouth: I support Israeli people, and want them to live secure, peaceful, happy lives in Israel.
