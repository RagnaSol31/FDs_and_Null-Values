The problem is that the press here reports virtually nothing, probably as a consequence of the strange defamation and libel laws that we have.<p>As an example, I have witness of two significant cases of fraud in the last 5 years. In the first, a lawyer stole more than $2 million from trust accounts. The second was a professor from a major university who misused close to $100K from grants. In both cases, the matters were dealt with internally (returning money, compensating victims, etc.) and no single piece of information about this went to the press.",1406682251.0
