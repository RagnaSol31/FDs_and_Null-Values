Biological data is often incomplete, fields can be missing, a field that is expected to be present once occurs several times (because, for example, an experiment was run in triplicate) or the data gets entered by hand and doesn't quite fit the expected format.

The time spent on the chance of being selected is far better spent doing one of two things: working on your portfolio presentation or approaching prospective clients.

These types of projects only amplify that under appreciation and misunderstanding, while placing their work in the hands of a potentially unscrupulous individual with no contract in place.<p>A comment in the linked article states it plainly: if Kawasaki wished to encourage new, undiscovered designers he could easily have used his large network to identify and review portfolios.

Some had great communities, but lacked a killer feature. Etc. etc.<p>Then I found FreeBSD. The learning curve was steeper, you had to know more about how things actually worked under the hood (a plus, in my book) and the system was elegantly clunky.<p>A cohesive whole -- more or less -- instead of endless re-packaging of the same things.<p>I do a minimum install, then build my system up from the ports system. (Ports is like apt-get, pacman, other package management systems. Compiling from source can be a bitch, but only for big things -- Emacs, X11, Firefox etc. but it allows unparalleled customization, or at least the option for it.)  Installing binaries is also an option if you don't want to compile.<p>It has had every piece of software I've ever needed (minus <a href=""http://joey.kitenet.net/code/mr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joey.kitenet.net/code/mr/</a>) already in ports.<p>I even recompiled my first kernel within three days of starting out (thanks to Absolute FreeBSD, by Michael W. Lucas), something that seemed a dark art on GNU/Linux.<p>I've had no stability problems in the last year or so, and I just upgraded from 8.0 to 8.1 smoothly. Everything important on my laptop is supported.<p>If I want shiny stuff like webcam, usb auto-mounting, all that, I reboot into Ubuntu. Not because FreeBSD can't (I'm mostly assuming), but because this is my dev box and I'm not supposed to be doing anything shiny or distracting on here, hehe.<p>In short, think of an older truck with a manual transmission -- it's dependable, gets you there and back with minimum of frills and you can tinker rather than a new SUV with bells and whistles.   While FreeBSD is more angled towards servers, I love it as a desktop OS -- at least for coding and light web browsing.<p>And it's a single community, without the balkanization of GNU/Linux.",1280799125.0
