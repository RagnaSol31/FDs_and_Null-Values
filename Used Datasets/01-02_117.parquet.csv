In other words, it is an economy of the self-employed.  The US still has 20% of the work force that is self-employed and only 1/4 of those are doctors, lawyers, and others offering professional services.  Anything which enables others to become self-employed moves us in that direction.<p>Any distributist approach cultivates the possibility and mentality of self-employment.  Whatever form that takes is OK with me, even if that is the paradox of self-employment as a member of a larger firm.",1341712710.0

That introduces a lot of regulation, and still ends up being very expensive for the taxpayers.<p>What I'm proposing essentially separates ""place to securely hold my cash, and provide ATM services"" from ""place to invest money long term"".<p>Now, I agree that long term interest rates would rise, but it doesn't follow that mortgages would become unaffordable. What's more likely IMO is that houses become a lot cheaper. The main ""anchor"" to the price of a house is your ability to pay a fixed percentage of your income.

A similar theme applies to South Korea - which probably has the most sophisticated bond market in Asia (ex-Japan). Even for Japan as well, the most sophisticated market in Asia, the <i>keiretsu</i> system drives most of the inter-corporate funding and credit.<p>The equity capital markets in both China and India are peanuts as compared to the bank-lending market for corporate funding and that's likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future - a crash in the HSI or the Sensex doesn't spell doom for the economy. The fact that we see China willing to allow RMB-trading in the London markets or to build an equity market-making operation implies a tactical funding alternative - <i>not</i> wholesale market ""liberalization"" as we perceive it.<p>As far as the debt-markets are concerned, these countries have been extremely wary of the implications - especially post the credit-crisis and the disastrous impact on high-yield names in the developed world. Non-performing corporate loans are a big  problem as it is in both these nations and unsafe leverage is avoided at all costs. Foreign-currency bond issuances are strictly controlled by their respective central banks and domestic-currency corporate issuance is virtually non-existent.

I can improve performance by deleting a lisp function, reimplementing it in a new .cc file, and restarting the interpreter.
