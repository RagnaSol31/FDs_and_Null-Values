The backup plan had the same customer development steps in it -- it just moves along slower.<p>The main problem is getting distracted with funding, not finding it. I can always self-fund. People come to me to ask for help with making teams perform a lot faster. Hopefully I've built up a bit of a good reputation and that makes my phone ring.

One loved the  idea, one liked it, and one had no clue about the market (wasn't familiar with Facebook and quizzes). Our idea targets young people (12-25 yrs). Which leads to my thinking, that because they're unfamiliar with it (YC partners too old, would never do facebook quizzes), they brushed it off? One other issue is that they prefer built out products with users. We only had a working demo and proof of concept samples.<p>Either that or all the other teams were more spectacular.

If ethernet is provided by a separate chip, then the motherboard manufacturer doesn't have to be ""in"" on the whole affair. During final assembly the keyboard output is spliced through this special board then plugged into the ethernet chip.<p>However, if ethernet is completely integrated into the chipset, then this is probably already provided and we just haven't noticed it.<p>> 2) Why is this not backed up with TCPDUMPs of the call-home?<p>Because that would be a very bad design. It would completely blow the whole thing out of water. If someone designed it that way at the NSA, they should be fired immediately for incompetence.<p>What should happen is that this capability should be turned on selectively upon receiving a specific ""wake-surveillance-up"" packet or even better a specific timed sequence of regular packets (sort of a secret knock code using ethernet frames).<p>Even better they should be able to access this wirelessly as well and perhaps use some of the wires as antennas.<p>> 3) Source?
