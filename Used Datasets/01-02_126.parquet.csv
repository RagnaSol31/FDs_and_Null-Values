I have already moved to another country, not because life cost was cheap, but because it was less stressful for me.<p>I am passionate about my work but I mostly focus that passion on side projects and hobby (that is for free). Not saying that mixing work and passion is bad ( I think, it is great ), but that can easily be abused ( game industry, animation industry ).<p>I think it is wrong to push people from the start to work on weekends (that was the way I read it), it is the fastest way to burn them out (speak of personal experience here, first company (start-up) I joined payed me ~900$ a month but I didn't care because I was motivated, worked 10am-8pm~1am including some weekends, after 5-6 years of this I was a mess, Apple is hopefully not be the same ).",1336442258.0

The problem is that the source of support for that insurgency was in North Vietnam, and it was impossible for US ground troops to advance there and eliminate that support.<p>The war effort was also politically micromanaged--for instance, every airstrike had to be individually approved by the White House. This led to delays and, frankly, interference in military affairs from incompetent politicians.<p>Fighting a counterinsurgent war on the defensive is never strategically sound; one is always better served by being on the move and taking the initiative. This was politically impossible in Vietnam, which is why it took so long.<p>Now, perhaps there were valid political reasons not to invade north Vietnam. In that case, the answer is not to get involved at all. You either do the job right or you don't do it at all. In either case, the mistake <i>wasn't</i> that the US invaded Vietnam without a good reason--there was no invasion, and there was a good reason.

While there's some cool stuff involving wavelets and using interesting basis sets (matching pursuit looks cool), if you're primarily looking at power and frequency over time, the FFT is sufficient, and usually faster than the other algorithms. (And if you're looking at power/phase, the common Morlet wavelet choice is mathematically equivalent to an FT with a Gaussian taper.)<p>I'm not sure what you mean by ""on a small window such that this isn't really applicable""; can you give an example? As long as you accept the inherent time-frequency resolution trade-offs, there's no obstacle to using FFT on a small window. It's called the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and it's used everywhere; it's probably used more than analyzing an entire signal, since we frequently want to know how power and phase change over time in a signal, and a full-signal FT can't tell you that.",1336441601.0

The others are robotics (also taking a while) and self-driving cars.<p>If Google can work through not only the technical but the social and legal problems associated with fully auto-drive cars, it could literally change the world overnight. Instead  of driving cars being a time sink, it could change into something along the lines of being in a room that goes places. You could sleep, read, play games, or otherwise occupy your time. It would literally give the nation tens of billions of hours in added productivity time. It could make the elderly more independent, eliminate drunk-driving, and a lot more.

What I really want is the opportunity to take a few steps back and spend some effort getting things back in shape. If, as you say, both types are needed, I think it would help if an organization valued both types and allowed them to do the type of work they find fulfilling.<p>If I get a new feature working, but I do so at the cost of adding more technical debt to the project, I don't feel fulfilled at all; I feel I've done a net disservice to the world, and especially to whoever comes onto the project after me.<p>Being the type of developer interested in keeping things clean and meticulous, while being pressured to always sacrifice quality for speed, seems like a recipe for stress and burnout.",1336438822.0

This isn't just about Java. If the judge finds that APIs are copyrightable, it affects a lot more.<p>For example, Microsoft has a promise not to sue over its patents on .NET. But if APIs are copyrightable, is Mono in infringement of Microsoft's copyright? Safety from patents is suddenly not enough.<p>Another example, Android uses Linux kernel headers, the API needed to access the kernel. The wide assumption has always been they are not copyrightable, so you can implement userspace apps that are not GPL. But if APIs are copyrightable, that might be less clear.<p>The bottom line is that this judge is going to decide, by himself, whether APIs are copyrightable. It's going to have a huge impact on our industry if he says ""yes"". It's scary to think about the amount of power he currently holds.",1336438812.0
