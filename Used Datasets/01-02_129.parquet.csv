No one wants to own a business that is unattractive for acquisition or investment, since these businesses just fade-away over time.<p>So the directors need to continually look for potential strategic relationships; a) because these are obviously potential customers, and b) because they are potential acquirers who will pay top-dollar for your business.

114,7926523,comment,7926087.0,7926087.0,3,0,rdtsc,,,"> Building the complex, scalable systems demanded by todays highly connected world with such weak guarantees is exceptionally difficult.<p>So is building a complex scalable system that break the laws of physics or theorems. The world is eventually consistent. Some business domains can handle that. Even some banking operations are eventually consistent. You can get to an ATM in Australia and one in US at the same time and overdraw your account. That is eventually consistency. Banks see it better that way then expect you to wait for half an hour until they can decide on a global shared consistent state of your account.<p>> Essentially, that engineer needs to manually do the hard work to ensure that multiple clients don’t step on each other’s toes and deal with stale data.<p>Sometimes that is not that hard. Sometimes business logic allows for a custom (user-based) reconciliation of conflicts. In some cases that engineer has to rely on magic unicorns that another engineer (who build the DB) put it in the product to make it beat the CAP theorem. Or the administrator needs to handle global restart of all the servers because the global cluster has become unavailable because say one node has blown up or got partitioned. That is not _always_ in all cases better than the case of eventual consistency.<p>> Google addressed the pain points of eventual consistency in a recent paper on its F1 database<p>So the answer is installing expensive GPS receiver on the roof of your data-centers and running wires down to the cluster of machines? Yeah that works better in some cases. But it is not the best answer always.<p>>  Vendors should stop hiding behind the CAP theorem as a justification for eventual consistency.<p>Vendors should lie and market-speak their way out of a theorem? This has been done before with other database products. So maybe FoundationDB is choosing that path to follow...<p>> Dave Rosenthal is a co-founder of FoundationDB.<p>I don&",
