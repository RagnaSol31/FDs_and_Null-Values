But I do still have some insights into the observations they have written about.<p>We offer reminders to log your food if you have done so far today.  Users can pick the time and then we use iOS notifications to remind them, similar to the way they remind users to log their weight.  Tis feature is iOS only, no Android or web only version of it. If you compare users with reminders enabled to users without reminders enabled we see users with reminders enabled lose 1.8 more pounds.  (8.4 vs 6.6lbs)<p>However there are two other observations that we see from the Lose it! base.  First, weighing yourself daily is stressful.  People get down on themselves all the time because they gained weight from one day to the next when they thought they were doing good.  This is because people fluctuate weight so much day to day based on so many factors.  Most users on the forums always recommend only weighing yourself once a week.  We also had to build in a buffer range for users once they hit their goal weight because so many users complained that their weight moves around so much once they hit their goal weight they kept getting bumped back into a weight loss plan.<p>Another pattern we see is that users that have a Withings scale that automatically records their weight receive a lot of value (expressed in emails to us, posts on the forums, or written on their wall) from the device.  We haven't had time to run stats (on how it effects weight) on this yet but we are starting to talk about the 'passive tracking' for users that have a Fitbit and a Withings connected to their Lose It!.  Users cannot get over how much a better picture of their health they get after the values come in on their own.  The Withings scale takes the textWeight idea to a new level.  Sadly, both of these devices are pretty costly and out of the range of a lot of people.  So textWeight might be a good way for people to track weight that are on a low cost budget.<p>All in all though, the most important feature that will improve your weight loss is accountability via social / friends both online or in real life.  Studies have shown this in the past so we are not the first to notice or the first to say.  In fact, this is the first thing out of the mouth of most health startup CEOs.",1313632598.0

Seriously - if this is something that you find you can't overcome from practice and a book, but want to, it makes sense to seek professional help in some form. For example, Los Altos has ""The Shyness Clinic"": <a href=""http://www.shyness.com/shyness-clinic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shyness.com/shyness-clinic.html</a>. I just found it in simple searching around - I'm not endorsing them in particular.<p>I'm a nerd too - and there's a ton of things that I couldn't just read and practice away. In fact, our intelligence often gets in the way of our progress - overthinking can do more harm than good on many social issues that plague us nerds. It's hard to stop overthinking by studying!<p>I've got a ton of friends who do group dance lessons to meet people and get out of the house.<p>General tips:<p>* Smile! It'll put others at ease and it'll put you at ease too.<p>* Leave when you're done - don't stay just because you feel bad you haven't spent n minutes there.<p>* Silence is OK - if someone talks to you, it's way better to take an extra 5 seconds (which will feel like an eternity!) and then start your reply than feeling like you need to respond the split second the other person finishes. It didn't feel natural at first, but when I listen to other people it happens all the time.<p>* Everyone loves to talk about themselves. Tell the person you're new to the area and ask them what their favorite drive, hike, day trip, restaurant, or hot new start up is. Ask them why. Ask them anything related. They'll think you're swell <i>and</i> you didn't have to have any deep searching to answer their questions!<p>What brought you out to the Bay Area anyway? And what are your interests?",1313631565.0

Eventually you'll find what works for you and feel comfortable introducing yourself to groups.  Even then you'll occasionally have an awkward moment: that's ok!

Just keep moving past it and don't lose your stride (the exact same advice one would give to a dancer or musician for when they mess up).<p>Hackers and Founders is a great event for this: it's a really great bunch of people.  Hunt down Jonathan, the organizer[1] when you get there and explain that you're new to the area and would love to chat with people interested in X, Y, or Z.  He'll get you started :).  It's much easier to connect with people who share similar interests.  Even if you suck at it initially, practice will make you better.<p>Holding a drink that you can take a sip of is also a great way to avoid awkwardness.
