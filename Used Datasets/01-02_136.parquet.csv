(this is an overly simplistic definition, but it is mostly right, almost all the time).<p>So you have:\nGross Revenue - Expenses = Earnings<p>What is left out of this simple definition is ""operating leverage"".  Operating leverage is the concept that you have a set of costs that don't move much no matter how much your revenue moves.  Most internet companies have a lot of operating leverage.<p>So lets take a hypothetical company:<p>Quarter 1: (Revenue) $100m - (Expenses) $99M = (Earnings) $1M ..... All with a market cap of $100m, the P/E would be 100.<p>Now, if expenses are mostly fixed, (think lots of engineers salaries which have most everything running in macros etc.) and the revenue increases by 5% what is the new PE?<p>Q2\n$105m - $99m = $6m .... all with a market cap of $100m, the new P/E would be about market average of 16.66<p>--You could do the same example if you drop your long term projections on R&D, or acquisitions or any number of expenses.",1336096150

45,3926621,story,,,2,2,buu700,Ask HN: Interested in porting a game to Android and splitting revenue/IP 50/50?,,"A few years ago, I wrote a fairly interesting adventure-RPG which received a lot of positive feedback from people I demoed it to and talked about it with, but over time I pretty much forgot about it without ever releasing it. Since then, I've looked back at what I had, and realised that the format would be really well-suited to Android/iOS (more so the former since the code is already in Java).<p>The code is 95% done (there were a few levels which weren't fully implemented, IIRC), but the game itself is pretty small-scale compared to something like Pokmon, and everything aside from the code is more or less complete.<p>So, here's what I'll contribute to the project:<p>* I'll help with the coding and related work, of course, though it will be more of a side thing for me<p>* I have a private Git server we can use<p>* The original Java Swing code, including a custom game engine, characters, levels, maps, etc.<p>* Extremely extensive documentation (this may very well be more useful than the original code for some parts of the game, actually); includes all level specifications, event flow, all dialogue, etc.<p>* Related video, images, and audio<p>If anyone cares to see it, this is the intro video I have embedded in the start of the game: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i4i9sz44-k (depending on how professionally the redux wants to take itself, I may be willing to put in some money after the MVP release to remake this and/or properly licence ""borrowed"" IP).<p>Regarding funding, if someone does decide to take on this project, we can set up a Kickstarter page, but if that doesn't pan out I suppose we'll have to bootstrap it and keep the first release alpha-quality. Regarding revenue, the obvious options that come to mind are advertising, flat cost, and/or possible in-game purchases.<p>---<p>So, is anyone interested in working on this? Whether you're a professional development team or just a student looking for a summer project, let me know if you'd like more information!",1336095448

It's simply unreasonable to insist that developers build a more ""touch-based"" interface to fundamentally non-touch-based remote systems, and nearly as unreasonable to expect professional programmersto adapt to a ""touch-based"" UI paradigm for _editing text_.

The prototype misses the subtle intersection of all the <i>constraints</i> necessary for good design on the iPad. At a high level, here are a few that you want to optimize for:<p>- Efficiency: how fast can the user perform the task at hand?<p>- Intuitivity: how likely is it the user will understand how to use it without direct instruction? (based upon trial and error, previous experience, etc.)<p>- Consistency: how much is it like other patterns in the same UI/environment?<p>- Metaphor: how much does it 'feel' like other real-world objects and leverages how the user understands them already?<p>These are of course a sample of high level overlapping themes. This particular prototype is obviously optimizing for efficiency. It does so very well, but at a very, very deep cost to the others. It is an undiscoverable interface. It utterly destroys the direct manipulation illusion of the iPad. It causes the virtual keys to no longer be metaphorical buttons since you can drag across them for an effect. It is inconsistent with other use of gestures, particularly since you are controlling a cursor <i>remotely</i> much like you would with a mouse (likely a fire-able proposition at Apple!)<p>The thing that makes Apple's work so amazing is the balance they manage to strike between these things and so consistently get it right.

Those kinds of apps have often been around over a decade with little or no modifications or auditing, because if someone cared enough about the apps to maintain or audit them it's likely they'd have moved to a more performant backend.",1336093279

Just a few snippets of php embedded in html.\nIn terms of your problem with the dashboard url, theres a login link at the bottom of most themes and when logged in theres a big honking button that says dashboard. not too complicated.\nAt first I thought c5 would only be good for simple brochure style sites, but when I got into the internals I found that its a ton easier to build massive sites with than many other cms/blogs like wordpress ( a lot less confusing for the customer too).",1336093214
