3,372578,comment,372270.0,372558.0,0,0,boucher,,,"Although its clear I'm not going to change your mind, I would only point out that the law you're talking about exists to allow companies to enforce other longstanding laws, specifically copyright.<p>Just because you would like to be allowed to copy any media off any device doesn't mean that should be possible. Your interests are not the only ones to consider. Under the law, content producers have rights too, and it's reasonable to expect them to try to protect those rights. Anyone certainly has the capacity to (attempt to) rob a bank, but that doesn't mean adding a safe is taking away their freedom.<p>Now, ultimately, I think DRM is both a waste of effort and bad business, but it's disingenuous to call it a moral issue; it isn't. It's a legitimate disagreement between competing interests.",1227318942

You're thinking: what a jerk! Well, I care as much about this poor soul as I do about any of the other thousands of people who died today. I am a compassionate person, but I have some gripes, so please hear me out.<p>I live in the UK, and for the past several weeks we've had to suffer the media being obsessed with itself over [this](<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7741322.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7741322.stm</a>) and [this](<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7740926.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7740926.stm</a>). They've each consumed 4 or 5 days of consecutive news headlines at the top of the bill. Politicians even get themselves involved - no doubt to disassociate themselves from having to answer real questions about their calamatous mistakes! It's a real circus, with destructive consequences, and this too is a circus, albeit a smaller one.<p>Yesterday I clicked on a link regarding this whole saga; it was worded with (fake) outrage over the Justin.tv CEO's notable lack of compassion from the press release. Personally I always find that press releases are great vehicles to show compassion! Anyway, right there in the middle of the screen was a very prominent screencaptured image of that boy's dead corpse. Uh, yeah, thanks for that er suicide porn. Very appropriate. Very well considered decision.<p>There is apparently good reason why established media don't go in to the details and gratuitous imagery of suicide that it reports - studies show that it can inspire further tragedies to take place, perhaps by indulging the fantasies of those among us who may be contemplating taking our own lives. With journalism, professional or amateur, online or offline, comes a great responsibility granted to it by a free society that shouldn't be taken lightly.<p>I fail to understand why tdavis felt the need to post a ""public apology"" over this. I can just imagine him standing in front of a press pack, his humiliated wife by his side, trying to worm his way out of some scandal to salvage a career. It never seems credible to me when people retract something they've said - why didn't you just say that you acknowledge that you have a dark and twisted sense of humour and that you won't apologise for it?<p>I thought HN was supposed to be a community of tech oriented entrepeneurs collecting relevent content, but judging by the cumulative editorial process that I've witnessed lately it seems to be descending into becoming nothing more than just another category of foxnews.com.<p>Now, you can release the hounds and I'll just stand here.",1227318668

17,372563,comment,372091.0,372091.0,0,0,strlen,,,"Few things-<p>First of, there is a way: if you're confident that a start-up you like will succeed, you can invest in it by joining at a sub-market salary and taking a high equity stake. This way you're investing ( $market_rate - $negotiated_rate ) * 4.<p>Yet this approach has issues: you can't join multiple start-ups at the same time and of course you're taking a long term and substantial risk. Yet it also provides a filter of ""investors"": if you can get hired in start-up run by competent people, presumably you're able to judge the likelyhood of a start-up's success.<p>If we take substantial public investments in start-ups, we'd have people with no domain knowledge and in no financial shape making investments in start-ups that generate the most (or the most targeted) PR. This is very much what happened during the housing bubble (people with no knowledge of real estate buying ""investment properties"" using borrowed money at prices they couldn't afford to pay).<p>Bottom line is that investment in a start-up is risky. There are tons of faux-entrepreneurs who'd abuse this method as a chance to flip a quick buck (take an initial investment, float more and more PR about the company and sell their stock for a profit to investors who took are hoping for a quick profit).<p>There is another issue everyone is talking about: public markets are effectively closed for <$500mm companies. M&A is slowing, especially at prices between $100mm and $1bn -- the types of companies that are too big for Flickr-style exit and too small for an IPO.<p>Running a profitable mid-size company may be great for the founders (take bonuses/receive dividends after hiring a professional to run the company while you either step-away or step-down to a CTO/VP of Engineering), but what about the employees? The employees in this situation are not likely to see anything for the equity, other than through secondary private equity markets (which are not common in cases other than Facebook and are limited).<p>This leave employees screwed: either wait for the ""next Google"", work at a public company (where the equity may be worth something, but the quantity of it isn't substantial and you have little ability to affect the worth of your equity), be employee 1-5/founder of a small ""built-to-flip"" company (limits you to, essentially, consumer web-start ups) or work for a salary/bonuses.<p>Here's an idea I'd suggest: allow limited sales of early equity by employees to non-accredited investors who believe that the company will achieve phenomenal growth later on making their equity worth something.",1227317729

I have always wondered why micro-financed model isn't the solution for all the financial worries of startups and the VC play.<p>This is the ""change"" that would make a lot of things easier, ensure startups keep up their momentum and not waste in VC fund raising process. More you have angels who are truly angels backing founders. (I understand this can hurt lest rational thinking is lost)<p>Micro financing at angel level (be it 5 friends/colleagues or more) is great. Someone needs to institutionalize this or have some learnings on how to deal with accountability, resolving dispute and the like.<p>For people in India, Israel, Ukraine and the rest of east Europe the startup costs are quite low. $100K is like close to upper end angel funding.<p>I know of at least 6-7 ex-Trilogy startups in India - brilliant guys, doing it right, when it comes to funds Indian VCs are most risk averse they wouldn't invest in anything other than jobs, matrimony, real estate and travel. I have always wondered why would it really bother for couple of ex-Trilogy in US to invest. For 2 guys to put something like $50K it would be hardly anything.",1227317476

Maybe ""a car"" is extraneous, too, though I suspect dealership contracts would have something to say about being turned into a Cadillac Pencil dealership. But still, I would imagine GM has a lot of discretion about what gets called a ""Cadillac"".
