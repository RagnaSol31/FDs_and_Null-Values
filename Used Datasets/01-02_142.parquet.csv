Someone somewhere has to make a decision of what people want to buy and make it in advance of the item being purchased (hence inventory). This is why most business use central planning. If they get the planning wrong they lose money and potentially go out of business. The question is can this be scaled up now economy wide now that we have much more advanced computational tools to predict and react swiftly to demand changes. I don’t know :),1437442762.0

So the strut was way over-engineered for the load and still failed, likely due to a hidden mechanical flaw. Would that make more sense to use a large number of smaller struts then, such that a failure of one or two would be less problematic? You can even test the design for it - make sure the rocket is still working when certain number of struts fail.

One of the biggest reasons is that its very hard to avoid timing attacks on higher level languages (when a computation takes a different time to run depending on the inputs an attacker can extract some info about secrets you control). Performance is also really important because the bad guys will use whatever means necessary to speed up their brute-forcing and you don&,
