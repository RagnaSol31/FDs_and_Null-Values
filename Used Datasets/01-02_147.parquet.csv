11,1396765,story,,,26,32,famfam,"Ask HN: Here is my current batch of ideas. In exchange, I ask for your feedback.",,"I have a pool of unimplemented (or partially implemented) ideas laying around right now. I've decided to let them go into the wild in order to light a fire under myself to chase after which ever ones (if any) that I ""miss"" after I let go. Not claiming any of these are original, but I though there may be unique  opportunities in some of them.<p>In sharing these, all I ask is that you provide feedback on them, even in the form of ""I hate 1,2, don't care about 3, 5, 6, and I may be interested in 4.""<p>1. An alternate twitter landing page (e.g. username.twitteridea.com) that each user can heavily style and customize. I'm shocked that Twitter customization is relegated to simple background images and color. Tweets are pulled via client-side javascript, so themes are simple html/css/js. As awful as MySpace skinning was, people clearly wanted it. Viral potential is large here. Main problem, people don't read a lot of tweets by visiting a user's profile. Revenue model a bit iffy.<p>2. A simplified system for conducting beta tests. Match up companies (thinking micro ISVs or small webapps here -- this is not an enterprise play) that need exposure + a diverse tester pool with people who like being early adopters. Allow testers to earn reputations and allow companies to filter candidates through quality thresholds. Now testers are incentivized to do a better job, so they can get into more ""exclusive"" betas. Plenty of room to add in social elements here too. I think someone must be doing this but I've yet to Google the right set of keywords to find them. The differentiator here is that it's an offering for <i>testers</i> too, not just companies. Almost creating a marketplace where the currency is reputation.<p>3. A hosted solution for referrals (non e-commerce - this is not an affiliate system). I posted about this here once at http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1280478. Basic idea is to host a system/api that lets you build per-user referral codes, track those referrals, and then provide widgets to let you give users badges, show top referrers, things like that.<p>4. A guided daily diary. Inspired by Keen's Simple Diary. http://www.simplediary.com  Pose simple questions to allow people to reflect on each day. Short and sweet, no feeling of obligation. Okay, that's just a rehash of the book itself. Now make it interesting by crowd-sourcing the guided questions or making them social (amongst your friends). Share entries etc. Favoriting answers. This needs more fleshing out. Big problems are: content until you solve crowd-sourcing, and how to monetize.<p>5. Private blogs/microsocial sites for families. Keep it fun and easy - think Tumblr. ",

22,1396754,comment,1396380.0,1396563.0,0,0,bwanab,,,"All that you say is correct. However, I would like to mention that motivation for the euro was at least as much economic as political. Many companies in Europe have means of production that span several countries. Having a stable currency across those countries decreases their uncertainty which certainly increases their willingness to invest. Vaclav Klaus is correct in his diagnosis of the problems with a single currency - this is nothing new - Jane Jacobs described everything he said in his article more than 30 years ago in her book ""Cities and the wealth of nations"".<p>He is incorrect in that he ignores the motivations behind the euro. Americans, of which I'm one, should try to imagine a world in which a company in New York that has a supplier in New Jersey would have to hedge their future payments to account for potential currency fluctuations. While the cost of currency hedging has decreased in the past twenty years, it is still a significant business driver. Not one of my European friends and colleagues believes that the end of the Euro would be a good thing.<p>On the other hand, I'm not so sure that currency revaluation always represents a sleight-of-hand. It can and often does, but at it's best it forms an immediate positive feedback that the balance of accounts between two countries with different currencies have become out of line. What the world needs is a feedback mechanism as immediate and accurate as currency fluctuation that doesn't impose the kind of economic risk to individual economic entities within those countries - plus, what you said above about politicians and voters.<p>Sorry, again tl;dr.",1275443467.0

Not only has the BP leak massively surpassed Valdez in volume (2-10x), it took place a mile underwater, which multiplies it's danger.<p>Exxon Valdez was a surface spill, so most of the oil that was spilled stayed on the surface of the water and began to have dramatic effects on the coastal environment. This disaster is leaking millions of gallons per day (Valdez was 10 million gallons) from the sea floor, much of which is rising slowly to the top through a mile of water, dispersing on its way up, and some percentage of the oil is clumping at the bottom, or simply not rising [1].

There is too much competition online.  In fact, when I was freelancing, I didn't have a professional website of my own at all, I just had my own personal blog, which brought me zero clients.<p>For me, being an effective freelance web developer was all about making and cultivating personal connections.  As a freelancer you must be reasonably good at all aspects of business, including business development and sales.  I think most salespeople would tell you that the key to sales is meeting people, telling them what you do, and finding out if they need your services or if they know anyone else who does.<p>The great thing about being employed in web development work is that it is a skill with a lot of demand, so it is not difficult to find people who need it.  What is more difficult is finding people who will pay at a level that makes the pain of freelancing worthwhile (for me, the pain of freelancing was mainly being solely responsible for absolutely everything, including the parts I detest, which are primarily billing and collections.)",1275441464.0

I would do it for you but next week is very busy for me, and my main camera buddies are both out of town.<p>Things to consider: lighting the area may require time. 'Good' lighting conditions are as bright as a cloudy day, which is very often more than you think. Take some exterior ooutdoor photos with a digital camera, then some of your stage area under typical conditions <i>without changing the camera settings</i> (ie no auto-mode). If it looks noticeably darker and turning on more room lights doesn't help, then you may need to rent and pay for some lights, which will add about $50 and an hour of setup time.<p>Sound: do you have microphones for the panel discussions? If so then you may be able to just connect a stereo output from the mixer system to the camera. If not, participants will need wireless lapel mics, unless you want stands and cables everywhere (not a good idea). Again, this will up cost, but by about $75 for each two people who need to be given a mic. You may save by having a wireless 'baton' mic and passing it back and forth but that's going to kind of suck. Onboard-camera or boom microphones are generally inadequate for this purpose.<p>What's the format - two people conversing in chairs or a long table with 5 or 6 panelists? In the latter case, you might want two cameras, unless you wish them to look very small in the frame, necessitated by putting the camera farther back in the room. Not an issue for sequential single presenters who can be given a baton mic or un/wired between presentations. Multiple mics require a mixer between the receivers and camera.<p>Make sure the camera person has a tripod with a fluid head. Nothing worse than shakycam on a scene where the subject is sitting still, or jerky panning if the camera is moved from person to person on a cheapie tripod. Camera + tripod is going to run you about $75-125, each if you need more than 1.<p>Format - if the camera guy just hands you a mini-dv tape, can you use it, eg by sticking it in a camcorder you already own? If not, ask for the footage on DVD, or loan them a USB drive. 1 hour = 13gb. DVD transfer will take about 2hours of work on the shooter's part, and run you another $50. If more than 1 camera, multiply. If it's for the web only, maybe they'll do it for the same price instead of DVD. Frame rate should be 29.97 or 30 (preferably the former) which will offer the best quality and compatibility for easy subsequent web compression. Avoid 24 frames/second, that's for art stuff. You don't need HD unless there's someone famous and you want to preserve it for the ages. A DVX100 or XL-2 will provide sufficient video quality.<p>Mention this last (as well as the likely need for lights or microphones) in your ad to look knowledgeable, signal the quality you require, and avoid being ripped off. If appropriate, mentioning 'post event beer' will usually save a few bucks (~20%) by making you seem friendly and convivial rather than cold and corporate. Use the information here and guess at a likely total. Offer that upfront in your ad, which will attract more replies as people hate having to write quotes for clients who may never actually book the job. Payment is always on delivery of final media unless you negotiate other terms. Do not ask for credit on any job worth less than $1000, it's not worth the person's time even if that's your organization's purchasing policy unless you can honestly promise a regular gig. I would want $250-$400 for this gig, assuming you're a cool guy doing something that's not very commercial. If this is business/corporate, then I'd bring more stuff but expect at least $500.<p>Legally you are commissioning a 'work for hire' and and laying claim to all copyright in the resulting material, from raw footage to final edited product (if different). This includes the master tape if you are getting it transferred to DVD. You need a release from the camera guy to this effect. Typically shooters don't want footage of events for their reel, but if they ask it's good form to allow it. If your panelists are even remotely famous you need a release from them authorizing the videotaping. It's also a good idea to put up a sign at the door of the event saying that by entering, attendees agree to being filmed and your use of the film in any context. You should also secure a release from the building owner, even if you work there - in that case have your supervisor authorize it. that seems like a bunch of unnecessary paperwork for something so informal, but it won't be if your video ends up widely seen and someone later claims you made a participant, attendee, or the venue look bad in some nebulous fashion.",1275440533.0
