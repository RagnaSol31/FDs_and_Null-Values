Researchers don't want to be known as publicity-seeking cranks, they want to be known as earnest and honest academics, which I suspect entails playing to the in-crowd and letting the system work[2]--the system being to talk to your colleagues before hand, release everything through peer-reviewed journals, and if everything passes muster, you've eliminated any risks to your reputation while achieving renown as the guy who proved P != NP.<p>On the other hand, having the proof publicly available to anyone who can understand it can massively parallelize the process of having it verified, or having errors found and potentially corrected. Meanwhile, the researcher's reputation is maintained, because he did the right thing, and if any errors are found he'll be judged to have acted prudently and conservatively in advance of having his findings reviewed.<p>[1] Fleischmann and Pons publicly claimed to have discovered a means to induce nuclear fusion at room temperature in 1989, but their results couldn't be replicated.<p>[2] And the system <i>does</i> work--this is no criticism.",1281405467.0

For entrepreneurs balancing risk-reward, trying to build a company that is solely equity valuable is tough.<p>Also, I don't think the equation is quite so binary.  Cash businesses, by virtue of the cash they generate, can expand and enter adjacent markets and these growth initiatives can increase the equity value of the company.

The fall off to T-Mobile/Sprint in terms of coverage is dramatic. There may be some spots where you have 4 good choices but for many of us it's AT&T or Verizon if we want acceptable service & speeds. Both AT&T and Verizon mimic each other's pricing structures and policies. We just need to look at Sprint who is trying to offer lower prices and faster speeds yet is still losing money. The duopoly owns the most valuable chip -- coverage. The other players are at a permanent disadvantage because they can't grow with inadequate coverage nor can they address the coverage problem with poor growth.,1281404685.0

Better than my family, which is how this whole thing got started.<p>About a year ago, in preparation for my little brother starting at an expensive private college (which my family can't afford), I started teaching him to program. Fast-forward a year later and he's at the point where I throw him my junior stuff and he can pretty easily make $30 - 40 / hr. He's good with Wordpress, CakePHP, Facebook apps, etc. I'm actually really pleased at how well it's turned out.<p>Now my dad is interested in going down the same road. He's in his late 40s and has been a general contractor (construction) his whole life, and the last few years have been rough on my family financially. However, he's actually fairly technical and I suspect would <i>easily</i> grok the principles of programming, especially most LAMP dev, which isn't terribly challenging. He called me looking for advice, and I'm not entirely sure what to tell him. I don't think he'll be looking to join a startup at 50 (but who knows), and I'm not even sure if he'd be looking for a job. I think contract / freelance is more attractive to him at this point, because he's interested in some flexibility and making better money. I know he can learn what he needs to, and he has plenty of client management experience, but will he be able to find work? Will people hire a good developer who is older like that? I just wasn't prepared for seeing my Dad go down the road of building crappy Wordpress blogs for $1500 like I had to do, and I'm wondering what advice people have for how he might make this kind of switch, or whether it's worth doing at all.<p>Is starting programming only for the young?",1281403761.0

(very low, consider that my parent's Bay Area home has risen by about 5.7% yearly since the 1980s) What that leaves you with is entrenched residential and commercial property owners paying relatively very little in taxes.<p>You're forgetting that their property taxes are continuing to go up even though property values have gone down significantly.  Why?  Because their assessed value is below market value and as long as that's true, their taxes go up.<p>That factor makes property tax revenues far less volatile than they would be otherwise.<p>We know what counties and cities do when property tax revenues boom without a cap - they ramp up their spending.  When property values crash, as they do every decade or so, that tanks their revenue, so cities and counties jack up the rates.<p>> If you are a new resident though, you get no immediate benefit - your taxes are assessed at the purchased value.<p>You get the benefit of knowing how your property taxes will behave.  (If you buy right before a crash, you do get a respite until values recover.)<p>> that's $17.6 billion a year - pretty much the budget deficit of the state.<p>It's also significantly less than state spending has increased in the last few years.

But a couple of thoughts on the investments front:<p>1.	In many ways it is about time horizon.  If you are sure that you will not need access to the funds in the short term (conservatively, in the next 10 years) then you can invest in high risk vehicles.  But remember, this is not necessarily because the funds are in a 401(k) or IRA account where there is a large early withdrawal penalty, but also because high risk instruments could have fallen greatly in value at the time you need the funds, and if you have to withdraw them at that time you’re forced to take a large loss.<p>2.	If you think you have a long time horizon make sure to do the math to actually be sure - ndimopoulos’s advice above about having an emergency fund is good.<p>3.	If you have a long time horizon, there is no need to discount 401 K plans and IRA plans.  Tax-free growth, or tax deferred growth as depending on which flavor you choose, is an amazing thing.<p>4.	If you’re really interested in extremely risky investments in an effort to expose yourself to the largest upside, there’s been some recent work around lifecycle investing where some relatively well respected academics are proposing a model that includes some small amount of leverage for folks who have a long time horizon and a large amount of risk tolerance.  This will road, if you choose it, bears quite a bit of research before you start. Take a look (as a start) at <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lifecycle-Investing-Audacious-Performance-Retirement/dp/0465018297"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Lifecycle-Investing-Audacious-Performa...</a><p>5.	Remember that being rational with money is a lot easier when its not yours and when it’s not decreasing rapidly.  It probably bears some effort on your behalf before jumping into any high risk investments to project yourself into the future and understand how you would feel if your life savings drop by 50% or even 80%.  Make sure that you’re OK with this.<p>Just a couple of thoughts, hope this helps.<p>P.S. I am the cofounder of the recently launched YC Summer 2010 company FutureAdvisor.  Our current product targets specifically optimizing an existing portfolio, so not much help in this situation, though this is definitely a scenario we hope to support in the future.
