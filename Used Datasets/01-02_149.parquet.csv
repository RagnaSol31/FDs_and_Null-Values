Even with LTE just around the corner, richer multimedia at higher resolutions will partially offset those gains.<p>Note that according to Nielsen's Law bandwidth growth rate, while sill exponential, is slower than Moore's Law (transistor count) and Kryder's Law (disk space), so we will be increasingly bandwidth limited as time continues [1]. For an example just look at SSD hard drives. To overcome bandwidth limitations the best SSDs now have whole ARM based computers in them to compress data on the fly, reorder operations on the fly, and run its own garbage collection programs just to save from going over the already very fast SATA bus which the latest drives fully saturate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen%27s_Law",

On the other hand, a cursory examination of his comments would show that every response to ""the benefit of a humanities education is X"" is met with a reaction with something of the form ""engineering students can also do X"" (meaning that they are physically capable of doing it).<p>This reaction occurs regardless of the merits of the initial claim, and without a basic examination of its points. He then delves into what I can only call a petty dissection of the semantics of the argument. If I had said that a benefit of my education was the prominent role of public speaking and debate, no doubt that would immediately have been met by a predictable, worthless (in the literal sense of providing no value) rejoinder: CS students can debate also.<p>This is a degenerate point and not at relevant to a serious discussion of what benefits are provided by a humanities education. That sort of criticism can be leveled at anything.<p>This doesn't even address the fact that the way he has chosen to frame this conversation is totally absurd. ""CS doesn't do abstract"" is what he thinks people are saying, which would be a ridiculous statement to make. The terms of the debate don't allow for any sort of gradation or nuance -- this perspective can't admit that there is a qualitative difference in abstract reasoning between engineers and philosophy, while still allowing that both receive an education in it.",1306288421.0

The same test images, compressed with WebP, looked surprisingly decent and were quite usable.<p>That said, if our photo storage budget had been 10 kbytes instead of 5 kbytes, JPEG would have been fine for the project's purposes.

Its true, if you work at Google people who you haven't talked to in years, or who imagine they knew you back when, will approach you to get you to hook them up with someone inside Google who can see the value of their idea/product/company/etc.<p>My short answer got down to:<p>""So nice to hear from you, be successful in your endeavor, develop market leadership, and execute faster than Google. The correct person from Google will then contact you. Cheers!""<p>There are a lot of things you can say about Google but 'unaware' isn't one of them. And especially if the technology at hand is so clearly a 'good fit' with Google then you can assume that Google is aware of it and if they haven't deployed it then <i>they have already rejected it</i>.<p>That last bit is key, for better or worse, nearly everyone at Google thinks they know better than you, they are smarter than you (or you would be at Google), and anything you think you know about the value of what you are doing is wrong because if you were right Google would already do it.<p>Now you and I both know that with great hubris comes great blindness, but the <i>only</i> way to convince someone at Google that you've got an idea that is both good and that they need, is to execute on it so well that it starts causing them some pain. Just <i>telling</i> them about it won't get you anywhere. Trying to get a meeting where you want them to sign a deep NDA to prevent them from stealing your idea is a non-starter.<p>The good news is that you don't have to worry about ""getting in touch with the right person"" at Google. Don't spend any time on it. Just do what you're doing well and if they care, they will get in touch with you. If they don't they won't and you won't have wasted any time courting them.",1306286610.0

Standard grammar guides also say that when you end your sentence on a quote, the punctuation mark should move inside of the quotes.  Even if it wasn't originally the end of the sentence.<p>That is exactly what the journalist in question did.  The omitted section of sentence was the word <i>not</i>, and it appeared at the end of a sentence.",1306285482.0

In the big rolling jackpot games, the average payout is about 50 cents on the dollar, but after weeks and weeks of paying 10 cents on the dollar with no big winner, the jackpot builds until it's higher than the expected number of dollars coming in.",1306285355.0
