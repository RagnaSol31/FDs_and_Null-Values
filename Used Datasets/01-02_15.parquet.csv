The big three want to be bailed out using this fund which defeats the whole purpose of why this fund was started in the first place. I don't see how giving this money to the big three will help anyone. They will go on to build those big SUVs and will need more money in six months. The jobs that would be saved will be at stake again.<p>Jobs at companies like Tesla are more likely to stay.

11,381278,comment,380377.0,380650.0,0,0,CatDancer,,,"Well, I think there's different kinds of risk, and mathematically from a financial point of view they may look the same, but it's not the whole story.<p>For example, suppose I want to take a year off and go hiking.    I <i>could</i> have worked that year instead, made 100K, invested that in the stock market, and be a multimillionaire by the time I retire.  So from a financial point of view, going hiking is a really terrible idea.<p>Or, suppose, I feel like taking that year and doing a startup.  And suppose I have a 90% chance of failure.  OK, you can run the numbers, and probably show that, on average, I'll do worse than if I took a job for a year.  So, yes, looking at it that way, you can say that my starting a business is an ""exceptionally high risk"".<p>Except... what if I'm working on a project that I feel like working on?<p>A part of the interview with Steve Wozniak that I found quite fascinating was that he said he didn't feel like he was taking a risk with Apple.  Sure, he could have worked all those extra nights and weekends and had it come out to nothing.  Yikes!  Invest all those hours, that he could have been working to make money, and end up with zero.  But so what?  He was doing something he wanted to do, that he found really exciting, building one of the first computers that people could own themselves.<p>Is there a danger that one will become overly caught up in a startup, and do foolish things?  Sure.  I been there.  I've done that.  If I had found the right mentor they could have advised me to bail on my startup a year and half before I did, and saved me a lot of grief.  Does that mean that you ""have to"" or that it is ""realistic"" that you're going to wildly over commit?  No.  Just because most Americans are overweight and unhealthy doesn't mean that it is ""realistic"" for me not to have a moderate exercise program and eat healthy food.<p><i>it makes sense to double-down with money</i><p>hmm, I've already responded to this point, as far as I can tell.  I'd be happy to expound more if someone wants a more detailed explanation, but otherwise I think I'd just be repeating myself.",1228094728

If he doesn't the 6K will buy a couple of months, there is no fraudulent intent, the debt still exists, it's merely minimising your costs. As others have said credit cards are a nasty way to fund a startup, but financial institutions make them easy to obtain, likewise they make obtaining lower cost methods of obtainin capital difficult, and who can blame them - 20% versus 3% why wouldn't it be structured as such. I find these comments interesting that there is any resistance to getting a personal loan, it has been made so difficult, the banks buy their money at 1% and sell it at 20% on credit cards, what a game. Personal loans are unsecured and go by the ability to repay and credit history. I'm assuming patryn20 has a credit history by repaying his cards on time and will obtain a method to repay the loan, to keep repaying at credit card rates would be foolish.",1228094439

I'd recommend it, not that I've noticed any difference but, I'm old enough that I'm willing to take some pains wrt my brain. Exercise is a big one, btw. But yeah, it should be cheap or, even in a library. I remember there were a couple similar books that came out around the same time. But this biochemically based one, was what I picked.<p>As for the guy being a charlatan or something, calling it a 'program' is just his set of recommendations. He's got ~30 pages of journal citations, he was a neurosurgeon so he had to keep up. This kind of nutrition isn't an established science yet, you have to scrounge papers. If you're curious, if you stumble across it in a bookstore, where he talks about Acetyl-L-Carnitine is pages 104-105.<p>To quote him: (after much praise in general for ALC) ""ALC also appears to retard the age-related drop in nerve growth factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which helps  rebuild new brain and nerve tissues. In addition, in structures that deteriorate over time, such as the myelin sheath, ALC appears to slow and perhaps even reverse the degenerative process - at least in mice"". .. rec dosage: 100-500mg / day (1500-2000 has been used in Alzheimer's patients without side effects). It's expensive though, US $37 for 120 x 500mg. But /all/ books put exercise way up on the list; it can help regenerate .. I forget which brain structure but, they're all good :)<p>But _you_ probably won't see this reply either :/",1228093693
27,381260,comment,380825.0,380973.0,0,0,jd,,,"> sustain a continuous GPS feed to a 3rd-party source<p>Is that even a requirement? Can't you just sync every 5 minutes or so? Or sync more often when the battery is full, and sync less often when the battery is starting to deplete - given enough users that should take care of the power issue. Because it doesn't take a lot of energy to download the congestion information, so like with Bittorrent you only need a couple of seeders.<p>Bear in mind that you need only one data point to prove there is no congestion: a single car driving at 70 miles/hr rules out congestion at that road.<p>I expect it will work if all taxis are seeders, and all commuters are leeching. Considering taxis benefit a lot from such a service it's not unrealistic.<p>The auto-locking problem is another technical nuisance. A firmware update would fix that.<p>Also, I think the problem should be solved entirely without GPS. You don't want a machine to tell you that traffic is OK, what you really want is to receive a text message whenever there are traffic problems on your usual route on weekdays. ""Traffic jam at intersection X"" is all you need. When you get that message you just have to take a minute to figure out alternative route. The passive approach is much more appealing. After all, if traffic has been good all week you're not going to check your iPhone the next morning. Just not worth the trouble.",1228093641

To make matters worse, the company identified more than 50 variants of Srizbi in circulation, impacting 500,000 systems. Those that were deficient or ill-programmed in some way controlled fewer victims -- anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand computers. The more virulent strains of Srizbi, however, controlled upward of 50,000 systems, FireEye found.<p>That meant that to prevent the Srizbi authors from regaining control over their herd, FireEye would have to register more than 450 domains each week just to stay a step ahead of the bad guys. But each domain name registered costs money. FireEye spent $4,000 buying up future domains that might be sought by stranded Srizbi bots.""<p>It would be interesting to see what sort of intelligence they were able to gather while they were running this operation.",1228093564

I think that's true.<p>But they're different kinds of motivational material.  I think the primary difference is that Paul's writing usually builds to some point or collection of points of advice rather than the abstractions being the point.  This isn't really surprising because basically his job is being an advisor.<p>Also, I'd be pretty careful in calling it perfect.  Referring to almost anyone's ideas as perfect sets off the bullshit alarms for me.  Paul's a smart guy and he's got some good insights, but he's sure to get a lot of stuff wrong.  The converse would be to assume that he's stopped making mistakes and learning from them, which I think is the opposite of what smart people shoot for.",1228093517

It takes a community to make use of good ideas, not just validate them. In the former you get the latter. Sure, sometimes a community has to be shaken free of their assumptions. But I'm not sure it's ever apparent by virtue of the strength of a lonely idea. It takes some powerful proof of concept. That's the apparatus.<p>To put it another way, in merely writing an idea down it may exist all by itself in some Platonic ideal. Not surprisingly, the Greek philosophers often left it to others to validate (or invalidate) what they produced. Running tests wasn't truly valued. I'd argue those ideas that have stuck with us the longest are those that engendered the greatest utility.<p>Then there's Heraclitus.",1228093375
