I took the AP Comparative Government without ever having taken the course, or really having any sort of academic exposure to it (hey, it was free with the purchase of the AP US Government, and I was taking the day off from school anyway for the latter test).  My only knowledge consisted of what I read in the newspapers, plus half an hour with a test prep booklet at breakfast that morning, plus whatever I could glean from the test questions themselves.<p>I scored a 3 on it.  Not a great score, but passing.  Pretty good, actually, considering that the test involved writing 4 essays on a subject I knew nothing about.  So I figure perhaps 50% of the outcome of a test is knowing the material and the other 50% is test-taking skills.<p>Ironically, though, I think that the skill of extracting subtle clues to the mental state of the people around you, and the answers they expect, is far more valuable than any subject matter you learn in school.  It's absolutely essential if you work in an organization, so you can understand who the decision makers are, what their priorities are, and what will really impress them without them having to tell you anything.  It's absolutely essential if you manage people, so that you understand why they're working for you and what will motivate them to do their best work.  And it's absolutely essential if you choose to strike out on your own and be an entrepreneur, because that's how you tell what customers want.  They're generally indifferent to you and often have no clue what they actually want; there's no way you'll get them to tell you.",1326592799.0

Do strength training. Do cardio. Do flexibility, motor control, and p/rehab (flexibility, soft-tissue work).  You can still cover most of this in 20-90 minutes/day (45-60 is preferable, less is OK in a tight spot).<p>- Do strength first, then cardio. It has to do with glycogen availability and training stimulus, look it up.<p>- Make sure your strength program is whole-body, whether you do that in 1 day or as a split.  Your basic muscle groups are legs, glutes, back, chest, arms, and abs.  Your basic movements are squats, lunges, deadlifts, rows & chins (back/biceps), presses (chest/triceps), and twists/bends (core/abs).  These can be done with freeweights (preferred), machines, bands, cables, or bodyweight, though you'll get best results with freeweights if available and you can use them.<p>- Emphasize compound movements over isolation, for strength.<p>- Understand that intensity matters for cardio.  You'll do much better getting an intense 4-minute workout (Google ""Tabata intervals"") than plodding lazily on a treadmill for 40 minutes.  No, Tabatas aren't easy.<p>If you want to lose weight, eat less. If you want to gain weight, eat more.  Eat real, whole, unprocessed foods, not too much, mostly plants.  Eliminate harmful noxious stuff (processed carbs, trans fats).  Get an appropriate  balance of carbs, proteins, and fats (40/30/30 or 30/40/30 are good starting points).<p>If you're concerned with body weight, toss BMI out the window (it's completely bogus), and understand the basics of BMR and your estimated daily expenditure.<p>Agree on bar, bench, and rack.  Though the bench is optional -- you can press off the floor.  I'd add (or ensure the rack had) a chinning bar.  And plates might also be useful ;-)",1326591602.0

In smalltalk and other languages that take a message passing approach doing a.b() sends a message ""b"" to object a, and the object can do anything it likes with that.<p>Now the normal (and optimized) route is to find the method on a’s method table and then call that, but if a doesn't have that method then a second method may be called to allow this to be handled. Once you have that sort of mechanism you can make ORM libraries that dynamically examine a schematic at run time and generate accessor methods only as they are needed, decorators, proxies and many other patterns become wonderfully simple, and there are often many more opportunities for meta-programming at run time.<p>The downside is of course that it becomes harder to find errors when writing or compiling, but tight integration of your development environment with your runtime can help with this.",1326591520.0

But ... you can do this.<p>For a couple of nutshell basics:\nBeginners' Health & Fitness Guide: <a href=""http://liamrosen.com/fitness.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://liamrosen.com/fitness.html</a>\nHierarchy of Fat Loss: <a href=""http://alwyncosgrove.com/2010/01/hierarchy-of-fat-loss/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alwyncosgrove.com/2010/01/hierarchy-of-fat-loss/</a>\nEverything You Know About Fitness is a Lie: <a href=""http://www.mensjournal.com/everything-you-know-about-fitness-is-a-lie/print/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mensjournal.com/everything-you-know-about-fitness...</a><p>For a great beginner's book, <i>The New Rules of Lifting</i> (Schuler and Cosgrove) distills a lot of good knowledge, and <i>Starting Strength</i> (Rippetoe and Kilgore) has one of the most brutally effective novice strength programs bar none.<p>It helps to understand basic physiological response to stimulus:<p>- If you eat more food than you need, you'll gain weight. Whether that's fat or muscle depends on:<p>- If you overload your muscles periodically (more weight or reps than they're used to), and provide sufficient rest/recovery and fuel, you'll build muscle.  How you lift (sets, reps, rest) focuses the adaptation (strength, size, endurance) somewhat.  What lifts you do affect what muscles get developed (curls do nothing for your glutes).<p>- Doing cardio of varying modalities (2-bit word for ""types"") will maintain/increase your abilities here. Tabata intervals, hill sprints, and HIIT training are great for short, intense work.  Doing periodic (1-2x weekly) longer-duration stuff will help your endurance system training (mostly making your body more efficient and effective at burning fat for long periods of time). Which is <i>not</i> the same as losing weight.<p>- If you're interested in skill-specific activities (skiing, gymnastics, juggling, whatever), do that. Training is highly activity-specific in this regard, though cardio in one are translates well to other areas.  Your specific motor skills may not.<p>There are a few other bits:  you need rest and recovery.  You can't target fat loss.  Too much cardio is catabolic (wastes muscle mass), though most weekend warriors don't need to worry about this.  Men and women in their 30s onward are losing muscle mass at the rate of about 1/2",

I'm not one to get all wound up over definitions so please excuse if I use the wrong terminology here, I'll try to be as clear as possible.<p>A beautiful site can have an awful UI. The StartSSL site doesn't have that polished hipster-corporate look that we're so used to seeing these days. I think you might be talking about the experience. It's one thing to have a pain in the ass experience with forms or actions that require multiple page views/reloads to complete and quite another to have an ugly site in general. ""Ugly"" <i>can</i> be a very subjective thing though. StartSSL's site isn't exactly ugly but more dated looking. Speaking striclty from a design point of view, without being overly critical, the site is aligned nicely, has a nice grid, the typography isn't fancy but it's not so ugly that you'd complain about it on first glance, the colors are okay and don't hinder readability, there's enough white space, etc. Even so, when it comes to design there are always those intangible qualities that you can't quite describe or put into objective terms (which I'm sure is very frustrating for programmers as we're all about exact, measurable, science-y stuff).<p>So considering that the site isn't ugly from an objective standpoint, how could it still be ugly? To answer that you have to take into account experience. Web design, much like fashion, has fads and trends. Right now we're used to seeing what I like to call ""hipster-corporate"" design. This style is all about being casual while still looking corporate enough for people to take the comoany's site seriously. It's really tough to straddle the line between trying too hard to look hipster-corporate and looking dated and old fashioned. We've all seen the website for the local doctor's office that looks like it's trying too hard to be that big corporate style but failing miserably and looking like the crappy free Wordpress template that it is. Hipster-corporate is really interesting because there are a lot of variations and the amount of hipster style or corporate style that mixed in all depends on the company's personality and size. Too much or too little of one or the other totally breaks the feel.<p>So the point is, after all that, I think we're talking more about the ""feeling"" that the site gives you rather than the objective reality of things when we talk about the site looking pretty or ugly, good or bad, well designed or poorly designed.",1326591026.0
