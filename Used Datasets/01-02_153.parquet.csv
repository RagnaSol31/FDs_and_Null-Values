The categories that are hardest to notice in the acquired language are the categories that don't even exist in the speaker's native language. (For example, Chinese has neither number for nouns nor tense for verbs, nor does it have indefinite or definite articles, so native speakers of Chinese regularly confuse those issues in English.) This is especially so when the grammatical features are marked by phonological features that don't exist in the first language. Chinese does not have syllable-final consonant clusters, so a Chinese speaker's ear is not practiced in hearing those in other languages. So the difference between ""fix"" (present tense) and ""fixed"" past tense can be missed on TWO levels by a native speaker of Chinese learning English, as can the difference between ""sixth"" (singular) and ""sixths"" (plural).<p>Americans, of course, make a huge number of grammar mistakes when speaking Chinese, and rarely notice themselves doing so.",1292982531.0

My local government granted Time Warner and Windstream (a regional phone company, formerly Alltel) exclusive rights to run wires down my street and to my house.  In exchange for these rights, those companies agreed to rate approval and other restrictions.  Now, they want to indirectly extract more money from people in my community by selling premium access to their homes.  I am not sure why net neutrality is not seen as a local or state issue -- much like cable rates and the price of electricity.<p>Similar arguments can be made about the wireless carriers.  The US government artificially limited competition in the wireless space by deciding how many different entities could own the spectrum in any particular geography.  While I am more sympathetic to the wireless companies' arguments for traffic prioritization, the claim of absolute free enterprise is laughable.<p>I am a small-L libertarian.  I don't think I should have any right to tell Apple what content it should or should not carry on iTunes, what products WalMart should stock on its shelves, or any number of other things that private enterprises operating largely without beneficial government mandates might care to do. But, to suggest that a government-enabled monopolist should be able to pick and choose the issues where it can pull out the Free Enterprise trump card is absurd.",1292982087.0

85,2030161,comment,2030095.0,2030095.0,0,0,Periodic,,,"I think Rails or basic PHP are good places to start.  There are plenty of screen-casts and tutorials out there for both.  They may not go into depth, but they will help you learn the basics of web programming.  You should move off of either once you are comfortable as there really is a huge ecosystem of web programming languages, frameworks, and practices and it will take some time to find the one you really like best.  I am going to assume that you are not interested in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript aspects of web programming at this time.<p>PHP is a good start because it is simple.  It is fairly trivial to set up a quick LAMP (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) server. The Ubuntu Server distribution even has a system configuration option for it in the installer.  It's also very simple and easy to create a minimal dynamic page such as one that stores the data from a form in a database and displays it, or does some minor calculations.  The ease of set up and the ability to just plop some <?php ?> tags in HTML are PHPs real strengths for the beginner.  PHP does not lend itself to large applications without careful thought and experience with organization.<p>Ruby on Rails is a decent framework for the beginner because it is so opinionated and will do a lot of the defaults for you.  You will likely generate a few models and scaffolds and can fill in the gaps with your application logic.  It is a lot more complex than just starting with PHP, particularly in terms of integrating with a real web server.  The benefit is the opinionated programming and sensible defaults.  Having the framework make some good guesses for you frees you from having to make every little decision before you understand it.  As you get better at the framework you will realize why these defaults are so sensible and you will learn a style of web programming that many smart people have worked to refine.  The major limitation will be that it can be hard to do things that the framework didn't expect, and writing your own plugins is leap in complexity from setting up simple apps.<p>In short, PHP is very easy to set up for simple pages, but quickly gets cumbersome without experience as the size of the application grows.  Ruby on Rails is also easy to get started with, and will expose you to many good practices, but it provides a narrow path for development.<p>Start with one of those two, then try out whatever you think is cool once you know what all the buzzwords on their home page mean.",1292980912.0

It's much better to do that than to force people to work on something that everybody knows lost, or at least is worse than the competition. That's what 'follow-through' amounts to. One way that Google is still even vaguely an acceptable place to work is that it allows a fair amount of freedom about what to work on, and nobody good wants to work on something that clearly lost.<p>Also, it's unclear that success is measured by direct profit from that project. For example, the world with Android is clearly much more promising for Google's continued revenue growth than one without Android. Mainly, Google is the only company with the software chops to write and maintain iPhone-clone software that even vaguely works and the cash and testicles to negotiate with carriers. If Google didn't continue to bang hard on Android, all the non-iPhone smartphones would suck fairly seriously, and Apple would probably cut pretty seriously into Google's ad profits, despite Apple's ads not being as effective, purely because Apple controlled the dominant smartphone platform. Apple might also have a much stronger influence over the tablet web experience, beyond than just having written the first tablet web browser that worked.<p>(Disclaimer: I like iOS better than Android, having owned both.)",1292980869.0

Unless you're in a position where CPU + memory are effectively all spoken for, I'm not sure I understand why you'd need a dedicated instance for this sort of thing - it'll run for a bit, but I suspect most of that time will be network comms, so it's not even going to thrash your CPU that hard.",1292980803.0

We want to know if there's any evidence that the IPSEC stack was ever  tampered with, and particularly around the time frame that Greg Perry suggested that it was. Worse still, OpenBSD had what appeared to beâ€ â€  a very serious security flaw, and they fixed it without telling users. OpenBSD users do have a right to ask the question, ""hey, what gives?"".\n\n  > â€ â€  We don't know if any particular configuration of OpenBSD with or without hardware accelerators in any particular release of OpenBSD had this problem exploitably, although it sure looks like they did.\n</code></pre>\nThomas, please try to look at it from a different perspective; <i>You</i>\nwant to know if there's any evidence of tampering, and you are free to\nanswer your own question. OpenBSD users and even developers do not have\na ""right"" to an answer, or better said, a ""right"" to someone else's\ntime, instead, they have a <i>responsibility</i> to find the answer on their\nown.<p>If you do not care enough to do the work to prove or disprove your\nallegations, then there's really no point in making or reiterating\nallegations of tampering or exploitable releases. Unlike most people,\nI believe you have the skill and experience necessary to do it, but\nwithout doing the work, you're doing more harm than good.<p>If you were falsely accused of tampering, you'd be pretty upset with me\nif I kept on yammering about it without providing a shred of evidence.\nAnd rightfully so.",1292979612.0
