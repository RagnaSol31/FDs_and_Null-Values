There's an element in the video of the blog posts that always crop up after a popular AskHN. You know, like ""how do I find people to network with?"" followed by 3-10 days of ""23 ways to make new business contacts"" HN submissions (if you peruse /new, that is). The thing that unites most of the blog posts I'm casting aspersions upon is that they purport to be about something, or a list of things, but they wind up weaving those things throughout an ersatz narrative (""Once upon a time in the dark days of CompuServe..."") that obscures the clarity you'd think they'd be trying to give to a list of 23 closely related things. I dunno, maybe that's just me.<p>In short, stop telling me why I'm going to use it, your recommendation engine isn't that good yet.

Do you have experience?  if not, you are going to have a damn difficult time getting $40K on just a part-time job, and right now is an especially difficult time for people without experience.

In fact, probably everything you know about cancer is wrong.""<p>But in fact cancer is being studied by people who don't have it - should they not be allowed to comment on it?",1304471039.0

I know how to get to CNN or the NYT and it's completely pointless to post bin Laden stories here period. I would also say that politics and religion, even if there'a some vague technology connection, should be <i>verboten</i>. There should be some minimum level of genuinely applied or theoretical computing or math content.",1304471007.0

Furthermore, photos aren't real things, they're just pictures of the things themselves. While we're at it, the things you look with your eyes at aren't really the things themselves, they're just light that's been reflected off them, and the appearance of an ""image"" of the scene is a mere illusion!<p>Finally, the way you compare a picture with your remembrance of a scene is utterly artificial. Your memory is fallible, mostly reconstituted from broad sketches and details filled in from similar pictures. Everything is fake! Get over it.<p>(Except for touch, taste, and smell.
