And since the kids of wealthier parents tend to do better, the education signal, by some accident ends up being used a great deal to gauge future success.<p>I actually think that it used to just be a straightforward signal of wealth, but these days we don't want to admit that that's the case, we instead want to justify it as producing some useful economic product.",1229478838

People have that, one way or another. The problem is bad choices, starting with the choice to make an uninformed decision. My girlfriend once worked at a bank. They had a credit cards brochure with a comparison table. 4 or 5 cards had gimmicks: miniature cards, points, miles, gold card (virtually no actual benefit), personalised card, internet purchase insurance (for those that reckon themselves rational). 1 card was the right choice. Lower fees, lower rates, lower penalties. It was grey & ugly & had no fun stuff. No one ever picked the <i>right</i> choice.<p>Those too sophisticated (old) to be swayed by something as dumb as a miniature card or fun points would be swayed by something with a little more mature like exclusivity (gold) or miles. Those making a <i>rational</i> choice pick the extended no interest period or some obscure feature like online purchase insurance or travel insurance or something else they think saves them money.<p>Now these were all the <i>good</i> cards you get at a bank: 16%-19% interest rates. The low interest card was around 11%. Absolutely economical compared to what you get a furniture store.<p>The crucial info wasn't in the small print. It was in a big glossy table. There was a clear right choice for anyone that hasn't had a card & never paid interest or late fees in the last 5 years. It was the least popular option.<p>*prime interest at that point was 7.5%.<p>There is no problem making a decent credit card with no frills. People won't take it.",1229477714

Societies try to do so by inventing cultural taboos!<p>Sex is inappropriate for children because (society presumes) most of them are not equipped to say no and make it stick. They lack the emotional, financial, and legal resources to ""break up"" with abusive or manipulative lovers -- particularly if those lovers are adults, and most particularly if those adults are family members.<p>(Note that, by this logic, sex is also inappropriate for a lot of adults. And there might be some people who are legally ""children"" who are nonetheless responsible and wise enough for sex (I certainly wasn't one, and I can't say that I've ever seen any, but it is theoretically possible... :) Like many societies, American society tries to deal with this ambiguity by defining a magic calendar age at which children legally and morally become adults. Alhough nobody ever said that this was a particularly realistic model, it's the one we've got. We do tinker with it occasionally, on a case-by-case basis.)<p>Why sex and not, say, football? (It's a good question -- a lot of kids get hurt when they're pressured into playing football.)
