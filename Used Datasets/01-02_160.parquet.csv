The fact that the user agent crafted and sent the malicious request at all is a problem worth solving. But for some reason you either seem to believe that it doesn't matter that the UA is acting maliciously on users' behalf, that this is an inevitable consequence of the way the internet works, or that it's such a difficult problem to fix that you'd rather ignore it and focus on the server-side. Or perhaps both.<p>Personally, I don't believe either of those things. Server authors should certainly take point on battling CSRF. But there is an important client-side piece to the puzzle that cannot be ignored.

Therefore, the only time available to hack was in the evening (after school you are hanging with your friends).  And once started on an interesting project, it is hard to stop -- hence the 3-am hacking session.<p>In college, you are often studying late (much more work in college then high school) -- therefore this continues the trend.  After college, you are spending your days programming for your boss, working on projects that may not interest you.  Therefore, to keep your sanity, you are forced to do your personal projects late at night again.  And after all, this is when you are used to hacking on things from years of experience, so your brain thinks it's normal.",1333158456.0

To disagree so strongly when anectodal evidence is shared regardless of context became a culture in itself rather than a model for rational behaviour and is disruptive.<p>Academic science is an entirely different story.

To apply the same standard to our daily lives is absurd - you could as well be against spoken conversation because it's too lossy and converse using pen&paper - speech recognition is tricky after all.<p>This doesn't take much more than common sense to get - you could formalize it for specific cases statistically, maybe using shannon entropy and such - anectodal information is still information and the loss of information by virtue of not being backed up by scientific method is in most cases insignificantly low - just think of it as an efficient compression algorithm.<p>If you aren't ethically against lossy audio/image/text compression, there is no reason to take such a strict stance against anectodal information.

This includes about a dozen core objects, such as request, response, session, and cache, plus a set of HTML helpers (all derived from the same class and named after their HTML counterparts) and a set of form validators (all derived from the same class). This is all very well documented.<p>People like you who have never actually used web2py routinely express concern that this will somehow set up false expectations and confuse people about how Python modules and imports work, but in practice this is simply not the case. Note, web2py also includes a number of modules that require explicit importing, and applications can include their own modules as well as import standard library and third-party modules.

It's unlikely that my bank will be putting user-generated content in front of me any time soon (and if they do I presume that they'll sanitize it well enough to not be a problem).<p>It troubles me deeply to have CSRF declared a purely server-side application problem. The browser is quite literally my agent in all of my interaction with the web. It is an extension of me, and when it does things that pretend that they are me, that feels very wrong. That is why I propose new HTTP verbs: my browser should know (and verify) that when it sends out a SEC* request, that my eyeballs are on that data and my finger physically clicked that button, and it can do this if those requests are, essentially, tagged as particularly sensitive.<p>To place the onus soley on the server-side is for me to abrogate my responsibility to fully control my browser-as-agent. Frankly, even if the server successfully rejects forged attacks, it is not acceptable that my browser, acting as my trusted agent, attempted that attack in the first place.",1333155629.0

I also agree we should work hard at getting better at programming.<p>However, I don't think that focusing on programming alone is sufficient. A lot of projects fail for reasons other than bad coding, and almost no project exists where programming is the end purpose. You can do all kinds of great programming, but if you make the wrong thing, you're screwed. Ditto if you have a bunch of individuals doing great programming that doesn't add up to a functioning project.<p>I also think you're creating a bit of a false dichotomy. When I first tried XP, it wasn't for the sake of doing XP. It was because I wanted to improve how we made things for our users. So exploring XP wasn't tangential to better programming; for me it was closely related, in that programming was a big part of making.",1333155607.0
