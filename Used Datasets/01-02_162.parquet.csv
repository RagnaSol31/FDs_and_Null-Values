64,2595633,comment,2595605.0,2595605.0,24,0,tokenadult,,,"Hi, Paul, I see this poll is ""official,"" because you are the participant asking the question. I don't think I ever saw the particular threads you noticed that prompted your thread-opening post with the title ""Ask HN: How to stave off decline of HN?""<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696</a><p>in which you said 55 days ago, ""The problem has several components: comments that are (a) mean and/or (b) dumb that (c) get massively upvoted."" I have never known exactly what the problem was previously. I suppose few people read this site exhaustively now that the message volume is so high.<p>Since you announced you would experiment with changes in the site,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2434333"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2434333</a><p>I haven't noticed any inconvenience from comments not having visible scores. I have noticed several threads with much discussion of that meta-issue. And I think you have answered your own question here about the issue of site quality when you say, ""I prefer HN without comment scores, because those fights really disturbed me, and they've practically gone away since I hid comment scores."" I too like the new way of doing things. Some discussions that I participate in seem to have been better than they would have been three months ago.<p>But in one thread complaining about lack of visible comment karma scores that was fizzling out as these suggestions were made, several users wondered if a user who had accrued enough karma to upvote, downvote, and flag might be allowed to optionally view comment scores while giving up voting power. That's an intriguing idea. To some participants here, finding the comments with highest point values for skimming threads is perhaps more valued to them than voting. I have thought about that issue for a while. It seems to me that there are several possible responses to the suggestion that voting power be separated from visibility of comment karma scores. Perhaps the learned readers here can suggest other possible responses. In any event, I think it is your call to decide what to do.<p>If HN offered participants a choice of either voting (without comment karma scores visible) or seeing comment karma scores without having voting power, would that be a good idea? Possible responses include:<p>1) Yes, then some readers can skim threads for information, while others vote on comments, and everyone is happy.<p>2) Yes, because readers can skim threads for information, even if that inconveniences voters.<p>3) No, because comment karma scores are misleading as a guide to what to read. (See the post from just before when the experiment began<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696</a><p>in which some kinds of high-karma, low-value comments were identified.)<p>4) No, because everyone should be able to vote, and everyone should have a clue about which comments have a high score (through colors or fonts or approximate scores).<p>5) No, because the interface should be like it was last month, when everyone could see comment karma scores and could vote based on personal karma.<p>6) No, because HN users will use sockpuppets to get around any such distinction between viewing karma and voting.<p>Personally, I haven't committed myself to any one position on this issue, or indeed even committed to whether this is a fitting way to look at how to improve the site. I appreciate you asking for user response, and I wish you all the best in setting site defaults that build a civil, thoughtful informative community on HN that helps innovation flourish.",1306632945.0

That's the one I actually envision. (Hard to imagine it not happening in the long run, barring serious technological stagnation.) However, it might be quite a few lifetimes before we hit that technological point, and people would be making do with inferior tech in the mean time.<p>One possibility is that before we get there, we might go through a phase of relatively crappy extension where we tend to end up stuck at a plateau somewhere towards the end of the decline stage. What I'm basing this on is the fact that (according to Michael Rose) fruit flies and other organisms reach a senescence plateau where their rate of death stops increasing with time, instead remaining at some fixed percentage rate per hour death rate stays constant. In biological terms that means they aren't aging any more, i.e. the death rate is not going up. He claims this happens in people too, just at a very late stage in the life cycle.<p>The idea I am going for is that idealized life support systems, robotic exosuits, implantable organs, and so forth could act as a crude counterbalance for the death probability (taking it to near zero) without actually altering the fact that your body has aged (i.e. would die very soon on average without the external life support).",1306631717.0

If it were true, we might conclude that some languages that I speak that lack marked gender in the languages' grammar are spoken among native speakers who are ""less sexist"" than speakers of languages in which gender is strongly marked. The real-world observation, if anything, is the other way around. I have to respectfully disagree with the strong version of the linguistic relativity hypothesis. Within each language grouping, people differ far more in their personal thinking along the dimension of visual thinker or not, or auditory thinker or not, than people differ from one another in thought patterns based on language background.<p>My native language is General American English, and I grew up in what was essentially a monolingual immediate family and neighborhood of English speakers, although both of my parents had had some instruction in other languages. All of my grandparents were born in the United States, but three of the four spoke languages other than English at home, and my two maternal grandparents had all of their schooling in German.<p>German as a second language was mandatory for all elementary pupils in fourth, fifth, and sixth grade in my childhood school district, very unusual for the United States. I had more German in junior high and senior high (in two different states) and then Russian in senior high. I entered university as a Russian major and immediately began taking Chinese, switching my major to Chinese as I grew in delight for that language. I have had formal instruction as an adult in Modern Standard Chinese (a.k.a. Mandarin), Cantonese, Biblical Hebrew, Literary Chinese, Attic Greek, Biblical Hebrew, Japanese (first in the medium of Chinese, then in English), Taiwanese, and Hakka, and various courses in linguistics (also in the mediums of both English and Chinese). I have engaged in self-study of Biblical Aramaic, Mongolian, Spanish, French, Latin, Hungarian, Malay-Indonesian, Esperanto, Interlingua, etc., etc., etc. For several years, my occupation was Chinese-English consecutive interpretation for people traveling to the United States from Chinese-speaking places to meet government officials or businesspersons here. My observations of many speakers of many languages, and trying to think in two languages in the same conversation while doing my interpreting work, convince me that people's thoughts are much less constrained by their native languages than by the family backgrounds they have, the educations they receive, and the mass media they consume.",1306630875.0
