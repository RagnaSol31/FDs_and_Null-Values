For example, suppose that we had a model that would typically return double what a drug would (modelling for inflation and opportunity cost), but that the pharmaceutical company was obligated to sell the patent at that price. Furthermore, suppose that this model was tweaked to generally return 20% more to the pharma company than holding the drug for the length of the patent.<p>Now the voting public could say that a drug was important enough that it should be funded via tax dollars.",1341626370.0

But if it is meeting their needs and they know how to use it, then keeping that software the same isn't ""stagnation"", it's stability.<p>Whenever I hear users ask for change it's because there's a feature they wish they had or a bug that's annoying them. I've never heard anybody ask for change just for the sake of change, or complain that software was boring because it didn't change.<p>For games I guess it might make sense to keep changing things up just to keep them fresh, but for productivity software I think ""boring, predictable, and functional"" is the ideal state.

Well, consider: many people here are arguing that the Internet isn't a right because someone has to provide or pay for it. In some sense, it's not a ""natural"" right in the same way that they perceive, say, property rights to be.<p>But when you say you have property rights, you're not just saying that the government won't come and take your stuff. You're saying that the government has a positive obligation to send violent thugs in uniform to protect a monopoly, of use and transfer, over a physical object that it has recognized for you. (After all, otherwise a right to private property would be meaningless.)<p>That leads the people making the initial positive/negative distinction into an intellectual trap: all of a sudden, their negative liberty has shown its true colors. It requires as much government involvement as, say, the universal provision of healthcare service. Or the Internet!

We had a binder of local bank roberies that we updated when the person was caught. It was usually rare for a person to get caught unless they were really dumb about te roberery (told someone such as friend they thought they could trust or their license was recorded) or they got greedy and came back several times. The banks never pursued the robbers very hard because the money was all insured. If a robber was smart he would tell the teller to not put a dye pack in the money and we were always instructed to follow those kinds of orders ... There was no reason to be a hero. Also if you ever want to rob a bank don't threaten that you have a weapon ... Armed robbery is a much more severe punishment than unarmed.,1341625875.0

There are many drugs that have the potential to cure all sorts of diseases that never make it to market for this reason.<p>""I'm just not sure why you would not take the next step and isolate the active ingredients and synthesize them so that people can benefit from something with predicable dosages and a price affected by economies of scale.""<p>Because often they work less well and have more dangerous side effects. There literally is no isolated molecule that on average will produce better results than the whole plant, even though what you're getting from the plant is a little different each time.<p>The first rule of recreational drug use is rotate your receptors. E.g. if you keep hammering the exact same receptor with the exact same molecule each time, bad things are going to happen. The same thing often applies to medicinal drugs, in which case standardization tends to be worse on average than taking a random cocktail of chemicals, even if you don't know what it is your taking. Again, c.f. the research on marijuana vs pure THC for a good example of this.<p>""What I still don't understand is why you think that some beneficial compound that's adulterated and present in unpredictable amounts in plant form is better than the alternative?""<p>Because that's what the evidence says is often the case.

Plants are cloneable, and you can grow them in highly controlled conditions and then blend them together the same way they blend tea or champagne. (Which is why champagne from a good house tastes almost exactly the same despite the wildly different growing conditions each year. Same for things like Lipton english breakfast tea or whatever.)<p>""I sympathize with your bias towards the naturalistic fallacy""<p>The naturalistic fallacy is assuming that if something comes from nature it must be better.

This method is straightforward and much more maintainable than the performant alternative: hold everything in place and manipulate the minimum needed to update.<p>It's a particularly important trade-off as you start considering, for example, more complex layouts where the size and positioning of one element may affect any number of others, elements get added or removed, etc. There's a spectrum of variations between these two extremes that let you choose between maintainable and fast, but neither end really has an ideal combination of both. Language and coding style changes can help, too, but a truly complete solution still seems absent.<p>The initial load is the second major source of peril for responsiveness. Even if a custom cache for the load is used, the user's first-run impression is still going to be of an uncached experience. Here the disk seek, as you mention, is of huge importance.

Hardware has gotten crazy fast, but software is struggling to make use of that speed in ways that are valuable to average users (e.g. reducing perceived latency).<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, a computer feels snappy when it responds to user actions (clicks, keypresses) quickly.  That is a holistic problem -- one that concerns all parts of the system -- so it's hard to optimize.  Software tends to evolve ""within the lines""; it's hard to make changes that cross abstraction boundaries.  But that's where performance is.<p>On the other hand, hardware has gotten faster unevenly.  Disk seeks are the slowest thing your computer does besides WAN access, but those haven't sped up much over the last decade.  Disk throughput (and size) have increased orders of magnitude faster than seek time.<p>But we're still using the same software abstractions (and the same software!) for these radically different machines.  For example, stat() is still a synchronous call.  In the old days it wasn't all that slow relative to CPU operations.  Now it can take 30ms, which is 30,000,000 cycles on a 1 Ghz CPU.  So arguably the default should be async.<p>C is another abstraction that had a reasonable performance model when it was invented, but no longer does.  It's hard for the average developer to have a decent (portable) model of a CPU these days, especially with regard to concurrency.",1341623103.0

If a thing like that goes viral we need to consider plenty of idiots on the roads making enough damage as it is already. Imagine giving them just additional angles from which they can crash into each other.<p>However, considering the current speed of research I believe (and hope) that before something like that goes ""very"" public and popular it will be already automated.",1341622999.0

I was told at the time, and do believe, that the memory leaking was an addon problem.  However... firefox was sold on the idea of addons.
