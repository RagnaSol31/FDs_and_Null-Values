He buys the sheets (linked in comments) and has a printer (the occupation, not the device) perforate them and gum them into tear off pads. I know several people who have done this in the past (myself included) though none quite as notorious as Woz.<p>I've made tear-off pads of $1 bills before, if you get a strap of new bills from the bank they come in sequential order and the pads will turn some heads but the bills are completely legit.<p>Uncut currency sheets don't have sequential serial numbers because of the way the print runs work; for uncut sheets the serial numbers are usually spaced by 20,000 or 32,000.<p>As a general habit I spend $2 bills a lot personally (they make excellent tips because people are so tickled to see them... They're not overly rare, go to the bank and ask and most times you can get them).<p>I've been to a couple of trade shows in the past where your ""pay"" for sitting through a particularly boring sales presentation was an uncut sheet of bills and a large pair or scissors and the tiny thrill of cutting off your own $1 bill.<p>Trivia for you all: uncut sheets have special serial number ranges, so you can identify that they came from uncut sheets (for modern bills the serial numbers are 96000000 and higher). This prevents people from buying an uncut sheet, cutting the bills in a strange manner, and then selling them at a premium as rare misprinted bills (not that it stops anyone, look on eBay for misprinted currency and see how many of the bills have high serial numbers...

I work for a shop that does the latter. If I brought software to our clients with the explanation: ""toughen up, read the manuals, we adhered to your spec!"" then we simply wouldn't get paid. Git or DVCS in general isn't this nature though and is turn-key like MS Office for example. If some part of Office was a usability nightmare most people would simply avoid it. Some may not purchase the software altogether if they were to say take a trial of 30 days and couldn't get passed File->Save As or some rote ""simple"" command.

There's a simple argument that seems to indicate that they should not exist.  If I remember correctly, this argument was commonly accepted by engineers at the time Shannon's paper came out.<p>The argument is: you have a communications channel that flips bits with some probability, say 1/4.  Suppose you want to transmit one bit.  The first bit might have an error, so you add a parity bit -- now P(error) is 1/16.  But that parity bit might have an error, so you add a second parity bit, and you're down to P(error) of 1/64.  So you are driving P(error) to zero, but at the expense of ever-increasing overhead.<p>If you keep on adding parity bits, it's not clear that you can ever make the error probability arbitrarily small, while still transmitting some information.<p>That is, in the simple approach above, P(error) -> 0, but Overhead -> Infinity.<p>It is ""intuitively obvious"" that's a fundamental problem, or at least it was, until Shannon's results showed that intuition was wrong, or at least needed correction.
