Telecom in Canada is <i>really, really</i> broken, and Jim Prentice keeps preaching about the choice in the free market, despite the fact that there are only <i>two</i> monopolies to choose from (Telus and Bell are the same entity for all intents and purposes, and then there's Rogers), who both share the exact same pricing structure, almost down to the penny.<p>The CRTC (similar to the FCC in the US) mandated that the major telcos must provide their DSL lines at a wholesale rate to 3rd party ISPs, which worked wonders - except the third parties managed to undercut the existing player's price, with better service. The answer to this was to heavily throttle 3rd party lines, and Prentice will not do jack squat about it.<p>Canada would be a much better place if that slimebag is out of a job.",1227750692

The people I talk about can hack circles around me - but they never got high marks in school (family trouble, learning disability, etc.), and therefore never went to a prestigious college. <i>Many</i> employers' hiring practices are obscenely stacked against coders with no degrees (or even degrees from a ""crappier"" college).<p>What you're describing is the precise problem with legacy admissions - the fact that we are judging a person's skill set via the college they went to, and controlling people's futures as a result of our artificial interference with what ought to be a true meritocracy.<p>If people <i>are</i> objective, and looked at a person's hacking talent instead of whether or not they went to MIT, then I agree - these people can clearly carve a path for themselves despite not going to a prestigious school. But this is not the case.<p>For the record - the people I'm talking about <i>do</i> work on some insanely cool projects despite the fact that they don't go to well-known colleges, or have degrees at all, but they constantly struggle to be taken seriously. When they walk into an interview (if they're lucky enough to get one) the fact that they come from some podunk college automatically tilts the playing field <i>far</i> away from them.<p>To try to be objective - I don't think we can really correct people's perception that people from ""good schools"" perform better. So instead of fighting this false presumption, let's make sure we stack our college student body with truly qualified and talented people.",1227749567

The opposite is true in fact, not competing is conceding.  RIM is going after a market of people that enjoyed their Blackberry's but loved the 'trendy appeal' of the touch screen iPhone. This doesn't mean that the people who want an actual keyboard can no longer use a Blackberry.  They can stick with the Bold, which I'm sure will not be the last real keyboard phone that RIM ever makes.  The Storm will serve to keep plenty of already existing customers from switching to the iPhone or G1 because they like the Blackberry system, or it's standard for their companies.  It will also likely drive new customers who want the professional appeal of a Blackberry with but still dream about the iPhone.  In plenty of industries iPhone's are regarded as a tech toy, not a business tool.<p>RIM has also already deviated from the full keyboard with the introduction of the Pearl, which was targeted as a more consumer phone to compete with Motorola and Nokia and this has been a great success.",1227748245
