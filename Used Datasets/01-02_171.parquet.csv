I think there are two clues to Apple's approach:<p>1. They're clearly evolving their offering towards purchasing -- notably, they just killed TV show rentals.  Why <i>stop</i> offering rentals of TV shows, as unpopular as they may be?  This was a major selling point of the ATV last year.  It seems like they're laying the foundation for their fall announcement, but they had to do this a little early because the fall season starts soon.  I presume that the announcement will be that they're leaving everything but purchases and movie rentals to the world of ATV apps.  Movie rental I think they are still trying to evolve against the studio's feet-dragging.  But TV shows are essential to an app store, so the new deal will be: You want to watch a TV show?  Buy it or get the app.  No confusing in-between option.  Apple <i>hates</i> in-between options.<p>2. Their subscription policy.  I think they definitely wanted to pick something that worked for the Apple TV as well.  The brouhaha over those rules has subsided for now.  But it's a lot harder to tell people to go buy or subscribe to something over the web when they're just sitting in front of an Apple TV.  That's way more friction.  You might as well tell them to call an 800 number.  I think that's something that makes an Apple TV app store viable -- you almost have to have that rule, whereas it seemed kind of excessive on traditional iOS devices.<p>And yes, they want you to buy movies and music only from Apple, but on iOS they have no problem with people using Pandora or Netflix or HBO apps which they get no money for.  Because they're services, just like Netflix and the sports channels you mention.  But on AppleTV, there will probably be more takers for the 30% split and Apple may go with a subscription-only model (i.e. no one-time-purchase apps at all).  This is presuming they only allow video-based apps (wot, no Angry Birds?!?) that you could just call ""channels"".  That is, very similar to the existing ATV apps.<p>In fact, I think a secondary reason that Apple even created the new Netflix app, new YouTube app and sports apps is to work out and test the AppleTV's API and design.  I presume they'll still be around in a new-look ATV in the same way that the YouTube app is still on every iOS device -- Apple doesn't like to lose control.  They're just going to be the founding members of a club of thousands.",1314927715.0

As much as Chinese companies have a reputation for making cheap knockoffs and cloning anything from baby food to Apple stores, there's a significant and competitive domestic Chinese market for cell phones which does reward innovation. Not necessarily YC-caliber innovation, but cell phones became prevalent and dominant in China faster than in the West, because of the large domestic market, low regulations, and international manufacturers eager to jumpstart the market. For example, Motorola was for a while the largest foreign business in China and was the market leader in mobile devices. Cheap operating costs and a rising affluent middle class = lots of cell phones sold.<p>You want an anecdote? I remember when I was in China in 2003. (Or 2004. Around that time.) Back here in the US, Motorola RAZRs were sorta popular. Here's an image for comparison of scale:<p><a href=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2331/2498240940_80a83f70e9.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2331/2498240940_80a83f70e9.jp...</a><p>In China, the popular phones were very different. They were much smaller, they had more varied ringtones, they were more colorful. And they were not all Motorola phones either, Chinese domestic manufacturers were all trying to make their phones as thin, sleek, and minimalist as possible. (Sound familiar?) Since then Motorola has lost a lot of market share to Chinese manufacturers who mostly are not delivering tasteless clones. Part of it is that expensive cell phones become a status symbol, and the people who can afford those phones take them seriously. I couldn't find any pictures by Googling combinations of ""china,"" ""cell phone,"" ""2003,"" etc. So take my word on it or not, but that was the case. (Of course, the Xiaomi device looks like an iPhone. But then everything looks like an Apple product these days.)<p>What's the moral of the story? Don't be like Motorola, don't throw away your Chinese market share, and don't force Google to acquire you just for your overpriced IP.",1314927490.0

Having to pay for a Starz account to watch Starz content through the Starz Player is about the most '90s thing they could do.<p>Having their content on Netflix or Hulu makes media companies feel like second class citizens because -- from their current worldview -- they are. They're no longer the tastemakers, the editors, the curators. They're now just the guys with the content, and in their eyes the content guys are the red on the balance sheet, they're the means to an end.<p>If advertising is the mousetrap, the content is the cheese, and its a big goddamn blow to traditional media outlets to discover that on the internet, they're cheesemakers or they're nothing, because there are waaay better mousetraps out there.<p>---<p>* Stratifying your content curation by creative entity feels counter to what people seem to be expressing they like.<p>I think people like Netflix because it has a disparate collection of content which it recommends, filters, and curates, and lets users choose and collect within that content. You don't need to go to Netflix' ""BBC"" section to watch Doctor Who -- it's just there, filtered by Netflix' employees and algorithms to sit next to other like-minded content.

100,2952511,comment,2951347.0,2951347.0,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I like these posts as well, as its a window on the economics of their information content (in this case music).<p>They didn't mention how long it took them to come with this album, but since the web site says they added a drummer at the end of 2010 and this album was done in April of '11 we will call it 4 months work of three gentlemen best case, and if they really only finished it here at the end of August it would be 9 months. If we use the outside estimate of 9 months, and these guys had 'regular' jobs, lets say they would have earned $60K/year each  with benefits, so call it $67.5K/year each for 9 months at an annualized pay of $90K. Note the numbers here are just guesses, I know they are in Europe and may have access to other healthcare options.<p>So had they worked at this mythical job they would have earned $67.5K * 3 or $203K. They opted instead to spend that time making an album so now, 9 months later instead of $203K in value they have this album with 9 songs on which they own the copyright for the next 75 years. Its an interesting exercise to compare that 'foregone' revenue for the possible future value of the album.<p>They can make as many copies of this album as they want and sell it for what ever they can get. Now they state that Spotify pays them .003 euros/play, Deezer .006 euros/play. Lets say it averages out to .0045 e/play. To keep everything in dollars, 1 euro => 1.43$ according to google, so .0045 E => 6.4 cents.<p>The question one can ask is this ""Would they have been better off working for 9 months? Or making this album?"" We can assume that as soon as they release the album they gave up music forever and went back to a 9-5 job at $60K/yr. (or not but that would be one way to look at it). In financial terms, when does this album they created give them 203K $ of value back?<p>A 6.4 cents/play That is 3.2M plays. Over the life of the Copyright of 75 years, that is 42K plays per year on average or 115 plays per day. So if they had 115 Spotify/Deezer fans who played one of those nine songs every day, they would earn back exactly as much money as they had 'not made' by not working 9-5. Conversely they would have to sell 29,000 albums on Amazon or 22,500 albums on iTunes to earn back the same amount of money they would have made.<p>So a couple of things that are also important. First, they don't have to do anything to manufacture copies of the album. And secondly, their time is available to add another album to this 'stream'. (if the financial analysis of making the this one pans out).<p>What this illustrates is that music is about the long tail, not the up front. If you make back all your investment in making an album in the first year, then your 10 year rate of return will be better than any other investment you could possibly make. What is more you can keep feeding albums into the system at what is your marginal cost of living (eating, thinking, composing, recording). This multiplies your revenue stream going forward.<p>The record companies used to play an interesting game with musicians, it worked like this:<p>Give us the 75 year rights to this music and we'll pay you a big chunk of change right now.<p>Now the criminality was that the record companies created accounting systems which obfuscated additional revenue to the point of not paying the artist anything. However in this world its quite different. If these guys turn into a 'huge success' and sell a million copies of their album on Amazon their are going to make nearly $5M on a $270K investment. In the past they might get $50K in 'upfront royalties' and then never see any of that $5M.<p>One thing they might do is sell the 'rights' to this album for $203,000. They are revenue neutral at that point and if the album does poorly they are protected from 'losing' money but if it does well they don't stand to gain from that. Risk arbitrage, its what VCs do, it is what music companies do, its what you and I do when we fill up our gas tank at half full rather than wait until the car is empty.<p>Being a musician is hard work. And early on when you are finding your voice and your fans, its not very profitable (in fact if you don't love doing it you shouldn't because if you die early all you will have to show for it will be memories of creating that music.) However on the flip side, down the road, it can be hugely profitable with <i>little if any additional investment</i>. You develop a following and your numbers get better, no need to go out can cut down additional vinyl trees :-) or schedule another ""pressing"" of your album.<p>It is this sea change that musicians need to understand, if you don't 'sign' with a label you are keeping control of your profits and managing the risk yourself. If you do sign with a label you can probably get more money up front but you don't benefit from the upside. Distributors make money on leveraging things like PR where it costs the same to promote 5 different albums at radio stations as it does to promote one. They work to amp the distribution so that they make more money. As a musician/owner you can do that but its not as efficient. The better news for musician is that the long tail money ends up in their pockets if they keep the rights, people underestimate that but it can get to be serious cash.<p>It will be interesting to follow these guys as they develop to see how it works out.",1314926211.0

I think they're fine with adding sports channels, but for movies they want you to buy them through iTunes. They'd love a deal with Starz, through iTunes. I don't think they want competing middlemen on their platform though.",1314925421.0

For $15/mo. you might be able to get Netflix Streaming + Starz + Breaking Bad.",1314925340.0
