2,1871682,story,,,2,2,kapauldo,Ask HN: How can I estimate my conversion rate?,,"I am very near launching a rental service.  I did a few $100 Google Adwords experiments, in which the ad was exactly what I was renting along with the price.  I got a bunch of clicks at an average of $2-4 per click, so I know I can get clicks.  The problem is, I have no idea how many of those are going to convert to sales.  I'm hoping that because I'm announcing my product and price in the ad that I won't waste a lot of money on window shoppers.  Anyone have any experience with this stuff?  How many sales per click are you making?<p>Thanks for any advice,\nKevin",1288922356.0

6,1871678,comment,1871473.0,1871607.0,0,0,thomaspaine,,,"I did taekwondo when I was little and I know some people who still do it. All martial arts are technical once you get into them, but grappling is different from striking in that what you do with your body is very similar to following a decision tree. Eventually these decisions get internalized into your muscle memory, but there's still a high degree of ""if he does A, I'll do B, which will leave me open to C and D, which I can counter with E, F, and G, etc"". Basically getting better at grappling involves filling out this decision tree.<p>Striking arts operate at a much faster pace so you really can't do that, the depth of the decision trees are much shorter, which is why I think bjj is more analytical and appropriate for most HNers.<p>I don't want to get into a flame war, but I personally don't find taekwondo and karate to be particularly realistic to fighting. Everyone has different motivations for training though, if you enjoy the fitness and athleticism of those arts, go for it.",1288922215.0

24,1871658,comment,1871473.0,1871473.0,0,0,PieSquared,,,"I logged in just to post this. Try Capoeira. It's not as well known as many other martial arts, but it's a <i>lot</i> of fun.<p>It's a Brazilian martial art which originated with the black slaves transported from Africa. In the 1800's, around 1880 or so, slavery was abolished, and due to massive former slave unemployment and gang activity, capoeira grew steadily more violent. It was soon outlawed, and any found practicing it were jailed. However, around 1930, a movement grew to found capoeira as a ""modern"" martial art, with a formalized training and graduation system, as opposed to a very advanced form of street fighting. Since then, it's been getting less violent and more popular throughout the world.<p>It's very different from the other martial arts. The closest Asian martial art would be Wushu; capoeira is equally ""showy"" at times, utilizing flips, jump kicks, and so on and so forth. A lot of the movements you see in breakdancing actually originated in capoeira. Headspins, 1990's, butterfly kicks, backflips, the ""baby freeze"" are all movements in breakdancing, but also find their place in capoeira.<p>Capoeira is played to music and singing on the traditional instruments. A berimbau, drums, and a pandeiro (tambourine). The speed of the game (the fight) is set by the music. Finally, capoeira is a game of <i>strategy</i>: it requires quick thinking, because every movement by your opponent can be countered and used to gain the advantage. At higher levels, the fight becomes a mental one - you must anticipate what your opponent will do before he does it, and, at higher levels still, you can <i>lead</i> your opponent to do what you want him to do, so that you know in advance what will happen.<p>It's a very dynamic martial art. It's beautiful and incredibly fun, as well as incredibly tiring. It really does a wonderful job of combining ""martial"" aspects with ""art"" aspects: some styles of play emphasize fighting and defense, while some emphasize beauty. Some do both.<p>Here are some links to videos of capoeira games: \n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xxgFpK-NM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xxgFpK-NM</a>\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51q1VB_dDik"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51q1VB_dDik</a>  \n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQl3iInVd0Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQl3iInVd0Y</a><p>Feel free to email me for questions.

This should be pretty obvious, but let me clarify that.<p>Most meetups are centered around a certain technology or language and this tends to discourage people who are working with different technologies from attending.<p>My advice : go anyway. Hackers are generally happy to meet other hackers, regardless of whatever they might be hacking on.<p>For talking with people it helps to do a bit of research into whatever the meetup is centered around and finding some common ground.<p>For example, say you're a Ruby coder doing web stuff and you can't find any group in your region that's doing Ruby. Find a Python, PHP or Perl group. There's a good chance that these people will be doing some web stuff too. That's a HUGE problem domain that you share. You can start on sharing experiences with session/state storage, databases, ORM performance and restrictions, test suites, logging, auditing, load-balancing, scalability issues, runtime bottlenecks, etc, etc. The list goes on and on.<p>Not everybody attending a meetup is a code freak. There are plenty of people who show up for, well, who knows why they show up. The beer and an excuse to leave the house maybe? Others might be recruiters scouting for talent. Some people are just there because they got dragged along with someone else. Talk to them, be polite and move on.<p>What you're looking for is fellow hackers.

I practiced Karate (shorin-ryu) for three years when I was young and I was never really happy. I've been doing flying white crane kung fu (fujian, not tibetan style) for many years now and I love it. It just depends on each person. Some dimensions to look for:<p>Soft (use the opponent strength) vs Hard (punch and kick hard!)<p>Traditional (deep historical background, traditional forms that have been taught for hundreds of years, at least some sparring without any equipment, spiritual dimension) vs Modern (sparring is almost exclusively done with equipments, more acrobatic moves)<p>Martial Arts vs. Combat Sport. I don't want to get too much flak on this one, but IMHO, the more rules you have, the more it looks like a combat sport. Which is perfectly fine if this is what you like!<p>Each school will favor some of these dimensions over the others, even among the same style (e.g., karate, kung fu, and even boxing vary widely across schools).<p>But the most important aspect is probably the teacher. If you are afraid of your teacher, if you are stressed every time you are on your way to the school, it won't do you any good, because clearly, you are not going there to become the next Bruce Lee or to learn how to save your family from burglars.",1288920747.0

119,1871554,comment,1871473.0,1871473.0,0,0,aeontech,,,"I've been doing Wing Tsun kung fu for over ten years. If you find a good school, it's a very methodical, highly intelligent and very technical martial art. There's a lot of depth to it, and as you get better, it gets more and more subtle (as well as a lot more effective). Unfortunately, there's also a lot of schools that are not very good (as with any martial art), so your experience may vary. In my experience, the german (Leung Ting) branch of the art is the best at this point. We have a few ex-fencers in our class, and they seem to enjoy it a lot.<p>The style itself is a soft style, relying on speed and sensitivity to deflect the opponent's attacks and triumph. A lot of the training is partner-training, a lot of it is playing role games. As you get better, we also work on the psychology and tactics of the fight. I've been doing it for a long time, and I have never gotten bored with it - there's always people who are <i>measurably</i> better than you to serve as a reminder of what you're striving for. In many martial arts, once you hit a certain plateau, there's not much difference between someone who trained for five years versus someone who trained for 10 - here, the difference is clear as day.<p>The other thing I really enjoy about our school is a very well structured curriculum - you always have very specific goals and targets to work on, you get tested every 3 months, and the teacher always keeps track of where you are at and that you're making progress.<p>If you're in the SF Bay Area, send me an email (my username @ gmail), I can give you an introduction or an invite to class.<p>Most martial arts schools offer free or discounted introductory lessons. You can attend a class for a month or so to decide whether it's something that suits you.<p>How WT compares to other martial arts (that I have any familiarity with):<p>Aikido - softer, more traditional teaching style, so it can take a lot longer to get good at it. Similar concepts in terms of deflection and redirection of opponent's attacks; not as aggressive as WT.<p>BJJ - focuses on tournament-style fighting with certain rules - great for locks and ground fighting, but there's a reason that most people who take BJJ also take Muay Thai or another striking art at the same time - BJJ doesn't cover those areas well, if at all.<p>Muay Thai - amazing cardio, amazing for working on your balance, but more brutal and simple, not much technique or sensitivity involved.<p>Krav Maga - another very physically strenuous workout, but focuses on a set of very simple techniques. Not much depth to it, after six months or so you probably know most of what they have, after that it's just about getting stronger/faster.",1288918914.0

New Blue Belt here and I really appreciate the strategy and analysis it takes to figure out your own game and apply it to different opponents.<p>A note to those who are interested in starting:  It is a <i>highly</i> technical martial art, but it's not going to feel like it at first.  Other newbs who are bigger and more athletic are going to beat you most of the time.  But if you pay attention, the smaller, less athletic upper belts will have their way with them along with you.  Unfortunately, there is a steep learning curve.   Stick with it and things get easier!<p>Programming for 8-10 hours a day can drive me insane, and it's very nice and therapeutic for me to hit the mats a few days a week.  I get exercise, have fun, and am still mentally stimulated without thinking about technology or whatnot.",1288918887.0
