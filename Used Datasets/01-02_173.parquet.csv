After it is installed, an example/demo is provided by running:<p>photish init --example && photish host<p>Once I put together a nice template and some example sites I they would better showcase my HTML/CSS/JavaSCript and design skills rather then what Photish can do.

Yes, the VP tree has all the problems of the KD tree, i.e. it becomes unbalanced when inserting, but most fast implementations use linear search in leaf nodes instead of creating a full tree, and splitting a leaf once it exceeds its max size (which is normally around 100-1000) usually gives a pretty good vantage point. I guess the same can be done on a KD tree. In my experiments, the VP tree was the fastest tree for range queries when you can&",
