Pinterest may be even worse because (a) the UI is specifically designed to make it incredibly easy to copy content.  The overwhelming majority of Pinterest's content appears to be copied in this way.  With Youtube at least people could and did upload a huge amount of their own content.  And this is directly relevant to (b) Whereas Youtube was about hosting video content which may or may not have been copied Pinterest is so dominantly about copying content that it is much more like the case of the P2P sites whose whole modus operandi was to enable copying.  It wasn't an unexpected or relatively minor aspect of their business - it was their business.  And IMHO copying is Pinterest's business.  The courts took a dim view of the P2P sites claiming that they were just the innocent service providers because of the overwhelming dominance of the use of the service and the fact that the site was designed to facilitate it.  My suspicion is that Pinterest's moves to provide facilities to block pinning are legally motivated to fend off suits to the effect that they are unashamedly a copying engine.,1331171977.0

4,3678276,comment,3677393.0,3677393.0,41,0,billpatrianakos,,,"What we have here is manufactured outrage. Total non-story. I hope others don't start piling on now that this has been written.<p>The real deal is that Pinterest is screwed either way. These terms sound scary but so long as they are enforced sanely there should be no problem. What do you expect them to do? Assume liability for users posting content they should not be posting? They might as well not exist. A lot of startups these days may as well not even try to get traction as long as bloggers keep getting their panties in a twist over every TOS they see.<p>Pinterest provides a service for free that people seem to love. So long as no one is paying them and they haven't gone public they're damn smart to have these terms. If I ran Pinterest I wouldn't want to assume liability for some asshole who leaks a top secret photo on my site that I let him use for free and as long as I'm giving that service for free I'm going to make some cash out of my users. This is nowhere near evil. It's business. If someone doesn't like it they don't have to use it.<p>Question: How do you get over writer's block?\nAnswer: Start reading some terms of service or privacy policy docs from any popular online startup and manufacture some outrage over it. Truth is, if you read any TOS or privacy policy you're going to find something you can turn into a big deal most of the time. I've had it with the TOS/privacy policy outrage blogs.",1331171899.0

Sure, you can go on raids, trade, etc, but there's not the continually evolving strategy and new challenge of a different style of play, new sequences, etc. The games engine simply isn't that rich, it's underlying structure is still limited.",1331170171.0

After all, your interests are not aligned with the rest of Yelp's customers. Or even, necessarily aligned with the taqueria's success. Maybe it's to your codependent advantage that they always stay small and delicious and hidden and yours...<p>preciouss.<p>This is the problem Yelp hasn't solved yet: how to align the interests of Yelp, Yelp reviewers, Yelp readers, and restaurants. Yelp succeeds if reviewers leave bad reviews because they are upselling bad review protection (they say they aren't several times in the FAQ, but they protesteth too much for me), or if restaurants buy ads. Yelp readers succeed if reviewers are honest and they can use reviews to optimize their personal quality/dollar equation. Restaurants succeed if Yelp drives Yelp readers to them, if reviewers leave good reviews.<p>Reviewers have many incentives to game reviews. One of the Yelp FAQs is about payola. If they review enough they gain community prominence through badges/titles. If they review too much, their reviews look suspicious (because they could be making them up instead of actually attending). If they become untrustworthy due to a secret Yelp algorithm, their reviews are obscured from prominent view. If they have a bad experience at a place everyone thinks is great, they run a risk writing a contrarian review and being labeled untrustworthy. And on and on.",1331169824.0

90,3678184,comment,3678035.0,3678148.0,2,0,igorhvr,,,"You are right. The .pdf version of the user manual of pigz (at <a href=""http://zlib.net/pigz/pigz.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zlib.net/pigz/pigz.pdf</a> ) has a few details (the bottom of this answers your question):<p>""Pigz compresses using threads to make use of multiple processors and cores. The input is broken up into 128 KB chunks with each compressed in parallel. The individual check value for each chunk is also calculated in parallel. The compressed data is written in order to the output, and a\ncombined check value is calculated from the individual check values.<p>The compressed data format generated is in the gzip, zlib, or single-entry zip format using the deflate compression method. The compression produces partial raw deflate treams which are concatenated by a single write thread and wrapped with the appropriate header and trailer, where the trailer contains the combined check value.<p>Each partial raw deflate stream is terminated by an empty stored block (using the Z_SYNC_FLUSH option of zlib), in order to end that partial bit stream at a byte boundary. That allows the partial streams to be concatenated simply as sequences of bytes. This adds a very small four to five byte overhead to the output for each input chunk. The default input block size is 128K, but can be changed with the -b option. The number of compress threads is set by default to the number of online processors, which can be changed using the -p option. Specifying -p 1 avoids the use of threads entirely. The input blocks, while compressed independently, have the last 32K of the previous block loaded as a preset dictionary to preserve the compression effectiveness of deflating in a single thread. This can be turned off using the -i or --independent option, so that the blocks can be decompressed independently for partial error recovery or for random access.<p>Decompression cant be parallelized, at least not without specially prepared deflate streams for that purpose. As a result, pigz uses a single thread (the main thread) for decompression, but will create three other threads for reading, writing, and check calculation, which can speed up decompression under some circumstances. Parallel decompression can be turned off by specifying one process ( -dp 1 or -tp 1 ).""<p>I also just updated the article with this info.",1331169560.0

However, how a button looks <i>by default</i> clearly is.<p>In general, for example, I might want a certain set of buttons to look different from another set of buttons because this provides useful information to the user of the system.<p>I haven't worked with bootstrap yet, however it looks very promising.  The key to a good framework is how much it makes what you want to do easy when the tasks align, and how it stays out of your way when the tasks do not.<p>I actually look forward to playing with Bootstrap to see what it's capable of doing.  It looks like the alignment handling might be worth it by itself.  However, the article here made me somewhat less enthusiastic.  One of our goals is to produce something easily themable.  If bootstrap helps, great.  If it gets in the way, that would be a bad thing.",1331168535.0

The fundamental question is: do you trust Pinterest to do right by you?<p>Flickr has a similar clause that every photographer who has uploaded their photos has agreed to, but they do right by their users and so nobody believes one day Flickr is going to undo all that work.  It would alienate their customers.<p>If you think Pinterest is untrustworthy, why do you think some text on a screen that <i>they wrote themselves</i> is going to impact their behavior one way or another?",1331168486.0

141,3678132,comment,3676847.0,3677644.0,4,0,barrkel,,,"You're assuming a correlation between price and quality. But price has at least two aspects: the base cost of that type of food; and the supply / demand for the quality of preparation.<p>You could have cheap sushi that's very good; similarly, you could have excellent sushi that's quite expensive compared to other types of food, but is still cheap <i>for that level of quality</i>. And a third place could have the same price as the second, but much lower quality. Which should get $ vs $$$?<p>Furthermore, not all cheap restaurants are cheap because they are competing on price. Sometimes they are even run at a loss to sell something else. For example, El Bulli, when it was still in operation, was an expensive restaurant on an absolute basis; but relative to the quality of the food, it was very cheap - because it was not even profitable, the restaurant was run at a loss. Instead, it built a brand around Ferran Adri that sold books and other things.<p>Similarly, a local restaurant to me is called Corner Room in Bethnal Green, London. It's cheap food selected from a set menu - and rather than controlling demand with prices, it does it with timing and willingness to wait, since bookings are not taken. The same chef runs a much more expensive restaurant, Viajante.<p>The value of ratings is only as good as the preference function of the raters. If the raters are drawn randomly, then sure, you can probably rely on the rough consensus. But raters are seldom drawn randomly; for one thing, people are much likely to rate bad experiences than good; people with iPhones and who are generally more plugged in are more likely to rate, and there are demographic and geographic patterns to the popularity of various different rating systems.<p>Using Yelp in an area where all the locals use a different system, you'll end up with ratings from tourists, who may be bowled over by the novelty of sub-par local food. If your own preference function has a primarily foodie basis, but the website you take reviews from has a more balanced function of location, service and price, then it stands to reason that many places will get much higher ratings than you would rate it yourself, because you assign lower weights to those other factors.<p>If, as you state, you find ratings are a good match to your own preferences, all that means is that you have a preference function somewhere in the middle of the rating sample. But not everyone is like that.",1331168410.0
