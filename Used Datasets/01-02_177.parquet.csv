It's rapidly shifting from physical retail to digital delivery, and it's very likely growing very rapidly. Most of that ""other delivery formats"" column is Steam, not mobile and browser games.<p>Of course, no-one outside Valve actually knows that, because they choose do not publish sales data, and they were estimated to have 70% of the digital delivery market in 2009, and probably much more of it now.",1338861583.0

If that does happen, that would further consolidate the domination of Ubuntu in the Linux World (at least in numbers) as an unintended consequence.<p>I do not see Valve releasing clients for every distro out there.<p>For Linux/Ubuntu to be really strong in gaming, Steam is a big plus, however we also need strong driver support from nVidia and ATI. As far as I know, the best drivers on Linux are still not on par with their equivalent on Windows in terms of performance. If playing the same game on Linux means losing 10 fps on your favorite game, this may not be a very enticing alternative if you have both systems installed.",1338861502.0

X11 might be complicated of course (because Steam would have to run in the same X11 session as other software), but perhaps Valve are planning this around Wayland?<p>What this would provide is a ""distro within a distro"" where only things like the kernel version would vary.

Please publish your ideas and let the world help you with your problem.<p>Actually, you already have. Why _isn't_ there a one-button (or script) way to get started with github? This is exactly the sort of thing github should be doing to extend their community. The instructions at <a href=""https://github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/</a> (GitHub Bootcamp) seemed pretty good to me, but that just means I didn't fail at some step for impenetrable reasons, and give up. It's not obvious to me that the entire business of starting up, including generating ssh keys and registering them with github, couldn't be done in a simple installer.<p>Next, of course, comes the difficulty in learning to use git. And no, it isn't obvious. I'm not entirely sure the problem can be solved with training, but I am sure it certainly would be better solved by training focused at a particular user community. For example (to pick one out of the air), where is the tutorial for people who collaborate to write a document written in LaTeX? Do they want a centralized, single-master repository with a small number of committers, a centralized repository wiki-style, where everyone on the list can push, or distributed repositories? How to manage these scenarios? What special problems will be encountered because of LaTeX markup? This is probably best addressed by the community of LaTeX users, if they could only get started, and if only they could figure out how to use the tool to best advantage.",1338859417.0

Do you think Swinger Dude would describe the story in the same way?  We really have no idea.<p>Even more importantly, conference organizers really have no way to know.  Let's say you are running a conference and you get this story about one of your speakers.  You talk to him and he says ""it wasn't like that"".  What do you do?  Cancel his talk?<p>Unless you're asking for HR-style processes, any policy you try to create will continue on exactly as it has in this case:  Information flows to the event organizer, and the organizer makes future decisions based on his/her judgement of the credibility of the actors involved.  Maybe the speaker won't be invited back next year.  Maybe Ms. Elman won't be invited back next year.  Maybe the organizer won't care.  Who knows.<p>As far as being uncharitable:  People lie.

I'm not even sure it clearly qualifies as Sexual Harassment, ie <i>intimidation, bullying or coercion of a sexual nature, or the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.</i>[1]  Even taking the story at face value, it's not clear there was actual <i>intimidation</i> involved - just awful behavior.  Take her summary paragraph:<p>""It was incredibly disappointing, humiliating and degrading on so many levels. I had been turned from a professional colleague into ""a hook-up"" at a bar. I was disgusted by his behavior, his comments about his family and the fact he is even associated with the Django community.""<p>There's no variation on ""it was scary, I was concerned for my safety, I felt intimidated"".  Taking the story at face value - yes, this was incredibly boorish behavior, but the right solution IMHO was to get him bounced from the bar.  This kind of behavior happens in all kinds of bars to all kinds of women - bouncers are well-equipped to deal with it.
