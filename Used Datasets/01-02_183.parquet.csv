It is a fairly recent invention. Early Christian philosophy (the ""church fathers"") and much of Orthodoxy espouses a constantly unfolding creation.<p>I really hope that this notion, that theists just use God to explain what they don't understand, can be dispelled in the next few years.

Same deal for grocery stores, too. Have you ever wondered why you couldn't just load your local grocery store's website up and see what their current price for bread is, or if they're almost out of eggs? All business reasons aside, it's largely because their databases are (probably) running some hinky form of Pervasive SQL or Btrieve, which stores their information in a hard-to-decipher, proprietary format, which among other wonders ""deletes"" records by replacing them with nulls in the monstrously large flat file that represents their product database.

The process of culling Vs packing and shifting tends to help you dispose of junk you've accumulated. The prospect of moving again in the near future also makes you view potential purchases much more critically.<p>People talk about being broke so they have to hold onto all this stuff.

I don't work for UA, but I do know one of the founders, in the spirit of full disclosure.<p>UA's API for push notifications is best described as the API Apple should have provided for APNS. At first blush, it doesn't seem to add a lot of functionality -- but once you spend some time with the API, you realize that the UA folks put a lot of engineering effort into making your life easy. Feedback service? Much easier. Push to a group of devices? Yes. Device tagging? Yes. Scalability? Not your problem. Easy-to-use control panel for debugging during development? Yes. Getting started with UA literally took me all of five minutes from installation of the python UA client library to first device registered & notification sent.<p>Given how little they cost (recently lowered prices, too) and how much potential headache they take off your plate, I would warmly recommend them. I briefly considered a ""build-it-myself"" approach, but scalability questions made it an easy decision. The first 250k messages are free (IIRC), and if you get to the point where you are actually sending a million messages a month -- you probably have enough revenue to cover the $1-2k in UA fees. There's no contract, so there's nothing preventing you from DIY when it makes financial sense to leave UA.<p>To top it all off, the UA team is friendly and responsive.<p>I haven't used their in-app purchase framework yet, so I can't speak to that.<p>Hope this helps!",1266371125.0

He can't remember the last thing he drank, either, or the last thing he said. Of course, those things existed; those lasts happened. They just didn't happen with enough warning for him to have bothered committing them to memory — it wasn't as though he sat down, knowingly, to his last supper or last cup of coffee or to whisper a last word into Chaz's ear. The doctors told him they were going to give him back his ability to eat, drink, and talk. But the doctors were wrong, weren't they? On some morning or afternoon or evening, sometime in 2006, Ebert took his last bite and sip, and he spoke his last word.<p>> Ebert's lasts almost certainly took place in a hospital. That much he can guess. His last food was probably nothing special, except that it was: hot soup in a brown plastic bowl; maybe some oatmeal; perhaps a saltine or some canned peaches. His last drink? Water, most likely, but maybe juice, again slurped out of plastic with the tinfoil lid peeled back. The last thing he said? Ebert thinks about it for a few moments, and then his eyes go wide behind his glasses, and he looks out into space in case the answer is floating in the air somewhere. It isn't. He looks surprised that he can't remember. He knows the last words Studs Terkel's wife, Ida, muttered when she was wheeled into the operating room (""Louis, what have you gotten me into now?""), but Ebert doesn't know what his own last words were. He thinks he probably said goodbye to Chaz before one of his own trips into the operating room, perhaps when he had parts of his salivary glands taken out — but that can't be right. He was back on TV after that operation. Whenever it was, the moment wasn't cinematic. His last words weren't recorded. There was just his voice, and then there wasn't.",1266370363.0
