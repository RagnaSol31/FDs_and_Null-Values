Virtually every business dealing in Bitcoin has been hacked, and this basically always results in the full balance of their bitcoins being stolen and the attacker getting away with it clean.<p>The credit card system has its issues, but even these massive thefts of numbers generally lead to no financial losses for customers and modest losses for banks and retailers, and the attackers often do get tracked and caught. The biggest complaint on here is that the losses are not high enough to convince these companies to pay serious attention to security.",1411264474.0

37,8346063,comment,8344345.0,8346003.0,1,0,roryokane,,,"That experiment would not accurately test the emotional inception theory. The theory states that given ads associating a product with a positive emotion, people will eventually feel that emotion when they <i>see</i> the product in the store, and be compelled to buy it. Your experiment tests whether people feel that emotion when they <i>use</i> the advertised product after having bought it. You might assume that these answers would match, but that is a dangerous and unnecessary assumption.<p>I have an idea for a more accurate experiment. Survey a number of people about what brands of some product they buy, if any. The product should be something that does not currently have many ads for it (like bedsheets), so that cultural imprinting is not a factor. Then send them a weekly email newsletter on some random topic. Each newsletter would also contains ads for a certain brand of that product.<p>The people would be split into two groups. For half of them, the ad for the product tries to associate the brand with a positive image. For the other half, the ad tries to associate the brand with a neutral image, while otherwise keeping the text the same. This splitting into groups ensures that “honest signaling” is not a confounding factor.<p>To ensure that the participant opens the newsletter and sees the ads, participants would be asked to search each newsletter for a piece of information and reply to the email with that information.<p>After three months of the newsletters, participants would be surveyed again about what brands of the product they buy, if any. If emotional imprinting theory is accurate, the participants who were shown the positive images should have increased their purchasing of that brand of product more than the neutral-image participants increased their purchasing.",1411262778.0
