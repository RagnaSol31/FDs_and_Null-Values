SciAm consistently impresses me - they'll break new and groundbreaking things, but what's more impressive to me is how they avoid not giving into fluff the way many other publications do. And they make science pretty accessible and interesting. I've never written as more than a semi-professional hobby, but I'd love to put some of my research together well enough to get into the magazine at some point.",1251338342

I am sad that the education system in America is ""Asianizing"" rapidly, in the spirit of ""We have to compete with the Chinese/Koreans/Indians ...""

It is amazing Japan is synonymous with quality today.<p>It is easy to explain: in a mature economy, any new company would have a mix of experience and new talent.  In an emerging economy, practically everyone is a rookie, regardless of age. There are entire million-plus population cities in India where no one, literally not one person, would have any experience in how to manage a 10 person technology project.<p>The only way to figure stuff out is to make mistakes. Quality is an emergent property coming out of experience. And that is the reason societies don't go from $300 GDP to $30K GDP in 1 year, though it would be possible to carefully mix an immigrant group coming out of a $300 GDP area into a $30K GDP area, and as long as the mixing is at a controlled rate, it is possible to boost the per-capita GDP of the immigrant group very high in a very short time (Indians in the US offer a good example). That is the extra value added by experience of having done stuff.",1251336692

As this is your first real programming gig you will probably be given a hopeless assignment with really bad or zero infrastructure to build upon. Lacking development infrastructure or even fellow developers to work with, you will become a pawn in company politics you are totally unaware of.<p>My advice is : bite that bullet. Work like a demon and spend your evenings building the infrastructure needed to produce a working piece of code. Spend your day time hours building code that is just good enough to demo. Talk to people and get feedback, but avoid giving your immediate superior the idea that you're going behind his/her back.<p>Working like this blows, but do it for half a year to a year and suddenly you're an experienced developer.<p>Now move to a different location.<p>(If you're lucky enough to land your first real-world assignment in an environment where there are experienced seniors to consult and you have an existing build and test procedure, I would give different advice.)",1251336309
