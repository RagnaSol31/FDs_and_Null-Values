This is especially galling in basic Algebra where it is so easy to take genuine and real world problems from things like managing money, basic Newtonian physics, etc that are real and that will see in other contexts, even if only other classes.<p>I really think you are right that most students would be better served with emphasis on problem solving that is at least more like real world problems and less obviously contrived.<p>I disagree with your renaming suggestion.  For one thing, you will need to split students by ability long before high school, so what would be ""Year 1 Math"" for one student might be more appropriate as ""Year 2 Math"" for another.  That makes a lot more sense if you have names like ""Pre-algebra"" and ""Algebra"".  Also having meaningful names will make it easier when they go to college (for those that go).",1264816481.0

Open or closed is a binary decision that Apple made that was entirely separate from their user interface decisions.<p>It just happens that most of the development money is behind closed products.<p><i></i>NOTE<i></i> Before anyone on here says anything more about how much better/worse open systems are vs closed systems when it comes to user interface and integration, think about these points:<p>* Do you feel that at any point during the development of the iPhone or iPad, Apple's designers would have been restricted had the platform been open? (By designers I mean user interface designers; please don't give me some smug, ""they couldn't have incorporated a close-source library,"" answer)<p>* Do you feel that if Apple were to release the source code to the iPhoneOS tomorrow that the usability of all iPhones would immediately suffer and there would be mass panic as people were not able to continue using their iPhones?<p>* Is there any <i>real</i> reason that Apple couldn't have a 'devmode' switch that voids your warranty, but allows you to run whatever you want on it? Note: I'm <i>not</i> talking about jailbreaking. I'm talking about an official switch that flips the only-run-signed-binaries bit off, but at the sacrifice of Apple supporting your further actions.<p>Apple is all about control. One example, is when they removed the built-in ability to theme the operating system (in OS9) when building OSX. I remember that the justification back then was the Steve Jobs wanted every Mac that was running OSX to have the same interface so that: (1) it would be highly recognizable and (2) people wouldn't have to worry about differences between different setups.<p>What gets my goat about this is that they were selling computers to the masses. They weren't setting up some sort of corporate infrastructure or university computer lab where all the computers must be the same. What if I want <i>my</i> computer to be different than someone else's? What if I don't care about whether or not someone else can sit down and use my computer? What if X modification makes me more productive? I feel like if I were an Apple employee and voiced such concerns at a planning meeting I would be looking at a pink slip, the way that Steve Jobs runs his boat.<p>I guess the point of all this is that I see a lot of the electronics industry going the way of 'dumbing down for the masses,' but not just specific products... EVERYTHING. Just look at what happened with TechTV/G4TV, now it's no longer about tech, or even gaming. It's just a SpikeTV, ""Let's watch some wrestling"" network. The same with SyFy. I feel like this is the start of a 'race to the bottom' in the industry.",1264814850.0
43,1088042,comment,1087835.0,1087835.0,0,0,lutorm,,,"Nice. I played with a similar thing years ago: rigid bodies connected with various constraints. The simple solving for the acceleration of the point masses under the forces from the connections that this computation seems to do works fine as long as the cloth is elastic. If you try to compute the dynamics of points connected by rigid rods, the large forces makes the system really stiff and your integration time step drops precipitously. In that case you have to generate a large linear system of equations and solve for the global motion of the system. It's quite a bit trickier. It's also interesting how situations that are familiar from real life, like a drawer getting stuck diagonally in the slot, really are singularities in the equations.<p>I realized this was actually an area of research, and found a bunch of papers by this guy: <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~baraff/pbm/pbm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~baraff/pbm/pbm.html</a>",1264814847.0

While most people are good and decent, a minority are not - they will cause trouble for the company, for co-workers, for customers, etc. They are just bad hires who must be let go and there will inevitably be some significant number of these involved in any range of hires.<p>In at-will employment situations, the remedy for an employer for a bad hire is simple. You let them go. No questions asked. No legal difficulties. Even if the employee falls within a ""protected category,"" it is still easy early on to make a judgment and act on it without adverse consequences.<p>If the law were to require, as a default (and as suggested in this piece), that an employer have ""cause"" to do such routine firings, then every employment decision of this type would be the potential subject of a lawsuit unless an employer is prepared to show ""cause"" through some documented evidence. Such an environment only empowers lawyers who will come in and second-guess the entrepreneurs to no end, all the while suing them for potentially significant damages for an almost infinite number of reasons (""he didn't like my bumper sticker,"" ""he didn't like my perfume,"" or ""my looks"" or who knows what). Yes, employers can still act to get rid of bad employees. But the cost of doing this would go up substantially.<p>What is in danger here is private associational rights. Today, of course, everyone agrees that such rights are not absolute. If an employer discriminates against employees based on some illegitimate criterion (race, color, creed, etc.), all would concur that this is not something that should be protected by an absolute concept of private associational rights.  Beyond the illegitimate bases, however, the right to associate with those you like, and not to associate with others you don't like, is such an integral part of small business life that we don't even think of it consciously in the workforce. If this rule is undercut, then all private workplace settings will become like union shops, or like government settings, where it becomes basically a terrifying event to plan for and implement the discharge of an employee.<p>Is it unfair for an employee to be fired for a bumper sticker? Yes. Do we want the law second-guessing and lawyers armed to sue over every such employer decision? Absolutely not. Why? Because any firing, for any reason, can potentially then be second-guessed and made the subject of a lawsuit and this would change the whole dynamic of the workplace, certainly for small businesses.<p>Small businesses start and fail all the time and people come and go from them even more so. Does anyone really want lawyers to become an integral part of the routine dynamics of hiring and firing? Or to have to keep elaborate paper trails on each employee because every person hired might be a future lawsuit in the making? I would hope that budding entrepreneurs, of all people, would see the significant shortcomings with such an approach.",1264813226.0
