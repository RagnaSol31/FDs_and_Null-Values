It just so happens Apple chose almost the exact opposite when compared to Android.<p><pre><code>     - portability between hardware architectures\n</code></pre>\nAndroid went with the VM solution.  Apple chose fat binaries when going from PPC to X86.  They also use fat binaries for ARMv6 and ARMv7.<p><pre><code>     - portability between operating systems (mostly)\n</code></pre>\nApple handles this at the OS, framework, C language, and compiler (LLVM) level.  The Unix bits of OS X and iOS are essentially the same.  CoreFoundation is essentially the same across iOS and OS X.  Cocoa and Cocoa Touch share the same design ethos as well as a number of classes.<p>If you assume Unix then a VM isn't that big of an OS portability win.<p>In general, Apple doesn't believe in cross-platform Apps.  They believe in trans-platform Apps.  Every single pixel in a Mac, iPhone, or iPad App should be pixel perfect.  Java and a VM doesn't really give you any benefits with respect to this.<p><pre><code>     - memory management that doesn't suck\n</code></pre>\nObjective-C 2.0 on Mac OS X has garbage collection.  I imagine garbage collection will come to the iOS world when Apple believes that the performance tradeoffs make sense.<p>In general, memory management is hard.  Memory leaks are trivial to find for an experienced programmer with Instruments.  Leaks are tough for a novice programmer.
