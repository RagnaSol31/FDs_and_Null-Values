It's easy to get why the Bay area is such a powerful draw for developers.  It's the one place in the continental U.S. where the climate is perpetually perfect, so it's only natural that people want to live there and it's inevitable that people with rare and valuable skills that can command high salaries will congregate there.  It's not as clear to me what the draw is for NYC since the weather there is as bad or worse than Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, or Milwaukee and the cost of living is higher than those Midwestern cities.  It seems like Boston should be a bigger software hub than NYC just on the basis of the proximity of MIT and Harvard and the intellectual community that fosters.  On the basis of desirable climate (and astonishing natural beauty), it seems like Honolulu ought to be a major software hub, but it isn't.  What's NYC's secret of success as a software hub?",1302139119.0

More significant is the noise generated the formation and popping of bubbles on the surface of the propeller (cavitation) as it moves through the water.
