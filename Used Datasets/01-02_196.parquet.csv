I've enjoyed trying my hand at some offline gaming.\nFeeling like anything fantasy/sci-fi can be a waste of time, I turned to a WWII tabletop miniatures war game called Flames of War.  It's a three in one: social interaction with some older guys that I can shoot the bull with whose social circles I wouldn't usually fall into, diorama construction and historically accurate miniatures painting (hone those artistic mind-muscles), World War Two history.  I'm not trying to go for a shameless plug but I've found in it more than a game, not imagining I would have learned so and become THIS much more interested in history.\n..and as some of the other comments have pointed to, exercise is ++.  Hiking, biking and exploring the OFFLINE world around you can be key to returning fresh (and inspired!) on Monday.",1310867836

The problem is for the one success story that pulls through at the 11th hour there are thousands where the employees come to work one day and the doors are locked. I always started looking the first check that was not paid and left as soon as I had another offer. The odds are that the company will not survive very long.,1310867835

I don't remember the exact text, so I might as well spoil my prediction now since it can't be confirmed.<p>I predicted that some nitpicker would reply to my comment and name a few important works that are in the public domain or CC-licensed. Like I said, not a very interesting prediction.<p>This hasn't happened yet, so my prediction was wrong. In this case, making the prediction public changes how people act, so I didn't want to say it outright. On the other hand, saying ""I knew you were gonna do that"" isn't very believable.

Anyone less fortunate in those terms in that point in life probably couldn't get away with it, even if it were still a great school (top-50).

Lately I've just been going out with a few close friends, usually to a bar or two or three, to drink and laugh and talk and have a good time. It never gets old if you're with the right people. Yeah, it's not hiking or biking or walking, unless you count walking to the next bar, but it's always great being able to unwind. Definitely not the healthiest weekend activity, though. If you can handle being alone and have some money to burn you should travel. I'm going to Europe for a couple of weeks just for fun. Being single has its perks.<p>There's nothing wrong with reading a book on compilers or thinking about your startup's marketing campaign, but I think it starts to become wrong when that's all you do. Being single isn't necessarily a bad thing either. I mean, it isn't the greatest thing all the time, but that all depends on how you're looking at it.<p>Anyway, if you think it's fun to just sit around and read then by all means do that. Don't think you have to do something else. By the looks of it though, you don't think it's fun. It seems like you're forcing yourself to think it's fun because everything else seems scary or too difficult to do. Don't just work all day everyday. You'll just burnout and be worse off then you are now.",1310867616

And nothing in the logs rules out that Assange ""ran"" Manning nor do they prove it. All they have is Manning saying Assange is good at OPSEC. So Assange may not know WHO Manning is, but still may have directed Manning to get more info or look for this or that. That's the presumed essence of the grand jury proceedings.<p>Nothing in the logs changes any of that, nor would the publication require the gov attorneys to show exculpatory evidence to a grand jury. A grand jury is a one-sided proceeding intended to convince a group of people that someone likely committed a crime.<p>Lamo promising ""immunity"" to Manning on journalistic or religious grounds?

66,2772239,comment,2767867.0,2770812.0,1,0,EGreg,,,"1) re evolution: when I say it's a ""loaded"" term, it's because it is sometimes by people who seem to make the additional assumption that mutation and natural selection are sufficient to produce the results we see today. I think that assumption is unfounded and seems to be more like a wish to keep things simple. I don't for example see how gay people could be genetically predisposed to be gay, since they would have a reproductive fitness level far lower than others. But that's not even the biggest thing. Little mechanisms which could hardly make a difference in survival one way or the other are doing an amazing job. Maybe it's sexual selection. But where is the evidence that all that we see around us was produced with simple mutation and natural selection?<p>Regarding bacteria and viruses: that's micro-evolution, isn't it? Why is it macroevolution?<p>2) Regarding the BBT: so why do people think there was a ""big bang"" and talk about the ""first few seconds of the universe"" if the universe is probably infinite, and it is only the visible universe that we see expanding?<p>3) I don't know, I'm not a physicist... seemed like an intriguing way to think about the expansion though",1310865626

Social marketing works and it is measurable.<p>In my experience, the first step is to gain followers or fans.  The best way to do this is through targeted advertising.  While it is possible to build a follower base without advertising, it is harder.  Advertising gives the advantage of speed and targeting.<p>The second step is to keep providing people with good content, while at the same time, promoting your product.  As you provide content, you can measure the number of comments and get a feel for peoples' thoughts.  This becomes easy after a while because you become accustomed to your audience and know what they like.<p>Does this mean that you are going to be able to sell your product?  It really depends on your product and the market, just like with anything else.<p>I would question the product-market fit before I questioned the value in social marketing.",1310865244
