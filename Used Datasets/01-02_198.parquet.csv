Suddenly every move by Google can only be seen with incredible suspicion and assumptions of worst intentions.

My oldest son has the same medical condition I have.  We have gotten off all the drugs and stuff and gotten well by eating better, keeping the house stringently clean, etc.  He literally could die if he moved out (or I died) and he didn't know how to care for himself.<p>Re: ""domestic slave"" -- seems to me like good shorthand.  You knew pretty clearly what I meant -- someone really unfairly bogged down with uncompensated labor -- without a lot of elaborating, offended or not.<p>Re: Female audience.  That's a laugh.  Women seem to find me far more intimidating and offensive than men do.<p>Re: Arguing:  That has two meanings, one of which is to debate it and the other is to fight about it.  I don't mind a debate though my experience is that most folks on the internet don't really do that.  They pretty quickly deteriorate into fighting.<p>Nor am I making excuses.  I have pushed the envelope on topics like this many, many times in male dominated forums.  I have a fairly good idea of how hard it is do this kind of thing and that one of the big issues is the framing and underlying assumptions of what other people say.  It very, very frequently becomes ""If you don't agree it's black, then you must be one of those psychos that think it's white.  And that is so amazingly obviously wrong that you must be a retard.""  There is no room for discussing shades of grey, much less a more technicolor version of reality.  If I don't agree 100% with their assertion it's black, they peg me as one of those ""100% white"" folks.  I get routinely slammed as being someone who strongly holds the ""opposite"" view for attempting to say ""I don't see it that way"".  It really matters very little what the topic is -- politics, gender issues, homeschooling, you name it.  If I say I homeschooled my kids, I must be one of those folks who wants to dismantle public school.  If I say I don't think the anti-vax crowd is completely crazy, someone inevitably asks me what made me choose to not vaccinate my kids at all (which is a fallacious assumption and real example from this very forum).  And on and on.  So a public forum is a quite difficult place to try to articulate a view that is substantially different from the ""standard positions"" everyone is familiar with.  All attempts to side step the repeated efforts of other people to peg me as this, that, or the other makes it incredibly difficult or downright impossible to convey how I really see it.  Thus a blog would be a better option, and not out of cowardice.",1295573763.0

101,2126016,comment,2125115.0,2125115.0,0,0,sudoman,,,"The way I understand meditation is that it is a way of stepping out of ""worlds of becoming"" that the mind is constantly entering and wandering around in. (Until things go bad, and then it jumps to another world.) The way I try to deal with this is through the ongoing practice of calming the mind and giving it good mental food. A good source of this food is the blameless pleasure that comes from the ability to settle on a single range of awareness such as the body or the breath, and then to stay there for long periods of time, which is actually more satisfying than it sounds at first. It's inevitable that the mind will keep pulling itself away to harmful yet tempting subjects, so learning how to return peacefully, yet firmly and repeatedly is a skill that I've been trying to develop.<p>It becomes somewhat obvious as one begins to meditate that this wandering, and the repetition of unskillful mental qualities, is connected with what stress and suffering there is in life. The accompanying insight into these thought worlds and how they keep originating and pulling stress and suffering with them can supposedly allow one to grow dispassionate for those addictions and give them up to at least a greater or lesser extent. It's interesting to see what repeated mental habits the mind thinks are good ideas, simply because it hasn't taken a good look at them since before the age of two. Giving those habits up, even if only temporarily, can be a great relief for the mind.<p>The tough part about all this is putting in the effort on a regular/continual basis when the initial results can come and go without your really seeing why. Looking at my own practice, I can say it's worth the effort so far, despite the difficulties. When I'm in a tough spot, remembering the moments that I have been at greater ease in the meditation give me reason to keep working in that direction.<p>If you're interested, here are some talks by my favorite meditation teacher:\n<a href=""http://dhammatalks.org/Archive/BasicsCollection/BasicsCollection.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dhammatalks.org/Archive/BasicsCollection/BasicsCollec...</a><p>I hope this helps your practice. ;-)",1295571877.0

Apple using these screws is a fact, ""Apple chose this fastener specifically because it was new, guaranteeing repair tools would be both rare and expensive"", from what I can tell, is an opinion.<p>I could find two arguments for that being a fact in the article. The first one is that these screws are only used on the outside of the devices.<p>However, the screws on the outside likely also are the ones that are fastened with the most torque, and they also can the only ones connecting two particular materials.<p>So, it could also be that these are just the technically best choice for the application.<p>The second argument I could find is the claim <i>""Apple occasionally refers to these as “Pentalobe security screws.”""</i> however, Google didn't turn up anything for a search for 'pentalobe' on Apple.com.<p>Finally, Apple being Apple, these screws might even have been chosen because their color best matches the case, are the ones that could be painted white best, or to prevent cases where the alignment of visible lines with the edges of the display of a square or rectangular screw would occasionally be 'just not right'.<p>My opinion?
