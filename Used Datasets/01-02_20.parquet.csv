What's ""healthy"" depends how far you want to go down.<p>2. We don't know know how to eat healthy, just healthier. And what's healthier depends on the resolution you're looking at the body. Also you're particular goals and biology.<p>3. There's still a lot of conflict about basic things.<p>4. My old sense of black and white, bad foods and good foods, got destroyed; it wasn't nuanced.<p>For instance, even spinach and flaxseed contain cyanide [1]. Though not enough to kill you, in extremes they could. That was shocking, and just one example.<p>With eating and sleeping consider leptin levels. [2][3][4] Some people, because of obesity and overweightedness, in the long-term especially, have awkward leptin sensitivity. Also there are individual differences in genes and gene expression, or overall biology. And exercise factors too.<p>And that's just one hormone. You add insulin and how that reacts with leptin, and how that's effected by macro-nutrient balance, et cetera. At best I consider myself an intermediate in nutritional knowledge, considering what we now know. The next step up from interpreting papers on PubMed is producing them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts8.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts8.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/89/11/5762"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/89/11/5762</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0010062&ct=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-docum...</a>",1236217506

Yes, Pixar films are expensive because they are swinging for the fences.<p>That means they have many, many models, sets, textures etc that go into the production of any film, which of course increase your cost of production considerably. That's just a matter of fact.<p>What I have been saying is that if you take a different view, don't start out by trying to swing for the fences (you can always scale up later), essentially limit some of these choices you could probably get away with a smaller team in the beginning.<p>For example, lets move away from films for a second and talk about sitcoms. One of my favourite is Frasier.<p>Frasier has (for the most part) a very limited series of sets and characters. You have your 5 main characters, your 6 occasional supporting characters and for the most part these back and forths take place in 4 locations...<p>That's about 6 seasons of entertainment there for a sitcom, or about < 1 minute of Pixar animation.<p>That's really the kind of difference we're talking about in terms of cost of production.",1236217445
