Used book shops generally are quite savvy to the real value of a book in the same way this guy is.  They are profiting from the same arbitrage he is.  Used book shops have the added advantage that the original sellers often come straight to the book shop, having never offered their books to any other market, so they can buy without competition.",1286416705.0

Clearly there are plenty of independent artists - punk rock has a long tradition of independent label publishing going back decades for example. Anyone who just wants to put their music out there now is well served by distribution providers like CDBaby.<p>I'm talking about successful disruption of the established music industry and the oft mentioned suggestion that simply offering artists a distribution alternative will do it. It won't. We've had a decade for grassroots indy web publishing to take over and it hasn't.<p>My point about the long tail isn't that it doesn't exist, but that it's largely irrelevant. Just as Youtube has barely scratched Hollywood, indy music publishing isn't moving the profitability needle of big music enough for them to care. They still have the back catalog, they continue to acquire the vast majority of popular artists and they're still driving the creation of the most popular music which is where the money is.",1286416689.0

It was started by some MIT kids (afaik) with some basic algorithms set up to judge the ""goodness"" of a book when they go to sales or get turn-ins from customers for store credit. They don't solely include the Amazon sale price of a book though, somehow they definitely include unique-ness or coolness: their store is stuffed to the gills with amazingly interesting books on all topics (all of which are cross listed on Amazon also).<p>Seems to work for them. How many other independent bookstores have gone under lately?

If you're producing and serving one ready-made video at a time, say for a video tutorial, maybe converting to multiple formats isn't much of a burden. If you're <i>rendering</i> videos, say for raytracing demos, and they take a lot of processing power to render and you have many of them, it's a significant burden to recode all of them multiple ways. Given that there is one way that is already well established and works reliably almost everywhere -- Flash -- I don't have much sympathy for HTML5 advocates who can't offer a solution that isn't at least as easy and customisable as what we've had for years already, nor for a certain brand of hardware that makes a point of not playing by the same rules as everyone else in the game.",1286416557.0

That's not the impression I get either from the article or from comments here. Some people are upset that he, and others like him, are making it harder or less pleasant for <i>them</i> to buy used books. Some people are (something rather less than) upset because what he's doing displeases them aesthetically -- books are meant to be treated with reverence, bought and sold by people who love them, etc. But I don't see anyone saying ""He's making a profit, and that's bad"".<p>As to whether what he's doing is, on balance, beneficial or harmful, I don't think we have enough information to know for sure.<p>Scenario 1. A small minority of particularly good used-book shops, which would otherwise have had real trouble selling their merchandise, are visited by people like this; the result is that lots of books from their shelves are made available to people who want them, and that the booksellers stay in business. Everyone wins.<p>Scenario 2. All the world's used-book shops are deluged with people like this. As soon as any new books arrive they pounce on them. The result is that all the books anyone wants are sold at higher prices, reducing their availability to people with less money; and that the used-book shops no longer get any ""normal"" customers because most of the interesting books disappear as soon as they hit the shelves, and that after a while the booksellers give up in disgust. Everyone loses.<p>Presumably the truth is somewhere in between. I'd guess it's much closer to Scenario 1. But fearing Scenario 2 isn't really all that crazy.",1286414090.0

You don't breath through your nose. As I said before, place your nose above the glass and then gently breath in with your mouth. Your mouth will just breath in normal air, but it will create a draft through your nose that pulls in the vapours that are evaporating into your nose without creating eddies in the glass, and without quickly sucking the most delicate and lightest of the vapours past your nose's sensing cells and into your lungs, which misses the most interesting parts.<p>Don't take my word for it, try it instead. Seriously, try the expert's ""sniff with nose"" method and compare to the two-orifice with nose close to the glass edge method I have described. You will detect much more of the bouquet with the two-orifice method. Perhaps I have invented it, I don't know, that seems unlikely, but for some reason the so-called experts don't know about this and aren't doing it right. Just try. You'll see, it will be really clear. You can use the direct sniff too if you like to get the heavier vapours.",1286413570.0
