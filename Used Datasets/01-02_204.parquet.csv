The latter requires the consciousness to know what the future has in store for the organism.""<p>Your redefinition of what it means to suffer is entirely ad hoc (and just plain weird). The word ""suffering"" describes a pained state of being. One who is suffering need not have any beliefs whatsoever about whether or not that suffering will continue. They need not even have a word for it. If you contest this, I suggest you look in a dictionary. And by the way, no creature ""knows"" what the future has in store, not even members of your delusional humanity. By your sloppy ad hoc definition, then, <i>nobody</i> can suffer. What a meaningless little semantic game you play with yourself.<p>You said: ""Animals can be abused, but very few of them have the level of consciousness required for the abuse to be 'torture.'""<p>And the trivial game continues. Once again you redefine common words for your own ad hoc convenience. All of a sudden, in your view, one must have some vague level of consciousness that goes beyond the feeling of intense pain in order for the abuse one undergoes to be called ""torture."" Of course, this is not a part of the definition of ""torture."" Moreover, you say non-human creatures can be ""abused"" but not ""tortured."" That is some pretty... <i>tortured</i>... logic.<p>You said: ""You can pretend that animals are people too all you want, but wishing it to be true does not make it so.""<p>If by ""people,"" you mean ""humans,"" obviously nobody has made the claim that a cow is a human. Straw man fallacy. Also, you are conveniently defining ""people"" as the only beings who are worthy of deep moral concern to argue that humans are the only beings worthy of deep moral concern. That is, you've assumed a premise that is identical to your conclusion, committing a blatant, egregious fallacy of circularity. Forget about proving your point; you haven't even <i>made</i> one.<p>With that, I'll throw your own words right back at ya: ""Wishing it to be true does not make it so."" Quite.",1254880359.0

19,865855,comment,865306.0,865784.0,0,0,sovande,,,"The '!?' was aimed at Mr. defunkt who said that<p><pre><code>   nginx relies heavily on system calls at the expense of portability\n</code></pre>\nIts a oxymoron as you cannot expect a C application that mostly do network and disk i/o not to use syscalls. That said, the author of nginx does an admirable job of reducing the numbers of syscalls and make the application as efficient as possible. In this context a syscall i.e. a kernel call is heavy and something one want to minimize.<p>The blog post on the other hand was talking about using syscalls from <i>Ruby</i>. I can understand Ruby programmers who wrinkle their nose at this. If you want your Ruby application to be portable then using, for instance, fork is not the best idea. In fact, programing anything long lived such as a server in Ruby is not the best idea. The GC in 1.8.x leaks memory over time and it is a common case that Ruby servers has to be restarted often as they consume all memory on the machine they run on. Adding fork on top of this is bad. A fork will copy the whole Ruby interpreter into the new process and you will end up with a lot of top-heavy processes - not a good idea unless you sell RAM. Basically, using Ruby as a systems programming language and for applications that are long lived is a bad idea.",1254879791.0

I also think that a lot of people underestimate the role that a big company can have in helping you fine tune your skills with a safety net of sorts.

This is a repository of apps that are easy to find and install from the device itself, and it carries a certain seal of approval from Palm/Apple. There should be quality requirements for this distribution channel.<p>However, there is no ""2nd citizen"" app store. What Palm is doing is providing a link to your app that can be posted anywhere that will do exactly what JWZ wants: install the app on your phone when clicked. There is no charge for this link, and the app is not reviewed. Palm is simply hosting the app for you AND providing over-the-air updates for your app. What you don't get is the on-device distribution channel.<p>(Disclaimer: I work at Palm, but am not in developer relations. These are my opinions; I'm not privy to information on this topic outside of what you fine folks have.)",1254878085.0

China issues patents for China, Japan for Japan, etc. Thus, the Chinese are not really beholden to American IP owners in their own country unless they give those American IP owners Chinese patents.</i><p>...but then you say this:<p><i>I think the US is generally pro-patent and pro-IP because we know that one of the few areas we hold some kind of competitive advantage is in RD, design, arts, etc. We have to keep our hands on these intangible goods because if it comes down to making things we are really, really behind.</i><p>...which is cute in that the more you espouse to the outlook implied in the first quote the less the opinion in the second quote makes sense: how would being pro-patent and pro-IP help our competitive advantage with other countries unless there were were some mechanisms by which domestic IP influenced foreign operations?<p>You've also basically backed your way into the smart version of the theory in question:<p>- the USA currently has few strong competitive advantages short of producing IP<p>- the USA is thus pro-IP (domestically + in its international negotiations) as a way of preserving or strengthening its global position vis-a-vis its trading partners<p>...which makes it unclear what we're arguing about.<p>As I've heard the argument (and it's been around since the 90s) the argument comes in two versions (the 'lite' and the 'sinister' versions).<p>The 'lite' version is a balance-of-payments issue: <i>since</i> we're offshoring actually making stuff we will have a substantial trade deficit; having a lot of obligatory patent licenses can mitigate the imbalance. EG:<p>- (low-patents): original manufacturer builds dvd player with about $20 in parts and labor and sells it to an import/export type for $25 and then best buy gets it @ $45/unit in bulk and it sells for $70 or so; so ~$45/unit is flowing out of the country<p>- (high-patents): same as before, but now obligatory patent licenses tack on another $5-10 or so per unit; as the people espousing the theory would have it the effect is <i>less</i> net money  runs it (they don't get into trying to calculate which parts of the chain have more negotiating ability, and stick with 'less' rather than make more precise estimates)<p>It's not enough to neutralize a trade deficit but it can knock it down substantially; key to the strategy succeeding is legislative support that helps promote sufficient patent coverage in as many product categories as possible, then letting the market sort out which actually get licensed and for how much.<p>The issue of patents to foreign holders -- whether USA patents or overseas -- is essentially moot from the balance-of-payments outlook: they mainly impact the internal distribution of money sent to the trading partner but don't have a substantial effect on the total amount sent over.<p>The 'sinister' version takes the above and throws in some assumption as to how you produce patent-worthy R+D and so forth.<p>Basically it assumes you can't jump to the forefront of technology immediately (reasonable) and thus even though the USA patent system is equal opportunity in some sense as a practical matter there aren't going to be Chinese-originated patents worth licensing anytime soon; as a large chunk of industrial r+d is funded out of retained earnings the reduced earnings under the high-patent regime (reduced b/c they've been ""taxed away"" via licensing fees) will retard the technological progress of your trading partners; this lets you keep the upper hand for longer, even if they will close the gap eventually.",1254877980.0
