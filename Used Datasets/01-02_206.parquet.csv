I always have to remind myself that the planets are ultimately doomed anyway, and that there's a ton more gas than I can imagine, so supply is not yet in danger of exhaustion. (that I apply these concerns to another planet I'll probably never even get near, I have decided to simply take in stride)<p>Nonetheless, cool article. It's interesting how many theories are coming about anymore involving life on satellites rather than planets. I understand they are probably more common than small rocky planets what with the abundance of gas giants, but are they more or less suited to life? It seems like the presence of  a massive body nearby (the planet it's orbiting) would have a big impact. Plus, the distance from the sun would increase and decrease (meaning light and temperature variations), and overall incumbent light would be minimal.",1275702912.0

I could understand these arguments when Apple wasn't doing so well, but now it's just silly; Apple has, for ages, been extremely consistent in prioritizing margins over market share.  By all measures, it's working brilliantly for them.<p>Success through high margins is less visible and less obvious than success through high market share, and I'm guessing that contributes to the strange idea that Apple is somehow making a mistake with a high-margin lower volume strategy, but come on, they make more money selling cell phones than almost any other company in the world.<p>Apple could certainly license their OS to other vendors.

In common parlance, that's enough like a 'tax' to make the description accurate in a popular account.<p>(The Washington Times didn't even highlight one of the most egregious ideas listed -- a $5-$7 fee per subscriber on all ISPs, collected and distributed by the federal Copyright Office.)<p>The least honest part of the WT coverage is calling the document a ""draft proposal"".

Developers will continue to target the platform where they make the most money.<p>Apple treats Apps as a switching cost.  The more Apps and content that a user purchases, the less likely there are to move to a competing platform.<p>Microsoft won because Office, Outlook, games, etc increased the switching cost.  Once you were over in the Microsoft camp, you were there forever.  There was zero user churn.<p>The whole point of the Get A Mac campaign was about how the switching cost was now low.<p>Google treats Apps and content as a commodity.

In other words, it feels like a big deal to you but it wont feel that way to them.<p>Stop worrying about whether you deserve it or if it's fair on him, or if he's had a bad month ( and stop making it your friend's problem). I've found it pretty disgusting overhearing my boss chasing money from customers to see how many habitually don't pay and then shamelessly try anything they can to fob him off - oh no it's past our finance day it will have to be next month, no the only person who can sign cheques isn't here, no we don't have your invoice, actually it wasn't completed properly so we're not paying it, the cheque wasn't signed? You'll have to send it back and we'll redo it next month, and on and on.<p>Writing to them feels a bit of a cop out as well, frankly, like you want to hide behind it; I wouldn't want to do it myself either, but I think you should call them and ask to speak to him/someone who can help you with an unpaid invoice and say Hi, I sent you an invoice a few weeks ago and haven't received payment for it yet, but the work has been accepted  with no complaints or disputes, can you tell me what the status is, please? And go from there.<p>Don't be surprised if they tell you nobody is available who can help, or that they have reservations or that some part wasn't as agreed, and be prepared to take polite but pushy action - i can resend the invoice, i can come and collect payment, i can hold on the phone, come and see you to talk about it, etc.<p>You want to end the phone call with a commitment from them to pay, or with a concrete problem to solve and a commitment to pay after that, or some concrete time you can speak to someone when they will be there.<p>Log when you called, who you spoke to, what they said.<p>Because you can phone several times and go over several back and forth points in a few minutes it means you aren't waiting a week for a letter reply. If it's still going nowhere in several phonecalls or a week or so then write a stern letter with invoice and reference your phone call logs; you haven't delayed by much but you are in a better position to justify elevating it further.<p>All IMHO, as always.",1275699711.0
