To begin with, the floor of the ocean isn't a solid surface, there's a lot of mud which means the opening to the hole isn't ""clean cut"" - any kind of ""well"" uses an inner sleeve so that you can connect a pipe to the ""hole"". That's usually where the blowout preventers would go, I imagine, would be in the sleeve inside the hole. So, the opening to the well is probably pretty muddy and unstable.<p>When that well blew out it popped off the connecting pipe and began releasing thousands of barrels of oil at very high pressures. Even if the ""hole"" were clean cut and they could easily mount a fitting to it, the pressure alone would make it extremely difficult (try turning the garden faucet on high and then connecting a hose to it, possible, but rather difficult).<p>This is why blowout preventers exist, if a blowout happens the well is sealed from inside itself (as I understand it). I think it is ridiculous that mandatory blowout preventers never made it into law. Bright side of it is this incident will (or should) inspire reform.<p>I think everything they are doing is about as much as you can do at that depth with such high pressure.",1275184727.0

When an spill like this happens, BP can then be sued for violating the rights of the owners of the clean ocean surrounding the rig, and the damage they've done to the shoreline. As long as the shoreline is public property, they can get away with convincing senators and bureaucrats that they'll spend $x on cleanup, donate $y to their campaigns, and that's that.

20,1389679,comment,1389230.0,1389650.0,0,0,celoyd,,,"Sure, but even internally. Like a lot of long oral literature in verse, it has a smallish set of colorful epithets for often-mentioned things. For example, where the rhythm requires it, Ulysses might be called πολύτροπος, resourceful; where there’s less room in the hexameter, he might be δῖος, glorious – over and over and over again.<p>It’s not just that we don’t think of “rosy-fingered dawn” as being fresh because we know Homer used it: it’s that even if you’ve never heard it before, it will have lost its freshness halfway through the Odyssey.<p>So word-by-word freshness is usually not a useful or fun thing to look for in epic literature. While people can criticize Tolkien for a lack of eye-kicks (as I think I remember William Gibson calling phrase-scale fireworks in cyberpunk), a tree can be green-fingered twenty times without it being a violation of the rules of the game he’s trying to play.<p>(Also, for all we know, Homer might have stolen all his clichés.)",1275184131.0

31,1389667,comment,1389583.0,1389622.0,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Getting a cylinder <i>into</i> the hole seems difficult. An earlier attempt called the 'top hat' involved putting a capped cylinder on top of the hole but apparently methane hydrates, which are lighter than water, started accumulating inside it and it kept lifting off the seabed.<p>So my idea is halfway between the two: place a large, weighted concrete cylinder with no end caps above the hole - a hollow top hat, if you like. It needs to be big, like 25' x 25' or larger; height is more important than diameter. This in itself does nothing to stem the flow - but nor does it obstruct it. So the cylinder can then be sealed around the bottom and fixed to the seabed without interference from the pressure of the outrushing oil.<p>Then one can begin filling the cylinder with gravel or whatever is suitable - smallest material first, working up to rocks. As we begin covering the gusher, the pressure will obviously push some of the filler material out of the way...but as it's inside a cylinder, the filler is just going to get pushed against the side of the cylinder, where its weight is going to increase the downward pressure on the material at the bottom, which has nowhere to go except in towards the center. When the aggregate pressure at the bottom of the cylinder from the sides into the center exceeds the pressure of the oil, it will pinch off the flow, like a valve. This of course assumes perfect packing of the filler material; in reality the oil will diffuse through it, but in doing so the pressure will be distributed across the diameter of the cylinder, which will make it much easier to cap.<p>Or we could just go with Andy Borowitz's suggestion to plug the whole with BP executives....",1275183651.0

I dislike immensely that feeling that authors are just throwing in fantasy-ish sounding names and toss-away references to ""deepen"" the story.

41,1389656,comment,1389540.0,1389540.0,0,0,enjo,,,"Again, what is the iPhone app store doing that Palm didn't do before? There was a thriving app market. While it was web based (as opposed to device based), normal every day people bought millions of dollars in apps every year. I cut my teeth in that market at Quickoffice (who has translated that experience onto the iPhone today). While Palm was at its peak we would do 7 figures in sales.<p>What Apple did that other cell phone competitors (particularly Symbian) absolutely failed to do was make the app buying process seamless. For Palm users it was drop dead simple. Download the file, double click, and sync the device. On Symbian devices it was a mess of menus, disclaimers, and other crap that made installing stuff generally suck. It looked and felt like installing a big software package on Windows. The iPhone certainly deserves credit for fixing that.<p>Still, so much of what the iPhone has done was improve on what the folks at Palm did years ago. You can find examples of touch based interfaces (snappermail springs to mind) on the old Palm devices. Palm sported app-centric data with no exposed file system. Many of the design conceits of the iPhone first resided on Palm devices. It's part of the reason that I chuckle every time Jobs rants about how everyone is trying to steal from 'him'.<p>That said, there is one thing that I think is truly revolutionary about the iPhone app market. The advent of truly useful (and effective) mobile ad networks changes the game quite a bit. Being able to monetize free apps is huge. One of our app developers here in Colorado has actually seen their ad-supported titles surpass their app-store purchases which is interesting (and they sell a LOT of product). We didn't have that in the old days... it would have been really nice:) Both Google and Apple are bringing interactive ads to their respective platforms, so they clearly 'get it'.<p>In todays marketplace Apple clearly doesn't have a monopoly on the app market. The Android app store is a worthy competitor. It's easy to find apps (although I wish the 'top *' categories would rotate MUCH faster). They install seamlessly. You can find all the information you need in store. I really am not sure how it's really any different than the iPhone experience...",1275183115.0

While I don't know a lot about drilling oil wells specifically, my first degree is in mechanical engineering and although I've never worked as one I know that engineers prefer to oversecure everything where a failure would cause injuries, not to mention disasters on this scale. Simply put, safety always comes first on the drawing boards of engineers.<p>For example, simple elevators are typically designed to be able to safely carry 7-10 times their normal operating weight, including the cabin. I find it hard to believe that ""many of their safety systems"" just failed - I think it's a lot more likely that a series of really stupid human mistakes are behind this as well as management that is unable or unwilling to enforce (sometimes costly) safety procedures and practices.",1275182088.0

Funds of their own which were actually invested are still taxed at the capital gains rate. But the managers' bonus can not seriously be called capital gains, because it gets paid when they make a profit but they have no corresponding liability to their investors if the fund should lose money. It's not as if the investors were somehow lending a portion of their investment to the manager, or s/he would owe repayment regardless of performance. Any portion of the investors' gain paid as a bonus is income and deserves to be taxed as such.<p>The lower tax rate on capital gains is meant as an incentive for people to invest their assets instead of just hoarding them; investment implies an element of risk.",1275182074.0

Common sense would suggest that you'd have to start by anchoring something inside the hole which you could use to build a progressively denser matrix.  How the hell you do that at 30,000 feet underwater I don't know. Depending on the state of the hole perhaps you could put a hollow, expandable cylinder into the hole. The cylinder also would have a series of hinged blades that could be released and the pressure of the oil would force the blades together and close the leak. Hard to explain without drawing a diagram. Since it's an obvious solution I would guess that there's a good technical reason why it can't be done.",1275181759.0

Nor am I arguing that vintage cars might be popular - you're going into too much detail (the point was that in our modern world, in regard of products produced, ""newer"" usually translates to ""better"").<p>But what I do believe, is that they're asking the customer to think the analogy behind the idea of not drinking 9 year old milk and connecting that to the idea of not using a 9 yo browser (old = bad, new = good as you said). Wouldn't you agree that for that analogy to work with the message they're trying to convey, you need to make a connection of putting the IE Browser into the milk's place in that analogy?<p>I mean look at that page: half of your screen is filled with a carton of milk - the other half tells about why you wouldn't use a browser (IE 6) which also is 9 yo.\nSo wouldn't you agree that somewhere in there lies the notion of IE 6 being as good as 9 yo milk?<p>Probably?<p>And remember that most people are bad at remembering numbers. Names, on the other hand, are something that most people do remember better.<p>Therefore, imho, I don't understand what the marketing department was thinking, as in my opinion, the advert connects your thoughts about 9yo milk to an internet browser (of which we already have created our own views) - and in the long run people will most probably only remember 9 yo milk & Internet Explorer (and bear in mind that this advert comes from microsoft).<p>Therefore, the question of what was the marketing department thinking rose into my mind. I believe that the point of viewing and ""comparing"" IE & a carton of milk screams for some serious rebranding for the product called ""internet explorer"" - because nerds can really relate to that message or what?<p>And in the end of the day, they are the people who power the revolutions of switching browsers.<p>tl;dr I don't believe that the advert works in advantage for Microsoft & IE",1275181519.0
