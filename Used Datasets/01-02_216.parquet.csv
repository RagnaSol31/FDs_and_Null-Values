That's perfectly well thought out.<p>The cabbies or cab companies are allowed by the city to operate, and that's a nearly steady stream of money, based on a limited number of medallions.  The least the public can expect, is that any authorized cab will take them to where they want to go.<p>And yeah, I avoid the black car ""limos"" whenever possible.  They're like vermin way-uptown (way, way too many of 'em), and they charge whatever they feel like charging. Always negotiate that fee before you get in.<p>I don't feel sorry for cabbies.  It's not much more of a job than a shoe-shine boy with a driver's license, and some of these guys still shouldn't be behind the wheel.<p>It's also better, as a customer, once you learn the map yourself. I've had these guys deliberately take congested or longer, round-about routes, to jack up the price.  Once you know the map yourself, you can sometimes insist on a certain route, within reason.<p>Tons of NYC cabbies were also recently busted leaving some kind of ""outer borough surcharge"" feature engaged on the meter, within Manhattan where it doesn't apply.  Tell me how all the money they raked in over the years doing this, could ever be returned to the customers?<p>It's an adversarial relationship, IMO.

RIA (Rich Internet Application), by the way, was a term coined by Macromedia with regards to how Flash was used. Before Flash started doing what it was doing, surfing the web meant reloading entire HTML pages or the marginally better iFrames (which were a compatibility big headache back then because of the browser wars between IE & Netscape) to make simple data calls.<p>Flash has driven the ubiquitous and acceptable use of internet video, saving content creators from the huge costly headache of having to support multiple formats. Not only that, but Flash has made video <i>interactive</i>, allowing everyone to embed videos as entire rich mini-websites even non-tech savvy end-users can stick on any webpage they wanted.<p>Flash is the reason why casual games and the web games are so popular now, especially with both genders. Now, Flash is going to have full GPU hardware 3D acceleration, gamepad support and will be running on upcoming TV set top boxes including Google TV: http://tv.adobe.com/show/max-2010-keynotes<p>HTML5? Every single HTML5 demo you see now is playing copycat catchup to what Flash was already doing 5 years ago.<p>Think about it.<p>Can't wait to see what the web will be like in the next 10 years.<p>(btw, big shoutout to http://opera.com which has been responsible for most of the innovations modern browsers have today such as tabbed browsing, tab session saving, thumbnail preview buttons to your favorite sites upon opening new tabs, and speed, speed, speed http://bit.ly/aeEuFO )",1289612883.0

38,1899953,comment,1899310.0,1899310.0,0,0,jiganti,,,"I've been on 2+2 for the better part of a decade and can tell you the online poker community has far more pressing concerns than 'bots' that hope to eek out a few dollars an hour playing a large amount of tables. [1]<p>It's certainly an impressive feat to be able to play 120 tables at a time, but naturally the more tables you play the less attention you are able to give to what's going on. As online poker sites give you a time bank of around 30 seconds, if you are playing more than 20 or so tables you don't really have time to consider more than your hole cards, the board, and the effective chip stack (whichever person has the lower amount of chips, applicable in ""no limit"" games). To play 120 tables and make a profit is only possible at the absolute lowest levels, when you're making decisions in less than a few seconds, and only considering the cards in your own hand. Even then, I can't imagine doing this successfully.<p>A common criticism in the poker community about people who play a lot of tables (anywhere from 6-12 tables is pretty standard for most professional online players, less than 6 shows a pretty remarkable discipline actually, excluding those who play heads up poker in which 2-4 tables is more common) is that these people don't have time to consider their decisions, and therefore won't improve. If they have a set decision they do in every type of situation, they won't get any better by failing to explore the value of each of their options. Further, the nature of online poker is such that the games have been getting increasingly tough each year, and failing to improve will likely turn you into a break even player.<p>The problem is that almost every competitive online poker player signs up for what is called ""rakeback"" from sites like <a href=""http://rakemonkey.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rakemonkey.com</a> and <a href=""http://raketherake.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raketherake.com</a>. In short, these types of sites have deals with the poker sites that allow players to get a percentage (usually 27%-30%) of their rake back (the few dollars from each pot that the site takes as profit). So playing 16 tables at a time becomes very appealing to the guy trying to grind out a living playing the $1/$2 no limit games, as he can easily make $5,000 from rakeback alone.<p>My theory is that as a player's poker career progresses (and he ages) he becomes more risk averse, and so rakeback becomes that much more appealing. By the time I turned 18 I was playing some of the larger stakes games online as the money meant little to me (purely out of ignorance to the value of a dollar) so I wasn't afraid to try to climb the limits as far as I could. As little as 18 months later I had dropped down limits after a number of high stakes shots ended badly, and afterwards while grinding the mid-stakes games, I loved my rakeback.<p>[1] <a href=""http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/29/news-views-gossip/ultimatebet-scandal-sticky-251207/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/29/news-views-gossip/ultim...</a>",1289611951.0

Most ""bad"" firearms related deaths which happen to firearms owners are suicides, followed by children and stupid accidents, followed by domestic violence with guns.  I'm unlikely to suffer from any of these.<p>Carrying a concealed weapon (where legal) has a lower benefit than carrying a cellphone and first aid/trauma kit (which I also carry, and will try to get to EMT-I certification again, if not paramedic), but I still think it's a net improvement in your personal safety, assuming you're trained and competent.<p>The biggest disadvantage is that in some states you can't go into a restaurant where alcohol is served (even if you're going for a meal and don't drink), and of course the fashion compromise of a 1-4 pound hunk of metal/plastic/wood.<p>I think most gun owners disbelieve ""invincibility"" even more than non-gun owners when it comes to guns -- handguns especially are fairly non-lethal (at 3', I'd rather have a knife), and give an advantage to he who initiates violence.  I'd be very happy to trade a firearm for a Dune-style shield or something.<p>I think another factor is that a responsible gun owner who is carrying is probably more likely to avoid places where an incident might happen -- aside from bars, I'd also be a lot more likely to be less confrontational in traffic or other situations if I realized there was a potential it could escalate to shooting.  I've never been involved in any kind of scuffle or anything while carrying a firearm, and while I actively avoid ""bad areas"" to the extent possible no matter what, it's another factor.

I am very risk-averse, but the idea of gaining money doesn't mean that much to me. Winning $100 vs $1000 isn't that emotional for me. Oh, sure, I'd like $1000 but I don't even care about $100. I thought about scaling the numbers up til they mattered to me, and decided I'd almost always take the sure thing because I could turn that money into a higher amount thru investing it in expanding my product.<p>But I would gladly pay $250 instead of even a slight risk of losing $1000. (Or whatever the numbers were I've forgotten already!) IRL, I've bought a new car because I'd rather pay a couple grand more than have the uncertainty of potential repair bills, etc. Clearly I hate negative unknowns.<p>That risk aversion has clearly influenced the type of ""startup life"" I've chosen. My products are ""boring,"" but quite profitable. No funding, no 80 hour weeks, no sleeping under the desk, and no potential to be gobbled up by Google, either.<p>Nevertheless, I find this far less risky than having a job, because nobody can fire me from my own company! Plus, I'm not miserable because people are always screwing with my work.<p>That said, I think part of the special startup mindset is similar to the people who will bet more on dice they've rolled than dice rolled by someone else... whether a startup is acquired feels like something they can control, however irrationally.<p>Maybe you could ask what people believe is the average chance of acquisition for a startup in general, and what they believe their chance is?",1289611163.0
