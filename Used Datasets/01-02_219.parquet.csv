I might criticize an American who tried to make a name for themselves by building half-assed tools for Iranian dissidents. That was my point.,1329357550.0

I launch the app and click a button that says I'm bored and would like to meet up with one of these people I'm 'following'.  This then bring up a list of the followers that are free as well and the SMS option would be available.  I could then message them and possibly meet up with them.<p>This was just an idea I had come up with that could possibly solve this problem I'm having.  I figured it would be worth sharing if someone was looking to build something like this.  I was hoping somwthing like this existed already though because I believe I would use it a lot.  I completely understand there's no magical program that can know you're definitely bored and would like to meet up with a friend hahaha.,1329357304.0

27,3597013,comment,3595559.0,3595881.0,2,0,billpatrianakos,,,"That makes sense in theory but from what I've seen it doesn't always work that way. Most people don't stop using something and complain really loudly. Luckily, so far the people behind the sites or apps or whatever hold their ground and in this case I can certainly get on board with the popular opinion that apps should ask for permission first. I wasn't condoning that kind of thing but simply wondering what if it really was something frivolous like G+ not allowing naked profile pictures or something and they ended up giving into the pressure? We talk a lot about slippery slopes around here and I just applied that kind of thinking to this sort of thing.<p>I also wonder how much of this outrage is genuine and how much is just people <i>thinking</i> they should be outraged. Personally, I'd have no problem with apps getting the contents of my address book. Of course thats conditional but what I'm getting at is that this sort of thing isn't okay or not okay by itself, it's how it's framed that often makes it looked at this way. In this case it was framed as a terrible invasion of privacy with lots of room for security issues. What if it was framed as being awesome because it totally enhances the experience of the app? Maybe around here we're qualified to say ""this is okay, that isn't"" because of our knowledge and backgrounds but think of regular folks playing Angry Birds on their phones having no clue what a iOS is. I'm not sure they really have an opinion until you give them one and thats exactly what we're doing. So when you say they'd be just as content knowing its going on you're correct but I'm not so sure they'd come to the conclusion that it was bad while they didn't know totally on their own. I can totally picture a lot of regular folks finding out and saying ""oh, they upload the address book? I didn't notice. Whatever."" and continue on with their day. Of course that won't happen now because of how this is reported.<p>Anyway, I'm sorry to see so many people having such strong negative reactions to my original comment. Maybe I didn't make the point clear enough or maybe my thinking really is just way off on this one. Either way, I still maintain that these what-if questions will really get you thinking differently about this stuff.",1329356406.0

The Finder is the most significant carry-over from OS 9 to OS X, but the OS X version was a Carbon program written completely from scratch to mimic the behavior of the OS 9 Finder because the OS was so fundamentally different.
