Unity had some rough edges when it was first released, but a lot of that has been ironed out. I really like the direction Unity is going. I feel that it uses space in a more intelligent way. I am very glad that Canonical has taken the initiative to build a better desktop environment. Many people don't like change, and I feel that is the category that many of the people criticizing Unity fall into. I do agree that Unity is not as easily customizable as I would expect, but again, I enjoy most of the decisions that comprise Unity.",1318816692.0

However, this slideshow was not effective at communicating anything to me. At some point during the second half of this ""presentation"" each slide seemed to have some vague phrase or sentence that was followed by 3-5 screenshots with no explanation of what the relationship was to the context the screenshot was given in -- I started to wonder if substituting those screenshots with random ones would have any impact on the value of the presentation.<p>If anything, I think the awful slideshow ""player"" UI on this website did a better job at explaining the lack of ""invisible design"" than the slideshow did.

Way too many startups I've been involved with/talked to have over looked the role of admins/an ops team.  The mentality seems to be that developers should also focus as admins/ops.  Surely nothing will go wrong on a weekend after a developer has already put in an 80 hour week, right?<p>From my experience, sys admins are important.  If you are doing anything of scale, knowledge on how to setup, tweak, and debug systems is critical.  It is helpful if the admins can stretch a bit into the app layer, just as it is helpful for developers to be able to stretch a bit into the systems layer, problems come up and knowledge of the parts helps.<p>As an engineer that can also setup systems for scale, I know my limits and really appreciate help from and learning things from good sysadmins.",1318816304.0

Like when I include a library, on some level I'm assuming it will really function the way the API suggests. But I don't have to take that on faith; I can read through the code, and see what it's actually doing. The code itself is an abstraction of something else, but if I take the time, I can eventually reduce it to an understanding of what's happening on a transistor level. I can't see what's happening in the CPU, but I can understand it.<p>I can't hold the whole model of my code at a transistor level in my head, but that's the power of abstraction. I understand what's happening on each level on some scale, I understand how the levels interface with each other, so ipso facto I <i>do</i> understand the system as a whole. If it doesn't behave the way I expect, I can use that knowledge figure out why, whether it's because I made the wrong call or because there's a wire disconnected on my motherboard.

Some people assume, ""Screw everyone else"" because they view the game as just one play.  In the reality, we have long careers.  Companies that routinely take advantage of their employees don't stick around forever.  In most fields being known as someone who will take the short term selfish path every time will eventually hurt you.<p>- The obvious second point is of course you should avoid companies that have too crazy a CEO to workerbee pay scale, and that treat their employees poorly.<p>- Most of the great success stories in technology are build on loyalty.  Ron Conway commands great personal loyalty.  (And goes the extra yard for his firms)  Many of the legends of Silicon Valley are mentors to large groups of people.  Not everyone acts selfishly.

Sure, you can demonstrate that people will abuse games (I'm unsure about Farmville, but this certainly applies to ones like WoW) to avoid real life and to make themselves feel better. Taking away their computer may result in them exhibiting withdrawal symptoms such as irritability. <i>The same is true of movies, TV programs, books, computer programming, and almost any sort of entertainment</i>.<p>People can play games for many different reasons. A few:<p>- casual, healthy entertainment<p>- competition, like regular sports sans muscles<p>- a way to avoid dealing with life<p>The 3rd is a problem, but is not exclusive to games, and is generally ignored if you use something like books. That said, many video games are perfect for being used for avoiding life; IMO due to the easy immersion, repetitive interaction, and satisfying rewards.",1318814798.0
