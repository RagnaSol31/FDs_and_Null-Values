I worked at Yahoo a decade ago, and the mail team always took care to point out how hard it was to monetize the inbox compared to other parts of Yahoo:<p>When people read their mail they are immersed in content they care about. Your ads are the furthest thing from their mind. When people browse news etc., their connection to the content is far more relaxed. When they are searching, they are often <i>happy</i> to see ads if well targeted.  Yahoo got as aggressive about mail ads as they did because people were extra blind to ads in Mail.<p>I know I behave that way: I <i>never</i> click on ads in Gmail, but in Google search results I quite often <i>intentionally</i> look at the ads and sometimes prefer the ads to the organic results.<p>Mail was seen as a traffic driver, rather than mainly a revenue source: People check their e-mail a lot; and when they&",

The human starts with a concept of an algorithm and its intended result, and everything in-between is flexible, so this is a more &quot;global&quot; view of the problem of code generation.
