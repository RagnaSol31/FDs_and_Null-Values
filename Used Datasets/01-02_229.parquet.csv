Dual-booting seems closest to what is described in the article, since only one identity seems to have direct control of the hardware at any given time. But if the other identities are still running in the background and getting information about the outside world via the one that is &quot;fronting&quot;, we might have a more complicated setup where several VMs take turns being dom0.<p>In any case, if consciousness is a result of physical processes that take place in the brain (as almost everyone with a scientific background assumes), there&",

Just imagine if anybody could claim to be a dentist!<p>Formal training and certification bodies is not the answer.  Just look at the vendor sponsored certification programs.  Instead we need some sort of peer review and rating process.  Pushing back against clueless managers is a good start.,1433898302.0
