I know it because I read your comments.  Many of you are also wiser and more experienced in dealing with the world around you than I am. I am itchy on the trigger finger sometimes and I get myself into trouble and offend people -- without intending to.<p>I had a conversation the other day with some rational folks.  One of them was noticing an increasing trend in his discomfort with the world around him.  An older gentleman in the conversation said he noticed that trend in himself years before and was bothered by what the younger person had said, because ""it doesn't get any easier,"" he said.<p>I watch interviews with Ayn Rand and read Kant and their words are words I have said myself before.  It is scary to think that the thoughts in my head mirror those who are ""outside society.""  I don't want to be outside society.   Sometimes I want to fit in.<p>It's difficult to look around and see continuing trends in irrational behavior leading the world into what appears to be a very negative direction.  ""Why don't we just make the right decision, it's so obvious!?"" I think to myself...<p>What do I do?  How do I find peace with it.  I don't want to grow into a grumpy old cynical man.  I am full of optimism. I was told years ago, ""You just haven't had your wings clipped yet.""  I don't want them clipped, what do I do?  How do I deal with a crazy world?  Or am I crazy?

48,534468,comment,533849.0,534376.0,0,0,socialtistics,,,"That statement is wrong. Forum selection clauses are binding absent a signed written contract.  For example, one of the more famous cases setting precedent for forum selection clauses involved Carnival Cruise Lines.  In that case a passenger injured on a cruise attempted to sue Carnival in the passenger's local jurisdiction.  Carnival countered that because there was a forum-selection clause in the contract printed on the back of the passenger's ticket that the passenger should be forced to sue Carnival in Florida.  The case went all the way to the US Supreme Court which ruled that the forum-selection clause on Carnival's ticket was fair and reasonable and enforceable against the passenger.  Check out Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v Shute 499 US 595, 111 S.Ct122 (1991) for details on this exact case.<p>Now I am by no means saying that forum-selection clauses are an end all to potential contract lawsuits (key here being contract disputes and not just any lawsuit between a plaintiff and defendent corporation).  There are ways to fight the forum-selection part, but you must be prepared to fight it and pay the legal expenses involved.  Sometimes it is a matter of weighing the cost versus the outcome sadly and that is why corporations end up avoiding the lawsuits in contract disputes.",1238116512
