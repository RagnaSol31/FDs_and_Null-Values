Therefore it is ridiculous to claim that anti-virus software exists because of Windows alone.<p>On the other hand, it is true that anti-virus software became a <i>lot</i> more popular as Windows gained market-share. The reason is simple: as we all know, for a long time Microsoft did not take security very seriously. They essentially followed what seems to be Adobe's current philosophy, which is ""release first, secure later."" Remember that it was only relatively recently that they started to rigorously plug holes on a very short turnaround (mostly weekly if not shorter). So it is not difficult to conceive of a perspective where anti-virus software existed (and still does) mostly to overcome some of the shortcomings of the OS.",1357005586.0

As someone who also grapples with applying technology to public policy issues, I think part of the reason that more people from the tech sector don't dive into civic issues is that the challenge there is frequently 10% tech and 90% organizational/personal.  Like you said though, those that can revolutionize business process (and I would add have excellent people skills) can add a lot to government.<p>I definitely wish you luck in your next endeavor and would love to connect as you're making the switch to the private sector (I have been contemplating a switch of my own).",1357005554.0

My experience with it and kettlebell swings suggests that they may help with activation, particularly doing high-tension sets (damper set to 10, 20-40 pulls).  Rowing pretty much is ""the anti-desk"", with the exception that you're performing the activity in a seated position.  The main target is improving your cardiovascular performance, capability, and endurance.<p>What strength training does specifically is recruit muscle motor units (bundles of muscle cells).  These are differentiated largely by size and response time, and activating a given bundle requires triggering its controlling nerve.  Higher loads trigger larger motor units.  Stimulus is usually classified by sets, reps, percent of one rep maximum load  (1RM), ""tempo"" (how long you take raising and lowering the weight), and power vs. strength lifts (""Olympic"" lifts are, confusingly, based on power, ""powerlifts"" are, confusingly, based on strength).<p>The strength training concept of ""specificity"" (also given as ""SAID"": specific adaptation to imposed demand) says that you'll get a training <i>response</i> that corresponds to the training <i>stimulus</i>.  This means both the specific muscles, and type of lift determine the training response.  If you want stronger legs, do squats, not bicep curls.  If you want to get stronger, lift heavier (80-95% 1RM) weights for fewer reps.  If you want endurance, lighter (30-50% 1RM) weights for more reps (15-20 or so).  Hypertrophy (increased mass) is maximized by moderate resistance and reps maximizing time under tension.<p>Wikipedia's Strength Training article summarizes this nicely: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training",

I think you're overplaying the threats involved today. I pirated stuff when I was a kid, and it was relatively easy for someone who understood that scene to look for warning posts first. Today it's even easier given robust user rating and the camaraderie of pirate culture. It's very much an ""us vs them"" mentality, and it's hardly a solved problem.<p>It seems that pirates are increasingly looking to provide a better service, whereas publishers seem intent on bad practices that either directly hurt, or can be used to hurt, legitimate users. In fact, many people pirate today because they don't want DRM or required connectivity. (The next SimCity will suffer from this, but I expect pirates to not have to worry about it after a few weeks.) In the case of Assassin's Creed II pirates couple play fine, but legitimate players couldn't due to DDOS attacks on servers required to let you play even single player. And in a hilarious example, an Ubisoft developer was even found to use a hack by a release group in an official patch: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/07/ubisoft-drm-snafu-reminds-us-whats-wrong-with-pc-gaming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/07/ubisoft-drm-snafu-remi...</a><p>Given the relatively equal ease of piracy versus purchase, I would give the edge to the fact that developers are insanely integrated into the game buying community at every level. They've been blogging for years, they talk on Twitter, they visit 4chan and talk games, they even visit piracy sites themselves. Gamers like developers, and want them to succeed.<p>But yes, I do think Steam even has a chance because it's as easy and (mostly) as useful as piracy. Ease and use are a large part of why Napster succeeded, and why Kazaa was so popular, but it's also the reason iTunes succeeds, though people associate it mostly with music. Google Play... I don't know many who even use it.<p>Now, UltraVoilet is a wonderful digital attempt by film studios, on paper, but they cut their nose off to spite their face by making pack-ins that come with DVDs/Blu-Rays only guaranteed to last a year. And you can't buy from the studios, but instead a few other services that the common consumer has never heard of. Film companies really are still stuck in the past. Others have learned how to make their mediums work on the Internet, and these people have ignored the lessons.<p>/edit: Been looking into UV more. It's actually an even better idea than I first thought. It seems that it's the bigger stores (Google, Apple, Amazon) that don't want to go along with it.

They're publishing software supplier (Mag+) is better at supporting iOS than Android, so supporting Android becomes too onerous.<p>On the one hand that is sad for TNW, after all more subscribers is always good, but it is <i>really bad</i> for Mag+ since it points out a gaping hole in their strategy.

What I <i>did</i> find right for me was intense rowing (on a machine), which I believe develops many of the same support muscles (but doesn't lead to the hypertrophy-induced visible muscle growth the same way lifts do, so if that's your goal rowing may not fit you).<p>For my tastes, I find rowing the perfect counterbalance to a sedentary lifestyle. The full-body compression/extension cycle just <i>feels</i> like the direct opposite of sitting fixed at a desk all day. It may be psychological, but it's very common for me to sense a relative weakening in my posture control muscles if I miss a week of rowing for holidays or illness.<p>Related tip: if you find long (6+ hr) flights physically taxing (yes, first world problems etc.), improving your posture control musculature can provide noticeable relief. Even as a teenager I used to dread having to sit upright and mostly fixed in place on transatlantic flights, but ever since I took up rowing in my early 20s I almost never feel cramped or fatigued anymore even on long haul 15+hr flights.",1357003241.0

Causes of success and failure are hard to tease out, but people know when software sucks. Also, if people can't use it, then all the cleverness in the world (in optimizations, for example, or in feature set) doesn't matter. It still sucks.<p><i>But the broad middle is a muddle. People with talent that has been squandered by circumstance, people without talent who have succeeded due to accident and luck, etc.</i><p>That's very true.<p>This is part of why I think Valve's self-organizing open allocation is superior. Management rarely knows who the best programmers are. The group of programmers, if they're good, usually can figure out an appropriate leader on a per-project basis. This doesn't generate the permanent, entitled leadership that management wants to see, but it gets the job done.<p>You also need to create room to fail. If the software project can't be saved, let it die so people can allocate their talents and energy to something that has better odds. Give the architects respect for trying and ask them to write up the challenges they encountered, so as to keep the knowledge in house. If you fire people for failing projects, then you lose that knowledge and will probably fail in the same way again.",1357002855.0

In an MMO, if you get to level 80 as a cleric, you can go back and redo all the zones as a warrior. In a Zynga game, this isn't available: it's what MUD designers called single ladder advancement. You get to level 80 and that's it: you can only keep buying more stuff, or only maintain what you have. That's very different. There's no reason to make a new Facebook account and start over.<p>In an MMO, there are a plethora of interactions, mostly related to group activities. In a Zynga game, interactions are pushed into status updates. To bring in another analogy, an MMO is like a bar. You can go there, sit down, and chat with people. You can buy a beer if you want, but you don't have to. A Zynga game, however, is a beer. You can talk with people over said beer, but that talking isn't an intrinsic part of the experience of the beer. And at the bottom of the cup, it says, ""Tell your friends how great this beer was to get more beer!""<p>> If Joe Customer wants to log in and keep feeding 25 cent cookies to his Zynga dog every morning he could keep doing that forever.<p>Yes. But are there enough of him to justify keeping the servers running?<p>In MMOs, the answers tends towards yes, because the interesting activities tend to be group-friendly, which naturally pushes up the number of people playing and paying.
