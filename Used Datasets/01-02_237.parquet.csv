It is very hard to pitch Android to someone who is not tech savy, simply because of the choppy and sluggish UI.  This has also become the talk of the masses, most people who haven't even used Android say the following:  ""I've seen Android, its cool, but its not as smooth and stable as the iPhone.""  \nThe iPhone's hardware fails a lot (I've exchanged my 3Gs twice in less than a year), it also freezes at times and drops calls, but what do people see and remember!? UI!!  If android wishes to ever compete seriously with iOS, GPU acceleration is a must!<p>On a side note, who cares about the older phones!? they can keep being sluggish... There's less than a handful of Android phones that won't support GPU acceleration, there's more than 30 that do...<p>Conclusion:  MAKE THIS A PRIORITY, its time to put the choppy UI days behind us, this year is going to bring amazing hardware to the table, and the new iPhone is good, but not THAT good... As it stands, all iOS has on Android is a ""smoother experience"", why hesitate to fix it!?""<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6914"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6914</a>",1311386012.0

I do not filter my blog posts through any PR department, and I have written plenty of stories that received wide attention. And going through a PR department typically means that the resulting document lacks any punch and originality. (Been there, done that, for other types of communication.)<p>If I could think that people could leverage the post to post their negative preconceptions about business schools, NYU, Turnitin, academic, US, or whatever else they hate, I would have not posted the blog post to start with.<p>In most of my blog posts I try to propose and describe solutions, even when I ""whine"". (See, for example, <a href=""http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2010/10/plea-to-amazon-fix-mechanical-turk.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2010/10/plea-to-a...</a> and <a href=""http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2010/12/mechanical-turk-now-with-4092-spam.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2010/12/mechanica...</a>). The blog post about cheating was not an exception.<p>The reason that it was in my draft folder was because I did not want to put it out just to talk about cheating. The post felt incomplete. Yes, I could complain. But after that, what?<p>It took me a while to realize that people did not cheat in some of the assignments, but tried in others, was because some assignments were designed to withstand cheating. And that was a point worth talking about.",1311384509.0
