I feel sad when people forget that most of the history has been rewritten to suit newer regimes, newer philosophies. And the practice is still very dominant. Howsoever informed we may try to be about past, especially past that we haven't lived through but heard about in books or media or discussions, we are still aware of only part of the story. The part that survived, the part that dominated. And what is worse, we often tend to classify some leaders as well as their supporters who have failed and then replaced by their antitheses, to have this innate evil - while forgetting that they may very well be not 'evil' in their own morality; and hence ignorance not evilness causes their evil actions.",1338688589.0

The idea that a lone polymath experimenting in his basement, a la Ben Franklin or James Maxwell, could make a genuinely important scientific discovery, disappeared a long time ago. We're chasing the long tail of knowledge. Each increment will get harder, more complex and more expensive over time, and that's factoring in the technology that makes modern science so much easier and cheaper, or even possible.<p>If you wanted to sequence a piece of DNA in the 1980s (an entire genome was laughably out of the question), you would use Sanger's method and get a few hundred base pairs in a month. Maybe an entire gene in 3 months. Now we can sequence whole bacterial genomes or genotype a million SNPs in an afternoon, but gaining new, important knowledge is still much more expensive.",1338688376.0

These days andy time I do embedded work I tend to use either my own RTOS or a third party RTOS.

It's a less-structured StackOverflow, essentially. Submissions are somewhat moderated, comments are more heavily moderated. Top-level comments are not allowed to be jokes, and offending comments are removed. On-topic jokes in other places are allowed, but too much joking around in a thread will often lead to all of the comments in the thread being removed. Deleted comments are replaced by ""Comment removed"" tombstones, and seeing whole trees of these tombstones is a decent reminder to stay on-topic.<p>The CSS of the subreddit also encourages the community to maintain their standards. When upvoting, downvoting, commenting etc, users are reminded what those actions represent in the community.

54,4059741,comment,4057564.0,4057841.0,7,0,thraxil,,,"Yes and no.<p>I wrote the Python version in probably under an hour. My girlfriend had gotten into playing some stupid Facebook version of Boggle and I just wanted to see her face when I came out of nowhere with implausibly high scores. I didn't think hard about the problem, just reached for the tool I know best and implemented the first obvious approach that came to mind. It worked as needed and I moved on. You make it sound like I think that's a bad thing.<p>Later, when I had a bit of time to think about it, it occurred to me that a trie would be a better approach, so when I was feeling like getting back into C and wanted a toy problem, re-implementing the boggle solver in C with a trie seemed like a good choice.<p>The experience of programming in the different languages does feel different though and I think it can affect how one approaches solving problems. Python is so good at just letting me solve the immediate problem that sometimes I rush and don't think things through or settle for a less than optimal solution. This will come back and bite me if that suboptimal code ends up getting built on and re-used elsewhere.<p>When I write C (or Go, Erlang, Haskell, etc. basically any language that requires me to think a little more up-front about how I'll implement it), I know going in that I'm going to be putting some serious time and effort into the code, so I tend to be more careful about things at every stage. The game changes from ""get a result as quickly and painlessly as possible"" to ""write something that is elegant in itself"". That's not always a win. Sometimes you are much better off building the prototype quickly, seeing flaws that you never would've thought of and then being able to approach the problem in a whole new way. Sometimes you just need a result quickly and time spent making things elegant or efficient actually is wasted (I'm not going to build a framework out of the boggle solving code anytime soon, eg).<p>I code in Python pretty much every day. I have for years. I probably will for years to come. It works for me. I'm just saying that sometimes other languages push you in different directions and I can see why, despite taking more lines of code to write, taking longer to write, having more potential for segfaults, and so on, languages like C still find a niche for writing systems and platforms. And that reason isn't just that it runs a little faster.",1338686317.0

86,4059707,comment,4059249.0,4059249.0,5,0,dasil003,,,"This article is painting with far too large a brush.  Heroku is not The Cloud, it's just a little piece of it.<p>When you use Heroku you are paying a premium for the platform.  You do this because it saves you sysadmin duties, and you pay a premium in terms of base cost as well as flexibility.  Obviously it only makes sense if the platform suits your app.<p>If you want to manage your servers yourself you will save a ton of money and gain a ton of flexibility.  But does this mean you should reject the cloud and order some servers and start shopping for colocation facilities right away?  No, you still have dozens of competing choices for how to get your vanilla linux boxen up and running, some of them fall under the purview of ""the cloud"" and some of them don't.  These choices become very interesting based on your specific requirements.  Sure raw EC2 is going to charge more than buying your own server, but if you buy reserved instances and factor in the colocation costs it's actually not <i>that</i> much more, and you may have many other reasons to look at it.  For instance maybe you push a lot of data to and from S3 and you want it to be fast, or maybe you want to easily put identical deployments in Europe, Asia and South America for your global customers.<p>Beyond that, the premise that the cloud is somehow a big pain in the ass and owning your own hardware does not really wash.  They both can utilize chef/puppet equally well, and being able to programmatically commission hardware is a huge convenience, the learning curve notwithstanding.<p>I also don't like hosting substantial apps of any kind on Heroku for some of the reasons the OA touches on, but that is not an indictment of cloud hosting in general.
