11,1604416,comment,1603392.0,1603392.0,0,0,zmmmmm,,,"A good summary.  After several days of thinking about this I can only come to two conclusions, neither of which I like:<p>a)  Oracle is realizing that mobile is strategic and has decided this is how they will get in on the action.   They think it is much more important than Java.   They will force Google to license Java from them and that way gain not only royalties, but actual control of Android.<p>b)  This is purely about damaging Android.   There is an agreement we know nothing about yet between Apple and Oracle that if Oracle takes down Android something will happen in return from Apple.   They don't care if they win or lose, they just want to smash adoption of Android.  It could as easily be a move from MS but it is hard to think past the bitterness and sense of betrayal expressed by Jobs about Android, or the frequently reported ""close friendship"" between Ellison and Jobs.<p>I wish these were conspiracy theories but I can't account for Oracle's willingness to detonate what is still an incredibly valuable Java asset any other way.",1281836923.0

You'll make the spread b/w the rate you get and what you pay them.  You'll profit less but gain incremental hours for your venture.<p>2.  Pick or find consulting work that ""scales well"" meaning it allows you to leverage (sorry for jargon) knowledge/things you've already done or built.  This type of work will be more efficient for you, more profitable and you can reinvest saved time into your startup.<p>3.  Regarding multiple startup ideas, I'd pick one to focus on.  Diversifying amongst startup ideas esp if unrelated doesn't work in my experience. It leads to doing them all half-baked which ultimately won't get you further from consulting which is where you want to be.<p>4.  As mentioned below, we treated our own company as a client which meant we acted with same sense of urgency as we would with other clients.  It is a good way to make your own venture a priority else it always gets back burnered.<p>5.  This one is a bit drastic but exit the mortgage if you can by selling your home and renting.  Fixed costs like mortgages can be like anchors for an entrepreneur.  Take the money you may make and put some away for a rainy day fund for the wife/kids/you and a portion can be used to give your own venture some additional fuel or runway.<p>In same boat as you my friend so ""feel your pain"" although sounds like you have too much consulting biz which is a high class problem IMO.<p>Good luck.  And if you figure out a ""solution"", pls let me know.",1281836624.0
