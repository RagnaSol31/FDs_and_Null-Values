14,422803,comment,422575.0,422759.0,0,0,jerf,,,"I think that the situation would end up better in the end if, rather than the W3C trying to define new element after new element  after new element, especially if we're going to take the viewpoint that the language will be around after 100 years, we instead simply said:<p>* Use whatever elements you want, subject to some name limitations.<p>* Style those elements using stylesheets however you want. (CSS 3.0 finally, AFAIK, completes the set of CSS elements you need to finish emulating/implementing all HTML elements \nthat exist up to this point, including table.)<p>* Let an entirely separate layer argue about semantics. Use the <link> tag to link in those semantics or something. (The ideal would be XML namespaces but this is HTML, not XHTML.) Define a semantic set that matches today's semantics, let the future define what it needs. Let this be the default if no semantic is chosen. Let a thousand flowers bloom, let the winners win.<p>Ultimately, the whole W3C process is flawed at its very core. It's some small, essentially self-selected group of people/organizatiosn trying to decide how the Web Will Be for the Next Ten Years. That's just stupid, and inimical to the way of the web itself.<p>But this is just too darned <i>simple</i> an idea to get ""standardized""...<p>More seriously, one way I know I differ from the HTML and Semantic Web folk is that I fundamentally disagree about the nature of semantics. Semantics are not something a document <i>possesses</i>, it is something that you <i>apply</i> to a document. Marking up text is a way to make it <i>easier</i> to apply semantics, but a sufficiently sophisticated (AI-complete) algorithm could apply semantics to flat text just fine. Indicating what semantics you are using in the document somehow (like an XML namespace) makes it easier for the producer and consumer to agree about their semantics, but the consumer may still ignore it and may still extract or apply their own semantics to the document without contradiction. Think about it this way and my proposal is simply the only natural way to proceed. Believe that ""Today is <date>January 20, 2008</date>"" is actually any different than ""Today is <menu>January 20, 2008</menu>"" in some ""real"" way and this W3C exercise of trying to define <i>THE</i> tag set makes sense. But it's all just tags. Just numbers applied to other numbers. Meaning is brought by the reader in collaboration with the writer, there is no intrinsic meaning.",1231292763.0
