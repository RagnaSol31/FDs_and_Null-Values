But it is almost pointless to compare these two programs since Apollo was so much more complex.<p>To put it in perspective, Apollo flew on a rocket with five engines producing 1,500,000 lbf thrust each, on the first stage alone.  By contrast, the Virgin motor produces 60,000 lbf thrust for 70 seconds.<p>The Apollo program had a safety culture configured so that if anyone identified a safety issue, they became responsible for the problem and responsible to sign off that it was corrected.",1414807190.0
