She had two small pelves side-by-side, and each of her smaller inner legs was paired with one of her outer legs. She could move the smaller legs but was unable to use them for walking.  At the age of 19, she married a doctor named Clinton Bicknell and had four daughters and a son. It has been said that three of her children were born from one set of organs, two from the other.

Can you eliminate all ambiguities when you refer to ordinary objects? Are we all talking about more or less the same things? How could we talk about exactly the same things?<p>The picture gets a little muddled when you think of the choices and distinctions each language makes. Some of them will contradict each other.<p>Suppose Language 1 has 150 words for snow, but only one for love, while Language 2 has 150 words for love, but only two for snow. Would the uber language preserve the distinctions for each word? Maybe you're losing something by learning all this detail.<p>You can do the same thing with the intensional meanings of words (connotations). I think one of the original Sapir-Whorf examples traces the meaning of a word for corn in Language A to words in Language B that mean ""enemy food"". Would the uber language remove connotations? It would probably lose the word from Language B.<p>But this gets into an even deeper point, which is that when you use a language, words aren't isolated. They frame a certain outlook on the world that hangs together. There were probably a bunch of words in Language B that talk about foreign or ""enemy"" things. Can you really say those words and mean them without taking on their perspective?<p>There are many more examples. We have this kind of thing in English too. We have ""kill"" and ""murder"". We have the Anglo-Saxon words and the Norman words.<p>And finally and most importantly, what perspective on the world does the super-language take? Objective? Involved but fair? Polemical?

There were numerous times where the smbfs driver caused kernel panics too. The only improvement to this offered in 10.3 was a dialog that would popup asking if you wanted to disconnect the share whenever it deemed that the server was unresponsive. Though the 'timeout' that it was using to display this dialog was too conservative. Sometimes it would popup just to disappear right away when it finally get a server response. [Note: these shares were mounted over a LAN, not spanning across the internet or something] The issue hurt me the most when I left a share mounted at home when I closed my PowerBook, only to wakeup the PowerBook at school/work and have OSX require a forced restart because the server was no longer there.<p>{edit} I know that all platforms have issues, I just get annoyed when people act like they don't.",1265418330.0
