The summer smog warnings are nothing to be proud of.<p>GTA (Greater Toronto Area) drivers are among the rudest drivers I've ever seen (red light means GO!). Unless you live in the downtown core, you basically need a car. And the major arteries in and out of the city are hardly world class.<p>The transit system, which everyone brags about, sucks. Compared to Montreal, which has an excellent subway system, geographic coverage is lacking. If you live at one of the corners, you're on a bus for an hour before you get to a subway station.<p>While crime isn't nearly as bad as the worst US cities, gun crime is much more prevalent than it was when I was young.<p>The tech industry is doing fairly well here, but Toronto isn't the shiny gem it used to be.",1280455059.0

I've never heard that word used in that context -- ever. Now I'll be on the lookout for it because it would have simply passed me by.<p>FYI, during this exchange I was curious that I could have missed hearing such a usage for the term, I actually just went to google to see if I could find an actual real world example of it being used in such a context (outside of Urban Dictionary) and instead found several hundred uses of it most specifically not being used in the racial context.

If you can find a real, honest to gosh usage, please link it here because I have yet to see one.<p>""niggardly"" on the other hand, I wouldn't use just because it's archaic and sounds silly but also because it's etymology is the same as the n-bomb.",1280454634.0
