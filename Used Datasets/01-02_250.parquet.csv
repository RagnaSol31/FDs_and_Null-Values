That's exactly what Treacherous Computing advocates have in mind for PCs.<p>> There is a limit to how secure you can make a modern PC without hardware support for security<p>You have bought into the Big Lie of treacherous computing. None of it has <i>anything</i> to do with protecting you against what most people would recognize as malware. That would require writing robust and non-porous operating systems - an option which simply isn't on the table. The ""malware"" you will be protected against is, for instance: DVD rippers; P2P clients; TOR clients; and, eventually, compilers (for with an unrestricted compiler one might create any of the above.)<p>> any hardware support that protects your machine can also be opted in to protect the interests of someone else<p>Can I lock you in your house using the lock presently installed in your front door? How about the one in your car?<p>Every security technology has a clearly delineated ""outside"" and ""inside."" The ""outside"" is where the keyed side of the lock faces. Another ""outside"" of this kind is the inside of a cage. Treacherous computing leaves users on the outside, no doubt about it. And the ""keys"" are in the hands of people who would like to dictate which bits in the machines you bought and paid for you are allowed to view or flip.<p>I ought to point out that I believe that evil will triumph. We shall almost certainly lose general-purpose computing - in the none-too-distant future - in no small part thanks to people like yourself.",1260928561.0

Evidence that it is problematic, or that scientists are even remotely able to predict its magnitude and effect is nonexistent.<p>But the costs of prevention are 100% real and enormous.<p>One common argument for drastic public policy initiatives is the attempt by some folks to seize the moral high ground with ""humans are terrible at long term planning"". Yes, they <i>are</i> terrible at long term planning, because humans are <i>really terrible</i> at predicting the future, e.g., predicting the size and magnitude of AGW.<p>It's simply not true that preventing a worst case scenario is worth any price. Coming up with imaginary worst case scenarios 50 or 100 years from now is as easy as pie.

Essentially, the expected value is infinite, so the net present value is infinite, so we should be willing to spend <i>all our money</i> to prevent even a possibility of AGW killing us off.<p>Since no one knows the risk, even to within several orders of magnitude, your guess is as good as mine.

I fail to understand how it was ""banned"", as it's still widely used in countries like India and several African countries.  What actually happened was a bunch of guidelines were established for its use, which any sovereign nation can ignore with little consequences.  The fact that the west decided to outright ban the stuff isn't that big of a deal given the fact that there aren't terribly many Malaria deaths in the United States or Norway.<p>And those restrictions were put in place for good reason: For DDT to be effective in wide areas (rather than targeted spraying indoors) you essentially need something potent enough to disrupt the entire Entomological portion of the eco-system, which works its way up to small mammals, which can eventually impact certain key predators.<p>One infamous example this occurred in Borneo in the 1950s. The WHO responded to a malaria outbreak on the island by spraying DDT.  It abated the malaria problem but completely disrupted insect life which lead to numerous problems culminating in roofs collapsing from an overpopulation of thatch-eating caterpillars, along with killing of mammalian predators that ate lizards (which ate DDT-laden insects). This caused an overpopulation of rats which started spreading typhoid and plague.  The rat problem was ultimately solved by airdropping cats.",1260926001.0
