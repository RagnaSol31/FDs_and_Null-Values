I can point to specific things about it that I don't like, but in the end I come back and I appreciate the content.  What I am curious to see (and I think this is roughly what bonaldi is talking about) is how well the SX software supports other less-technical communities.<p>My main concern is that SO had such a large and willing user community from day 1, that you could survive problems in converting visitors into active participants just through sheer numbers.  For a nascent community, there are the karmic barriers to entry (e.g. I've been a casual SO user for over a year, and am still not able to fix someone else's spelling mistake!).  Also, the question domain of SO lends itself to being able to ask a fairly concise question and getting a decent answer with a minimum of back-and-forth.  This is important, because SX handles discussion so poorly (and I realize that's by design).<p>Anyway, I hope it works out for you - I do admire your goals and ambition.  I just hope you keep an open mind about what the software needs to do to best serve the new communities, and adjust it accordingly.",1271210344.0

If you're using half the capacity of the drive, then it's likely you have a considerable number of empty (or at least erasable-without-needing-extra-writes) pages--especially if your drive's controller does some basic defragmentation.<p>And no, SSDs aren't worthless without TRIM. But if you're likely to use the majority of the storage space on the drive and do a lot of writes besides, it could be the difference between ""fast"" and ""really damn fast."" Either way it'll still beat the pants off most rotational disk drives.<p>I think the takeaway, though, is that if you've spent potentially-obscene amounts of money on an SSD, wouldn't you prefer that your OS take full advantage of its capabilities to consistently deliver top performance?<p>(And no, that's not a dig at OS X. I'd recommend that Windows XP users upgrade to Win7 if they're considering upgrading to an SSD simply for the TRIM support. It can make that much of a difference depending on the user.)",1271209984.0

15,1263909,comment,1261702.0,1261993.0,0,0,gjm11,,,"Spin is not only a matter of factual misstatement and omission. In fact, I'd use a stronger term for those (""lying"", for instance). The spin is in the use of slanted terms at every opportunity. Hard-earned tax dollars. Highest level in American history. Staggering budget deficit. Dumped in the laps of our children. No free lunch. System risks collapsing. Doubling all income tax rates. Unemployment costs have surged. Numerous strings attached. Are taxpayers getting their money's worth?<p>Even if there is not a single misstatement of fact, and not a single consequential omission, even if every single one of those phrases is in itself an entirely defensible description, that's a whole lot of spin.<p>And all that spin makes the article look much less useful to me, because -- not being an expert on US taxation or federal finances -- I don't <i>know</i> whether there are in fact any misstatements or omissions that are relevant, and the spin suggests that the author may be more interested in promoting a particular viewpoint than in giving as accurate an account as possible. (So: thank goodness for the spin; it saves me from being taken in from something that looks even-handed and factual when it isn't...)<p>It's certainly not hard to think of some things that <i>might</i> be important omissions. For instance, it seems like there's a considerable difference between a one-off huge spend and a general policy of spending a huge amount; the US government has (reasonably enough, prima facie) been doing a lot of one-off spending in the hope of stimulating its troubled economy; so are those big increases ""since 2008"" and ""in the last decade"" systematic increases in government spending, or are they part of a short-term attempt to stop the economy collapsing? Oh, and are they inflation-adjusted? One <i>other</i> comparison in the article is, but curiously the author doesn't say about these conveniently scary figures.<p>As for your final question: That figure of $31k is for spending, not taxation; the amount collected in tax is allegedly $18k per person. So, the question is more like: Would the average person say ""I'm willing to give 45% of my income to the federal government, so long as I get back 70% more than I put in""? I suspect the average person probably would, although of course that might just be because they wouldn't appreciate that the difference is going to come back to bite them or their children in the ass.<p>(Yes, I appreciate that most of that $31k/person doesn't reach them in the form of cash: some of it is in public education, infrastructure, defence spending, etc. And yes, I appreciate that it doesn't reach  or benefit all people equally; but then the $18k isn't taken from all people equally, either. But a discussion that takes all that stuff into account isn't going to begin with talk like ""give 80% of my income to the federal government"".)",1271209675.0

First, in the article authenticity proponents are pictured as ""anti-globalization"" activists:<p>Do you really want to argue that anti-globalization folks are not (mostly) left of US center?  Or that they don't idealize rather crappy third world countries?<p>> I rarely see vegetarians as mostly concerned by marxism.<p>Good for you, but no one said that they were.  Few people, including vegetarians are ""mostly concerned"" with Marxism and it's quite possible to criticize consumer culture from a non-Marxist perspective.  Nevertheless, a lot of such criticism is from such a perspective.  That's why I wrote ""FWIW, ""marxist analysis"" does produce a lot of railing against consumer culture which is apparently derived from their first principles. If you want to argue against market economy and consumer culture without invoking marxist principles, have at it.""<p>> Moreover it is questionnable to correlate dictator regimes with Marxism: many south-amercian or african regimes are/were backed by the US/France/etc...<p>The existence of non-Marxist dictatorial regimes doesn't imply that Marxist regimes don't tend toward the dictatorial.  Note also that western countries have supported somewhat Marxist clients.<p>> I'm just saying that there is a need for more autonomy in the system to prevent crises like recent ones (e.g. the rice crisis in 2008).<p>How about some supporting evidence for the ""more autonomy"" theory?  IIRC, the rice crisis was due to a price increase that wasn't even noticed in the US.  That's why I mentioned the recent corn crisis in Mexico.  Prices went up more in the US, but Mexico had food riots.<p>> It's just common sense to say that third world countries with more food-producing agriculture (instead of say, cotton) are less fragile to speculation on food which can lead to disasters especially in bad years, or<p>I'm not interested in ""common sense"", I'm interested in what's actually true.<p>If cotton gives them a GDP of $2000/year while rice gives them a GDP of $500/year, cotton gives them a much bigger cushion if the rice price doubles.  Yes, a cotton failure hurts, but so does a rice failure.<p>An extra $500/year can make a huge difference at this level.  It may let them save enough to survive a bad year.<p>> that controlling their crops vs using GMO's makes them less economically dependent on big corporations.<p>Suppose, for the sake of argument, that GMOs double their yield and the price is equal to 10% of their crop vs a ""traditional"" price of 0.  That still looks like a 90% benefit.  Why is that bad?<p>Of course, if the benefit is 10% but the extra cost is 50%, it's a bad deal, but foreign corps aren't in a position to force anyone to buy.  (Their govts are, but that's a different problem.)<p>If you're going to argue that someone close to the edge shouldn't do what's most profitable for them, please provide the numbers.",1271209249.0

Examples of not-terribly-promising things:<p>1. He proves what he calls ""Assertion 1"", then says that it ""suggests"" some other propositions that he calls ""Conclusion 1"", ""Conclusion 2"", ""Conclusion 3"". He doesn't offer any proofs of these; they don't seem to be obvious consequences of Assertion 1; they don't even seem very likely to be true. In particular, Assertion 1 has the form ""if graphs G and G' are isomorphic, then [linear algebra stuff]"" and Conclusion 2 (which he uses later) has the form ""if [linear algebra stuff] then graphs G and G' are isomorphic"".<p>2. He then defines this thing he calls a W-matrix, which seems like it basically encodes for a given vertex of a given graph which other vertices are at any given distance from it. He then appears to claim -- I'm not quite sure, because his notation is eccentric and it's late at night -- that equality of W-matrices is basically the same thing as similarity of vertices (i.e., whether some graph automorphism carries one to the other), and that doesn't look right to me.<p>I repeat that I haven't looked at this carefully, and I'm not an expert in the field anyway. But it's not compelling enough to make me want to spend much more time on it; I expect that if it turns out to be valid someone smarter than me will check it over and let the world know :-).",1271207930.0

In the case of Microsoft, it was attempting to leverage a Monopoly in one market (Operating Systems) to takeover another one (Browsers).<p>Apple is so, so, far away from being a Monopoly in any market that it's laughable.

The closed-market situation leads to more divergent outcomes: you have wealthy people who are in profitable markets, and non-wealthy people who are kept out due to high barriers. Reducing market barriers makes that rigid in-v-out dichotomy harder to maintain, which is better for the people who would have been out in the closed-market situation. They can still only profit a little, but before they couldn't profit at all.<p>Markets where capital is a requirement also tend to result in rich-get-richer effects, where you have to have money to enter profitable markets, which then make you more money. Low-barrier markets make it harder to get a return out of capital, and force people to get returns from other things, like their tech skills.
