I'm of the opinion that taxes should be in compensation for the service provided by the government. What service is being provided here? It makes me angry that just because someone is making money off of something that taxes must sharecrop off of it. As long as the host files their 1099 that came from AirBNB, it seems fine to me. Why is it that a person can stay over and it's no problem but when they pay money it's a huge issue? It makes me think. If this is hurting the hotel business, too bad!

62,1473536,story,,,3,0,philipkd,How do I structure an Independent Contractor Agreement for an incubator?,,"My friend is starting an incubator and wants me to contribute ideas for new mobile apps. He sent me an independent contractor agreement, but I'm concerned about who owns what.<p>We both agree that there should be some co-ownership of the new apps that are incubated. However, the appropriate splits are hard to determine in advance, especially since we don't know how much I'll actually contribute to each of these new apps.<p>He wants me to sign an Independent Contractor Agreement, but it contains a bunch of clauses that state that anything I contribute in the performance of my contract, he owns.<p>Is there a way to craft this ICA so that if I give him some of my ideas for apps, he doesn't just own them outright? I was thinking of just modifying the standard ICA so that instead of granting him ownership, it grants him an irrevocable, non-exclusive license to anything I contribute. And that if we get serious about these ideas, and I get involved, that then we'd negotiate, on a per-app basis, what the splits should be. (And I'd confer exclusivity at that point).",1277860984.0

Confirmation bias, perhaps?), I'll take my downvote suffering-<p>>In fact, Apple seems very confident regarding everything it decided for the original 2007 iPhone<p>Except multitasking in apps. Actually, scratch that, except apps altogether. Two major shifts in direction.<p>Of course Gruber led into that talking about hardware. There you can look at the fact that the iPhone pre-4 had a worst-in-class DPI, but now with the 4 it's all about the Retina display. DPI is suddenly where everything is.<p>The original iPhones were about feminine curves. The new iPhone is about kick-you-in-the-face masculine squares.<p>And then the front-facing camera (a common complaint on the original iPhone). The volume buttons. And on and on. Original perfection indeed.<p>The iPhone 4 is a brilliant phone. I'm morally against Apple's dominance of mobile, yet it's hard to gather the strength to argue when a friend talks about possibly getting an iPhone 4: It's a hard choice to argue with.<p>Yet Gruber's salacious, disturbing love of all things Apple; his automatic justification of everything Apple does; is very tough to stomach.<p>As a somewhat unrelated aside, one thing that really strikes me about the iPhone is the large amount of wasted space. It's interesting seeing it near >=4"" phones and they barely eclipse the iPhone in size, the huge bezel (esp. on the bottom) of the iPhone making a small screen in a large phone.",1277860802.0

It seems they could have pulled that one easy, but i guess we will see this in Ipad2, its fair business, but still kind of a dick move in my mind, I am glad i didn't get the ipad yet. I can wait for the retina enabled one.<p>I am not an Iphone user, but I held friends 3gs and the 4 to compare, and found the smooth block disconcerting, it was harder to cup the phone, and introduced a mild strain on the fingers, it felt slippery, prone to fall out of my hands if i am not too careful, which is often the case when i pick my cell. I suspect that I would have got used to it had I handled one for a longer period of time , but I have to ask, why should I?<p>The design strikes me as beautiful (the most elegant mobile phone design i have seen to date) But I also think that the design choices Apple imposes, exclude a good number of people physically,(minor discomfort for me, due to a hand injury) some people prefer physical keyboards because of the physical capabilities of their hands,why not make a version for them? Not to mention the great benefit IOS4 and apps can give people working in more physically hazardous environments that are missed by not having a little more variance in industrial design choices.<p>Its pretty much agreed by both people who dislike and people who love apple, that Apple is not looking to fulfill every niche of the market, it is a source of contention or pride, depending on where your sentiments are.<p>I am too much of a tinkerer to use an Iphone, i feel it restricts me. Indeed, Apple products, restrictions and other idiosyncrasies drive me mad, and so i don't use them.<p>I do recognize that these are issues of personal preference, and by most measures i am not the hypothetical ""normal person"" that always appears in most Apple reviews.<p>So I fully recognize the genius behind the design, it is elegant and beautiful, without peer in the industry (for shame) and it is also true that the ""just works"" cannot be overstated. It is simply of no personal concern to me, because i take pride in making things work on my own, and rather enjoy it, as i mentioned... tinkerer<p>But I would have bought my mom one without thinking twice about it, ware it not for the limited physical options, she cant handle it in her age with her hands, this exclusivity by Apple is a pity, and in that sense it is a bad design choice, I suspect elderly people, factory workers, or people that need to work with gloves would love to have a phone that indeed ""just works"". this exclusion is something I always found to be the chink in apples design ethos, imagine an apple designed product specifically tailored to the elderly, or an Apple designed tough industrial strength laptop or Ipad.",1277860635.0
