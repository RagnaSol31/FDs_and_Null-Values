Since it has been allowed limited memory, when it put something new in memory, it has to kick something old out.  It uses a simple algorithm to identify what to keep and what to kick out.  One of the benefits of this (obvious) design is that when too many users are active at the same time to keep all of them in memory, a few of them experience a small lag (as opposed to all of them experiencing a complete crash).  If you have a few terabytes of disk then you have to really be asleep at the wheel (like for a decade) to totally crash.",1286503023.0

It sacrifices liveness for correctness - if the proposer does not hear back from a majority of nodes (in the case of, e.g. a partition), the protocol will not complete (availability is sacrificed).<p>My point is not that there is a 'vital packet' in every protocol, the omission of which will cause either a lack of availability or consistency (although I can certainly design protocols that way!) - it's that for every protocol there is a network partition which causes it to be either unavailable or inconsistent. That network partition might be dropping ten messages, or just one. Retransmitting would make sense, but in real life message failures are often highly temporally correlated :(<p>The proof of this, by the way, is in a very famous paper by Fischer, Lynch and Patterson called ""The Impossibility of Distributed Consensus With One Faulty Process"".
