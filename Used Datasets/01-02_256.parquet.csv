11,2129662,comment,2129424.0,2129545.0,0,0,tzs,,,"My guess is that the copyright issues aren't actually in the suit as an attempt to get <i>copyright</i> royalties. I think Oracle's goal is <i>patent</i> royalties from the several patents in the suit.<p>If I'm right, the copyright part of the suit is there for two reasons.<p>1. It might make Google look bad. Even if Google prevails on the copyright aspect of the case, some jurors may think that they were doing something shady--there just wasn't enough evidence presented to nail them for it. If Oracle wins on the patent side of things, those jurors may be more inclined to vote for higher patent damages because of the impression they got from the copyright side of things.<p>2. It might be a tactic to waste some of Google's time at trial. You don't get unlimited time to present your case, examine witnesses, cross examine witness, or present final arguments. In the patent trial I attended as inventor and witness, each side had something like 15 hours. Some courts go so far as to use a chess clock and time it down to the second.<p>Oracle could tell the jury what files they are going to show, enter into evidence proof that they own the copyright and have registered it, put up diffs between their version and Google's version, pointedly call attention to how similar they are, and be done with that in a few minutes. Let Google them spend an hour explaining it all away, teaching the jury about Java boilerplate code and such. That's an hour Google won't have on its clock for tearing into Oracle's patent expert on whether or not Google's VM reads on the claims of the patents, and other things like that.<p>Something like that happened at the trial I attended. As is common in many IP cases, the IP had been transferred to a holding company created specifically to hold it for the trial, and if we had won would deal with collecting and distributing the damages. Perfectly routine thing. However, someone screwed up. They did not file with the state's corporate authorities a document they are supposed to file that comes from the state's tax authorities that declares that the company has paid its taxes. They had paid the taxes--they had just not filed it with the appropriate corporate records people.<p>The other side found out that, and at trial asked our CFO (who was not involved in setting up the holding company--that was handled by the CFO of a company that was jointly involved in the suit, although our CFO has specifically asked before trial if they had taken care of this and they said yes), ""Mr. Soandso--why is HoldingCorp cheating on its taxes?"" or something like this. This of course flummoxed our CFO, and made him look confused in front of the jury. Then, the next day, after our lawyers made sure the filing was taken care of, they had to spend a lot of time teaching the jury exactly how these filings work and showing them we had paid taxes on time, and had just misplaced a minor documents.<p>Throughout the rest of the trial, they had to let some damaging things go un-rebutted, and drop some good arguments, because of the lost time on that tax thing.",1295661400.0

I thought I had found some real bargains in Manhattan but then realized the apartments were not in Manhattan, e.g. the address on Craigslist would simply be '34th St.' and PadMapper would plot it in Manhattan, but it is was actually 34th St. in Astoria.<p>It would also be good if PadMapper could scrape addresses from the title of posts (or from within the post) when there is no (full) address link at the bottom of a Craigslist post. This might be a bit more tricky since the way some of the addresses are written can't even be interpreted by Google Maps.<p>I still found PadMapper to be the best way to find apartments in areas I wanted to live, and it is a lot clearer than HotPads and Google Property search. One thing that I would really love is a more complete map that shows transportation and amenities like Google Maps.

39,2129631,comment,2127937.0,2127937.0,0,0,zone411,,,"First, I haven't noticed any significant increase in the frequency of spam sites appearing the Google search results. The biggest problem that I did notice is social bookmarking sites, like reddit and digg, outranking original content. They often have nothing more than a copied-and-pasted paragraph, sometimes supplemented by low quality comments (as is common with these types of sites). Since this site is very similar, not many people will be concerned about this issue.<p>Second biggest issue is poor Wikipedia articles appearing in the top results for almost any reference type query. Many less frequently updated Wikipedia articles are nothing but regurgitated content lifted from other quality sources. What makes it worse is that Wikipedia is using no-follow for their links, so even if these sites are linked in the reference section, they won't get any credit. It's interesting to see so many people complain about low quality content on commercial sites, but they never mention Wikipedia, which is a much bigger offender (I guess this might be because Wikipedia gets its content for free and doesn't have ads and other sites pay for the content and do have ads).<p>Third, I hope Google doesn't make any changes without checking very carefully that good sites will not be negatively affected. For example, newspapers will often have the exact same articles from the AP, but also original content based on their own reporting. Punishing them for having duplicate content would not work well.

My runway is relatively short, as I’m a part-time college student with less than 6 months in savings. As such, I’m working a part time job to support myself. So, instead of relying on my current $7.25/hour job to pay the rent, I’m thinking about starting a separate side business.<p>I’ve already got the idea mapped out. It doesn’t require any technical skills, and after initial set up (approx. a week) I’ll only have to spend about 3 hours per customer. It's not a scalable business, and the pricing is relatively high, so I probably won't have the issue of too many customers.

Obviously I have to actually <i>get</i> those customers, but I'm fairly confident I can manage it.<p>The best plan seems to be: start the side business, and if it takes off, then quit the minimum wage job.

On it's merit, to be honest, I don't think that Jason's proposal goes far enough. He's definitely got his eye on an undercurrent that could be a problem if we don't try and do something about it.<p>The real issue at hand is what's the real expectancy of college. Is college supposed to teach you to think, and make your more well rounded or is it supposed to turn you into a ninja in your space? I always understood that it's academia's responsibility to teach you to think and give you fundamentals that you can take to the market, and have the market shape you. Obviously that's archaic.<p>My generation (I'm 26) is, in general, a disaster coming out of college now, and it's because they spent 4 years learning the applied physics of throwing a ping pong ball across and 8 foot table and driving vaporizer innovation. Don't get me wrong, there are tons that are graduating, and are doing awesome things right now, but I bet that most of them had some sort of taste of what it was like to work in their space while they were in school.<p>I think that students would leave school significantly better equipped, if we found a way to make it so that you can't get your degree without spending the last 18 months of college if you don't go work full-time in a startup-like scenario, whether it's an actual startup or something like a Y Combinator. How you pay for it and make sure that students aren't free labor and a tax break for a startup, will be an issue, but overall this would end up being a net-benefit for the economy.<p>The last 3 years in school, while I was getting my BA in English, I worked at a tech startup, and very quickly I had to come to grips with the brutal reality of where I was, what I knew, and what I had to learn- and quickly. Those three years were a fundamentally life changing experience for me. I was hired to do user quality assurance and content development, and by the time I left, I was the de-facto project coordinator, because I was the one writing all the python to make sure that everyone's content and art assets made it into the system, so the developers could tackle implementing the new features of the software.<p>The real key to make this proposal work, although funding is important, is the quality of mentorship that is available to students who participate. I'm freelancing now, but I've been able to pay my mortgage for the last 2 years because the lead developer and CTO of that company decided that investing 20 minutes of their day, having lunch and sipping cups of coffee with me was a worthwhile investment of their time. If the quality mentorship component is there, programs like this will be able to help students really step it up a notch or three.",1295659558.0
