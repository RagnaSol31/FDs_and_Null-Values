I work with some really smart people, one of which has been at the company for about 15 years. When you have the opportunity to work in a field that fascinates you, the actual technology you use to implement products becomes a lot less interesting, the business retains the ""corporate knowledge"" that only exists in people's heads, and the less committed quit.<p>I wonder if the attitude here is a product of short product lifecycles and rapid gratification. In my industry, a short project is 2-3 years. An average one is 5-7 years from concept to first release.",1268963974.0

43,1203073,comment,1202959.0,1202959.0,0,0,jplewicke,,,"There are two different types of requirements that banks have to maintain: capital requirements and reserve requirements.  They are very different things, and reserve requirements aren't the important or binding one.<p>Capital requirements mandate how many assets banks must have relative to their liabilities.  If a bank has $100,000 in deposits(=liabilities), their capital requirements mean they must have around $105,000 in assets (bonds, mortgages, etc.).  There are also additional requirements about how much must be held in cash equivalents(T-bills, etc.).  If a bank becomes too leveraged, or its assets decline sufficiently in value, then the FDIC takes the bank over.<p>Reserve requirements relate to how much of one kind of asset banks must have relative to their liabilities -- ""bank reserves"".  ""Bank reserves"" are a special kind of currency issued by the Fed that only are used for accounting between the Fed and banks.  Banks that are short of reserves overnight(say, because they got a bunch of deposits that day), must borrow them from other banks that have too many to maintain their reserve requirements.<p>Like Bernanke said, this overnight borrowing was a major issue during the crisis.  Since any bank that was borrowing was at risk for going bankrupt overnight, there was immense counterparty risk generated by what was supposed to be payment clearing mechanism.  The Fed wants to move towards having banks borrow from them overnight, instead of from other banks.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds</a> ,\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_reserves"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_reserves</a> ,\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_reserves"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_reserves</a> , and\n<a href=""http://www.winterspeak.com/2009/12/banks-are-even-more-super-than-i.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.winterspeak.com/2009/12/banks-are-even-more-super...</a> may be informative.",1268962420.0

I am an outlier there.  I took over a year from initial interview to hire thanks to the hiring freeze.  I'd like to see us A/B test different interview formats to figure out how much of the process we can remove without hurting the performance of the people we hire.<p><i>a focus on hiring those good at interviewing and not those good at engineering (hiring scores do not correlate with performance scores)</i><p>This is not so simple.  There is a skill to impressing people, and everyone has trouble limiting its impact on interviews.  My impression is that Google does much better than most.  For instance how many times have you heard someone say that their impression was really good, but when they went through the notes the person wasn't as good as they seemed.  That is a case where someone's interview skills didn't have its usual impact.<p>The best anyone has managed do with any hiring process is to filter out the vast majority of bad people.  Successfully ranking the best is pretty much impossible.  The toy model I offer at <a href=""http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2010/02/what-is-intelligence.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2010/02/what-is-intelligence.ht...</a> is a pretty good explanation of why.  Just replace TST with ""interview skills"", INT with ""actual performance"" and IQ with ""hiring scores"".  Since both actual performance and ability to interview affect your interview results, being really selective winds up with people who are good at both, and not those whose performance is truly exceptional.<p><i>ignoring experience by offering salaries or positions significantly below candidate's current levels in the industry.</i><p>This I'll actively disagree with.  Google is in a strong negotiating position.  They would be amiss to their shareholders to not negotiate well.  <i>Particularly</i> since the ability difference between ""got in solidly"" and ""just missed the cut"" is rather small.  But even so, if you're good at negotiating, the salary drop is much less.  And there are various kinds of incentives that make your overall compensation significantly more than just your salary.<p>Besides, whenever you put people into a different kind of job than they have had before, you run a real risk that they will prove not to be a good fit.  A drop in compensation is only appropriate in that situation.  And Google's environment is different enough that lots of people wind up in that situation.  (For instance I'm an SRE.  That's a Google role that you don't find elsewhere.)",1268961560.0
