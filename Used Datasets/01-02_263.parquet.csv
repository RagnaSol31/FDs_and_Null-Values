Another commenter, mreid cited Thurston's essay ""On proof and progress in mathematics"" which discusses this in far more detail and far more authoratitively than I possibly could.  Hardy also touches on it in his ""A Mathematician's Apology"".<p>Mathematics which is long settled, the type of thing generally studied in high school and for most of undergraduate mathematics education, is often (but not always) presented in this format, with axioms and definitions cleanly laid out and tiny steps form one to the other to arrive at the theorem.<p>Mathematics for working mathematicians does indeed involve this, but it also often involves intuitive leaps, thoerems where the first proof is only vaguely sketched out, and reasoning from diagrams.  They normally try to clean this up by the time it is published, but for a variety of reasons even there it is often not perfectly rigorous and hardly ever in tiny steps with every step justified by axiom or previous proof.<p>There are many things held in common knowledge that are never cited.  This is of course fine if the proofs are available, but steps away from that school house rigour immediately.  Even beyond that, it is not uncommon for some ideas to only be sketched, and occassionally errors are found in the omitted steps in those sketches years after they have been formally peer reviewed and published.<p>These sketches are used in proof of absolute formalism often just for the sake of time and space in the journal, but occassionally because no one has ever actually gone through and filled in every detail at all, trusting to the more intuitive logic of the sketch.<p>The assumption in most cases is that it could be made perfectly rigorous if the need arised, but that is often only actually done if there is some question or debate.",1260236585

But ""facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored,"" as Aldous Huxley famously said.</i><p>No, they don't. The facts are that your prospects as an English major are, on average, fairly dim. However, your assumption that everyone will be in your position after graduation is woefully self-absorbed.<p><i>I have sympathy for my fellow students. I did many of the same things when I was an undergrad. Plus, escaping student debt -- no matter how frugal they try to be -- is nearly impossible. Even if they do resort to purchasing a large creepy van, most will still have to go tens of thousands of dollars into debt to pay for tuition.</i><p>I think not.<p><i>The idea of ""thrift,"" once an American ideal, now seems almost quaint to many college students, particularly those at elite schools. The typical student today is not so frugal. Few know where the money they're spending is coming from and even fewer know how deep they're in debt. They're detached from the source of their money. That's because there is no source. They're getting paid by their future selves.</i><p>And? He states this like it's <i>prima facie</i> ridiculous. The world runs on non-liquid assets and loans. If he thinks that he's somehow permanently escaped loans and debt he is going to have a rude awakening when he goes to buy a house and needs to take out a mortgage. Of course, he could always choose never to buy a house and live in a van for the rest of his life, but that completely ruins his idea of how ""sensible"" he is for avoiding college loans.<p>In essence, if he enjoys living frugally and does it for internal reasons (Thoreau's ideal) then that is perfectly fine. However if he believes that he is somehow in a better living and financial situation than the rest of his peers he is simply deluding himself. Yes, college education is exorbitant and yes loans make take years, even decades, to pay off. However, the idea that loans are <i>obviously</i> a negative thing have no basis in math or economics. One can construct situations in which loans and debt result in disaster, sure, but one can also create similar situations that have no negative consequence.

You have to pay producers, sound engineers, technicians, etc. Music videos aren't exactly cheap to produce either. The costs of the production of an album can quickly reach five zeros. Record labels invest a lot in artists (on not very friendly terms for the artist, but that's a separate issue). Additionally, they provide them with connections. They help them getting performances in TV shows, getting their music played on the radio, etc.<p>These days a many bands chose the alternative route of becoming independent.

However, if a mathematician arrives at a ""bad"" result, the reaction is not always to revise the definition.<p>Sometimes we think it's really awesome that the definition is general enough to capture additional phenomena in the same framework. Sometimes these degenerate ideas lead to interesting areas of research in their own right, like how adding some strange Godel-related axiom to number theory leads to Supernatural Numbers. Sometimes the theorems that are developed are not applicable to their original subject of study, but can be applied to another by re-interpreting their meaning, like non-Euclidean geometry. Sometimes the unintuitive result is simply accepted, like Godel's theorem. Sometimes our intuition is simply wrong, so unintuitive edge cases like Dirac spikes end up being fundamental tools in physics and signal analysis.<p>Intuition is often used to motivate the definitions or the axioms, but they are clearly labeled as definitions and axioms.

This sort of stuff is pretty common. Not because of greed or malevolence (at least not primarily) but because of the utter incompetence and chaos in the music industry. The big four companies (Warner, Sony BMG, EMI and Universal) are enormous chaotic abominations where one department has no idea what the other department does (not unlike Microsoft or IBM in the software/tech industry). Corporate politics and ego plays a great part. Despite them constantly whining about the hardships caused by music piracy they grew way too comfortable as nothing really threatens their business model.<p>Don't get me wrong; we need record labels and publishers. Someone has to invest in discovering, coaching and marketing artists. This is not an anti-recording industry rant but as someone who really loves music I'm infuriated to see every day how incompetent the recording industry is.<p>Really I can imagine only two solutions: either a number of lawsuits like this delivers the shock to shake up the industry or emerging new competitors with better talent and more up-to-date views on the future of this business replace the old ones. Perhaps the second path would be better but to be successful in this industry, having money and being smart is not enough; you have to have lots of connections. Lots and lots of them.",1260234430

(+) I don't know if he knows my work habits, but here there are: over the last three years I have averaged less than 5 hours a week on my business.  The most I've ever worked is during the week right before launch (my, ahem, entire development schedule), which was about 50 hours.  (I was working a day job at the time, although it was fairly undemanding.  Two jobs at once made me get sick.  I promised never to do that again.)<p>A typical weekday sees me get up, check my email for 10 minutes, go to the day job, come back you-don't-want-to-know hours later, check my email for 10 minutes, and go to sleep.   On the weekend I'll (sometimes) put in three or four hours on Saturday.  When I get inspired by a project I'll split ten hours across Saturday/Sunday.<p>I know there are a million things to do.
