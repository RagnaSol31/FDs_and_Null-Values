Not that specifically, but it was pretty clear from the start that it would be invasive and ineffective (because it's always been about theater rather than results).<p>> There will come a day when all computing purchases will be ""routinely"" reported to DHS.<p>That's completely unrelated to the bill at hand here, and the DHS will not be involved. (It will be the IRS, and it won't be at all specific to computing.)<p>> And every member of IT staff will need a Fed license.<p>IT is too ill-defined and general for that to happen, but I could see some positions on some specific kinds of projects requiring licensing just like Plumbers, Electricians, real Engineers, Lawyers, etc have.",1292119055.0

6,1996180,comment,1995775.0,1996053.0,0,0,ugh,,,"The rocket and capsule were designed with a certain payload weight target in mind. What SpaceX ended up with are a rocket and capsule that are capable of transporting between 0 and X kg (where X is the maximum payload) to orbit. SpaceX obviously doesn’t design a few thousand different rockets and capsules for a few thousand different payload weights, that would not be profitable.<p>Now, I’m by no means a spaceflight expert but I think it’s very reasonable to assume that spaceflight is a business with stupendously high fixed costs (designing and building the rocket and capsule) and comparatively much lower variable costs [0]. What this means is that the difference in cost between a flight of the Falcon 9 with no payload (except the capsule) and the maximum payload is relatively small. You will pay a lot of money for getting the capsule into orbit either way.<p>Or, to put it another way, the cost of getting the first kg into orbit is very high (because it includes the fixed cost of building and designing the rocket and capsule) while the marginal cost for every additional kg is relatively small (because the variable cost is a very gentle slope).<p>That’s true until you reach the maximum the rocket and capsule were designed for. The marginal cost of the first kg beyond the maximum payload will be relatively large because the rocket will have to be redesigned. (Drawing a graph would make all this so much easier to understand but I hope I was sufficiently clear.)<p>What this means it that SpaceX saves probably hardly any money by keeping the payload as low as possible while testing rocket and capsule.<p>[0] Other businesses with stupendously high fixed costs and comparatively low variable costs are for example Newspapers or software developers. The first copy costs for making the first copy of a newspaper or a piece of software are very high while the marginal costs for the second copy (the additional costs the Newspaper business or software developer will have for making a second copy) are very low, compared to all the costs that came before and that are fixed (salaries, buildings, machines, …) very nearly zero.",1292118915.0

In fact they can be used together:<p><a href=""http://www.waveprotocol.org/protocol/design-proposals/clientserver-protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.waveprotocol.org/protocol/design-proposals/client...</a><p>To explain at greater length, WebSockets are much simpler. If you wanted to do something simple, like let your website's users chat with each other, you could whip something up with WebSockets. If you wanted to do something complicated, like a real-time cooperative game, you could use WebSockets as the basic structure that you would built a more complicated messaging system on top of. A WebSocket is a two-ended pipe, client to server, and if you want a more complicated network structure you have to create that yourself.<p>The Wave protocol is much more complicated and aimed at a more specific case. It is built on the idea of shared documents which is at a higher level than sockets. It contains specifications for things like cursors and deleting segments of text in documents. If you were building a system that did not have something akin to shared documents, it would probably not make sense to use the Wave protocol. But if you were building a system based on shared documents, like an EtherPad clone, then the Wave protocol might be perfect and save you a lot of work.<p>They are not really direct competitors like JSON vs XML. It is more like comparing HTTP to XML. You could operate the Wave protocol over WebSockets, just like you could send XML over HTTP.",1292116524.0

Trying to replace sockets with Wave would be a major step backwards; the reason we need websockets in the first place is that the high-level HTTP protocol embeds assumptions that are not always correct for a given application and therefore gets in the way; Wave would be even worse about that.<p>Google Wave is one of the many protocols that can be built on a socket. Wave and HTTP are peers, sockets are the foundation they both sit on, WebSockets are as close to sockets as the web will let us get.<p>(It should be pointed out that WebSockets still are not the ultimate in flexibility; the TCP that WebSockets sit on itself makes assumptions about applications that are not appropriate to all applications, which is why not every packet on the internet is a TCP packet.
