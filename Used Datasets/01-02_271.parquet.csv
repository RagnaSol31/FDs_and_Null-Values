Due to performance reasons you occasionally have to abandon R to use Numpy, but for everything else you use R. Thus, in a sense you still have the problem that Julia tries to solve: You constantly have to jump between two different languages depending on the problem size.<p>Also, just like you chose Numpy, someone else might choose Julia. So this turns into a Numpy versus Julia comparison.
