22,1645130,comment,1644772.0,1644864.0,0,0,grellas,,,"Very good points.<p>Concerning the joint-venture analysis, where two otherwise independent entities team up to pursue a business opportunity for profit, or to jointly develop a product for possible future commercial exploitation, they can readily satisfy the technical definition of a ""general partnership"" under the Revised Uniform Partnership (a joint venture being in essence one species of ""general partnership,"" basically formed for a specific purpose instead of a broader collaboration). Under RUPA, the law can conclude that such a partnership has been legally formed whether or not the parties intended to form it and whether or not they sought to document it in writing.<p>Thus, given the critical elements - (1) a commercial teaming and (2) an intent to share profits - one can legally form a partnership or joint venture and incur the duties of a partner or joint venturer to the other party involved, quite without intending to embrace any such legal structure. This area of law can thus easily catch a party by surprise and lead to imposition of potential surprise legal liabilities. In effect, the profit-minded goals of the parties, combined with their statements and actions in teaming to further those goals, give rise to legal duties that they owe to one another even if they never intended to embrace a formal legal relationship. The greatest of these duties is that every partner (or joint venturer) owes a fiduciary duty to every other partner (or venturer) in the partnership or joint venture. A fiduciary duty is a far stricter one than is normally represented by arms-length dealing. It is, rather, a duty to act in the highest good-faith toward one's fellow partners and includes having to act in the best interests of the partnership in relating to the venture. This axiomatically means, of course, that one cannot appropriate for one's own use and profit the subject matter of the venture and at the very least cannot do so without compensating the other partners for the value of what is being taken.<p>Here, given the procedural context of a preliminary injunction application, the court was not required to, and did not, make any ultimate findings about whether these parties had in fact formed a joint venture. However, the court ruled that TC had made a credible showing that such a venture existed, <i>not</i> generally in the broader proposed business relationship that the parties had been continually negotiating and whose terms were probably wildly unclear but rather with respect to the product development itself. In other words, with TC having delivered specs for the product, as well as having contributed money and engineering resources to further its development, and with FG having gladly accepted all this and having done so while trumpeting the joint development efforts to the world, the court said that this likely amounted to a joint venture for the product development itself and, with that product constituting an asset of the joint venture, one venturer (FG) could not simply misappropriate that asset to its own use without breaching fiduciary duties owed to its fellow venturer (TC). The court said that it amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty for FG to do this without settling up with TC as its fellow venturer by compensating TC for the value of the anticipated business opportunity associated with such jointly developed product.<p>The rest of the TC case is theoretically far from over, even with the court's dismissal of its fraud claims and the like, but is nonetheless likely dead in practical terms. It seems clear from the court's discussion that the fraud theory is far too nebulous to be sustained.<p>It takes a great deal of time and money to take a legal action to a point such as this and, a motion for preliminary injunction being, in effect, like a mini-trial, TC and FG have very spent somewhere in the six-figure range already to go through this exercise. Given that it is pretty clear that TC is chasing after windmills in terms of what it hopes to get out of this core dispute over breach of fiduciary duty concerning the product itself, it would seem that any further extension of the case case at this point would be more ego-driven anything else. One would hope that the parties would simply put it to rest with some private settlement made in light of the court's ruling.",1283132635.0

However it is supply and demand that sets wages (in the absence of a minimum) and so if you are arguing that the minimum wage sets the ""floor"" you are proposing some fairly mind boggling demand side effects.<p>Your view also defines workers and firms as adversaries with no shared interest in improving worker productivity (ability to add value).  Aside from pure manual labor (for which workers might be whipped to increase productivity and for which virtually no intellect or interest is required) all firms would benefit from improving the human capital value of their labor force.<p>Strikes are a legacy of the days when work was simply straining one's muscles against the earth or repetitively doing stitching, stamping, etc.<p>Unions, too, are a legacy of the days when you could be replaced by any willing person ready to step in and earn your wage.  Today, Unions are granted additional power (beyond the market power they would have just via collective bargaining) and they essentially impose a tax on certain firms.  I'm not anti-union... they serve an important purpose, they just shouldn't have any extra power beyond collective bargaining.  New hires shouldn't be forced to join, etc.<p>In my view, minimum wage laws have a few negative effects:<p>- they drive low wage work into the black market where there are no protections against abuses.<p>- they limit employment opportunities for those whose ability to add value is lower than minimum wage... such people become wards of the state, terminally unemployed.<p>- They make subsidized training arrangements infeasible for low end workers.<p>- They draw a sharp distinction between employed an unemployed.  It would be far more accurate to determine that a person needs $3/hour of support from the state b/c they can only reliably pull in $4 per hour. In today's world, that person is unemployed or is constantly fired after it becomes obvious that he/she is not fit for minimum wage work.",1283131212.0

The information he presented about how a flat universe could come from nothing is thought-provoking.  I would love to read further discussion about the content-- for instance, the implications of an ever-expanding universe and future societies clueless to the presence of other galaxies.  Instead, people are focusing on it as a video about atheism, which really occupies less than 1% of the video here.<p>I'm aware this lecture took place at an atheism convention, but I don't find anti-theism to be very constructive anyway.  You can be a skeptic and an atheist without making disdainful remarks about the belief system of others.  Engaging in open, respectful conversation is a better way of making people abandon religion anyway, if that's your goal.  You know what they say about flies, honey, and vinegar.<p>Regardless, there are religious scientists and cosmologists.  Being patronizing about their beliefs discourages them from contributing.

The previous animosity actually melted away rather quickly, to be replaced with the somewhat tense, but productive give and take of a core team.<p>One of the really amazing things to come out of the last couple of years is a whole slew of new committers to Rails (in addition to Carl and me): José Valim, Aaron Patterson, Xavier Noria and Santiago Pastorino. Rails 3 would still be limping along if not for these guys, who really went above and beyond the call of duty in the past few months to get things past the finish line.<p>In light of all this, I really haven’t thought much about the old Merb/Rails party lines in a while.
