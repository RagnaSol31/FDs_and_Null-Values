You'd upload photos through the service into your own Amazon S3 bucket - meaning you have 100% control over the photos. Low resolution copies (for sharing) will be stored on your CloudFront distribution.<p>--------<p>The details<p>The state of photo sharing is absolutely horrible. Most people upload photos to Facebook and I won't even go into the 1001 reasons why their photo service is abysmal. Some use Picassa or Flickr, while better than Facebook they still control the destiny of your photos. Flickr's got APIs - so that's a start but it's not trivial to get all your photos and their meta data (comments, tags, etc).<p>What I'm envisioning is a frontend for YOUR photo collection that resides in an Amazon S3 bucket you own. A good interface to upload photos, share them, and control privacy. The whole point of this is to be open and let you retain ownership of your photos.<p>Lots of potential features on the roadmap but what I described is phase I.<p>My guess is the cost would be in the $1-2 / month range + any S3 costs you'd incur yourself.
