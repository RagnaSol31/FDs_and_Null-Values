If you get traction everything else falls into place so really you should be spending all your time figuring out how to do this and then making it happen.<p>The problem is as you say, it is of course non-trivial. However, while all cases are different, I do think there are strategies and best practices that one can employ. Your next post should be about the ones you've picked up. For my part, I'm doing a book on the subject with the goal to demystify the whole process of getting traction from every angle, <a href=""http://tractionbook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tractionbook.com</a>",1268359045

For example, if I am in a coma, my wife can make medical decisions for me. If I have two wives, what if they disagree? If two people are married, must they both agree on bringing a third into the marriage? What if one person from a three person marriage wishes to leave?<p>None of these questions arise with gay marriage. The closest gay marriage comes to these problems is that it exposes the inherent sexism in child custody issues, since with two men there's not a mother involved who the court can presume is the better parent.<p>As a libertarian, in theory I favor getting the state out of the marriage business, but in practice, marriage is a useful bundle of rights and responsibilities. That is, it's a standard contract between two people. We should make it possible for larger groups to enter into agreements granting the kinds of rights that marriage grants, but there is nothing discriminatory about saying that the state provides a standard simple contract for two-person marriage but if you want more than that, you'll have to see your lawyer.",1268358530

I will gladly and willingly pay higher fares than poor people if it means increased accessibility for them to a system that, in all honesty, they need more than I do. When I walk into work 20 minutes late because the bus broke down, nobody yells at me - for people in less fortunate positions in life, it can mean getting fired. An effective transit system that is affordable, accessible, and reliable is an <i>absolute</i> requirement if you want to even <i>begin</i> fixing the poverty problem.<p>And none of this can possibly occur if we create multi-tiered transit. All you will get is super-effective transit that <i>only</i> connects wealthy areas, and a barely functional lower tier that subsists on government handouts, and can't even get poor people to work on time. It will simply become a gaping money-hole that serves no one - it will make taxes higher for you, and make transit much less effective for the poor, <i>and</i> worsen the poverty situation in your city.<p>Transit is one of those issues that is close to my heart, and one where I'm willing to tolerate a lot of imperfections, because IMHO it's bigger and more important than me, or you, or wealthy people in general.<p>Hell, even just as a simple reality check public transit has benefited me greatly - I find that tech people are paid well, and many seem to lose touch with reality ""on the ground"" after a while - I've heard some truly idiotic and insensitive words uttered by my coworkers about the homeless, for example. My nightmare is becoming yet another pretentious, arrogant upper-middle class suburbanite tech worker, and I think riding transit daily at least does <i>something</i> to keep that in check.

I'm always interested to read a regular expression implementation.<p>1. Fair enough, changed linear in X and Y to linear in X and linear in Y.<p>2. I wasn't trying to highlight the caching so much as the flushing.  The Dragon book algorithm does not cache.  It generates the entire DFA ahead of time.  This may be appropriate in a lexer but not in a grep.  Ken Thompson's Plan 9 grep, which I do link to, does the same caching, as does the tiny DFA in regexp1.html, but neither can flush.  Being able to flush the cache is the big deal, because it lets you bound the memory usage.  I changed the heading from ""Use the DFA as a cache"" to ""Be able to flush the DFA cache"".  More generally, I try pretty hard to give credit where credit is due, both in this article and in the previous two.  This is well trodden ground, and I don't think any algorithm in RE2 is original, though many are unfairly ignored.  If you know of other specific citations that are missing, please let me know.  I'm especially not trying to steal any thunder from Ken.<p>3. The entire cache is flushed and then rebuilt as needed.  I'd be surprised to see an fast implementation that can flush individual cache entries.  The cache is storing a very cross-linked graph.  If you wanted to flush an individual state, you'd have to keep all the backpointers for the arrows in the graph so that you could invalidate them when flushing that state.  It is far easier (and I bet simpler and more efficient) to flush the whole graph and start again.  But hey, it's open source.  Try it and see.<p>4. The inner loop is many many lines of code but the common path through it is a small number of instructions, due to a bunch of big if statements that rarely run.  I think you'll find that it's not too far away from 12 or 20 instructions per byte (not character).<p>Thanks again for the comments.",1268355815
