Even if it existed, you are wrong: most people actually use Western Union/Moneygram/etc. This is why they are companies worth hundreds of millions of dollars and not some footnote on a slide deck. At best, if you tried to support your side reasonably by bringing Hawala in the discussion, know that even Hawala represents a minority share of the total remittance market.

Like many others we run Jenkins to handle our build and deployment. Appengine is not perfect but we spend the majority of our time focused on delivering business logic software rather than backend / infrastructure / scaling solutions. This allows us to keep our team small and increases our revenue per employee. Our experience has been that many of the idiosyncrasies you deal when first starting with AppEngine make scaling far simpler down the track.,1406165863.0
