You can be sure that the professors at your school put some thought into the decision, and even if you disagree, it would take a lot to convince them otherwise. There are so many things to learn, that you should really just start somewhere, anyway. Even if they teach you Java, what you should be learning are programming concepts. You can then apply those any programming problem.<p>Personally, I think C would make a better choice, simply because it forces you to understand the underlying architecture, and appreciate the thinking behind the constructs of slightly higher-level languages. I'm sure I'm in the minority on that, though. Java is a decent choice, however, as it's very generic and allows you to focus on things like data structures and algorithms without necessarily having to go through that steep of a learning curve.",1283305532.0

Hiring the wrong person is hugely worse than not hiring anyone at all.<p>The easiest hire is someone with whom you've already worked and who is known to be reliable. But once you've exhausted that pool, you're with the rest of us, dealing with the 1000s of resumes from people who don't bother to read the job requirements, the dozens whose experience has at least some vague partial overlap with what you're looking for, and the handful worth interviewing. So, ""we'll just hire a large team"" can be a solution, but before it's a solution, it will be a problem.<p>Ironically, if the tasks to be done are _truly_ independent of each other, then it is easier to scale up development by hiring and working with multiple software developers: they don't have to work with each other, the code one writes has minimal interaction with the code someone else writes, and if someone isn't working out, (s)he can be fired and a replacement found without affecting the rest of the work. Or you can hire contractors for the independent tasks, that might be even easier.<p>(I personally like systems that are more integrated - I think they have a better feel and higher value than a system that's just a collection of tools -  but maybe what you're building fits well with a collection of separable tasks...)",1283305531.0

I always find it exciting to see something happen because of my code. It's very basic, like a child playing with blocks. Graphics code is especially good for this; and there's also javascript that creates a  webpage; or  simply printing something on the screen (terminal/console). Combine a few steps together, and you can have something cool, even though it's simple.<p>2. breaking tasks down is how you ""get to the point of being able to attack something"". This ""divide-and-conquer"" is crucial - absolutely crucial - throughout all computer science (and every other complex activity). This is not a skill you should expect to automatically have perfectly mastered, but it's one you already have the beginnings of and that you can practice to improve it. For a start, you could look at any task (of any kind), and ask yourself how it could be broken down into simpler steps - often, it will be obvious to you. Now, break down one of those subtasks again, and keep going until you have a task that you are 100% sure you can do. Then focus on that one task to the exclusion of the rest of it. This is difficult. Try to pretend that the original task and all the other subtasks and sub-subtasks etc don't exist; and when you have solved this one task, observe that you've made progress and congratulate yourself. Only after this little celebration of real progress should you go on to the next step.<p><pre><code>    If you want to hit a bird on the wing, you must have all your will in\n    focus, you must not be thinking about yourself, and equally, you\n    must not be thinking about your neighbor: you must be living in your\n    eye on that bird. Every achievement is a bird on the wing.\n</code></pre>\nThis might not suit your temperament, but it's <i>the</i> way to accomplish things that are too complex/overwhelming for you. Once you're encountered one kind of problem a few times (or maybe even once), it can become intuitively obvious to you, and so you won't have to break it down so far next time. You have grown!<p>But be warned: there <i>always</i> be things that are too complex for you, and that you'll have to break them down. The skill of breaking things down is essential.",1283305531.0

I'll target <= 6 for now, assuming I'm allowed by the team I hire to keep coding ;).<p>I guess I'm less concerned with technical debt and more concerned with the product debt, which is a closely related concept I haven't heard discussed much.  By product debt I mean partially-thought-through features rushed out the door that have been forgotten about.  Even if the code is perfectly-factored, the product can come across to the end user as buggy because of product debt.

The upshot is that a team of 2 does work faster than a single person.  A team of 3-4 works a bit faster still.  A team of 5-7 works slightly faster.  <i>And then teams go slower!</i><p>You get back to the same territory at around 20 developers, and after that productivity scales smoothly.  (Albeit with horrible productivity per person.)<p>This real-world data confirms and quantifies the observation made decades ago in <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i> that as a flat team grows, the overhead for communication grows as the square of the team size, while the effort available grows only linearly.  There are techniques to organize teams in a more structured way to avoid this pitfall.  But the drawback is that the necessary procedures, documentation, etc significantly reduce individual productivity.<p>Oh, and to this add the fact that any time you hire more people you have to accept a temporary drop in productivity as that new person comes up to speed.  I don't have a figure for programmers, but for general office work a month is standard.  And I'm sure from anecdotal evidence that programming is worse.  Much worse.<p>On top of this, as I'm sure you know, the more code debt you have, the slower it becomes to implement new features, and the more risk you have when you do so.  Plus you're setting the foundation for an environment that the best programmers simply will not wish to work in.  What is the cost of that?<p>There needs to be a balance.  You can't try to create pristine code.  But don't discount the costs of a poor foundation, and don't plan on being able to hire past its limitations.  That way lies disaster.",1283304275.0

Perhaps state universities once (< 80's) charged very little because they (1) got lots of money from the government with the mandate of providing affordable education and (2) students didn't have access to grants/loans to pay more anyway.<p>Now, the ""price"" is higher (which is used to create the graphs in the linked article), but the effective cost for the student hasn't increased quite as proportionally because he has a government voucher to use.<p>Greatly oversimplified, I know.  We understand what someone means when he talks about the average price of a gallon of gas at a gas station, but we don't have a common definition for the ""price"" of education.  Out of pocket not counting grants/scholarships?  Do we discount the cost if the loans are at a below-market rate because of government guarantees?<p>Heck, even the gallon of gas ""price"" is hard to define.

Specifically, in addition to it's vocational value, education is a service purchased to meet the human need for self-actualization.
