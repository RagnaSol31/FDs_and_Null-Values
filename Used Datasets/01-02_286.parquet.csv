In the overlap area of small turbines and large pistons, pistons win out significantly in HP per fuel rate. Turbines do have higher power/weight as you say though. This Wave engine's pretty different as it features centrifugal versus axial flow (ironically, the first turbines developed by the US/UK attempted centrifugal designs - the germans gave us our modern axial flow jet engines).<p>A shock contacting the metal isn't a big deal. A typical jetliner will have a standing shock on the upper surface of its wing during cruise flight, visible if the lighting is just right. With this I doubt there will be significant stresses caused by the pressure gradient because the thing is pretty much a compact and flat disk (short moment arms).",1300413479.0

If there were widgets, vidgets, and xidgets on the market, and designs for building gadgets from them on the market, then there could be lifestyle business building gadgets - and likewise for any other part of the supply chain being removed.

31,2338956,comment,2338351.0,2338351.0,0,0,btilly,,,"<i>The test culture of Ruby helps a bit...</i><p>Uh, right.  Ruby folks have no idea how little of a test culture they have.  Doesn't stop them from complimenting themselves though.  What, you say, why do I say this about Ruby?  Consider the following facts.<p>- Ruby itself has fairly bad unit tests.<p>- By default you don't run tests on gems when you install them.<p>- Many gems that have tests, have tests that only make sense on the developer's machine and can't easily be run elsewhere.<p>- There is no automated process for identifying which gems are doing a standard list of good things (have documentation, tests, clear license terms, properly identified dependencies...) and which are not.<p>- There is no easy way for someone with a spare box and an interesting environment to contribute their machine to tracking down which gems fail their tests in your environment.<p>If you're a Ruby developer, you may be saying, ""This sounds like a nice wish list, but look at everything we do...""  Stop right there.  Everything on this list, the Perl community has been doing for years.  And Perl folks are doing all of the other good things that you were going to talk about.<p>In fact the state of the art of Ruby's ""test culture"" does not even match the test culture among good Perl developers during the last millenium.  You don't believe me?  The standard CPAN client has defaulted to actually running unit tests since Perl 5 was released in the mid-90s.  And the core Perl test suite back then was much more comprehensive than Ruby's is now.<p>But there is good news.  It is easier to copy someone else's working thing than it is to write your own in the first place.  Perl got this working several years ago, and has had time to iron out the kinks.  If you are interested, feel free to copy.",1300412773.0

Isn't it really up to the reader to decide what they believe? I tend to agree with him on this one because web apps on 4.2 weren't exactly impossibly slow and unusable. The performance increases in 4.3 are nice but it doesn't really make any huge difference to someone's ability to write good web apps today. Apple could have just removed the ability to launch web apps from the home-screen entirely if they wanted to.

What Madison could not have known when designing his version of a Republic was how modern mass high speed communication would turn his plan into the exact opposite of what he intended: tyranny of a majority. His intention was to prevent factionalism from destroying the Republic as it had all previous Republics. The options for preventing factionalism had been either a tyranny to suppress the factions or creating homogeneous/fraternal society in which factions were less likely to develop. Madison took a third route, he instead encouraged factions and counted on factions to keep each other in balance. The constant struggle between factions would prevent any one faction from winning and instituting a tyranny of the majority over the minority. The minority that mattered seemed to be the rich people and their property. The majority was the poor people, who if they had power would want to take it all away. By having a representative democracy then the states would act as a buffer keeping any faction from gaining a majority. It would be difficult for any faction in one state to gain enough support in other states to create a majority capable of exploiting the minority. A fascinating and interesting plan. Completely different from Montesquieu's idea of a republic at the time in which loose confederations of small groups participated directly in their own government. The US government is purposefully architected to prevent direct public involvement in the government. Madison views the likely representatives to be lawyers who he thought would be less swayed by the masses. He wanted an aristocratic form of representation. The anti-federalists wanted citizen farmers as representatives because they were more virtuous and independent. We still see this same split today. Madison's strategy to control factions in order to prevent employing the the power of the centralized government for they tyranny of the majority may have worked in his time, but it's clearly broken for our time. State boundaries mean very little today as far as creating factions. Movements quickly and easily form on a nationwide basis in a way that Madison could never have imagined. This allows for majority factions to arise and take power, completely gutting the system that was supposed to protect the American Republic from succumbing to the same factionalism the doomed every other Republic. Clearly that has failed. So in this way the republican form of democracy embodied in the US constitution is incompatible with modern technology. It's interesting to think what factionalism preventing design strategy would be appropriate for a modern era?",1300410634.0

In a normal car, the engine drives the wheels directly which puts a lot of constraints on engine performance parameters (e.g. needs to be able to generate a lot of torque at slow speed, needs to operate over a wide RPM range, etc).  Today's engines are a compromise to meet those requirements.  If you decouple the engine from the wheels (as in some newer hybrids) and just use the engine as a generator, it can be run at its optimum RPM all the time, and does not need to be able to generate high torque.<p>So, I think it is feasible that we'll see some movement away from the 4 stroke otto cycle that is standard today, and some ideas that didnt work out in the past might work out better now.",1300410060.0
