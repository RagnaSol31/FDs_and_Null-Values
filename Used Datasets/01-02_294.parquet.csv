Let me give you one way in which it might lead to a decrease in sales, and it is up to you to give a convincing argument for why I am wrong, and for how there are other ways in which it will increase sales, thus making the investment a no-brainer.<p>People who walked into a restaurant are looking to eat. It's as simple as that. They look at a printed menu with fairly limited information, decide that an entree sounds good based on the printed ingredients and description, and order it. See, psychologically, they are already predisposed to ordering something, and they need to have a very small push over the edge to order something.<p>Now, consider what happens when you start showing a lot more information to a potential patron. Will this information make them <i>even more</i> likely to order, considering that they were likely to order already? Probably not. However, there's the potential that it might make them <i>less likely</i> to order - for example, they find out that the dish has a lot more butter than they think is healthy. Or that the meat comes from a farm whose name came up on the news recently as being a place that mistreats its cows. Or they decide that a dish, though it sounds good, doesn't look good in a photo.<p>And the counterarguments that you give to this would be ""well, it's a good thing that customers eat less butter, or they don't patronize restaurants that patronize places that mistreat cows, and those restaurants should really invest in good food photographers"". And these things might improve the world in general if everyone did them, but they aren't going to improve the restaurants' bottom line. The ""people like paper menus"" is just an excuse. The real answer is ""You are someone who's a technologist first, and a businessman second (or third, or last), and you really don't understand our business model""<p>You are definitely not that far ahead of the technology curve. You are just behind on the ""selling to a business that cares about making more money"" curve.<p>Edit: more paragraphs.<p>Edit: removed a ""not"" that changed meaning",1368841639.0

That seems to be the approach T1Vision is taking. The problem with that (at this stage) is the huge initial investment required to make that happen. Not only is the hardware cost high but it is also very challenging to integrate with existing POS systems. Not to mention changing the workflow of taking orders and getting food to tables.<p>Where my approach differs is that it is one screen in the front lobby. It would be used to draw people's attention and provide an informative experience and bypasses the challenge of  actual order taking (for now) which makes the software simpler to develop and the hardware requirement much less so the total cost is actually reasonable for smaller/independent restaurants.,1368840782.0

I have never actually seen one of these anywhere but it seems to me like a no-brainer. The idea is that you would replace the printed menu at the front of the house with an interactive touch screen application. People could browse the menu and learn more about the establishment while they wait to be seated. You can see it here: http://innerfacelabs.com/products/interactive-digital-menu/<p>I haven't been promoting it too much yet because I am still developing it but so far the feedback I've gotten is  ""we think our customers prefer the simplicity of printed menus"". I find this feedback valuable because it shows me what the market sentiment is but at the same time I believe it is wrong. Yes, there may be some people that are intimidated by this kind of technology but I also think that attitude is fading with older generations. There are so many more advantages of a software vs printed menu like sorting, filtering by ingredients, images, video, nutrition information, etc. Younger generations will grow up expecting this type of interaction that their grandparents are resisting.<p>So my question is: am I in denial that this type of product is beneficial or am I just so far ahead of the technology curve that the real challenge for this type of product is a general fear of technology?",1368839309.0
