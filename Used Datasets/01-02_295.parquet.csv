Alan Mulally was a brilliant engineer and manager at Boeing ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Mulally"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Mulally</a> ). He was recruited to come in and essentially fix Ford. He doesn't need to work. He is already a multimillionaire from working at Boeing. The reason management is well paid is because you need a way to motivate the very small group of managers that are qualified for the job. If you are worth millions - why would you ever take a job that pays one dollar a year and makes the entire world hate you? Well because if they do pull this off - the stock will recover and everyone will make a lot of money. And management could be credited with saving the industry. I know this is hard to imagine but every executive manager I have known worries about their employees and how their decisions effect the community and world they live in.<p>I've known a number of engineers who have been laid off, including myself and it almost always comes out as a huge improvement to the individual. Anytime you leave a failing company and enter a company which is hiring it's likely to be a big big improvement.<p>The real question, assuming it's unavoidable with a democratic congress and president incoming, is how do we make sure the US tax payer doesn't get screwed. We shouldn't be giving ANYTHING away. I agree with you there.<p>I've worked for a number of big businesses and know some upper management personally. I've also worked two union jobs and come from a town that was/is mostly union labor. I can tell you that the unions of today that I saw are corrupt. Management is rarely corrupt - but since managers have greater influence it gets far more media attention. I don't know and can't think of the last time I've heard anyone that I respect say anything positive about unions. This is coming from someone who lived within 20 miles of a Chrysler plant for the majority of my life. The responsibility to fix the current situation lies with management. The blame lies with unions and the management of the past.<p><i>The efficiency and good work of American labor has never been in doubt.</i><p>Unfortunately this is in doubt. Unions do not recognize efficiency or good work. I agree most employers recognize this, but Unions prevent it. Ask any above average teacher, police officer or UPS employee.<p>(And for the record - yes this is entirely my opinion - I don't claim otherwise.

There are many biz that work if only 10% of the population has broadband, as long as it's the right 10%.<p>> Whereas I'm talking about the qualitative difference between even a large percentage of the population having some degree of access and 100% of competent adults having at least a minimal level of access.<p>You're assuming that the 10% who don't have broadband access would be a significant difference to an interesting fraction of biz.  That's unlikely.  Heck - it's unlikely that the 30% who have access but choose not to particpate would make a difference.  (If someone is unwilling to spend $30/month on broadband, how much money do you think that they'll spend if they had broadband for less?)<p>> Obama is not the only politician pushing for universal access<p>That's not exactly an argument that suggests confidence.  After all, these are the same folks who thought that 0 down mortgages were a good idea.<p>> if local governments could act with confidence that moving basic tasks like title transactions, judicial proceedings, public records, etc. to a completely electronic format would not create a vast set of support issues coming from the 8% or so of people who have no access; they could streamline operations and save taxpayer money.<p>You're significantly overstating the number of transactions.<p>I use such services about once/year but that's only because I'm somewhat of a nut about verifying that my property tax was properly credited - the vast majority of people don't bother.  Not many people have ""judicial"" proceedings to observe and most of them are served by lawyers.  As far as the rest, how often do you check that your house/car title is correct?  (I've never checked either one.)<p>Yearly car registration payment is about the only common transaction that can be done online but it only costs about $1-3 to do by USPS.  (Shipping stickers costs about the same but the reasons for having such stickers are not affected by on-line payment.)  Even if payment costs were free online, that ""savings"" doesn't buy much infrastructure.  It can be done by dial-up and a significant number of people already do it online, so the generous assumption is that at most 30% of the population could be moved to use on-line registration and they don't have that many cars.<p>And then there's the ""I didn't get the e-mail telling me to renew my license"" problem....",1228872226.0

In fact, I emphasized the important difference between can't and what translates to ""shouldn't"" in most circumstances.<p>2) I apologize if i was vague. I was trying to be concise.  The nature of a ""Type"" is not a fixed thing.  Some languages are said to be strongly-typed, some are said to be weakly-typed. Some languages are type-safe, others are not. If we were to simply draw a line and suggest that one end approaches absolute Typeness and the other approaches absolute untypeness, then sufficiently typed were to mean the lowest point along this line that supports the goal.  In this instance, we are talking about re-factoring.  So, you may say that my argument sounds circular: ""refactoring is easy when you use a language in which refactoring is easy."" However, the important point that I am making is that  ruby's amount and implementation of Type is what facilitates its ease of refactoring.  In particular, I have found its features of reflection, its implementation of polymorphism (""duck typing""), and its hooks into the Type system (look at Object, Module, Class and Method for more info) to be particularly helpful.  Also, because there is not <i>too much</i> typedness, we don't have to worry about sending data of a new/different type to a function as long as it satisfies the assumptions that the function makes about it (which can be inferred by a number of techniques.) Delegator and Forwardable are also pretty nifty.  One of the least appreciated tricks is calling .dup on an instannce of Class (that is, an object that represents a class definition, not an instance of a class,) but thankfully it is rarely necessary. -- You need to use it when you want to a) inherit from Foo and still b) have 'super' refer to the implementation in Foo's parent class.<p>3) I suppose the above might give some clues into my favorite debugging techniques. If you'd like me to go further in depth, contact me via email, my name @gmail.com I didn't think the details were salient to this discussion.<p>Edit: c++ makes some of the worst decisions wrt supporting the notion of Type, in syntax and in features.  That being said, Bjarn is still one of my favorite authors and learning C++ was a great entre into OO for me.",1228871723.0
