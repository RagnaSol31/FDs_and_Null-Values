All lenses will have astigmatic aberration and vignetting at the edge of their image circle (which is normally outside the photographic media the image is being projected onto).<p>This lens is uncoated and highly susceptible to lens flare.  As I understand it, many lenses before the 4-element Zeiss Tessar also tend to have more pronounced flare than later lens formulas.  You can really see this in some of the photos.<p>Overall, it's neat little lens and I would shoot it in a heartbeat.  It looks very sharp in the center with gentle fall-off near the edges.  The owner could go a long way to get the most out of it by crafting a little lens hood for it -- it really helps with older lenses like this.",1284861511.0

4,1705404,comment,1705221.0,1705221.0,0,0,mgkimsal,,,"Was reading pg's comments about single founders:<p>""What's wrong with having one founder? To start with, it's a vote of no confidence. It probably means the founder couldn't talk any of his friends into starting the company with him. That's pretty alarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best.""<p>Someone else mentioned it on this thread, but I'll expound.  The majority of good solid people who are <i>capable</i> of being 'co-founders' of something are likely already doing it.  'Capable' has many dimensions - financial stability, personal drive, motivation, risk tolerance, etc.  This notion of 'get your friends to join you' is extremely narrow, and while this may be how life in the Valley is, I can assure you it's not like that in most of the country where the rest of us live.<p>Also: ""And you learn a lot more about yourself and your limits.""  That's right.  One of the things that happens with 'co-founder' situations is that you're both learning about yourselves <i>and</i> each other at the same time.  Taking on a 'co-founder' who's ""good with sales"" - unless there's a demonstrable (and ideally <i>long</i>) track record is essentially a <i>huge</i> gamble, as both of you are making a guess about someone's ability.  Personally, I tend to discount anyone's self-estimate about their own ability - show me the track record.<p>As for the other comment about 'only being able to do so much on your own' - that's what hiring other people is all about.  I understand there's not always money up front to do that.  But I'd say you'll be in a much better position to contract out the bits you can't do, either at a reduced rate or some sort of time-limited profit sharing, but in no way just bring someone on as a 'co-founder'.  If they are truly starting at the beginning, that's different, but bringing someone on after you've done much of the hard work - nope.  Yes, you might not be able to find quality talent, but you couldn't find it in the beginning anyway.<p>My own view is I'd be much more likely to want to work with someone after they've demonstrated the ability to do something on their own which produces revenue (or something insanely innovative from a technology viewpoint that I grok instantly and see a distinct vision for, but that's not crossed my path yet).  If you've got 'a cool idea', and want me to come on board as a 'co-founder' and do all the hard tech work, and you've never sold anything to anyone, and want to veto every suggestion I have, we're not co-founders - you're looking for hired help.  And that's fine, but the hired help need to be paid.<p>I've been approached numerous times over the past few years about coming on as a 'technical cofounder'.  Only once did someone even have a proof of concept put together that was demonstrating the idea in rough form (including a revenue stream, however meager it was).  In all other cases, the execution onus is entirely on me, and in every case, there were some rather odd directions people wanted to move in.  When questioned, in every case the 'founder' (who hadn't done anything except float an idea by people) was adamant that the vision was great and couldn't be changed.  And without me (or someone) it couldn't be executed, but that point seemed to be lost.  It seemed people I was talking to would generally rather have 100% control of an idea rather than, say, 80% control over an actual working service/product.  Maybe my experiences are radically different from others who get approached about being 'co-founders'?<p>Short view - I agree with the notion of 'DIY' as far as you can as a single founder in your enterprise before you start looking for help.  With the luxury of some initial success behind you, you'll be in a much better bargaining position when bringing help on board in whatever capacity (paid, equity, etc).",1284861438.0

These are the worst sort of problems to recognize because their cost doesn't manifest directly (merchants steal money) but in various costs incurred to prevent it.<p>-  Consumers are picky about who they give their cc to online. They sometimes buy from second best sources due to these concerns. This also favours the established players at the expense of innovation.<p>-  Banks/CC companies always favour consumers and always chargeback merchants for alleged fraud. This means merchants are careful who they sell to. They spend resources vetting clients (I had a client that sold phones who called every client to confirm orders -  this is not abnormal). They don't sell to marginal customers (the margin is often 'outside the country'). This hurts merchants and consumers.<p>-  Banks/CC companies spend lots of resources dealing with & preventing fraud.

You want to produce a low end and a high end chip - because that's what the market is eating up.  It's cheaper to have one fabrication process rather than two.... and suddenly, instead of busted, inferior chips being sold as lower end chips, we have the same chips in the same market niche, with the possibility of a simple software update to enable the high end features.

There were bubbles that popped in finance and construction. This should produce a surplus of labour in these areas that needs to be absorbed.<p>I'm not an expert, but I don't think that a structural unemployment explanation is necessarily incompatible with with Keynes. Keynes talks about sticky prices disrupting the classical economic reallocation of resources. This would make sense especially for labour. If you need to go from an 80k job in finance to a 40k job in retail, you would probably be very reluctant and meanwhile be unemployed.

Since most of my friends went to big-name jobs right after graduation, nobody was particularly keen on starting up.<p>I hit up all the networking events - barcamps, startup events, and other miscellaneous meetups. I met a lot of people, offered to buy them beer in exchange for hearing out my idea, and made some great friends. The people who were capable and experienced were already in a job, or a startup of their own. The ones who were interested to join me were ready to do it part-time and half heartedly. The two people who were enamored by the idea and wanted in couldn't code for nuts.<p>Two months later, I am still single, two weeks away from launch, and things are going great. I have some unconventional little discoveries by my tiny amount of experience:<p>1. Go somewhere you'll be surrounded by people. I went back to college and have friends all around. In the event that I get bored or need to take a break, a coffee break with five people is just a phone call away.<p>2. I realized that it's hard to stay fully motivated through the entire thing. Talk to your friends and family about it and tell them it'll take their help. My parents were extremely helpful, and my mother patiently used to listen to my ideas, even though she couldn't really understand what an alpha release is.<p>I actually found some minor advantages of being a single founder. For instance - you get the flexibility to travel around and relocate if you want. But the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages.<p>In programmerspeak - I felt being a single founder instead of having a co-founder is somewhat like writing a web application in C++ instead of Rails.

I haven't read much of it yet, but I'm glad I didn't buy it sight unseen.  It's an understatement to say does not meet the expectations I had for it.  Perhaps one could develop a good course around it, and I'm sure there are good things an experienced coder could gleam from it, but as a standalone text for a beginner I think it would do more damage than good.<p>I thought at first that the code samples he was giving were examples of ""what not to do"", and then was astonished to find him defending them in the text.  From page 36, after some horrendous code for Atom_int() page 35:<p>""When the conversion is done, s points to the desired string, and this string has &str[43] - s characters.  str has 43 characters, which is enough to hold the decimal representation of any integer on any conceivable machine.  Suppose, for instance, that longs are 128 bits.  The string representation of any 128-bit signed integer in octal - base 8 - fits in 128/3 + 1 = 43 characters.  The decimal representation can take no more digits than the octal representation, so 43 characters are enough.<p>The 43 in the definition of str is an example of a 'magic number,' and it's usually better style to define a symbolic name for such values to ensure that the same value is used everywhere.  Here, however, the value appears only once, and sizeof is used whenever the value is used.  Defining a symbolic name might make the code easier to read, but it will also make the code longer and clutter the name space.  In this book, a symbolic name is defined only when the value appears more than once, or when it is part of an interface.""<p>I'm glad to see his priorities presented in such a clear manner.  If you feel that your current code is too readable at the expense of ""name space clutter"", this might be a good book for you.  But otherwise, just say no!<p>ps.

Let's say a biotech stock fails its FDA panel and drops like a rock, its fair-value suddenly drops from $8 to $2; your 100 limit buy orders at $6 suddenly gets hit and you'll have to sell them at $2/share.<p>> Some other graphs have perfectly innocuous explanations - for example someone probing the depth of the book or filling a big order piece-by-piece.<p>You probe the depth of the book by building the book not by submitting out of the money orders. You sell block order periodically over a day or days via VWAP by not revealing your true order size. Submitting a bunch of limit buy orders at once even if they are out of money, especially under the same MPID will reveal your hand and the size of the buy/sell interest.<p>> FWIW, you can't really pull a serious DoS against most exchanges. Most decent ones have pretty strict rolling-window rate limits.<p>The point is not DoS against exchange but to make your competitors process messages slower than you do. They can still process messages 15ms at a time, but you could do it at 10ms. In this game where everyone's colo'd to the exchange and have the same arbitrage algo, having a 5ft. cable to the exchange trading server vs. a 7ft. cable is a competitive advantage. The same case is with slowing your opponents' message processing rate down by 5ms.",1284858628.0
