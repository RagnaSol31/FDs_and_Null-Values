While select few (myself occasionally included) will always seek old-fashioned simplicity, not only is that rarely the overall trend but it almost never applies to information-age hardware. I like having stupid-simple hand and power tools, for example, but you will rarely catch me asking to have features removed from my computer. I suspect this is tied to the fact that actual physical tools have <i>one job</i> and one job only, whereas a computer/phone/etc is a multi-tool.<p>There <i>is</i> the netbook trend, and that whole minimalist trend might hit cell phones some time.

By simply doing what we do we keep making other groups in the company look horrible.  I don't think we're all-stars, but in big corporations it seems that just doing your job with a results minded attitude easily sets you above the rest.<p>Also, don't think we anti-process :)  I'm a stickler for SCM and testing, but we operate in an agile manner.  Most projects start out with a 'hey, this would be cool' and then we iterate based on user feedback.  Early on code changes can roll out daily, while the new process wants us to bundle our code and hand it to a 'deployment team' who might take 2 weeks to get around to deploying.  How this is acceptable is beyond my comprehension, but it might explain why other groups never seem to deliver anything (or put 6 months on any timeline).<p>I told my boss today that if this goes through that it will likely destroy what makes us so successful and he agreed.

However, it's very usable and we already have a few thousand users who discovered our product themselves or via some selective tweeting. We're getting good feedback from them, which is helping us prioritize things we already know we wanted to do. We're putting off promoting the product in favor of improving what we have and adding those features. It's helping build quality and scale, which are both great.<p>What I don't have a good feel for, though, is when to really start marketing this thing. There will always be bugs to fix, more features to implement and scaling issues to worry about, so ""when you're feature complete"" isn't a good answer.<p>I suspect the right answer has something to do with being happy with quality and confident in the ability to scale, but I can't really define what the criteria must be.

Frankly, I'm inclined to be awfully conservative about the stock market at present.  If you told me we were going backwards 5 years in technology and there'd be way less money made on the stock market, I'd probably be ok with it, for a few reasons.<p>1) Frankly, I'd rather be conservative on cutting edge approaches to stock pricing for a little bit.<p>2) To my mind, the stock market doesn't exist to enrich participants, it exists to efficiently distribute capital.  Enriching participants is good motivation, but it shouldn't be legalized gambling and game playing.  If an unreasonable share of that capital is going to the console cowboys rather than being distributed to companies and investors (not traders), then something's wrong there.  I'm not sure if we're at that point but I don't like the trend.<p>3)  As I said upthread, I don't understand the gains for the economy as a whole of smoothing out the price curve in the sub-second range.  I really don't.  Anybody who's going to spend a lot of money on something takes more than a second to make up their mind, right?  They probably had to get it budgeted and everything.  So the subsecond trading on, say, commodities seems to me to be at the expense of actual purchasers of commodities.  The gains have to come from somewhere, right?<p>In general, I'd settle for slower, dumber and less profitable day traders if the upshot is less risk to the system, greater portions of investment gains going to grandma and a more deliberately moving stock market.

Block them.<p>Let me give you some anecdotal background story...<p>I realized this was happening to me a few months ago - that I was wasting more and more time just surfing Facebook or Twitter and so forth. So I started adding websites to my /etc/hosts file. (That is, my computer now blocks me from accessing these websites, unless I edit a file, and then restart).<p>It started with Reddit - one day I read an article on Reddit that said something along the lines of ""How many of you are intelligent, but waste a ton of time on the Internet?"". It struck me that I was one of those people - that my potential was dwindling away because I was wasting tons of time on Reddit rather than getting interesting things done.<p>I blocked Reddit a bit later, figuring I might unblock it given time, but I never have. After the first day or two, the instinct to open up a Reddit tab just died. I still feel an attachment to the community, and I feel kind of bad that I left, but I don't feel that I was addicted like people get addicted to drugs or so forth.<p>Later on, I blocked some other sites that I frequent, including Facebook. I even blocked HN for a while, but I realized that I wasn't wasting nearly as much time on here as the other sites, for some reason. Perhaps it's because the rate of change of articles is small. Plus, HN has noprocrast settings, which are great. Anyway, I digress. Sure, there are disadvantages, but the advantages, and the savings in time, are huge. I know a lot of people say they don't want to leave FB because they'll lose contact with people. 2 responses: One, my last FB status says to contact me on gmail - so if anyone really wants to get in touch with me, they know how. Two, it's only blocked on my computer, so if I really want to take the effort, I can hike over to a library computer or something and respond to people.<p>Now, the point to this comment is to convince you that you have to block these websites too.<p>There are two things that I would want to tell myself in order convince myself that I needed to go through with it.<p>1. The reason I didn't want to do it - and didn't do it, for a long time - is because I always thought that I should just have enough will power to stop doing it. If you believe this, remind yourself that even though you believe this to be true, you keep coming back to Facebook every few hours or days. Why is that? It's because even if you have enough willpower 90% or 98% of the time, that small fraction when you don't is enough to open  a tab to FB, but once you open a tab, you could end up wasting an hour.<p>2. You become more aware of how you spend your time, and you become more productive, after you stop wasting it. I used to dump hours into just surfing the web. Now I'm quite sensitive to how much time I spend, which is advantageous. Plus, most of the sites that I visit (like HN) require constant focus, so you can't really get into that vaguely unfocused mindset that allows you to waste tons of time on things like Facebook.<p>In short - you said that it had to stop now. I challenge you to follow up on it :) Blocking FB, etc, was an awesome choice on my part. I think it will be for you as well.",1279761482.0
