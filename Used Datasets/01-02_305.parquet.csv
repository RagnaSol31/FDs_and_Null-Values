Properly support those that have developed a dependency and move away from the nanny state. Harm reduction should be the overarching aim.<p>While I agree with decriminalization to a reasonable extent, I think you are severely underestimating the crippling effect being dependent on a foreign substance can be on relationships, society, and the individual. Simply changing the legislation is part of a broader comprehensive solution. A cultural change needs to be part of any comprehensive solution to substance use and abuse.<p>A cultural change is also needed so members of society can enjoy moderate use, without leading to abuse, of substances.
