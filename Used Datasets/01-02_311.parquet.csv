41,4415689,comment,4398688.0,4399156.0,1,0,nilium,,,"I'm in roughly the same camp as you here. I depend quite a bit on things generally working in a Unix-y sort of way. Not necessarily everything, but POSIX compliance is pretty important for me, since it means I can rely on a wealth of software that's already been made, in particular for command line use. Time Machine, disk encryption, and the applications already available for OS X are excellent as well.<p>Font rendering is also an important point of OS X for me. Generally speaking -- qua someone judging the OS based on whether I like looking at it every day -- Mac OS has the best font rendering. This in turn makes it much easier to stare at code, a terminal emulator, and many other tons of text all day. This is even better with the HDPI display on the recent Macbook Pros, which makes the screen really comfortable to use.<p>One of the biggest point for me is that Mac OS comes with bash and a terminal emulator. The flexibility that a shell on BSD, Linux, etc. offers me is far beyond what I could do with the Windows console back when I still used Windows as my primary OS. This is also somewhat more important on Mac OS, as Finder, the file manager (for those who don't know it), is absolute garbage. Windows still has the best graphical file manager I've seen, but I preferred to get around in the shell, so the Windows console was always inadequate.<p>That's probably changed a lot since then, especially with the advent of Powershell, but I'm still not convinced that Windows is any good for someone who relies heavily on a shell. Piping output into other programs and treating them as little functions to build up bigger things has saved my ass a lot. It's saved me often enough that I don't want to end up on a system that has a passable shell but lacks all the tools at my disposal on Mac OS or Linux. As such, I'm pretty committed to any OS that offers that same level of flexibility, and I've never gotten the impression that Windows could give me that.<p>Additionally, I also love Apple's APIs, at least Cocoa. The older C APIs are far less friendly, but they work and offer some very powerful tools as well. So, working in Objective-C (or MacRuby) is the way to go for me for a lot of personal projects. This is largely the only thing that keeps me on Mac OS now aside from it simply having all the software I know well.<p>All that said, it's troubling how much harder it's become to use all of my tools as I'd like. For example, in Mac OS 10.8, the ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist file, used to set environment variables in applications launched via Finder and such, was deprecated. I can work around this by editing a system file, but it's not a good fix, and I imagine it's only going to get worse. So far as I know, that sort of thing wouldn't happen on Linux, and is largely a result of Apple locking down large chunks of the OS, I think.<p>So, yeah, Mac OS for me, but only for as long as Objective-C remains mostly unusable on other platforms. That may be a long time, though, so I'm probably in this for the long haul. Either way, for the majority of the work I do -- mainly writing articles and software for my own use -- Mac OS is my preference.",1345599650.0

I make no claims about whether or not it is a good business idea, or how people will actually play, but a quick and incomplete theoretical analysis follows.<p>First, some simplifications:\n* an infinite number of players\n* everyone agrees on the ordering (quality, utility, etc) of shirts\n* only look for symmetric equilibria (where everyone plays the same strategy)<p>Some notation:<p>Let there be N shirts (N=5 for this application).  Order the shirts by their utility (that everyone agrees on).  x1 < x2 < ... < xN.  Let the utility from the bonus shirt be z, where z > xN.<p>The most simple strategy is for everyone to randomize and put equal probability on each shirt.  If everyone plays according to that strategy, then the expected payoff for any given player is avg(x1, ... , xN) + z/N.  But this can't be a Nash equilibrium because an individual player could deviate and choose xN with probability 1 and get payoff xN + z/N.<p>The (maybe not the only) Nash equilibrium is probabilities p1, p2, ..., pN such that sum(p1, p2, ..., pN)=1 and x1+p1z = x2+p2z = ... = xN+pNz.  These probabilities make a player indifferent between choosing each shirt with certainty.<p>I haven't spent the time to see if there is a nice formula for the probabilities, but for the case of N=2, you get<p>p1=(x2-x1+z)/2z and p2=1-(x2-x1+z)/2z<p>This doesn't take into account that people have different tastes, or the sequential information that the star creates.

107,4415621,comment,4413569.0,4414800.0,7,0,rdl,,,"In a company which is post accelerator and has raised $1-2mm, without being an absurd success or abject failure, I value equity for employees using a valuation of 0.5-0.75x the cap on convertible debt if you were to issue the debt right now.  I have no idea how to handle this at Series A or beyond; a bridge I will burn when I come to it.  You may adjust this based on whether you view investor money as particularly cheap (which varies by segment), how long since you raised, etc.  The main thing is it should be consistent across employees at a given time.<p>(So, e.g., a $10mm cap note company which has raised $2mm would treat each 1% of employee equity as $50-$75k.  So giving up $25k in cash salary should get you, as a 4 year grant, 2% to 1.3% equity.  That is in line with the 0.5-1% for a seed stage 5-7y experience strong individual contributor equity, which is a slightly low amount; generally I've seen 0.1-0.25% for 3-5y experience Series A hires, on say a $20-30mm valuation, which also is in line with this.)<p>The annoying thing is a company wants to discount equity to employees at 0.5-0.75x.  Engineers often discount it to 0.1, especially people who have been burned in the past (90% of people in the first bubble, ex-Zynga people, etc.  If you're negotiating with someone who irrationally discounts equity, just pay him more cash and pocket the difference).<p>A Google SSE or Staff Eng is about $200-225k on the market (total comp), a 3-5 year guy is more like 125-150k, and a very junior person is 75-100k.  You can allocate that among perks, equity, bonus, %, and base in various ways.<p>There is basically no way to use just above-market salary to hire good people, but lack of market salary can get people to rule you out.  I've worked at companies where ~everyone got $150k cash + strong equity (0.25-1%), and it ended up just being mercenary people who worked there and remained, due to other defects in corporate culture.  (I've also worked in a 200-500k cash-comp-only environment, and the quality of people was inferior to any startup I've ever seen.)<p>You can probably get people to sacrifice 0-25% of total comp (and maybe up to 50% for short periods of time, like 3-6mo until financing).  They are only willing to do that if they think it is ""fair"", which means they have good odds of doing well on the deal, and others in the company, particularly founders, make similar sacrifices.  If a founder is paying himself $150k/yr, and is trying to negotiate a $225k Staff Engineer hire to take $50k cash + $50k equity, you'll probably only get the most self-sacrificing and useless person to join.  If a founder is paying himself $30k and is trying to get a $225k SE to take $70k/yr until Series A (6mo), then $120k, plus $50k of equity, and some other perks (""not being at Google of 2012"" seems like a serious perk for a lot of the people I've talked to), you'd have a shot.<p>The best way to allocate equity that I've seen was the 'allocate by cohort' strategy (I forget who proposed this...maybe hn user joshu?  or suster or feld or someone).  Basically all of your hires at seed stage get x%. All of your hires from Series A to Series B get x% also.  But your first pool is split across 5 people, and your second pool is split across 25 people.  It is way easier for me to understand the relative importance of the 5 people hired during seed stage vs. figuring out their time/risk weighted importance in a company all the way to IPO.",1345597573.0
