Really?<p>YES:<p>It's not the time saved while <i>writing</i> the code that matters here -- although I do believe it adds up quickly if you work on a project that might occupy you for months or years and have invested the initial week of getting fully into CoffeeScript mode.<p>NO, it's the time saved <i>reading</i> your code time and again as you revisit your code-base over these months or years of refining your project going forward.<p>CoffeeScript's ""easier writability"" may be debatable, but it's its ""easier readability"" where it really shines. I can glance quickly at my way-fewer-lines of CoffeeScript and parse it much more smoothly than I ever could a curly C-style language. Maybe it's because I first started out in, boohoo, BASIC. But indented lines with no superfluous { syntax; decorators } just flow into my brain much faster.<p>If you're a fire-and-forget coder who writes line after faultless bugless line that you never need to revisit, review or simply recall and still get a meaningful composition of a program, app or site that isn't just a house of cards built on quick-sand or a simple batch job at the end of the day -- I envy you! In my case, 99% of my classes and functions are an API to each other. So I look up how the stuff I wrote days, weeks or months ago was supposed to be called or initialized constantly. I read my code more often than I write it.<p>I like writing CoffeeScript but what matters is -- I love reading it. Before, I liked writing JavaScript -- but I hated reading it.",1309744720.0

Lets walk through it.<p><a href=""http://www.mywebsite.com/api/getAllPageNames/returnType/JSON"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mywebsite.com/api/getAllPageNames/returnType/JSON</a><p>In this string 'get' appears once. However, as an experienced dev, you know that this is a GET request. To you it looks redundant. However to someone trying to understand what will happen when they hit enter with this URL in their location bar it is meaningful.<p>The question at that point is naturally ""But if you don't know that's a GET request then why are you using an API?""<p>This is the point I'm driving at. There are scores of underserved individuals who want to do interesting things with your website that go beyond your GUI, and they are just brave enough to read through your API docs.<p>Now, when I'm thinking about API design I have a big initial choice. Is this API for skilled developers who care about the REST spec? Or is this a tool for as many people as possible to get more out of my service than I have time to accommodate with features. This is where I will always say ""I don't care about the spec."" A really talented dev will read the docs, discover how my design works, and will write something cool on top of it. I can trust the hackers I know to make things work by hook or by crook. The same cannot be said for someone who really wants to extend my functionality but isn't a talented developer.<p>I feel it's my responsibility to produce a tool that can be used by as many people as possible. I don't want to make a high-end professional camera, I want to make a better point and shoot. I want to extend the abilities of people, not demand they gain a large skillset to use my new tool.<p>New programmers and enthusiastic users are always on my mind. These are the people who's preconceptions are that it should 'just work' and that if it doesn't it's my fault.<p>This is why I applaud decisions like Chrome dropping <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a>\nIt simply doesn't matter to 99% of the users of the product, and in fact makes browsers less friendly and more confusing.<p>If I can get my api to work like this, then I will:<p>'I want to see all the names of pages on mywebsite.com'<p>If I had access to a deterministic natural language parser then I'd use it. As such a thing doesn't yet exist, I try to remain as true to that ideal as possible.<p>The REST architecture may be less confusing than others, but it is far from simple.",1309744605.0

But that shouldn't be confused with whether semicolons affect your ability to think about code. Really I can't imagine how someone could be significantly distracted by semicolons, once they're used to a language, to the extent that it occupies their conscious brain in any way whatsoever.

It isn't in my observation. It certainly offers more flexibility in style, but why would you need it? I can't conceive of a reason besides minification.<p>Your comparison with novels I think is a bit skewed. Literature has a whole different set of readability enhancements such as fully justified text, variable-width fonts, as well as margins and padding. Punctuation in English has been evolving for centuries as people settle on the minimum needed to convey the full meaning as unambiguously as possible.
