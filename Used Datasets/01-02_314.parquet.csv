I will see if I have some extra time to file a report.<p>Slightly off topic (but relevant to my comment above), do you know why this:<p><pre><code>    func TraverseInline() {\n      var ints := make([]int, N)\n      for i := range ints {\n        sum += i\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nshould be slower than:<p><pre><code>    func TraverseArray(ints []int) int {\n      sum := 0\n      for i := range ints {\n        sum += i\n      }\n      return sum\n    }\n\n    func TraverseWithFunc() {\n      var ints := make([]int, N)\n      sum := TraverseArray(ints)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSeeing a huge difference here. With an array of 300000000 ints, TraverseInline() takes about 750ms, whereas TraverseWithFunc() takes 394ms. With gccgo (GCC 4.7.1), the different is much slighter, but there's still a difference: 196ms compared to 172ms. (These are best-case figures, I'm doing lots of loops.)

Explain what makes conclists so interesting from a parallelizing perspective. Take-away lesson: Conc lists; how anything with accumulators is not practically parallelizable, and that conslists are thus not that great, at least for parallelization purposes.<p>* Scala: turn hello world into a .par() list of characters then print those. Explain how at least in theory the output will be ""Hello, World!"" but with the string jumbled up non-deterministically. Take-away lesson: Parallelism can be that simple.<p>* ObjC or smalltalk: A random messagesend with colons in the method name to highlight this creative and somewhat unique way of providing named parameters. Take-away lesson: Sometimes weird design choices lead to elegant solutions.<p>* Javascript: Do something pretty profound using no actual alphanums anywhere - just wonky symbols.

Use deny-all with whitelists, not allow-all with blacklists.<p>.... but that's where I'm kind of stranded.
