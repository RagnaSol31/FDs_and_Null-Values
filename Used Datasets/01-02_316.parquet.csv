1,7861021,comment,7860917.0,7860917.0,5,0,aylons,,,"&quot;Mr Musk has said in the past that Space X does not patent its technologies for fear that they could be stolen by competitors.&quot;<p>The USA has forgot it, but this is why we have patents: to stimulate people (and companies) to publicize their technology instead of hiding. The most important function of patents is avoiding science and tech secrets.<p>This is why patents on functionality rather than methods (as are most software patents) are bogus. A patent for &quot;recognize a phone number in a text field&quot; is useless for society because it does not tell us how to accomplish that, just what need to be accomplished.<p>One should be able to patent a specific way of building a lamp. This way, it will not be worth to keep it a secret, as the legal protection is more secure than obscurity. OTOH, Patenting the concept of &quot;a device which illuminates a room with electricity&quot; should not be acceptable.<p>This comment from Musk shows that the patent system in broken both ways: it prevents what should be stimulated (creating new science and tech, even for the same applications) and stimulates what should be prevented (tech secrecy).",1402106385.0

Execution port saturation (the example in the article) is one. Another one is where additional computation in-register is faster than simply loading a register with a new value (i.e. computation is faster than access). There is also instruction fusion, where a pair of assembly operations commonly used together are fused into a one, single-cycle operation inside the CPU. Optimization on modern micro-architectures has a lot of complex and sometimes counterintuitive rules but you can often squeeze substantial performance gains out of them if you know what you are doing.<p>One caveat to be aware of in the article&",

I would have thought nature would stop optimizing once a sting is a good enough deterrent. It is as if someone said, no, I would optimize the crap out of this chemical weapon.<p>I have always been intrigued by how much does the effect generalize across the victim species. Consider tarantula wasps, their sting take pain and suffering to new heights (for humans). But really what the wasps use it for, primarily, is to temporarily immobilize a tarantula so that it can lay eggs on it. The hatchlings end up eating the tarantula. If temporary immobilization is the main use case (surely not the only use case), must it be this painful. Is the tarantula in as much pain and if so what purpose is that serving ?
