They will also be able to appear to need very little time when they get to each table.<p>The trick of course is just to play each player against another. The magician acts as a proxy and makes the moves of one player against another. Of course it takes a little practice at memorisation but magicians are often practised at mnemonics anyway.,1416794330.0

Objects are copied if they are modified in a function.<p>* Function arguments are lazy evaluated.<p>* Watch out for automatic factor conversion when importing data. R will display your string data as text, but behind the scenes it will treat it as an integer.<p>* R is slow. Really, really slow. All your intensive calculations should be handled by libraries written in C, Fortran or some other compiled language. Your R code should be mostly for glueing things together.",1416791187.0
