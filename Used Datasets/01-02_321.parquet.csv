You can read the whole paper here: <a href=""http://www.box.net/shared/fsiv1bu7ugrpp814aucx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.box.net/shared/fsiv1bu7ugrpp814aucx</a><p>Google's Strategy:<p>Google has indicated that it will not collect an interchange fee on transactions made through Google Wallet which shows that it has its eye squarely focused on the Payment Context. Google understands it stands to gain very little from the current revenue and expense sharing arrangements in place today for traditional payments. Google expects to employ a strategy similar to where they made Android a compelling better than free option to handset makers by offering to share a portion of search-based advertising revenues generated through the Android ecosystem.<p>Google also plans to lease space on its wallet solution to banks for free, compared to ISIS who will charge a rental fee. Google however has not made clear as to whether it plans on controlling the secure element outside of Nexus S, on handsets that run Android, despite not being in direct ownership of the master keys.<p>Challenges to GW:<p>Google Wallet's secure element resides on the handset, which is different from Carrier led mobile wallet initiatives(e.g. ISIS). Google Wallet is designed to be interoperable, so as to attract more partners, but so far its olive branch has not been met with reciprocal affection from other players in the payment ecosystem. If ISIS Carriers (Verizon, T-Mobile & AT&T) mandate that any and all mobile wallets must work through ISIS to function on their carrier networks, Google may be forced to modify Google Wallet so as to work with a SIM based secure element.<p>Also Google Wallets launch outside of U.S may run counter to European mobile operators current business model where they charge fees to banks and other service providers for putting their NFC applications on SIM cards owned by the Telcos. As Google attempts to court European banks to be part of the Google Wallet initiative, this could deter European mobile operators from adopting Android handsets if Google continues to unilaterally control the embedded secure element. Even though Google Nexus S supports SWP (Single Wire Protocol) that allows a mobile operator to put the secure element in the SIM, Google has opted not to enable this capability in Nexus S.<p>It would be great to hear other opinions on what I outlined above, and within my paper.",1316397567.0

Habits range from social skills (are you the social butterfly or the quiet kid who keeps to himself), to health (exercise a lot and eat well or lounge around watching tv and eating Doritos), to work ethics and more.<p>We are all, as individuals, the collection of habits that we have learned over the years. A frequent topic here on HN is how you can go about hacking yourself to change your habits. A popular one is to force yourself to talk to random different strangers every day in order to 1) break the habit of being shy, and 2) learn the skills necessary to make friends with people easily. For many people, this is successful.<p>Being a teenager is only the first small part of a person's life. We continue to grow and mature and have new experiences all throughout our life. Those are much more important than the awkward and often painful childhoods we all endure. Even when we're on our death beds, we still learn new things.<p>I myself was an introverted kid. As a teenager, I was an arrogant s.o.b that thought I was better than most people around me. When I was 17, during that summer I played baritone in a drum corps and had such a set of experiences that even then I could viscerally feel the change in my outlook on life and on others. Throughout my 20s I began to get more perspective on life and bad habits I had growing up melted away.<p>Now here I am in my early thirties (31 at the time of writing this), and I can feel my perspective on life changing again. I stopped getting angry about things a couple years ago. Literally when everything seems to be breaking and failing around me, I just find it funny and keep working through it. That happened again a few weeks ago. I'm at a point now where if I am getting depressed, I can rationally sense where my emotional state is heading and most of the time do things to bring myself out of it early.<p>I'm able to recognize my bad and good habits and I'm able to make conscious choices now to change what I want to change.
