The batteries only have around 100k charge cycles, and I read somewhere that the reality is the batteries of electric cars half their charge life in 5 years, and probably need replaced by 8.<p>You ignore that modern gas engines require fixing/replacement of clutches, transmissions, engine rebuilds etc. that an electric vehicle don't need/have.  Those things wear out faster than a HV battery.<p>I know folks with 10+ year old Prius who still get 45+ MPG.<p>Finally Tesla warranties the battery for 8 years [1].  So after 8 years you might have to replace the battery, and the cost of which (given the rise of electric cars) will have gone down considerably.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/model-s-update-pricing-and-options"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/model-s-update-pricing-and-o...</a>",1324691727

Currently academia generally has partial transparency and a closed competitiveness between research groups, where replicating results is non-trivial (at least in the comp sci research field I am in where sharing source is not standard).<p>The analogy of a git-hub for experiments makes sense; research is about expanding knowledge freely. In contrast, the partial disclosure and under-sharing of tricks of the trade between research groups is about the entrenched interests of particular groups.<p>The article makes a strong case for a system that removes the inefficiencies of the status quo, that disrupts the current university system, because that institution is no longer serving its initial purpose as well as it could be.<p>However, what is less clear, is what financial system would provide incentives in the academia-github system?

But of course the cities are of different sizes, so again this is very shaky grounds for accurate comparison.<p>I don't want to end up posting a novel here, but it's definitely an interesting topic on which I'd love to hear more insights from european expatriates in the US (or the opposite).<p>As for the cheese, you are completely rightâ€“ and regarding the women, I don't want to belittle my fellow French women, but I would be lying if I said I hadn't found delightful ladies in SF :)",1324691385

28,3387881,comment,3387812.0,3387812.0,3,0,sj4nz,,,"Read the source with a question in mind. For example, how does some software create a particular kind of file? (I did this recently for Pandoc's EPUB writer-- while this software is in Haskell and not Python, the same rules apply.)  Do lots of searches for keywords that seem appropriate to your question. When you find a class or function, trace its execution until you understand it.  Learn the difference between function calls and function definitions--hopefully the formatting of the source makes a distinction.  [For example, in JavaScript, Douglas Crockford recommends whitespace hints for functions, ""function name () {}"" would be a definition and ""function name();"" would be a call. The space between the name and the '(' is the clue for the difference. This is not part of the JavaScript language per-se.]<p>Write down other questions or make notes about anything you don't understand.    With most source, there's almost never any ""best place"" to start unless you have a question in mind. I don't think anyone can read source like a novel, because it is not a linear narrative--it is much more like a choose-your-own-adventure book.  The longer you read and skim the source code of any system, you'll find that you know ""where everything is"" and just like a choose-your-own-adventure book, you'll slowly internalize when it tells you to turn to page 78 that the dragon is going to eat you without needing to turn and read that page.",1324691145

62,3387847,comment,3387628.0,3387818.0,18,0,jarrett,,,"Fair question. A web service would indeed be a better solution. With a web service, you have a server-side application layer, and all database reading and writing is done by that layer. Sure, you might be able to authenticate and send bogus info to the web service. Even that can be made very difficult, e.g. by cryptographically signing requests or encrypting the data on the wire.<p>So if you do that, worst case scenario is someone reverse-engineers the protocol, including whatever cryptography you're using. And that person then sends phony data of the sort the game would really send, e.g. messages saying ""I completed this level"" or ""I scored X points."" Which, in the big scheme of things, isn't a huge security breach.<p>The difference between that and having an open MySQL server is that the open MySQL server allows you to read and write <i>anything</i> stored in the database. That's much worse than being able to spoof normal data the game would be sending anyway. In this situation, the worst case scenario would be total corruption of the database, as opposed to the player falsely accruing points or something like that.",1324689920
