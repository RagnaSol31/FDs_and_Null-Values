So as a beta, I only use facebook because quite honestly that was the easiest way for me to get the product out fast, and get feedback.<p>The key differentiator between this and facebook (right now) is that the album is shared i.e. multiple people who were in the same place/event, and shared the same experience, also share the same album. Basically perfect anytime several people do something together and want to have access to everyone's photos, to share, to print, to store, whatever.<p>Our mobile app will extend this functionality live to events happening in real time and will be a way for hundreds of people, taking pictures at the same event, to have all their photos (instagram/picplz etc) in the same album - the end value in this is that it becomes an additional discovery mechanism for people with similar interests.<p>It's important that we break away from a facebook login for example, but this is really the crux of my question; my goal is to build something robust that a lot of people can use, and I'm torn between depth and breadth; depth being making it more useful to the people currently on it for now (and focusing on functionality/UI before acquiring users) or building out features more slowly, and focusing on acquiring more users.<p>If we focus on depth, we'll have a better product sooner, but less users for now, which means less feedback to react to, less traction etc. If we focus on breadth, it will mean more users more quickly, but it will take longer to realize the vision.",1300240762.0

Integrity is when you do something against your best interest because it's the right thing to do. Since AOL seems to have given them free reign to attack their sister sites there's no risk in this.  In fact it's in their best interest because it drives page views.<p>I'm not saying it says something bad about their integrity I'm simply saying it's not really relevant to a discussion about their integrity.,1300240566.0

I think it reflects a narcissistic view of the company and their platform. I think it's bad for innovation on the iOS platform. I wrote about it on my blog too [1], but so what? Users don't care about that either, apparently.<p>Interesting that you'd say that about Gruber, because the majority of the time I've seen his posts show up here, he gets lynched.<p>Please don't confuse my remarks with saying that Apple is ""right"" in any greater sense than that they're making a lot of money. The problem is, users aren't asking questions about what's right, but that's nothing new. If we want an open platform to be widely accepted, it has to deliver what users want, not what we (geeks) want, and it won't sell based on any higher ""principles"".<p>> However, the bigger failing is the failure to recognize these even among technical people, most of whom seem to have something akin to devotion for Apple.<p>You'll make as much headway fighting against this (devotion to a product) as you will fighting religion. As one of the greatest marketers I ever met once told me, ""No one but schools and universities ever made any money trying to teach a customer anything."" His point is that buyers are just as self-centered as Apple. They're not interested in being taught why they want something; they want whatever scratches their itch. Some people are interested in what's ""right"", but for most people, it never crosses their mind.<p>I also reject the notion that this is any sort of ""failing"" on the part of someone who buys an Apple device. Business isn't always quid pro quo.  I still assert that Apple wears their intention on their sleeve. If you don't like what they're doing, you shouldn't buy their products.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.bradlanders.com/2011/02/21/its-not-greed-its-narcissism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bradlanders.com/2011/02/21/its-not-greed-its-narc...</a>",1300240302.0
