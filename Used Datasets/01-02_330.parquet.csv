The first one is the bureaucratic nature of personnel evaluation, the second being the lack of actual 'real' wars to train the leaders (as sadistic as it appears).<p>_Disclaimer_ : I only have an observer experience of the US Army (I went on tour in Afghanistan in a mixed US/Canada brigade), but my actual employment was in the Canadian Forces. I was on tour when Gen McChrystal was relieved and replaced by Gen Petraeus, and also when (CA) Gen Menard was relieved and replaced by Gen Vance.<p>1. In the early ranks of officers, promotions are very strongly linked to evaluation reports. Evaluation reports came to be very sanitize and politically corrected documents where you need a load of supporting documentation if you want to negatively score someone. If someone received an hypothetical score of 3 last year, you need very strong arguments if you want to reduce that score the year after. The system is somehow 'humanitarian' in that it believes that no one can become worse over time, and no one is incompetent. Also, there is a lot of 'political' pressure coming from relationships inside the military. I saw first hand some obviously incompetent Captain be promoted to the rank of Major, simply for political reasons. Somebody back in the country had plans back home for this officer, and this promotion was planned ahead of time (the officer had time in rank and was put in the position they were to give them some 'action' cred).<p>Put together with the fact that promotions are expected after certain specific check-in-the-boxes, this leads to the promotion of incompetent leaders on purely bureaucratic grounds. Eventually leading to a wider range of incompetent officers in the pool of Colonel in which Generals are chosen.<p>2. Recent wars are not related in 'danger factor' to what WWII has been. Nobody's in actual danger of having their family killed/their country harmed if they don't succeed in their missions oversea. Those missions are political disturbance of far away countries. They are, sadistically, good for the troops as they give them first hand experience with real combat - it's essential for an army to always have veterans in their ranks to train other members. If a generation of the army would go without seeing combat actions, the technical abilities of this army would quickly evaporate. In that regard, while recent conflicts provided combat experience to field personnel, they have not been of a large enough scale to train generals.  Generals thus can't really become battle-hardened and provide hands-on experience while on tour.<p>Finally, the idea of doing a 'tour' when you're a general, like noted by the article. They come in theater with a vision (but often no general field experience, and sometimes even no field experience at all) and have only a few weeks/months to try out their vision and see what happens, and that's when they're actually on site and not back home dealing with politicians. Then regardless of the outcome, they are relieved and replaced by another general.",1351389580.0

You're right, it isn't. Re-reading it, what strikes me is that he is quite dismissive, cruel even, of everything Microsoft is doing - jumping to see the negative and showing very little willingness to see anything positive. Perhaps I was too quick to defend him in the original thread, though maybe some of his points were valid and the negative response from HN was a bit too strong a counter-reaction.<p>Honestly, for me articles like this are really an ersatz susbtitute for actually going to Microsoft stores/using the Surface/getting a closer look at Microsoft corporate culture. Not living in the States and not having much disposable income I take what I can get I suppose. I'd write that blog post but without such experiences and resources I don't think I'm qualified enough for anything other than internet armchair pontification ;)",1351389571.0

22,4707871,comment,4706892.0,4707401.0,9,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Welcome to experience. Have you ever tried walking along the outline of a balance beam drawn on the floor? Jumping along it? Now move the balance beam 1' off the ground, still easy? try 5' and take away the mats. The difference between walking the outline and walking the beam is that you can 'see' the consequences of failure and you know they hurt.<p>Not surprisingly this happens in engineering as well. You start ""just trying to get it done"" and when you didn't know better you just wrote it. But now that you know better, perhaps you've been bitten by an unchecked return value or a fixed length array, so now you reflexively look for those things, you fix them, you refactor them. This slows you down, and your fresh graduate peers start thinking ""the old guy is slowin' down.""<p>The only way I've found to move past this to let go of the responsibility when your manager asks you to. The conversation you have is ""Boss, I can crank this out quickly but the faster its written the more likely it will have some future problem in it."" then write that into the comment ""Boss asked me to hack this out, said he would take responsibility date - time"" and then just write it and move on. Later if it screws up you don't worry about it.<p>But you can't just go all irresponsible on them, you also need to think about the kinds of things your doing and step up your game in terms of what some folks called 'design patterns' make an effort to capture the way you write the things you write all the time and train your fingers to spit out an 'ok' version from the start.<p>Good luck.",1351388871.0

First, I wanted to say that my boss is a programmer himself, much better than I am, and he understands the value of good code very well.

I mean - I do program in my spare time and have side projects, but if anything it worsens the situation: I have more time and no deadline, so I just tinker with the code until I'm satisfied.

Here are some things that I've observed, as a hacker, about humans:<p>1. (most) people like to form groups and then compete with other groups<p>2. (most) people enjoy feeling superior to other people<p>These are things that seem to have been true in any part of the world, throughout all of human history.<p>So what's our plan here? Are we going to turn hackernews into the only collection of humans to ever live that defies these rules? Is there some technical solution that will change fundamental aspects of human nature? Maybe getting rid of the voting arrows will remove all of the meanness and tribal thinking on the planet.<p>I say all this because I don't understand the impetus for your post. Of course it would be nice if everything everyone said made an insightful contribution. But you know that people aren't like that. No amount of blog posting or commenting is going to change how people interact with each other. It seems like your problem isn't with the hacker news community, but with the nature of human socialization.<p>This looks like a clear case of selection bias. It's hard to do good as a hacker if you isolate yourself in an ivy tower of ycombinator hackers and geniuses. Making things does take some understanding of the average person and how they behave.
