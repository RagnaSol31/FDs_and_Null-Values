For example, the government pushing of subprime mortgages (at the urging of cronies) over-inflated housing prices, and then when the balloon burst, the cronies won again by having the government take over their debt.  The question should primarily be how to restrain cronyism, and thereby provide the best outcome for the most people.  Cronyism seeks to restrain trade in a way that is advantageous to only a few politically connected players.<p>A pure socialist system or a pure capitalist system would probably not have these issues, but then these are both unicorns.<p>Cronyism seems to be the primary way a socialist system operates.

34,10285095,comment,10284202.0,10284531.0,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I was watching a TV programme on haiku the other day.  One of the things they stressed was that because haiku is so compressed (17 mora in Japanese, where a mora can be though of as either a vowel sound or a consonant followed by a vowel sound in English terms) that you have to be careful of what grammar constructs to use.  Grammar does not usually lead to imagery and if you can strip away the grammar, you can have more mora to use for words that evoke imagery.<p>This made me think that haiku, in particular, is good at evoking emotions and imagery that the reader/listener is already familiar with.  There are some incredibly powerful haiku that in just a few words can really tug at your emotions.  But you need to have already experienced the imagery for it to have any meaning.<p>I find that picture to be similar in nature to a haiku.  There is very little in the picture itself, but the elements it has evoke powerful emotions because we know what they mean.  The starving child, the vulture sitting ready, the question of &quot;why is the child starving&quot; (war)...  You assemble these ideas in your head and it generates a huge number of thought processes and feelings.<p>To me, the difference between such a picture and a haiku is that the picture is not something I have ever seen before.
