It’s especially nice when two or more people are trying to read from the same screen, because occasional scrolling of a whole column directly horizontally is much less disruptive than arbitrary amounts of scrolling down a page. On wide computer displays, it is a significantly better use of screen real estate than single-column web pages, which should stick to a measure (width) of not much more than about 60 characters to be readable.<p>Anything longer than a page or two that I plan to read on a screen gets copied and pasted into Tofu.<p>Edit: note that there’s a (quick) slide animation with scrolling in Tofu which helps maintain the impression of a single continuous surface, but there are no gratuitous animated flipping page corners.",1292896775.0

You can burn through time, money, health, and other consumables chasing bad ideas and, if you're not measuring obsessively, not even know you're doing it until the company suddenly fails on you.  (This is even more possible if you're not ""in the loop"" : many startups with actual employees which flamed out had highly motivated bright people who were hitting their performance targets, in the service of a business which just <i>didn't work</i>.  That fact is, ahem, not always clearly communicated to all employees.)<p>That said: owning the effing company at least means that, if you're getting screwed out of something-to-keep for each hour you work, you should at least know whose fault it was.  I really recommend it if working for The Man starts to feel exploitative.  (Heads you win, tails you find out why The Man was offering you the terms he was offering.)",1292894797.0

For example, the 'JailbreakMe' jailbreak exploited FreeType running in the browser (Safari), but it still was sandboxed and running as 'mobile', so it had to the exploit the kernel itself -- from userland -- to get full access to the system. (It also installed itself to run at startup, using yet another exploit to evade the code signing requirements.)<p>However, if, on an iOS device, you do find an exploit in a root process, you still don't have a way to do much. Because of the code signing requirements and the W^X protection, you can't run your own binary or even execute shellcode: ROP is the only method possible to run code. So you still have to exploit the kernel to disable those, making root code execution is only slightly more useful than 'mobile' code execution for that purpose.<p>But that's not even really relevant, since only a few (JailbreakMe, Spirit, the on-bootup component of limera1n and greenpois0n) of the ""jailbreaks"" (a really misleading term, since they are more of ""injected kernel patches to remove code signing requirements"") are even done from a booted device at all! Most of the exploitation happens in the lower-level bootloaders, over USB (using the protocols intended for restoring the device if the higher-level components fail). Once you get access there, you can pretty much do anything you want (run a different OS, remove restrictions from the kernel), but only for this one boot cycle. After a reboot, you need to apply these patches again, leading to what's known as a ""tethered jailbreak"": you have to exploit the bootloaders each reboot to start up the device. This can be avoided with yet another exploit, which breaks the chain of trust at boot time to apply the patches without user intervention.<p>Edit: some clarification.\nEdit 2: I should turn this into a blog post ;P.",1292893505.0
