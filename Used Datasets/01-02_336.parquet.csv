The computer spent millions of years calculating, and arrived at the answer ""42"". The problem, it said, was that the Question had never been formulated. The computer then designed another computer to calculate the Question. After millions of years of calculation, this computer was inadvertently destroyed. The last remnants of the computer were only able to provide the question ""What is six times nine?""<p>Also, knowing the answer without knowing the question is Jeopardy!",1369619904.0

In evaluating where the boundaries should lie, we <i>shouldn't</i> consider how new technologies might allow criminals to coordinate in new ways, perhaps rendering existing privacy protections obsolete, but we <i>should</i> consider how new technologies that allow more effective policing might render existing exceptions to the privacy protections obsolete.<p>Privacy advocates do not have a principled approach to the problem of how to reconcile the legitimate needs of the police with privacy rights in the context of modern communications. Their approach boils down to ""do whatever makes it the hardest for the police to do their work."" Which goes wholly against what the founders intended when they wrote that limitations on the power of police to search must be ""reasonable.""",1369619812.0

I had to do this.<p>2. I don't do random shit, so it must be important.<p>3. Therefore, you have to do this.<p>This chain of logic breaks down at step 2, so that's where post-hoc rationalizations step in to save the day. That's why I'm going to say this explicitly: <i>For everything you can come up with to justify handwriting classes, there's a better way to learn the same skill that also fosters things that are more important than having neat handwriting.</i><p>For example, fine motor control is better learned through PE classes that actually teach sports, which has the added benefit of promoting physical fitness. The aesthetics of handwriting is better learned through calligraphy as part of a <i>good</i> art class, which has the added benefit of transmitting a culture which is left out of handwriting classes.",1369619310.0

28,5773077,comment,5772901.0,5772901.0,2,0,jacques_chester,,,"For those of you wondering about the (current) headline, ""Pre-served prison sentence"", it refers to time in custody on remand being subtracted from any prison terms.<p>People who are charged with a serious crime are usually placed in custody to prevent them skedaddling. Sometimes you can get bail to remain at large, sometimes you can't. When you can't, you remain ""in remand"" -- not in custody for punishment, merely to control the risk that you won't show for trial.<p>If a trial is held and you're found guilty, the judge first calculates a sentence for each crime and then combines them. Assuming that the judge sentences you to imprisonment, he or she will then subtract your time spent in remand from that sentence. You have, in effect, served the time in custody already -- the principle being that you shouldn't be punished more than once for a crime.<p>Depending on jurisdiction a judge may also elect to set a non-parole period or suspend the sentence.<p>This is why you sometimes hear things like, ""John Citizen was found guilty and sentenced to 10 years. He will be released in 7"", when the trial process took 3 years.<p>Of course: I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice.",1369619157.0

I spend far more time updating a ~40G Linux installation than I do Windows - Ubuntu's package manager accosts me at least once a week.

I wasted a whole day - last Friday, to be exact - figuring out how to get Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS working on a modern UEFI machine with full disk encryption and Nvidia graphics card. UEFI doesn't supply old BIOS text routines, and Ubuntu GRUB2 defaults don't work, such that when you switch from nouveau's hilariously unstable drivers (hard X.Org crash if you move windows too quickly) to nvidia-current you don't get a prompt at boot-up to enter your password - just a black screen of apparent death. You have to configure a framebuffer that works with the Nvidia card and live with NVRM's kernel log warnings about only supporting VGA text consoles.<p>Most of all I really resent Ubuntu forcing me to learn how all these pieces are put together, so I could fix it.

But the worse misconception is that even if the startup defies the odds and <i>is</i> quite successful, most younger non-experienced folk remain under the impression that because they were given ""1%"" of the company to sign-up (at the time when they actually signed up), if the company exits at say $100,000,000 (""real"" money but kind of chump change in the days of Instatumblrgram) they will see $1,000,000... which is... not going to happen, not even close.  By the time they are fully vested and the company exits, their 1% is probably more like 0.01% or worse.

So in normal usage [1] [2], you shouldn't ever be able to delete the contents of any commit that exists in the history of any named commit.<p>A commit that is newly eligible for garbage collection will not actually be garbage collected during a grace period, I believe one week.  During this time the commit is still accessible by commit hash [3].<p>Branches are kind of like variables in a garbage-collected language, and commits are like objects in that language.  An object is eligible for GC if and only if there are no variables that point to it.  Making new variables that point to the same object is a really lightweight operation since most of the data's shared.  <i>Unlike</i> many OO languages, objects in Git are immutable, which means git can safely collapse identical copies of the same object to a single instance (an optimization which git is quite aggressive about).<p>> it can lead to disaster (if those commits were pushed already)<p>If you want to cause a remote repository to delete a branch, look at the --mirror and --delete options for the push subcommand.  AFAIK, pushing the deletion of a branch has the same effect as if you deleted the branch locally on the machine you're pushing the deletion to.<p>> someone else could actually start new branch from commit which is in branch you just ""deleted""<p>If another developer has merely fetched the deleted branch, their remote tracking branch will be deleted when they fetch again.  If your colleague has created an actual local branch with the changes you deleted (as opposed to a remote-tracking branch), when or whether your colleague deletes that branch is entirely under his/her control [4].<p>[1] Using low-level git subcommands to force git to delete objects which are still referenced by other objects is abnormal usage.<p>[2] Corrupting the object database in your .git directory through unclean shutdown, hard drive failure, or vindictive hex editing is also abnormal usage.<p>[3] If you neglected to write down the commit hash before you deleted the branch, you can likely find it in the reflog.  The reflog is a history of the commit hash at the tip of each branch.  Alternatively, you can use git subcommands to browse the object database and find orphaned commits.<p>[4] At this point, git has no <i>technological</i> way [5] for anyone but your colleague to delete the local branch from your colleague's machine.  <i>Socially,</i> of course, you can use project management techniques to encourage your colleague to delete the branch (e.g., if the official maintainers announce that the deleted branch is considered obsolete and will not support it or accept changes based on the version of the project in the deleted branch, that can be a compelling reason for people to stop using the copies that are floating around.  Or your colleague's boss can tell him to delete it or be fired.)<p>[5] If you have git push access to your colleague's repository, or you have shell access to your colleague's user account, you can delete their branches.  Footnote [4] is referring to the <i>usual</i> case where your colleague's machine is a private box where you have no access.",1369618047.0
