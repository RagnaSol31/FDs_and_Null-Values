For example, even though Google is doing great, quite a few of their board members hate how Eric Schmidt feeds Google employees so well.

You see where I'm going with this.<p>Crash Protection: I stand corrected.

I usually suggest people take one of two paths:<p>1) Startup work -  This means a genuine interest in learning and doing outside of the classroom because it's dependent on what you've done and what you can do.  You have to adapt to changing technologies, but the work (imo) is more interesting and the degree requirements can be substituted for the right combination of enthusiasm, personalily and experience.<p>2) The corporate route - will require a degree to get past the HR department unless you have a foot in the door.  You'll work 9 - 5, be done at the end of the day and will likely have a secure job in either a legacy language or a current language that may become legacy.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with this route and I encourage most people to take it.  You do your best in school and use all available opportunities (summer work, coops, internships, etc.) and network your way into a likely fantastic company.<p>To differentiate I test most people to pick a project or field they have an interest in and we brainstorm an idea.  If they can do it, finish it, and write about or open source it and they're still interested, I highly recommend the startup/aternative routes.  If not, no harm no foul, but you're likely better suited for a corporate job.<p>I think both are equally valid and good, but different people need to do different things, which is why high school is so boring for a lot of people in the first place.",1278465422
