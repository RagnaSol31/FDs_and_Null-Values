1,4508705,comment,4508407.0,4508407.0,2,0,AndrewKemendo,,,"So, this seems fairly intuitive to me - mostly because I have been trying to build one of these for predicting strategic actions by states ie: when is x country going to launch a missile. I am curious what they are using as their heuristics for developing solutions and how they are determining confidence intervals (my guess: number of samples).<p>It is actually pretty easy to build a process that ""fills in the blanks"" the hard part, obviously is getting those blanks correctly. In my experience that takes a fairly deep set of expert opinions and coherent ""causal"" node programmatics which have assigned confidence intervals. Not to mention the fact that people are going to be scrutinizing this data and if it is wrong, they are going to lose faith in the system, and quickly.<p>When you talk about implementing this on databases however, either the blanks which are being filled need to not be critical processes which require precision or they need to iterate corrections very quickly. In the end I think this is useful for non-critical products which users can correct if necessary. If however they have a novel solution with a significant history of ""right"" answers, they may be onto something in machine learning.",1347415086.0

It's easy to understand their respective philosophies - Apple in terms of product design and quality, and Amazon in terms of prices and shopping experience. Both are now crossing into each others' territory - Apple with the future iPad mini and Tim Cook's operations knowhow, and Amazon with designing higher quality products. But both approaches are easily understandable by customers and appeal to their own values - innovatively, doggedly competing either on quality or price or both.<p>On the other hand, I don't think it's hard to see that most other manufacturers' philosophies go along the lines of ""Let's make everything we can think of and see what sticks."" Microsoft, for one, is only starting to turn around from its philosophy of ""We want to be everywhere in your life"" to focus on customer experience. These approaches are business-centric, and don't present anything that the consumer can trust or grab onto, especially when you think about the various music stores and other half-hearted approaches at retaining consumers who buy their products.<p>Intrinsically, I think customers understand the lack of focus - that these manufacturers are fundamentally focused on gaining a share of the pie rather than making customers really happy with what they just bought. With Apple, it's ""Look at all these neat things I can do with all these apps""; with Amazon, it's ""Look at all the stuff I can buy and read/listen to/watch."" Other companies are only recently coming on board, and as long as they're not focused on giving the customer something to do with their products, they're going to miss out.",1347412084.0
