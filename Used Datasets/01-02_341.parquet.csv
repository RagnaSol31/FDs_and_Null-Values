Agree that most people are consumers not producers - but FB cleverly and incessantly worked towards making the most hardened consumer into a producer (Like being the first incarnation thereof). Half that site's audience visits every day. They like brand pages and friend's posts. They disclose location when they upload photos.<p>All of this is low-friction data production unlike the review example you use above (most people are terrible at <i>writing</i> original content unless absolutely required to do so).,1353722314.0

Full of buttons that had weird symbols written on every face of the keys. It had a disk drvie that would make <i>drruuuun prrub drruuun</i> sounds while the little light flashed. Boy, did it looked busy. The power  button was nowhere to be found by this 7 year old. The cables? Where do they go?\nLittle by little I kept breaking down each issue I faced. Its funny how things never change. One cable went here, the other there. Turns out someone was smart enough to make the cables fit in one way only. Then I found the power button after hitting every possible key on it. Luckily I had managed to plug it in before doing that. The monitor came alive and suddenly I had a working computer in front of me. Little did my oldest brother know that unplugging it would not keep me from using it.<p>Then came the issue with not knowing how to use the thing. I did not speak or read english and the manual was written in it. What was PRINT? GOTO? Well, that was for me to find out. Turns out, I still use the same method. Break up everything into pieces and work with each piece at a time. I do miss that C64.",1353721818.0

30,4824276,comment,4821488.0,4824016.0,7,0,sparkie,,,"Yes, people still care for microkernels, particularly in research, security, embedded systems. The developments didn't end in 1980 and are still going on now. What's interesting is that some of those kernels from the 1980s were architecturally superior to the commercial OSes used today. It's really a mistake to discount the technical advantages of these kernels due to lack of popularity.<p>The main problem with them is simply lack of manpower. Research usually means that older solutions are replaced with the new, which leads to a lot of wasted effort where those changes aren't backward compatible. There's also the huge effort to keep kernels up to date with hardware, and to port over the thousands of software packages that people typically uses in day-to-day activities.<p>That's perhaps the real advantage of the current popular kernels - they have a strong requirement for stability and introducing breaking changes is out of the question. It's a propagating effect too, due to the many layers of dependencies we have - modifying the lowest layer, the kernel, has the biggest overall effect on the entire operating system.<p>That's why the current VM (or chroot/jail/namespace) solutions are being pushed and researched - because they bring some of the advantages of the microkernel design to modern computers, but don't completely break everything. A graphical application in user space for example, shouldn't care whether it's running in a VM or on the metal, it only cares about it's dependencies.<p>>The Hurd is, at least from the outside, a 1980s design that failed to catch on in the 1980s and is now a solution looking for a problem.<p>The Hurd is still a problem, rather than a solution. It's original goal is by part a failure because of design problems in the Mach microkernel. There's attempts to put Hurd on other microkernels, which has pushed Hurd more into a research position, but there's certainly things to learn from the history of the project on how not to create an OS on a microkernel. It's also not the only project still running with a microkernel design (see HelenOS, Genode etc).<p>And it's not like the research is completely wasted even if these projects don't gain popularity - as some of their features make it into mainstream kernels. A good example is FUSE (Filesystem in userspace) on linux - which allows people to experiment with filesystems without hacking on the kernel or requiring additional privileges.<p>But whether a microkernel design will ever become mainstream is a different question. The sheer amount of work to port applications over makes it seem unlikely - although good design of open source software will make the effort significantly easier. It's unfortunate that we seem to be heading in the opposite direction though, with key players in the open source world pushing for a monotonous ecosystem around linux/systemd et al, even excluding working kernels like the BSDs.",1353721298.0

It's primarily a problem of misunderstood economics.<p>Instead of trying to monetize recorded music, which has virtually no hope of maintaining the artificial scarcity (and thus salability) it enjoyed during the last century, musicians need to return to their roots and find new ways to monetize live performance and other real-time interactions. Recorded music should become a loss-leader for these kinds of transactions. You may not get a $100 or even a two-drink minimum for ""tickets"" to a live stream, but you might also fill a few orders of magnitude more ""seats"".<p>The ultimate unit of marketable scarcity is <i>immediacy</i>. There is only one ""now"". Once it's gone, you can never, ever have it again. Barring the mass-availability of time travel, ""now"" isn't going to be commoditized, so it ought to be a fairly safe thing to base your business on. For example, ""we'll post the recording for free next month, but if you want to see it happen right now, you pay (directly or indirectly) for access."" Whatever drives the last nail in the coffin of the labels, I'll gladly wager 5 years of my life in a startup that it's going to involve this principle.<p>Second, there's a problem of social conditioning. Not so much on the demand side, but on the supply side. Musicians are taught to worship blindly at the alter of intellectual property. When Napster first appeared, I was a student at Berklee College of Music. That was pretty much ground zero and I remember it feeling like armageddon. Selling IP was all that is good and holy. To most of my musician friends and acquaintances, it still is.<p>This bias has to be overcome by helping musicians make more money from non-IP sources than from IP. That is the only thing that will convince them to throw away everything they've ever learned about their own industry, and throw off the yokes of their voluntary servitude.<p>With a nod to Etienne de la Boetie: ""I do not ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over, but simply that you support him no longer; then you will behold him, like a great Colossus whose pedestal has been pulled away, fall of his own weight and break into pieces.""<p>As an aside, my startup is out to make the music business a better place for musicians and their fans.

From that form to useful work is typically over 90% efficient.<p>By contrast from what I'm reading on Wikipedia the reaction that drives photosynthesis has a theoretical max of 25%.  But you only get that efficiency at 1/4 of normal sunlight levels during the day (the rest of the light has to be wasted).  We're already well below solar.  And then you've got to give some of the energy to the plant for growing.  Then you lose energy in the chemical reactions that make a biofuel.  And the biofuel goes into an engine.  Every one of these steps has a maximum theoretical efficiency that is fairly low.  (For instance a gasoline car engine's maximum efficiency is in the 25-30% range.)<p>If I remember correctly, Elon claimed that biofuel production had a theoretical max of about 0.5% of incident sunlight energy being converted in the end to useful work.  (We're a long ways away from this maximum in practice today.)",1353720404.0

To me, some of the questions you raise <i>(Do they have more crashes? [..] More problems with program compatibility?)</i> are points I would traditionally associate with Windows rather than with Linux.<p><i>Is it harder to train people to use Linux?</i> is an interesting question. I think if people are already used to working with MS products staying with these products should provide an advantage it terms of training. However, I would expect a significant portion of the staff to use only a minimal feature set available in their setup, typically writing letters, etc. For them, I wouldn't expect the transition from MS Office to an open source office suite any harder than, say, the transition from traditional MS Office to the ribbon-based interface.<p><i>Is Linux as easy to use, or are there inefficiencies?</i> -- The whole ""this year is the year of Linux on the desktop"" joke will probably never get old, but I think everyone has to admit that Linux has come a long way in the last 15 years. For your average user, I would say there aren't any major differences between a Linux desktop and that of a commercial vendor, once the system has been set up. Of course, that still leaves the question whether Linux systems are <i>set up</i> as efficiently as Windows systems...<p>I personally think that MS Office at least <i>looks</i> way more polished than any of the open source alternatives, and I would expect it to be a good deal ahead of the latters in application as well. But I can't say for sure because I've used Open-/LibreOffice exclusively for many years now. It's totally fine for whatever I want to do with it, and I would bet that it is absolutely sufficient for 90% of the use cases an average admin person has.<p>So all in all MS products might still be a (good) notch ahead in terms of product quality, but I think that advantage is somewhat neglectable because Linux alternatives have certainly matured enough for the particular use case of a city administration.",1353720250.0

Humans are a biological species subject to normal ecological principles. One of those principles is that, in the absence of a limiting factor in our environment, we will grow. If energy availability is removed as a limiting factor, we will grow (""gettin' larger in waist and taste"") until it is again. Anyone who pretends otherwise has not stepped outside to notice all the millions/billions of people clamouring for food, clean water, jobs, holidays, new computers, clothes, homes, education, etc etc. Imagining that, unlike every time in the past where human societies have chafed against resource limits and hoped that just a little more would fix everything, this time human needs will <i>finally</i> be satisfied, is the oldest fallacy in the book.

I'm reproducing my bullet points here as I think the claimed savings in this situation are actually false savings. They supposedly took training into consideration but I think they ignore loss of productivity inherent in the switch as well as compatibility issues. Consider the total costs of all the following:<p>* How will incompatibilities be handled with their existing documents? Is LibreOffice absolutely 100% feature complete identical to Microsoft Office? If not, what proportion of documents use incompatible features? How much effort is required to determine this incompatibility? How much effort is required to redo these documents to fix the incompatibility? How many employees are required to be on such a conversion team and how long will the conversion take? Can the conversion even be done?<p>* How is interaction done with external users who send Office documents? What happens when users outside their office send them Office documents which make use of incompatible features? Will this require maintaining an ongoing conversion team? What is the opportunity cost inherent in the delays in getting documents converted?<p>* How is installation of LibreOffice done? Can it be setup on a centralized WSUS server and automatically deployed to every user as Microsoft Office can, or does it require an army of people manually installing it on thousands of PCs? How are updates for both version upgrades and security patches handled? What is the typical update schedule for LibreOffice (security-related patches, compatibility upgrades, etc.) and will this need to be done manually as well? How many man-hours per year will this take?<p>* LibreOffice doesn't include an email product. What alternate solution would they use? What is the cost to convert all Outlook email and archives to this new solution? Can the new solution make use of all calendaring and other Exchange-related features that Outlook has? Can the new solution be deployed on WSUS and kept up to date automatically, or does this too require an army of people manually installing and doing updates? Can they maintain the security permissions they currently use, such as restricting the ability for users to forward internal communications outside the office?<p>* LibreOffice doesn't have a Visio, Project, or OneNote replacements. What are they going to use for these? How do they convert existing documents and interact with external users who send them Office documents? Is it even possible?<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4235508"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4235508</a>",1353719554.0
