It has nothing to do with iteration.<p>* Files themselves are self-iterable (anything that loops over a file object uses a line-at-a-time iterator).  Even writing &quot;for line in f: ...&quot; causes you to loop a line at a time without the whole file being in memory all at once.<p>* Sets are just one of many objects that takes an iterable as an argument:  min(f), max(f), list(f), tuple(f), etc.",1421716142.0
