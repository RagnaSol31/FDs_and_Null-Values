It's in fact invaluable in that sense. We use a Cicle for our startup which with Hangout basically replaces Skype. The thing is that we later plant to have a circle for devs, and a circle for managment, etc - and I'm sure this applies to any company size. How much would say IKEA cut their infrasturcture and communication costs if they had ""a corporate twitter (between people, or machines, or both - like a collective intelligence), a support page for customers out, an interaction capabilities with new or existing teams/customers/subgroups"" all in one system? Do the math. Google had enough credibility for a huge company as H&M to replace their old systems with Google Apps. It's not a Facebook killer, it's a business enhancer.",1311818315.0

Graduated last year, started on my project 3 months ago, and I've barely just got a working prototype up now.<p>You just have to bite the bullet... work 9 to 5. Then get home, and work some more. Then work weekends.<p>I've tried several strategies to get myself to be more productive<p>- block reddit and HN (didn't last long).<p>- block out all external distractions;use headphones, loud music of choice. For music, try to stick to ambient stuff (classical, techno, things without lyrics). I find that songs with lyrics distracts my train of thought as well.<p>- have a good environment to work. If you're comfortable you'll fall into the zone a lot easier. Although, if you want to change it up a little, try and find a local coworking meetup group.<p>- anytime you are not working, be thinking of your business. Your startup has to be your life and soul if you want to go all the way. e.g. when you're showering, sitting on the toilet, commuting, walking or having lunch, before you sleep. On the way home you should be thinking about what you want to accomplish tonight, and aim towards that as soon as you get back.<p>- talk to people about it. If you're talking to people and they're not convinced, that means: a) your idea sucks and you're deluding yourself, b) your idea may have potential, but you are not confident about it enough to be able to convince other people, or c) your idea is great, but other people don't see it <-- this rarely ever happens. But ultimately, by talking to people, you face objections. Objections are the number 1 crucial factor in selling; you cannot sell someone a product if they don't tell you what they're worried about. So talking to people lets you build up a portfolio of objections that you can counter with solutions, and you'll grow more confident with your idea. More confidence = more enthusiasm and productivity.<p>Sure your work is going to take a hit... but if you're already working on being self-sufficient, I doubt your job is the last thing you're worried about.

That Swartz intended to distribute content downloaded from JSTOR not in the public domain.</i><p>I'll grant that the absence of detail on this claim in the indictment makes it very debatable. However, it's hard to fit <i>any</i> explanation about his intentions to the facts as we know them without making major assumptions about information we don't have.<p>For instance, many people assume the downloading was for legitimate research. Not unreasonable on the face of it (given, as you say, credentials and history) but then, why does a Harvard research fellow need to covertly access JSTOR from MIT?

Thanks for letting me know (both you and pg) about it being frowned upon to change the title - I'll know that for the future.  As he states, it was changed for me.  (The original I put in was ""AirBnB: Crimes committed against a host"".)<p>I do have to disagree on the likelihood that this particular scenario would've happened to the host through other rental agencies.  For her explanation as to why, see paragraph 14 overall - or paragraph 4 under the heading ""This was my home"" - in her post.  She addresses Craigslist; to add to that, I know that VRBO and HomeAway (the two major entire-unit vacation rental sites) accept payment for the host's listing only but absolutely everything else is left between the two parties, including verifications, contracts (if any), and payment method. The key relevant difference between those sites and Airbnb is that Airbnb blocks both host and guest from exchanging outside contact and identity information until a reservation is completed through their system. The reason for that is obvious, as Airbnb is a different business model, and needs to ensure that they receive their percentage for leads they provide. But one result of that policy is that taking independent security measures are impossible until both host and guest are already obligated and on the hook (hosts are penalized by appearing lower in the listings if they cancel a confirmed reservation from their end). The victim admits her naivete in thinking that because Airbnb demands to handle several aspects of the booking, that there are other levels of safety and verification implicit that in fact do not exist.<p>So yes, hosts can get ripped off using other listing services as well. But it is also made readily apparent that one should protect themselves on those sites, and users aren't actively blocked from gathering information to do so.",1311815118.0
