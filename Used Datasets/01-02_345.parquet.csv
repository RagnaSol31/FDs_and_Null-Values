So Google+ is Facebook-like and Twittery and bloggy in one package.<p>But I think this means that G+ might not ultimately be the winner here. The things it really has going for it is combining models developed by others. The big winner will come at the very end, when all the small stuff has been created, and it will be service that combines all the features to become the one network.",1313112861.0

70,2875581,comment,2874301.0,2874701.0,3,0,wglb,,,"Triangulation of interference can be a time-consuming process.  Like my EE professor (who spent the war years building $100 radar jamming tools that rendered million-dollar radar sets inoperative) said, the odds are stacked in favor of the jammer.<p>A crude example is a ham-radio fox hunt.  A radio is hidden somewhere in a pre-agreed area and teams of foxhunters are set loose once the fox ready to go.  If the fox is exactly one transmitter and its power is steady, it can still take the better part of an hour, for example, to locate a fox hidden within a one block area.<p>So increase the ability of the trackers, say with doppler direction finders mounted on roofs.  Now the jammers can do the following things to continue to wreak havoc.<p>1) Vary the power in 3db steps, perhaps in a loose random fashion.  Fox-hunting techniques include rotating an antenna and pinpointing where signal strength peaks.<p>2)  Using carefully time-syncronized jamming boxes, scatter three or four of them around the area and have them turn take turns being on.  Or have two out of three on in some overlapping way.<p>3) Combine 1&2.<p>4) Oh, make them mobile.",1313112488.0

I understand that as the CEO of a startup with $42 million he has to sound like he knows what he's doing, but surely anyone reading that statement would have serious reservations about either using the product or investing in the company.<p>Or perhaps he's an MBA-type who thinks that deep pockets have to mean competing in every single ""hot"" tech space, instead of excelling at one thing first. Even the giant companies he cites didn't stick their fingers in so many cookie jars: Apple had the iPod, Google had search, and Facebook had interactive college directory. That they are competing now is only possible because of their earlier mastery of a narrow area. And yet, perhaps because of their lofty ambitions, Color is a data mining company without data, and a photo-sharing company without anyone sharing photos on it.<p>Please don't ascribe this to any bubble. Sometimes, the best intentions of a group of talented charmers can fall by the wayside for a variety of reasons. Perhaps they got carried away by dreaming about what they would do with Facebook's data, or Google's algorithmic prowess, or Apple's UX process. Perhaps they just couldn't connect. Perhaps they got overruled by VCs. We might never know, and it's all part of the natural flow of smart, creative people meeting Wall Street-esque amounts of money.",1313112031.0
