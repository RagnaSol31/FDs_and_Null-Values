This is a known fact as evidenced by the assortment of results you'll find if you search for ""dvd update arccos"". It's also why a few of the more popular rippers in the past are no longer popular since they haven't been updated.<p>Intentional errors on CDs would actually demonstrate my ""theory"".<p>And in terms of it being a theory, I have anecdotal evidence that multiple people I know were annoyed at the inability of a ripping program they used/purchased to handle a new release and therefore gave up on ripping.
