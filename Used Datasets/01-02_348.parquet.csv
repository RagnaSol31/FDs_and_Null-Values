(or perhaps they were). They got involved because the heat was on in Kenya.<p>4: Mocality suffered a loss here (e.g. use of data to be used to solicit businesses against their terms and conditions), the people doing so were at Google and representing Google and thus Google has opened themselves up for a considerable legal mess.<p>5: The Nigerian courts and legal system are too hard/expensive/slow for Mocality and Google to navigate, so Mocality have turned to PR to motivate Google to change.<p>6: That approach is working, and it should be working. Google needs to do something urgently to fix this.<p>7: Getting rid of the partners is insufficient remedy for Mocality. There needs to be some compensation involved for the solicitation of a considerable percentage of Mocality's listings.<p>8: Ultimately the best way for Google to handle this is to purchase Mocality.<p>Questions<p>1:Was the India team a Google team one or outsourced to some rascals there?<p>2: What will Google do to compensate Mocality of this scam?<p>3: Has Mocality retained a lawyer in Nigeria, have they formally asked Google to Cease and Desist and requested compensation?<p>4: Why has Google not approached Mocality wrt purchase of their data?<p>5: Who has the relationship with any businesses that did sign up to the scammers? What will happen to that relationship and to the money paid?",1326506202

68,3463171,comment,3461582.0,3462675.0,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok, let me share my reasoning and assumptions which might make my position clearer.<p><i>""First, the system technically functions based solely on votes, but these votes can be changed by gerrymandering, hacking voting machines, rigging elections, etc. Don't pretend like your vote is some assured method of sending an impulse (however small) to the system. Note also that once candidates are in office, the system responds to their whims, and in turn many whims can be affected by extortion, blackmail, bribery, corruption, or whatever else.""</i><p>So let us separate out the difference between 'vote fraud' (aka the illegal manipulation of the vote) and voting legal voting changes (districts, rank-choice, open primary, etc etc).<p>While there are notable cases of voting fraud (the most famous perhaps being the Chicago elections) there is no evidence that such systems persist today. Conspiracy theories aside, I assume that most voting is legit in the US.<p>Now that leaves manipulation of the voting pool through either redistricting or voter polls manipulation (preventing undesirable voters from signing up or signing up more desirable voters). In a contest where voter turnout is < 60% and the winning margin is < 5%, getting half the people who don't vote at all to come in and vote intelligently (which is to say responsibly) will cause the correct outcome to occur.<p>To your second point:\n<i>""Second, you assert that you still vote when the incumbent isn't working out--you just vote against them. This is wrong, because the information you want to convey--'The candidate in office is not one I want'--is now altered to something else--'I want this particular candidate in office'. You've given away the ability to say 'None of these candidates are worth a damn, give us new ones'.""</i><p>The effect of eliminating the current incumbent is achieved. One of the ways people demonstrate that evolution works, rather than just a 'theory' as ID folks would suggest, is by creating a population where births and deaths are controlled by a simple fitness function, the simplest possible examples evolves to support the fitness function in a remarkably small number of generations. In our case 'death' is 'not re-elected'  and birth is 'elected.' Without any other influence we can show mathematically that because candidates want to be elected the fitness function will drive them to doing what this population of voters considers a 'good job' and away from what they consider a 'bad job'.<p>Now you and I may not agree with a district's definition of what that is, but the system will insure that the district gets what they want.",1326504001

ObjC has (to its credit) NSMutableData, but there's still u_char-star handling code there too (I also feel like --- but can't back up with evidence --- ObjC code is more likely to call out to C libraries like zlib).<p>* Both C++ and ObjC have error-prone ""automatic"" memory management: shared_ptr and retain/release, respectively. shared_ptr is risky because every place it comes into contact with uncounted pointers has to be accounted for; retain/release because it's ""manu-matic"" and easy to make mistakes. In both cases, you can end up in situations where memory is released and pointers held to it, which is a situation morally equivalent to heap overflows.<p>No, I don't think C++ and ObjC do an equivalent job in reducing memory corruption flaws.

Due to a catastrophic error in a logistics system somewhere, a bookstore in Ogaki City once received a shipment of English Battletech CCG cards.  Battletech is originally an off-brand knock-off of a Japanese series, the license was never very popular in Japan, this particular product had recently died due to lack of demand in the US, and geeky English products are not hot sellers in semi-rural Japanese agricultural/manufacturing communities.  So the bookstore tried to liquidate their stock, and put the sign ""100 yen"" (then about $0.80) on the box.  Battletech packs of cards retailed for about $3 each prior to going out of print.  Score, right?<p>On investigation, the unopened box was not a box of $3 booster packs.  It was a package of $10 starter packs.  And they were first edition.  And the store, not having been able to move even their Japanese CCG cards, was <i>not interested in opening the retail box</i> so they were selling <i>all the packs in the box meant to be opened by the retailer</i> for 100 yen.<p>I told the cashier that this was likely a pricing error.  He either didn't understand what I was saying or just didn't care.  So I bought a few boxes of boxes, for 100 yen apiece.  Then I found a Yahoo mailing list for fans of the trading card game... and promptly send them an offer which was about one step less unlikely than that from my forgotten grandfather from Nigeria.<p>A few spirited rounds of negotiation later, I went to the Post Office, dropped approximately half the profits on shipping (I was irrationally worried about being perceived as being a scammer, so I went for the expensive option), and cleared about a student loan payment.",1326503612
