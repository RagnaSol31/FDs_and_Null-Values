Like most wealthy individuals, he has investments across numerous asset classes. Many of those asset classes (equities, commodities, etc.) are heavily impacted by the Fed's policies. Needless to say, this individual is far more likely to feel comfortable pouring some money into a new VC fund he has been pitched when his other investments are doing well courtesy of Helicopter Ben's printing press.<p>Without willing investors, VC firms can't raise new funds and certainly, had there not been a massive pumping of cheap money into the global economy from the central banks, many of the massive VC funds, more than a few of which are being used to buy up shares in companies like Facebook and Zynga, would not exist.",1308448773.0

Perhaps you confused what I was talking about with GCC's auto-vectorization?</i><p>Those aren't gcc vectors, those are intrinsics.  Vectors use something like this:<p><pre><code>    typedef uint32_t v4si __attribute__((vector_size (16)));\n    v4si v16 = {v,v,v,v};\n</code></pre>\n__builtin functions that act on __m128 values are <i>separate</i> from ""GCC vector instructions"".",1308445535.0
