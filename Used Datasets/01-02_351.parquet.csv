In my experience, these can be discounted 50-75% if your account rep is hungry believes you can be more than a one-off client.<p>Second, you should take a hard look at how news-worthy your release is to the general public. If you're announcing a rewrite of your webapp into scala, then you should skip a press release and just target the handful of outlets in your niche. This can be a hard one to do since you may have spent the last 10mo tirelessly devoted to feature x and it's all you and everyone at your company talk about. Strive to regain focus and take a critical look at how exciting the mass media is going to find your announcement.<p>I've never just used a wire service and expected results. If you are a small startup and are really announcing something that meets the criteria of the paragraph above you'll probably land a few hits - small blogs, regional print, maybe a trade pub. Wire services should only be a small part of your strategy for announcing a new release.<p>The direct outreach is the most important for real results. Hopefully you've been building a list of media contacts that communicate relevant information about your industry, if not start now. If you haven't already, sign up for HARO (<a href=""http://helpareporter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://helpareporter.com</a>) and look for reporters who are actually looking to write about things your company does//makes//gives away.<p>On the day you release your update, I would send an email individually to those people on your list. Write them a short, personal message explaining what you've announced and why it's interesting. Add the text of your press release below your email and make sure to include ample ways for them to contact you (cellphone, aim, etc) if they're interested in any followup.<p>As for writing a press release: very few PR people will understand what you're doing as well as you. On the other hand, those people spend all day interfacing with the press you're after, so they have an idea of how to effectively communicate with them. I would suggest the best writer on your team takes a stab at writing the press release. Then pass it around for folks peer-review it (friends, girlfriends, english lit majors, whatever). Don't be afraid to cut down the verbage. Don't over-inflate your accomplishment(s). Don't use geeky terms.<p>One thing I've had great success with is teaming up with a college student who wants to get into PR. It's a great opportunity to cut their teeth on something real, and for you to have someone else obsess about the wording in the release while you manage the 500-or-so pre-release emergencies that tend to crop up.<p>Lastly, you should also take a look at marketwire. I've had experience w/ most of the wires you mention and mw was my fav for tech.",1265766925.0

Maybe he was a slave owner and didn't like disobedient, unproductive, or dishonest slaves. He may have at first thought this was just a problem with how he treated his own slaves that his neighbors had already fixed.<p>So he goes and asks his neighbors about it. He's not trying to rock the boat, just make a bit more money. He finds out his neighbors have the same problem. So that pushes him in the direction of seeing it as a problem with slavery in general. But he still expects there will be a solution that keeps slavery more or less in tact.<p>So then he looks for a solution. He tries different ways of treating his slaves and tries to figure out which result in more cotton production. As he learns about what works, it gradually leads him away from slavery.<p>This example shows how someone could end up becoming anti-slavery by accident, just by trying to solve immediate, practical problems.<p>There were also other ways to become opposed to slavery. For example, one could notice that slavery is an exception to widespread traditions that existed at the time. And one could wonder: what is the reason for making this exception? People did wonder that, and they had answers like that black people are less than human. But one could notice problems with those answers. They aren't very intellectually satisfying arguments and they had logical flaws. Or one might talk to a black man for an hour and notice he seems like a normal human.",1265766752.0

The credo was not to even bother remembering historical facts unless they help you explain why something happened. I always hated remembering facts. But I always really loved history. It wasn’t about facts, it was about explaining why something happened (with the facts as your tool) and finding out whether some explanations are better or more plausible than others.<p>Remembering just facts is no fun if you can’t use them for anything.<p>(The “whys” of history are more than cute little stories about individuals as this article makes it sound, though. Explanations can include economic data, statistics, maps, laws, newspaper articles, cartoons and all kinds of documents.)<p>PS, history as taught in the United States can’t be that bad. I just finished listening to a lecture about Germany prior to the First World War by Margaret Anderson (Department of History UC Berkeley – <a href=""http://history.berkeley.edu/faculty/Anderson/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://history.berkeley.edu/faculty/Anderson/</a> – the lecture is available as a podcast – oh, the joys of the internet) and it pretty much echoed exactly all the things we discussed in the last two years in school. It was pretty nostalgic all around.",1265765015.0

For one thing author has neglected engineering debt - it's far too easy for me to add features by sacrificing code quality or worse yet design quality (even adhering to the coding standards). There should be a way to measure engineering debt and take into account. One idea I have here is that a piece of code should have an owner that has incentive to keep code in good order, and that owner would accept money from developer who is making changes to compensate for the damage - if a change requires two week to cleanup a smart code owner would charge 2.2 weeks, thus coming out ahead and providing incentive for the developer to do a better job. But then the problem is that each piece of code becomes a monopoly with extortionist prices. There are two ways to deal with monopolies - regulate their prices or introduce competition (by direct action if needed).<p>The other problem is that this may get quite expensive.
