""Real FBI GPS Phone Tracker Pro"" (under various names) is another repeat offender. The description goes on to say that the application uses GPS satellites to pinpoint the location of any phone number, ""It works, guaranteed!"" and then as a last sentence mentions that it's a gimmick. This app repeatedly comes up to top 100 paid under different names and publishers. As soon as one version disappears, another comes up with another author and app name, but very similar description.<p>Example (top 41 right now in the US App Store): <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phone-tracker-spy-pro-locate/id379314242?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phone-tracker-spy-pro-locate/...</a><p>What's fascinating is that the reviews (if you browse through them) fall into two buckets: 5 star reviews proclaiming that it works, and highly negative reviews. This smells fishy. The 5 star reviews must be fabricated, if I know any better.<p><pre><code>    Buy it! \n     \n   by loganczyz\n   Buy this app!! I would of paid millions for it\n\n    awesome technology \n     \n   by Reynagreen\n   It should be prohibited .... big brother ..\n\n</code></pre>\nWord on the street is that these happen from operations that commandeer thousands of iTunes accounts to purchase and leave reviews, floating these apps to the top.<p>As a developer, I do find it kind of a bummer to spend many hours on my apps and then see these make it. Of course, I do know I should spend more time building apps and promoting them through creative means rather than being angry at the status quo.<p>However, I don't buy the argument that ""people want these kinds of apps"". I see the typical customer as a click-happy teenager who wants it to work, buys it, sees it doesn't work, and then forgets about the 99 cents wasted. In the meantime, the scammer gets wealthier.<p>I suppose this is no different from selling muscle supplements, acai berries, or get-rich-quick books, but still. Ugh.",1301709277.0

Rain water has radioactive isotopes in it. We've had a bit of rain, so our water supply has a drop in the bucket of basically-not-contaminated water.  Given the short half-lives of most of the isotopes, our water supply will not be contaminated (in any meaningful sense of the word).<p>>And who knows, maybe those isotopes can accumulate?<p>Who knows?  Hella people know.  Like anyone who's taken basic science classes.  They obviously will accumulate and then will radiate and change.  Some may concentrate in tissues (e.g. the thyroid), but the starting concentrations are too low to make a difference.<p>>just saying<p>I noticed that you're German, so I hope you don't mind me pointing out that the ""just saying"" idiom is seen as signaling either ignorance (by asserting something while simultaneously disallowing rebuttal) or humor.

Bananas and the sun will be responsible for loads of deaths; Fukushima will not.  The isotopes in bananas are also much worse because you ingest them: radioactive isotopes on the skin can be showered off; ones in your intestines ... not so much...<p>Also, paraphrasing the great Andre the Giant: you keep on using that word ""accumulate"", but I do not think you know what it means.<p>>Also, the Tacoma bridge was built by engineers, too, and yet it broke down. \n>Obviously engineers are not the infallible angels that you make them out to be.<p>I'm apparently an ""infallible angel"" and one of the best aspects of an engineering education is the notion of ""tolerances"".

What principle says that more temporal resolution equals better aesthetics? This seems like some sort of cultural bias, assuming higher fidelity = better aesthetics, which I don't think is true.<p>I tend to prefer more stylized films overall, not just in temporal resolution either. If you prefer more realistic ones that seem like you're really watching a scene that's happening, that's a legitimate preference, but it's not mine. I'm not sure the 24-fps (or better, 18-fps) effect is the most important or best anti-realism aesthetic effect in a film-maker's toolbox, but it's one of them. It's probably, as you say, an accident of history that it's as widely used as it is, but it's in my view a <i>positive</i> accident of history.

In the web speed is scalability because every web server is conceptually a parallel computation unit. So if the web page generation takes 10 ms instead of 100 ms I can server everything with just 10% of the hardware.""<p>If the database is the bottleneck then the speed of web page matters much less. A page with a single 50 ms query will take %40 of the hardware (60 ms versus 150 ms).<p>This is even much less of an issue if you take into account how long it took for his test. PHP served 1500 requests per second vs Ruby's 250 requests per second which is equal to 0.7 ms per page and 4 ms per page. Assuming again you have a single 50 ms database query you are looking at 50.7 ms vs 54 ms which means you will need ~94% as much hardware. This is assuming that the database and webserver are on the same machine.<p>If one puts them on separate machines then the time of execution does not matter as long as the time it takes to query the database is less than the time it takes to render the page. Now this is bad in terms of page load as 50 ms + 49ms for page rendering is much more than 50 ms + 0.1 ms but in both cases you will be able to serve the same number of requests per second. This of course assumes that this is running in a multi threaded environment which allows one thread to sleep and other threads to start while waiting for a response from the database.",1301706677.0
