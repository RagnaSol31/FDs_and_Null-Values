They were all linked in some way, a nasty chain of relationships.  I think some of the early talk might have kept the chain going.  The high school finally sent for proper grief counselors from the local university.  It had been 3 or 4 months of gloom.  I am not sure if they helped or it was just an ending, but they did stop (could have been the ending of winter thinking about it).<p>The truly sad part (beyond the ending of so many young lives) was the utter cynicism the rest of us got to.  The grief counselor who was dealing with our class was utterly horrified by us wondering how anyone commits suicide by using a door knob and how we concluded that someone was using the suicides to hide a murder.

I guess that is partially of his own fashioning.<p>He laid the practical foundation of digital circuits by noting the applicability of boolean algebra to circuit design. Electronic devices and computers are descendants of his work. After a brief hiatus to work on mathematical biology and cryptography he laid the foundation to the internet with his work on Communications/Information theory and contributions to sampling. His work on information theory is also vital in machine learning, Natural language parsing, compression and more; it finds utility in quantum physics and controversy in gravitational physics. He also had some of the earliest working examples of wearable computing, algorithmic trading, and artificial intelligence.<p>Arguably, mores so than any scientist of recent times, there is not a person whose work more thoroughly infuses and touches our lives than Claude Shannon.",1321235505.0

We all like to think they're living large and wish we had what they have but really it's all relative.<p>This lime of work (starting a business, startup, whatever you want to call it) is the furthest thing from easy and glamorous as you can get.
