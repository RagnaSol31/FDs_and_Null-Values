This implies that it is a perfect ""notch"" filter (absorbs only a specific frequency/wavelength) that can also be turned on and off.  Notch filters are very important in communications technology.  Being able to turn a perfect notch filter on and off is very interesting.<p>Modulation of light (lasers) is an obvious potential application, especially if it can be done very rapidly - direct modulation of lasers is somewhat tricky. <a href=""http://www.molphys.leidenuniv.nl/~thooft/laserweb/download/laser_modulation.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.molphys.leidenuniv.nl/~thooft/laserweb/download/l...</a><p>...of course, they have to build one first.",1280627950.0

The biggest problem with patents is that the non-obviousness step is almost ignored from my experience.<p>What they need is a way to determine whether an invention is an obvious extension or not. I suggest they do this probabilistically. Let's say it's a non-obvious idea if only 1/100 skilled practitioners would come up with it given the generic problem statement. Then it's easy to test. This would increase the cost of patents (a good thing imho) and dramatically decrease the number of spurious patents.<p>The interesting thing would be what proportion of inventions would qualify under this scheme.

For this, the standard practice seems to be to have a ""search"" button directly underneath however the search is configured (eg this what google search does for ""custom range"", for time, in web tools). So this would mean adding a ""search"" button beneath the sliders (not labeled ""update"", even though that is also an accurate description - I guess, maybeuse  ""moreofit"", if you want to promote the brand at possible expense of usability).<p>tl;dr add a ""search"" button beneath the ""searching for tags"" sliders.",1280625241.0

It might require more clicks to get there, but even the non-savvy user should be able to managed it.<p>I was impressed by the results returned by moreofit though, especially for websites that don't have numerous linkbait articles about ""Top 10 websites for ...."".<p>The tag importance sliders are especially neat, though one minor usability issue is that the update button (bottom right) is a long way away from the sliders and the text advising you to click it. The Google display ads returned when you do a URL search are horrendously irrelevant and probably deter users from clicking on the targeted text ads above them.",1280624687.0

If you quote a ""regular"" price then you might get screwed when the news comes out which has an impact on the price and you can't pull your quote from the market. So you end up either not quoting a price at all or quoting a much worse price to protect yourself from the news. In either case you result in worse pricing for everyone.<p>Shrinking times also have the advantage of improving price precision, when your talking about price moves over a very small period of time we can often be talking about very small price moves (say one-thousandth of a cent) which helps everyone. When before something may have been worth 213.314 you may have only been able to sell at 213.31, which for large deals can have a significant impact in high-volume markets, but with higher precision prices are more accurate.",1280624620.0
