Market-share is entirely irrelevant. What constitutes the definition (the reason the term even exists: what is meant to describe) is not how ""big"" a company is, but the _exclusivity_ (as in: is anyone else allowed to ENTER that sector of the market). And using the words ""effective monopoly"" or ""in practice/real world"" doesn't work as a permission to misuse the term, either. In fact, it does the opposite. Actual real-world ""effective"" monopolies would be: An entity holding a patent for some invention, the State having exclusive control of force, etc, etc.<p>Some company being ""the only company who is currently doing X"" is not a monopoly, as long as anyone else can enter the market.<p><a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monopoly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monopoly</a><p>BTW many of us developers are totally against the evil ""effective monopoly"" (see what I did there :P) that this not-so-pretty JavaScript language has in the world of web development, so the idea of more options doesn't sound bad at all.<p>Because last time I checked, there was no axiomatic law embedded in the fabric of the universe which stated that ""Every desired improvement and/or business endeavor in the realm of browser scripting should be expressed in the form of a proposal for a next version of JavaScript, over at <a href=""http://wiki.ecmascript.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.ecmascript.org</a>, or else the oh-so-heavenly multilateral dimension of the interweb net will fragment and spiral down eventually collapsing into a black hole made of kittens""<p>Dart is probably going to suck, though (and Java-stained ideas polluting its design will probably be the cause).

It is an age old economic strategy, but as far as I know it has never really worked before (from what I remember from economics textbooks). It would only work for a very short time. Say you hoard rice this year and sell only a little rice at exorbitant prices. Peasants the world over would increase their rice production, so next year there would be a lot more rice, plus your warehouses are already stocked to the ceiling with rice from last year. The prices will now be low - either you sell your rice for cheap, or you throw it into the river. In both cases, the attempt was not really worth it.<p>If I'm understanding you correctly, a similar argument was made in 2007 - it's actually really expensive to hoard millions of barrels of oil (which is what was assumed if people were speculating), it wouldn't be easy to hide and nobody had really found any evidence of it. I think Paul Krugman made this argument.<p>Then the bubble went POP pretty spectacularly. I think Krugman eventually admitted he was wrong there.<p>Hoarding wasn't necessary as the price increases from the futures market were transmitted to the actual market for oil (since most oil is bought on futures anyway, very little is bought at spot price) and the speculators weren't actually taking delivery of the oil they were just rolling the contracts forward. I assume a similar dynamic is in play for wheat right now.",1316049176.0

I'm not sure why they did given how much support he received from the banking industry. The reason he won was because the bankers preferred him over McCain and gave him dump trucks full of money. It's easy to see why so far. Basically we've had to give the bankers foot massages because a slap on the wrist would have been too mean for their tender hearts to handle. I'm not arguing McCain would have been much better but on this kind of nonsense he definitely would have been better.<p>And of course Obama doesn't know anything about the market and certainly does not believe in the free market to do anything. His latest jobs program should make that painfully obvious to anyone paying attention. The notion of the technocrat appeals to people who are smart and like solving problems. They feel like any problem can be solved with a good enough team and a smart leader (as an aside why does anyone believe Obama to be anything but an average intellect).
