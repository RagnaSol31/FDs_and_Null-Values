I certainly have some reading to do.<p>Can you explain a little more the notion discrete values and sampling rates and how that applies to stream processing?  I assume that it applies to sampling values of a process over time, but what would be an example in computation where the value would be considered continuous?  Is it similar to continuous vs discrete signal processing?",1413165591.0
