What I think, though, is that perhaps what most paid apps need is a way to do ""shareware"": allow the user to try for a day or a week, and then let apple block the app from working until the user buys it. There are a lot of apps that I would buy under this model that I don't due to fear/uncertainty/doubt (and in-app purchases for features don't really work for the same reason that I never know if those features are actually worth the cash, unless it's ""pay me to stop bugging you with ads"", which is really annoying).",1303869454

One reason why we were able to fix the dedicated databases quicker has to do with the way that we do backups on them. In the new Heroku PostgreSQL service, we have a continuous backup mechanism that allows for automated recovery of databases... We are in the process of rolling out this updated backup system to all of our shared database servers; its already running on some of them and we are aiming to have it deployed to the remainder of our fleet in the next two weeks.</i><p>Combined with multi-region support, this should make Heroku far more resilient in the future.",1303869436

It's just I see these pronouncements about a language, which frankly, I don't think can be backed up.  I like Lisp as a language.  I really do.  But to me that's not sufficient to annoint it a super language.<p>The evidence of its superiority is lacking.  The one thing that languages generate is work product, programs/libraries/etc...<p>In contrast, look at something like VB.  An oft-scorned language, but a language that you can walk into any Fortune 500 company and can probably find 10M LOC across the enterprise used for business critical purposes.  And further, the interesting thing about VB is that you probably couldn't have replaced the language with any other language and had the same productivity.<p>Now of course this last assertion is hard to prove.  But at least we have existence.  At least we can say, ""if there was a better solution than VB, no one used it"".  And it was rediscovered by every enterprise in the world.<p>Again, I'm not saying Lisp is a bad language.  But to the best of my ability it seems to be about on par with other modern languages (and that in itself might be compliment enough for some, given its vintage).  I see a couple of truly noteworthy Lisp projects, a lot of middling ones, and that's it.  About what I'd expect for a language with a user base of its size.<p>Over the past 40 years there hasn't been any mind-blowing Lisp projects.  And there's nothing wrong with that, I wouldn't necessarily expect it, except that its supposed to be a super language.  Not only a super language, but a language practiced by the brightest amongst us.  And by accounts of some evangelists, a toolchain that is magnitudes better than that available for other languages.<p>Yet as a result I typically get 3 projects noted to me when we talk about notable Lisp projects.  Emacs, ViaWeb, and ITA.  Three great projects.  But if someone said that they were written in C and not Lisp, everyone would believe it.  And when people go back and talk about important/influential software in history, Emacs is likely the only one to be mentioned.  And of course there's been tons of other very important SW that has been written in languages other than Lisp, from Tex, to Mosaic, to Lotus 123, to gcc, to iOS, to Google, and so on.<p>The worse is better, Lisp super-loner, rationalization seems like a pity party.  And what makes it sad is that it's simply not necessary.  There's no shame in liking a language for characteristics you find appealing.  But don't try to sell it as some super language.  Because when you do people will say that the proof of the pudding is in the tasting.  And the tasting are the programs.  If you want to show that Lisp can do what others only dream of, show us the programs that make us drop our jaws.  Show us the programs that make us rush to relearn Common Lisp.  RoR didn't catch on because it had a sexy name.  It caught on because the pudding was pretty tasty -- although a bit cloying for my taste.<p><i>Moreover, in no field of creative human endeavor have popularity and worthiness been correlated. You think all those billboard top 10 acts came from Juliard?</i><p>Are you arguing that for music that college serves little purpose?  That we're entering some type of music education bubble.  :-)",1303869339

And if no one supports all the great stuff people work on and put up for free on the Web, then we'll just get more and more obnoxious advertisements and more crazy schemes from big businesses.<p>At TipTheWeb (see my comments above), we think that by supporting the publishers of the stuff you like online, you're helping to make the Web a place that's more valuable to you.  We all want more of the good stuff and less of the crap.

I read it front to back and spent a couple years scrawling programs on paper, until finally the IBM PC was introduced and he bought one. I wrote a bunch of BASICA programs, including half a text adventure in a horrible mess of spaghetti. I spent hours with printouts spread across the floor, tracking bugs through thickets of GOTOs.<p>Then Dad got Turbo Pascal and I discovered the joys of structured programming. For my first project I wrote Conway's Life, and was shocked when it worked perfectly the first time. I never wrote another line of BASICA.<p>I went to college, thought I didn't want to program for a living and got a degree in anthropology. A few years later I had all kinds of crazy ideas for software running around in my head, plus I was tired of being broke.

Not using a tool that would yield better productivity for himself doesn't count as outcompeting people.  It counts as working as part of a team.  Part of my point is that the idea of out-competing people is a joke to begin with.  You succeed with your entire team.  You fail with your entire team.<p>Secondly, I dispute the notion that clever, compact code and extendable, maintainable code are at odds.  Code becomes extensible by simple virtue of there being less of it.  I <i>do</i> agree that clever, compact code is at odds with one thing:  someone else looking smart.  Do people write clever, compact code to look smart, or do you dismiss it to look smart?  Because my experience is that it's almost always the latter.  If I really <i>did</i> write the code in an unmaintainable way, they usually have more precise criticism than ""It's too clever and compact.""",1303867401

I think it all comes down to whether you feel recognition and respect for your work.<p>This recognition comes from yourself, your direct peers, your superiors, your subordinates, your customers, your friends, and your family. If any one group thinks lowly of what you do it has a strong effect. If all of them think that way it would be very distressing.<p>The only way anything matters is as it relates to recognition from any of those groups. Your own background and the people around you have a tremendous effect what works and what doesn't.<p>For example, a financial planner who made $5 million last year might be thrown into depression if they were reduced to doing taxes for middle-class clients for $50,000 per year. But a junior college graduate from a poor background might be filled with importance to have that opportunity. Likewise being praised by a Nobel laureate would probably be much different than being praised by your barber who thinks your app is cool.<p>So, figure out what would make you respect yourself. Work for someone who respects you and has customers that respect what they do. Have peers that respect you. And hire subordinates that respect you. Surround yourself with people whose respect is meaningful and earn it. Respect can come in the form of money, but any one form of respect can get negated if the others are lacking.
