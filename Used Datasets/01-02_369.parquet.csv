21,2600988,comment,2600650.0,2600886.0,14,0,ibdknox,,,"Haha, I guess I am unusually qualified to talk about those different domains. It's actually kind of funny - when I was interviewing with MSFT I begged and pleaded to get on the ASP.NET MVC team. I was previously a lead web developer and wrote a few different PHP frameworks back when rails was just starting to gain some popularity (and before anything good existed for PHP). So I thought I was <i>made</i> for that job, but apparently they thought the VS editor was a better fit ;)<p>So here's a list of my thoughts on the different communities:<p>Clojure: up and coming; very piecemeal (working on this here: <a href=""https://github.com/ibdknox/noir"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ibdknox/noir</a>); community very helpful and very responsive on issues; Clojure itself is beautiful; it's hard to beat DSLs built into the language, you can actually do everything (HTML, JS, CSS) in one language.<p>Ruby (Rails): now ""grown up""; lots of different modules for virtually everything you can think of; convention over configuration taken a bit too far; takes a while to just get started; but somehow maintains a low barrier to entry.<p>ASP.NET MVC: hosting remains an issue, though appharbor is working on it; they've come a long way; roughly equivalent to rails now, except when it somes to gems; lack of large gem-like community hurts; solid tools;<p>I think ASP.NET MVC suffers not because of the framework itself, but because of the mentality of the MSFT community; they wait for MSFT to deliver the things they want. Compare that to most other language communities (Ruby, Python, Node.js, Clojure, etc) and you see the polar opposite: everyone is writing tons of modules/gems/packages to solve all sorts of problems. Going too extreme on that front can be a problem too. The Node.js community, for example, suffers a bit from the decision paralysis created by everyone building modules for the same things.<p>Ultimately I settled on Clojure because I think it is one of the most intelligently designed languages I've ever used. While The web-side of things is still very much in the formative stage, it's actually further along than most people think. My startup (<a href=""http://www.typewire.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.typewire.io</a>, built by me and NathanHammond) is now entirely clojure, but we originally started with node.js. Over time, I became frustrated with the fact that JS code doesn't scale up to large apps well (it becomes messy no matter how hard you try, especially with something as callback heavy as node) and it didn't perform nearly as well as we'd hoped. The result of our transition, however, was a much smaller, more efficient codebase built on top of DSL's that make generating content so much easier. Writing your html directly in manipulable clojure data structures opens up a world of possibilities that I simply didn't have using standard templating solutions that most other frameworks rely on. My hope is that I can show some of this to others and am working to solidify what Clojure webdev can look like with my micro-framework Noir: <a href=""https://github.com/ibdknox/noir"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ibdknox/noir</a><p>In the end, there's a lot more for me to say here... it may be better for a blogpost or a real-life conversation. I'd be up for the latter if you'd like :)",1306806355.0

Facebook has 6 months of stuff in the pipe, but hasn't been deployed to the general public.<p>Is this important? It's impossible to tell. It all depends on how they quality control and implement changes. Facebook is very interconnected and giving it a third leg might cause a complication in how it runs. How it appears, given that my wife's facebook can be on a server down for maintenance and my account works perfectly fine, is that it might be in the facebook backend, but it could be taking them months to safely roll it out without downing their entire network.<p>Furthermore, who knows what will get released.

I didn't immediately post it because I figured it would be interpreted negatively/argumentatively.  That's not really my intent.  I am just thinking of your remarks in terms of ""fashion trends"":  Looking back historically, hemlines go up and down again, ties get fatter then skinnier again and so on.<p>I don't personally read any big significance into the possibility that this is part of a trend towards over-the-top, bling-bling, excessively flashy job-hunting techniques.  Maybe it is but I think the value in this particular post/microsite is that he seems to be genuinely interested in this company and that he made the webpage and posted it here rather than sending it directly to the company.  So it got notice because other people already vetted it for him so to speak.  I think sincere interest in a particular company is always something of value for that company.  I remember reading a story where a recruiter at IBM said he would hire the next person who knew what the letters ""IBM"" stood for because he was so sick of interviewing people who had zero idea what the company did.  Most folks who are job-hunting are just looking for a paycheck.  There is limited value in that from the perspective of the company.<p>That's not to point fingers at anyone.  I am as guilty of that as anyone and that is part of why I am still stuck in an entry level job in an industry I never had any interest in.  I'm a former homemaker who was going through a divorce and I needed a paycheck.  I did try to apply to jobs in the field I was training for/had relevant education for but I never completed my bachelor's and ultimately took the first job offered me, having nothing to do with any of that.  I am envious of Loren for having a clear idea what he wants to do and being in a position to go after it.  In terms of career, I have not ever been in that situation: I either knew and wasn't qualified or didn't know (and also had other significant obstacles).  I sincerely wish him all the best.

In those scenarios the exceptions serve as a vehicle to bubble state through multiple layers. Pretty much like an event-framework, except many people don't realize they have that baked right into their language.<p>A simple example would be a network-server that detects a protocol phase change at the lowest protocol level. By raising a ""PhaseChange""-Exception you can quite nicely propagate such an event to the higher layers that need to know about it, without resorting to duplicated/shared state or awkward call-chains that introduce nasty dependencies and then need their own exception handling, and without running into potential synchronization issues.",1306805326.0
