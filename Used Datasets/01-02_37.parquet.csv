The ""shared dream"" is very analogous to a movie.<p>Stokes' interpretation doesn't look deep enough. He attempts to figure out what is really happening before, after, or even during the movie. I find more use in interpretations that try and figure out what something means and what the underlying message the writer/director is making (if any).<p>Stokes focuses too much on plot and not enough on meaning. Reminds me of people who think the Six Sense is awesome (pretty much everyone) because of its amazing plot twist. But that's all it really had--not too much meaning. A movie worth analyzing shouldn't just stand on plot alone. Thankfully Inception has both an awesome plot and some decently profound meaning.",1280714206.0

I don't think I would want to invest at FB at the currently quoted 25$ billion level if I had to leave my money there for a very long time; so much can change, and I share some concerns about the company's future, at least where valuation is concerned.<p>The question here though, is about an IPO. I think that the markets would eat up FB, but it's dicey to try to time such things -- have a look at Tesla, for example! -- and easy to be correspondingly burned. I presume that if we follow this question to its logical conclusion, assuming Facebook has an IPO sometime in 2011, I don't know I'd want to take a bite - I think it would get overvalued in the public markets, especially at first, and I am not sure about long-term growth. Huge potential, but can they execute? I would want more diversification, and I wouldn't want to buy a small enough chunk of FB to feel safe about that investment; wouldn't be much point. I would be happy to have it join a roster of other more broad tech investments of mine, though, all things considered.<p>Interesting to see the contortions FB has to make to stay under the 500 ",
