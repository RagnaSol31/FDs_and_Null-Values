A call option to buy the stock for the fixed price of $5 (until it expired next Friday) sold for 80 cents when the market closed.<p>* 3Com is up 2 bucks (35%) in the after market. The value of that call option will increase by around that mount. So the price of the option went up from 0.80 to ~2.80. That is an increase of 250%, which is way higher than 35%. This leverage is one reason people trade options.<p>* The option buyer used a market order (""bought on the ask"") to buy a <i>ton</i> of options, which is executed immediately at current market price. More cautious buyers tend to use a limit order in markets that don't trade a lot (like this one). A limit order will buy at no more, or sell at no less, than a specific price.

There's no random chance associated with where you're born - it was the result of what your parents and their parents did. They worked hard to get over to the States, or wherever else, and to make a good life for their kids.<p>Actually, that whole viewpoint that's come into fashion these days worries me a little. Before, one of the biggest ethics to live for was ""making life better for your children"" - you'd work hard, and sacrifice, knowing your kids would have a better life than you did. It's what my Great-Grandparents did, what my Grandparents did, what my Parents did. All came up poor, I came up lower middle class, my kids will probably come up reasonably wealthy.<p>But nowadays, a lot of people write that off as the ""birth lottery"", or luck, or chance, and think that happiness in your own life, right now, is the highest virtue. They even <i>almost</i> look at it as a bad thing for parents to work very hard for their kids specifically to have the best life they could, calling it things like a birth lottery or random chance.

By their inherited wealth, scions of prominent families can exercise significant power over the rest of the nation, and this power will tend to be exercised to the detriment of meritocracy, since a system that rewards talent and energy runs exactly contrary to the interests of the inherited-wealth class. (Humans care about <i>relative</i> wealth and power socially, even though absolute wealth production is not a zero-sum game)<p>However, it is true that being able to pass on wealth to one's children can be an incentive to produce more, so <i>that</i> on the other hand points to the benefit of a lower estate tax.<p>So, I think the best compromise is somewhere between the pro-meritocracy 100% tax and the pro-short-term-productivity 0% tax; that way there is still a significant incentive to earn for one's offspring, but if 1/x of the money is taxed away in each generation (and the important thing is not where it goes, but that it is taken out of the hands of the rich family), there is an exponential-decay curve for the wealth and power of the family.
