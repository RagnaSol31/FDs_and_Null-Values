These tools have been used to build networks of previously unknown terrorists, put murderers in jail (two of which I had the pleasure of testifying for in high profile cases pro-bono), and frequently (on a daily basis) finds smoking guns in child rape and molestation, grand theft, kidnapping, and a number of other cases to which you should be thankful that you are entirely oblivious to. If you knew what really went on in our society, you'd be helping the good guys out too. I imagine you probably have in your mind some redneck cop pulling you over and checking for text messages on your phone illegally, or some other stupid misappropriation of authority... 99.99% of the time, these tools are used for the right purposes, and against people who might be living on your street, committing unspeakable offenses in private.<p>Now, as for the tools, saurik is entirely correct. The PIN code is, for the most part, just a GUI lock - think of it as a screen saver lock. The file system is encrypted on the chip, but applications need to be able to read and write from the file system. If you read the FAQ, I make no secret about how this works: we boot a custom RAM disk (from DFU mode) that mounts the disk. The kernel takes care of the decryption and because we're not actually booting the OS on disk, we don't have any pesky screen saver lock or anything else to even content with, though if we did, the forensic imaging process runs entirely in the background, and has the same level of access (root) that most of Apple's processes do.<p>As for encryption, what IS encrypted on disk that you can't get from the file system includes keychain passwords, HFS journal (to undelete files, thanks to Jean-Baptiste's most awesome code), and files protected with iOS' data-protection classes. These files are few and far between. In fact, a vast majority of the evidence you'll find on an iPhone is entirely unencrypted. For the files that ARE encrypted, Jean-Baptiste's brute forcing and decryption tools allow us to extract the master encryption keys from the device. Each keychain password is encrypted with its own key (""AES wrap""); we apply the device's keys to this wrap, decrypt the password's key, then use that key to decrypt the password. Apple's data-protection classes are about the same. Each file is wrapped and we use one of the class keys to ultimately decrypt the file. This includes the few files on the device that are encrypted, such as email + attachments, and some third party data files using this encryption.<p>Once you unwrap that, you'll find that even applications using their own encryption code are storing keys in the keychain - so once the keychain is decrypted, the keys to these third party crypto stores are equally exposed.<p>The moral of the story here is that the only GOOD way to protect files is 1. To encrypt them (something Apple really doesn't do very well), 2. To have the encryption depend on a very complex key that only the owner has knowledge of and must supply in order to decrypt the files, and finally 3. To protect the device in such a way that the key cannot be intercepted by trojans or other malware. Unfortunately, iOS fails on all of these counts, making it very easy (thanks to many world class hackers contributing code) to defeat all of the encryption on the device, and MOST of the encryption even when the device is password locked.<p>Scary? What's scary here is just how neglected security is on mobile devices, and how easy it would be for me, or Saurik, or anybody who can use code.google.com to steal all of the data on your device in just a few minutes.",1317952602.0

My personal favorites are a combination of a new calendar, new lat/long system, and new set of timezones.<p>The calendar has eight months of 28 days and four months of 35 days (so that every month has an exact number of weeks, so that a given day of the month is always the same day of the week).  The first day of the year exists outside of the months (month zero, day one), and would colloquially be ""new year's day.""  When a leap day is needed, it is added as an extra day at the end of the year (month thirteen, day one), and would colloquially be ""leap day.""  The order of the months would be short-long-short-short-long-short-etc (so that each season has one long and two short months).<p>Whenever I'm in a situation where I can't keep myself engaged by reading or conversation (e.g. waiting in line with no wireless signal), I amuse myself by dreaming up crap like this.",1317952035.0

CCP is both brilliant for making it and foolish in their managing of the game. I recall during a war that had virtually every PvP player engaged that lasted years the side I was on felt like we were actually fighting the company itself since one of their employees was involved with cheating on the other side's behalf. As I recall the employee was never fired for acting in a way that managed to really piss off thousands of paying customers. Many left but many stayed just to not be whiners about it.<p>I can't say I'm surprised that they made such poor choices in directing the game. They want it to not be a niche game but that's what they have and they should probably be happy that they have what they have. Unless you're engaged with other players it isn't even a game at all. It's actually more like playing a video game within a video game. Shallow doesn't even describe it-I've felt more engaged playing missile command.<p>That said it sounds like they're going to try to fix things which is good. I hope the game does well.

But either way, I believe that it refers to the property of not being tied to Web specifically, but rather any resource in the internet. All URLs require more or less specific application to handle them; web browser for http-URLs, mail client for mailto-URLs etc. I don't think that fb-URL is any worse. You could register your browser to handle them, or use a native application, based on your preference. If Facebook would be forced to use http-URLs then you wouldn't have that choice.",1317949311.0

They aren't yet NetSuite but $50/month is not going to break the bank (and that's for a deluxe plan). There are plenty of upscale restaurants and successful businesses (like Salesforce, Oracle, or even Google/Facebook) that don't front page the price.",1317949258.0

The Linux community, for example, has spent many years divided, building several window managers and hundreds of distros, never focusing on what is really important to consumers, in general.  The iPad already has more Internet market share than desktop Linux in a very short period of time.<p>Was that better guys?  Personally I like my first response better.
