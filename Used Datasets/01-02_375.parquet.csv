For obvious reasons they don't talk about the details of their software much.<p>The nub of our disagreement: the definition of an embedded system. Per Wikipedia, ""An embedded system is a computer system <i>designed to perform one or a few dedicated functions</i> often with real-time computing constraints.""<p>So a cheap MP3 player counts as an embedded system, because playing audio is what its hardware and software is designed for. A personal computer, in whatever physical form, that runs a variety of applications, including audio players, is not an embedded system. And therefore, no, I don't count smart phone applications as embedded systems software. If you're writing device drivers that are burned into a smart phone's ROM, on the other hand, then I'd consider it embedded software.<p>When you find hardware running Android that's designed to be dedicated to a single task, such as, say, a climate control system, then you can count it as an embedded system.

It may seem obvious, but the most difficult time for bees is during winter; almost all hive deaths occur during the colder months.

I went there to do Communications and Electronic Engineering in 1981 because it was famous (our own MIT) and hard to get into and I was very disappointed.

""It is important to note that these issues are by no means specific to Azure; similar teething issues affect other Platform-As-A-Service providers such as Google App Engine and Heroku""<p>Deployment on Heroku takes seconds in my experience. Certainly not 30 minutes!<p>Also, db backups on Heroku are easy. And if you don't want to use Heroku's built-in PostgreSQL db, it's easy to use Amazon's RDS instead.<p>It seems strange to imply that Heroku currently has the same problems they attribute to Azure.",1292288801.0

I highly doubt the Python added much overhead (we were using OpenCV, which is compiled), and it still wasn't very elegant; however, you make an excellent point. Once we can push web technologies to make JavaScript capable of computer vision, or use other technologies/plugins that empower computer-vision in-browser, simple applications like video surveillance will get much more interesting.<p>EDIT:\nJust a thought, wouldn't it be cool if we didn't have to ring doorbells anymore? There'd be a webcam instead of a lens on the door, and a small computer that notifies you when someone's at your door. It could even tell you who they are if we create adequate recognition technologies.",1292288795.0
