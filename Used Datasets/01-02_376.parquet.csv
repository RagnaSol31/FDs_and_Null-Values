This is difficult for a computer to solve, but not impossible to break.<p>How would this reveal the CAPTCHA value to a human but not to a computer? If the string is readable over only some background colors, then it's written on a transparent-backed image, so the whole background-changing script can be ignored. Just OCR the image with the transparent background.<p>If you're suggesting the CAPTCHA itself be the movement of the mouse over specific inputs, rather than deciphering a string, then this is trivial to break as well. The code that watches the mouse events and does whatever it does to indicate human-ness has to be written in JavaScript and transmitted to the browser... which means it's sitting right there to be analyzed and copied by the bot author. They don't need to replicate the mouse movement, just trigger the same code the correct movement triggers.<p>Requiring previous state adds nothing to the test either. If a human has to visit a certain sequence of pages before submitting a form, the bot can make the same sequence of HTTP requests and replay the same cookies or however you track the state.<p>It doesn't sound like you know what you're talking about.",1339724968.0

28,4114532,comment,4114206.0,4114206.0,6,0,robomartin,,,A big part of that is that Apple controls the horizontal and vertical (sorry if you are too young to get the reference). I would imagine they have customized store builds that they can easily restore to a normal state when someone royally screws it up.  Then there's probably a level of reasonable user level protection setup (no admin access).  I've never tried going into an Apple store and tried to do admin type things.  I'd be interesting to see how they deal with that.<p>The contrast is even sharper in other countries.  In some places it is a huge cultural no-no to go into a store and start touching stuff.  Just try going into a toy store in one of these places with a US-raised kid used to ToysRUs.,1339724919.0

Most functions are quite fast, and fine to just poll, and it's quite convenient to be able to bind to functions when needed.<p>But it's all tradeoffs - in our app we have a few that aren't - for those, we profiled to find them, and added a bit of code to the functions to cache the return value.",1339722170.0

138,4114416,comment,4111667.0,4113742.0,2,0,wendsday,,,"The solution I often contemplate is to address the process by which the data is created.  (Let's assume we're talking about data you would find on the web.) That is, why don't we impose rules on that process?  Why can't we ""mandate"" that the output be structured data from the get go?  Instead we allow vast quantities of unstructered data to be created and then we try to normalize it.  I know this is a radical view, but it could make sense in some circumstances.<p>I disagree with your comment about CSV.  But it's impossible to have a meaningful argument unless you provide an example: Give me a job to do, a CSV file and let me have a go at it.  I'm serious.  Post a link to a CSV file, define a task and let's see what we can do just using plain ole UNIX.  Could be a fun exercise.<p>As for your hypothetical command, I do not understand what is so difficult about this.  The stat command is what you want, not ls.  No self-respecting UNIX user would parse ls when he can use stat (I recommend the BSD one over GNU.).<p>But here's what I would do:<p>1. If your UNIX filenames have spaces in them, rename them.   There is no sensible reason to leave spaces in filenames in UNIX.  Fix this first before it becomes a problem.<p>2. Write a one-liner and save it as a function, perhaps in your .profile, or maybe in RCS, or save it as a script.  There's so many ways to manipulate output as a stream.  Pick one that suits your tastes.  That's the beauty of UNIX.  Make your own solutions as you go.  There is no right or wrong answer.  It is a form of customization.  My choice will no doubt make some people cringe. Assuming there's no user named ""[0-9]M"":<p><pre><code>   whatever(){ ls -lhS |tr '\011' '\040'|sed '/ [0-9]M /!d' ;}\n</code></pre>\nor save what's between the brackets as a file named ""whatever"".  Maybe you save it in a directory called ""x"" and add that to your PATH. Then you do<p><pre><code>   . whatever\n</code></pre>\nOf course how long the list of files is going to be makes a difference.  I might take a different approach if the output was going to be an enormous list.<p>There are so many ways to get what you're after.  The point is that you should be able to tap out a one-liner that does the job.  Maybe it takes a few iterations to get the right output.  Tweak it until the output is what you want.  Viewing command-line history is perfect for seeing the process of creating a one-liner to manipuate output.  You can see the line grow incrementally as you build it, until you finally have the output you want.  This sort of history allows you to go back to any stage in the process.  If you're a vi fan, you can use vi-mode on the command line to move around the line quickly as you edit.  Eventually you can hit ""v"" and edit the thing visually in your EDITOR, then save it.  I've built over 700 useful functions this way and the number keeps growing.<p>I do understand there should be a way to ""extract"" the file size column the way Pike decribes in the article.  To do this I think you have to free yourself from ""line-oriented"" thinking and imagine another type of structure.  And I think using another language you can do it.  But for something as simple as this -- manipulating ls command output (cf. manipulating large datasets) -- an ""ugly"" one-liner suits me fine.  The more you use the boring old utilities the more you can get them to do.<p>Regular Expressions are indeed ""crude"".  But, to me, that is just fine in a lot of cases.",1339722058.0

Any time you see someone complaining about the 30% cut, you can be sure that they don't have business experience. In some businesses the middleman gets a bit lower, in others a bit higher, but 30% is boringly normal.<p>Do you think the farmers make more than 70% of the retail price you pay for food in a supermarket? At an eatery? Do you think that book authors (before or after the internet) get more than 70% of the retail price of each book?<p>In selling things, the creation of the thing is important, yes.
