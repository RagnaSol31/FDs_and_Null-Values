Just because more people groupon, does it make competitors less valuable?  Is it a barrier to have emails from livingsocial <i>and</i> groupon arriving in your inbox every day?  Groupon is almost the complement of fb -- fb had huge lockin, but no obvious monetization method.  Groupon has obvious monetization, but no lockin that I can see.<p>I also question in the long run how many businesses have large enough customer LTVs that selling stuff below cost is worth it to hook customers.

We will be equal when a woman hits a man in the face, and the man responds in kind by punching her, and nobody says anything about ""hitting a woman"".</i><p>There's a reason that social moor exists. Until women catch up in physical power, or men regress, most men will have the power to seriously injure a woman and walk away unharmed, unless the woman is trained or armed. As such, it is a man's duty to take responsibility for this difference, and that is where the taboo on striking a woman came about. There's a partner taboo as well- regarding children- that exists for exactly the same reasons.<p>Would you argue that someone more powerful does <i>not</i> have a responsibility to manage their strength, and using brute force on women and children should <i>not</i> be considered reprehensible?",1291427765.0

In the first few cases I felt obligated to stay - I'd given my word, right? But the bullshit just meant that I just ended up contributing to the toxic environment by being an asshole out of resentment. I began to wonder if it was just me. Others certainly insisted it was. About six years ago I got a therapist and a psychiatrist. Best thing I've ever done. It was clear after talking to a professional that the situation was toxic. I got myself onto a smaller team within that company with some awesome people and really enjoyed myself. Unfortunately the toxicity remained, our lead quit, and we instructed to do what our lead would not. I'm quite proud that our team said ""no"", and said that the plan we already had was the right one. We were all let go. Ok, <i>that</i> was the best thing I've ever done.<p>My advice, then, if you are up for it, is to imagine what <i>would</i> light you up at this company. What would get you excited about it again? Figure that out, and do it. If you really are that good, then have faith in yourself. Give yourself a shot. Give your partners a shot. And if it doesnt work, quit. Unless this company is curing cancer its just not that important.<p>PS What amazes me about toxic environments is not the number of toxic assholes (actually quite small), but that most everyone else chooses to be enablers for these people.<p>PPS I did go on meds, but as another poster says here, it can take a while to find the right one - one can make you wired, another lethargic. The best thing to do is exercise and eat right; but the meds can help you get started (IMHO).",1291427459.0

I don't see a reason in having a corporate entity for making apps, let alone more than one.

Intellectual property belonging to the corporation may become another issue (I've heard some horror stories about this; make sure you transfer all IP to the corporation).

I've even heard stories about people incorporating through LegalZoom and never actually issuing stock to anyone.<p>Also, there <i>is</i> a reason for incorporating in Delaware.

It's not like free AdWords would change the limiting factor on the Groupon model - the limiting factor on the Groupon model is the speed with which Groupon can add cities and salespeople: two things where Google can't help one iota.  And, to date, Groupon has shown an ability to expand faster into new cities/countries than LivingSocial and all the also-rans.<p>I also don't think group buying is going away in, say, 20 years.
