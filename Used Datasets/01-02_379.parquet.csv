Also, larger companies that have high turnover, etc don't exactly inspire warm fuzzy feelings in employees, there isn't some magic formula, you have to realize that people probably aren't as stupid as you take them to be, on average, and you can't trick them into caring, you need to give them a reason to actually want to see the company do well. The more responsibility / talent an employee has the more they feel that they can get another job, if needed, and therefore their fate isn't tied to the fate of the company.",1324087138.0

And that's what socialism vs capitalism is all about: the way the economic activity is conducted in a country, and the way it affects everyone's life. The regimes were different in Castro's Cuba and Pinochet's Chile, and saying they were both a dictatorship is a way of sweeping that difference under a carpet.<p>I'm sorry, but it's ludicrous to claim that the Eastern bloc countries were not socialist. The most charitable way I can characterize it is as an extreme instance of the no-true-Scotsman fallacy.<p>Certainly during those regimes' existence no one seriously doubted they were socialist (except people who wanted to redefine the word ""socialism"" for their ideological benefit). In fact, even Chomsky realizes he has to explain that somehow and makes up justifications for why the West called USSR socialist and for why the USSR called itself socialist. Those justifications are idiotic, by the way (he's claiming the Soviets called themselves socialist to get sympathy from Western socialists, as if the internal propaganda and ideology weren't in any case by far, by x1000 the more important reason).<p>It's also not true that ""the entire country was owned by a small clique"", etc. It was not owned, it was <i>controlled</i>, and the 'small clique' (actually the Party bureaucracy) ostensibly represented the will of the workers, through formally functioning though farcical mechanisms such as elections, the extensive Communist Party hierarchy down to individual members, etc. It was not quite a dictatorship - dictators tend to pass their countries to their offspring or in absence of those to hand-picked successors. In the USSR, the power went to another top Party official after an internal power struggle. Never to a descendant (compare with North Korea, which is closer to a socialist dictatorship).<p>Now having centralized control over the economy by, say, the top echelons of the Communist Party, representing the will of the people, is an idea that's <i>perfectly</i> compatible with socialism and Marxism. That is why, in fact, countless socialists in the West supported the Soviet Union and saw it as the torch-bearer of the socialist dream; they were <i>not</i> confused about the fact that the economy in the USSR was under central control! Now many of them <i>were</i> naive in thinking that the Party leadership really represented ""the will of the people"", which it generally didn't. But that's not a reason to say it wasn't socialism; it's a reason to say, maybe, that it was bad socialism, socialism gone haywire, a socialist dictatorship, what have you. But it was, very clearly and unmistakably, socialism. Just as if in a capitalist country an oligarch clique takes over all the real power, that's not a reason to stop considering it a capitalist country. If you don't do that, the no-true-Scotsman fallacy destroys any chance you have of objectively observing whatever it is that actually happens in socialist or capitalist societies, and learning whatever lessons there are to learn from that.",1324084100.0

To a first approximation, it's easy to throw up a LAMP site and sell random crap.  Once you get beyond this and start trying to squeeze out profits by building and executing on various optimization problems, things get significantly more complex.  Companies like Amazon and Wal-Mart have invested huge amounts of money into esoteric research to optimize supply chains, fulfillment processes, inventory control, promotional returns, energy usage, expected customer value, etc, etc, ad infinitum.",1324083860.0

For even a short period, if enough people simultanrously just said ""No, thanks.  We value a free Internet more than your movies and TV"", then these movie studios might take notice.  As long as internet users keep seeking these movies and TV programs from pirates online, Hollywood is not going to relent.<p>Do nerds really understand what SOPA says?<p>Business located outside the US having no jurisdictional ties to the US are not going to be sued as a result of SOPA.  It does not try to create extraterritorial jurisdiction.<p>This bill only extends to US businesses that pirates use: e.g., US-based ISP's, domain name registrars, ad networks, payment processors.  And they carry no liability.  They are merely subject to injunctions.<p>This is a far cry from a Great American Firewall.<p>But yeah, it will be nerds that build such a firewall one day.  They are already head over heels into spying.  And that does not say much for nerd solidarity.",1324083818.0

I was giving this solely as an example of why making statements about the future and basing arguments about some future state cannot work. Yet you take it as some trick to avoid having to explain the paradox.<p>(Your analogy with pretending that the word false doesn't mean false is entirely off base. I don't see the correspondence. But no matter.)<p>I think I've found a formulation that won't offend your sense: due to time's arrow and causality (which both go forward in time), one cannot make an induction that goes backward in time. This would cause a circular dependency in the inductive proof.<p>In this case, the steps of the inductive proof go from Friday, down to Thursday, Wednesday, etc. Yet at the same time, causality goes from Wednesday to Thursday to Friday. One cannot simply dismiss causality.<p>IOW, we have the inductive process N, N+1, N+2, where N is used to proove N+1, etc and where N = Friday, N+1 Thursday, all the while N state depends on N+1 because due to real-world causality, what happens on Friday depends on Thursday.<p>You seem to wish to deny causality.",1324083642.0
