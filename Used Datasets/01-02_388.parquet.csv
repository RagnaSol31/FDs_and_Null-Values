Otherwise, stay clear.</i><p>This would address my other concern, having my car tracked in parking lots by private businesses.<p>Being able to detect a camera seems a knotty problem though.  Maybe have it use GPS and enter locations where the plate needs to be impossible to scan from a distance.",1350694813.0

The only solution was making a second plate mechanically fall over the real plate. I had planned on using infared LEDs which ran off of the car's battery. Only cameras would pick them up.<p>It's awesome to see this actually being implemented and sold. Even though I had absolutely nothing to do with this, it's cool to see the product come to life.",1350694811.0
