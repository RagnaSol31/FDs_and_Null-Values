Chances are, he would have gotten it. This would have mitigated the career damage and gotten him a good job much sooner.<p>Remember that a severance offer is a starting point. If the only thing you want to add in negotiation is something that doesn't cost the company money-- good reference and a revision of the record to say you left voluntarily-- they'll usually give it, unless you did something illegal and they're afraid to give you a good referral for liability reasons.<p>Getting fired is something that happens to a lot of good people... for all kinds of bizarre and stupid reasons.

Finding uncorrelated investments in large groups of <i>standardized assets</i> is actually as much a tricky social science project as it is a green-eyeshades math problem, right?<p>When you AAA a product built out of supposedly uncorrelated risks that turns out to be correlated, you're fucked.<p>So, to extend your analogy: suppose you designed instruments backed by $5 debts from college students. And suppose as time goes on, Ivy League students used it less and less, while at UMich-Flint the program spread like wildfire. At some point, without even changing the explicit structure of your instrument, basic market forces might up converging on highly correlated (and very risky) buckets of risk, mispriced at AAA (or whatever).<p>And all the while, every incentive is set up to get people to throw away unfavorable results and cherry pick the most lucrative interpretations.<p>My point (you are by this point I am sure exasperated with me) is that ratings agencies and product designers are trying to build models to assign risks to quickly moving targets, by taking a spot measurement of the current correlation coefficients and extrapolating them.<p>Whereas on the other hand the credit history and business model backing BRK is (relatively) straightforward.",1310780318.0

No Apple is not immune to anything, they could benefit or pay horribly like anyone else.  When they infringe on people's (valid) patents I believe Apple should pay the appropriate penalty.  Conversely when other companies infringe on Apple's (valid) patents I believe they should pay the appropriate penalty.  Thirdly patents that should not have been issued (i.e. many of them) should be deemed invalid.

45,2769837,comment,2767879.0,2768929.0,15,0,sbaqai,,,"I agree with your view of procrastination. I think there's a good portion of it that is due to the points you make.<p>However, there's something else to be added to the discussion about procrastination that has to do with people's temperament and unhealthy ideas they have of work (and themselves).<p>For example, one problem people might have is they tie their self-worth to the outcome of their goals. You can see why that could cause a lot of anxiety and stress. Using your examples, if you needed to win every time you played video games, and it was a source of great confidence and self-esteem for you - the moment you're in a situation where you know there's a chance you might loose, it will become a lot harder to get the energy to practice/play. It has nothing to do with enjoying video games in and of itself - it has to do with connecting your worth to the outcome. Even hanging out with friends can become a hassle if people think they need to control the outcome somehow.<p>This happens in school (in college,where for the first time people may not be getting the top grades and in highschool grades were the source of great pride and acceptance and popularity), and at work (if you screw something up you think you'll be considered an idiot and possibly be fired). A lot of people, somehow and at some point, develop some sort of inner drill sergeant who tells them they are no good until they get X done - and this works well enough when you're young and use to being forced to do things by other people anyway and are looking for approval from adults and peers. But as people grow independent they realize they really don't like the way they talk to themselves or at the least, they start not to care about what the drill-sergeant in them wants.<p>To people who do not have these cognitive traps, these problems are invisible. They are likely to think procrastinators are inherently lazy/undisciplined because that is what they can visually conclude (and it also reinforces the idea they are not lazy and are disciplined).<p>Another trap is not viewing work in the correct context. People feel they are being 'forced' to do something. That reinforces the idea that the work isn't very pleasant, and they would be doing something else if they could. Well, thats the wrong way to frame the problem. It focuses on your feelings, transient and often miscalculated. A healthier way to frame work is to consider cost vs reward. We tend to highlight the cost of work and compare it to the rewards of procrastination.<p>Also, people who procrastinate may also not take breaks when working, or set aside time to enjoy their life - they are stuck in a perpetual grind where they feel like crap/imposters if they take their attention off  work. That very pressure is what renders them unproductive.<p>Anyway, if this stuff seems interesting to anyone, I recommend checking out ""The Now Habit"" by Neil Fiore. I found it to be one of the few books that frames procrastination as a symptom rather than a cause. It has a lot of interesting insights if you don't feel the you lack discipline or are lazy, but may not be framing things (or talking to yourself) in the healthiest way.",1310780081.0

HTC (also mentioned in the headline) is not a household name and it is a huge part of Android.  This isn't just bad news for HTC, it's arguably worse news for Android because the patents are reportedly fundamental to the OS.  If HTC (et al) can't import Android phones or the fees make the cost of it too high they're just going to switch to WP 7.<p>Media:  the media isn't taking sides here, the ITC did and the media is reporting that.

How has everyone here dealt with this? Any advice would be helpful? Thanks.",1310778323.0

How much is that worth - $5, $20, more?  (there's a lot of streets, and I'm always surprised how often I find a coin).<p>But I can guarantee that it's worth at least $1.00.  That would be a AAA risk.  And Moody's would rate it so, just by looking at the statistical properties of coins * streets.<p>This adds 1 security to the totals.  The 'new idea' is that investors were willing to invest in new 'slices' of existing pools - chosen so that they'd get a AAA rating.<p>The idea itself isn't bogus.  But the historical statistics  of the subprime market were not valid for the wave of 'new money' moving into the Florida & Vegas markets...  Subprime mortgages were a different animal than the rating agencies modeled, and no-one had any incentive to call them out on it.",1310778292.0

I've heard that employers do significant background checks now.  Low credit scores are a red flag.  Arrests are also a red flag.  Not convictions, but <i>arrests</i>.<p>The social thing sounded a bit weird to me.  But then, <i>most</i> of the people I've worked with either base their social scene around their work, or around something else (e.g. church).
