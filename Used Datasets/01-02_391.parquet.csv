Mainly, they want to promote job creation and increased productivity, which is in theory done through reinvestment.<p>When you reinvest into equipment, the logic goes that the productivity increases and new higher paid jobs are created even though the lower end labor is eliminated or reduced.<p>Increasing capital gains tax would in effect make everyone accelerate the sale of their company before the taxes are effective, so it was a mass liquidation of capital.<p>But, I don't believe it would discourage investment because people would simply tax plan around the capital gains tax.  A while back, during Reagan and friends presidency, the personal income tax as well as capital gains tax was more than 35%.  People actually invested more into corporations because the corporate tax rates were lower (ironically).",1311127095.0

When, out of hundreds of hires, a handful match the criteria, it's easy to look back at data collected at hiring time, and find out if there are correlations (not causations).<p>> <i>I think you're a history buff and so you assume that it must correlate meaningfully, just as programmers who are into music, or art, or whatever else do.</i><p>Wrong.  History isn't a primary interest. I enjoy a variety of things more. I believe most are unrelated to ability to architect software.<p>> <i>No number of developers is enough to turn offhand observation into meaningful correlation. That would require measuring and tracking. It would require more than your gut feeling and confirmation bias.</i><p>See above. Your assumption was mistaken.<p>> <i>I frankly find it worrisome that you actively choose history majors over CS majors for development work. That says nothing to me except that you have a personal bias.</i><p>Prefering to hire a History major with a minor in CS over a pure CS major typically results in better rounded individuals more capable of software architecture, dealing with clients, and collaborating with peers.  Unfortunately, out of hundreds of hires, again, only a handful have fit that bill.  But none of those who did fit that bill, had to be let go.<p>This was data collected at interview time, and in fact, on the first such individuals, I was as skeptical as you.  Looking back at the collected hiring data about outperformers revealed this correlation.  Since then, I've confirmed this curious correlation with several peers.<p>> <i>I stand by my statement that you must be writing small programs if you're willing to print them in entirety on paper.</i><p>Again, your assume that I was printing the large programs.  I was not.  I was invovled with software developed and used by scientific research organizations, hospitals, and universities.  They would hand me a box of fan-fold paper (once even on a hand truck), and say, ""Here's the code.""   I found learning the overall picture faster reading through the stack than scrolling the code on a CRT, particularly thanks to the ability to use a highlighter and Post-Its.<p>Today, when confronted with a similar task, I prefer an iPad and a good reader with markup tools.<p>> <i>As for code reviews in the 80s, the value is in the review. Whether it's printed on paper or not isn't really very meaningful. It can be nice to have a paper copy sometimes, but it's just that, nice. It's not really a substantive change.</i><p>Given today's technology, mostly agreed.  However, research suggests tangible artifacts cement concepts more firmly in our organic brains than digital exposure alone.<p>> <i>And yes, this history argument is extremely tangential. You did not start with that. You started by saying that you used to spend compile times reviewing the printed code. That has nothing to do with being a history buff. Someone could love doing paper code reviews and hate reading about history. And any link that might exist was certainly not established before you transitioned into talking about history buffs being good architects.</i><p>You're right, I didn't bring up history first, I brought up the concept of understanding ""a map of the whole"".  To me, that equates closely with a long multifaceted narrative.  You brought up the inability to hold a few pages of code in one's head, and I countered with literature and history.  Both code and history are something like the Bayeux Tapestry, where the local is most useful when understood in context of the whole.  Come to think of it, the word for our oldest long historical texts, and for what you do reviewing code on a the screen, are the same: scroll.<p>My ravioli's done baking.  Enjoyed the discussion.

There are some alternatives such as uploading a list of barcodes, Referring URLs (I'm not kidding ProQuest for example allows this), Athens, Shibboleth, and a few others.

Usually, all links will go through the proxy, but if on campus the proxy will redirect you directly to the database to avoid the overhead), it would be near impossible to enforce the restriction of guests.

Find some friends and family money (< $50k).  Build a product.  Sell the product to 10 people.  Then entertain the investor route.  If you can build a product and sell a product with <$50 investment, you will be in an exponentially better place than you are right now.<p>Good luck and keep us posted.",1311124103.0

The titlebar fonts are generally okay, but the way fonts are rendered in web browsers on really any desktop environment in Linux versus how they're rendered in OS X or Windows are considerably worse.<p>I'm referring to the visual style in general, there's a huge difference between having something work and enjoying using it, and Wine is most of the time the former, but rarely, if ever, the latter.",1311123779.0

You need to spend a good day or so just to get them to run correctly"". Must be pretty frustrating",1311123637.0
