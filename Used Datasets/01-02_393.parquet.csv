This is partially to do with the growing prevalence of enterprise-ready web apps & services, but also with Microsoft's insistence that they really will kill XP and IE6 in 2014.  The same thing recently happened when they finally killed support for XP SP2 (just last month) and there was a big run to upgrade millions of corporate PCs to SP3 (which forces an IE upgrade unless you do all sorts of not recommended funky hacks to prevent it).<p>As an aside, most companies for whom IE6 is an elephant-scale problem are using both AD and MS SCCM for user configuration management & group policy controls.  CM makes it trivial to deploy stuff across the board, including complex software like OS service packs [and browser upgrades].  I posted before that my own org is in the process of upgrading everyone to IE8 right now, but we switched to Firefox as our standard browser about a year ago and are currently testing the new Chrome MSI (woohoo for GPO support), since even though Google's interpretation of the HTML5 standard includes a few things that aren't actually in the draft yet, it works much better with Google Apps.<p>You won't have to worry about IE6 in 2015.",1286848351.0

I've tried a lot of Python frameworks out before deciding on Flask.  It's a paralyzing decision - there is just so much out there.  The process of choosing a web framework is filled with information overload - from reading about the framework, dabbling with the code, and finally learning the actual framework.  For the reason, I recommend going with a microframework.  You learn what you need as you go. So this lead me to Flask.<p>Two things set Flask apart (for me) - the documentation and the extensions. Just check out the site <a href=""http://flask.pocoo.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flask.pocoo.org</a> for more information.  You also want to be assured that development on the framework is not just going to be dropped some day.  It really feels like this framework is going places.  (My initial inclination was toward CherryPy, but the documentation is bad. After all these years.)<p>My dev work is mostly done on Windows, and for an IDE I've taken to using JetBrain's PyCharm. (I'm primarily a .NET developer, and I find it more convenient to use Windows to avoid context switching.

Good lesson for companies that buy these solutions - make sure your agreement does not let the vendor change their price on you whenever they want with no notice, especially when you are integrated like this.  Having one more comment saying that we didn't like the pricing change probably won't change anything - but it sucked to get ready for a go-live today and then have to put on the breaks.  I spent my weekend finishing up the integration and Monday find out that that time was spent integrating with a company that has basically no regard for the smaller users.

I also expect the market to shift. I have been known multiple times in the past to pay $0.99 for a nicely formatted digital edition of a public work I could download (raw text or broken formatting) for free or buy at a booksale for $0.49; one of these days, people will pay MORE for ALL digital books, because it will be worth more to them.<p>> Also the authors are still getting scammed by the industry and only see a tiny fraction of what the buyer pays. This is not it.<p>Ok, first I think the idea that we should reject groundbreaking advances because they haven't fixed every problem by themselves is insane. Second, it really is opening the door for authors to get a larger cut. The industry had the authors by the neck because the authors depended on a lot of the value the industry added (publishing, editing, advertising, etc). Many authors still rely on those things, but with digital distribution it is now POSSIBLE, for authors who are willing, to do it (at least mostly) on your own.",1286845278.0
