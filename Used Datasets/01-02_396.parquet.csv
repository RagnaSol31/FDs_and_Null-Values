If you update your address it overwrites your previous address<p>With datomic you are just adding a new fact. My address is <i>now</i> x. This has a lot of nice properties. I can now easily write a query to tell me your previous 5 addresses, rolling back is easy, you can get amazing and scalable read performance, etc etc<p>In the past we have either had to hand roll our own features (e.g. Have a table of past addresses, or add date columns to specific tables) or rely on error prone/brittle techniques like using audit tables, source control, or transaction logs.<p>Datomic makes it easy!",1435971975.0
