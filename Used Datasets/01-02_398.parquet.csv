Examples from my own work:<p>1) I was tasked with instrumenting the T58-GE-16 engines in a CH-46 [0]. So what did I need to inform my sensor placement and selection? Some schematics and technical manuals, all from the late 1960s, all undigitized.<p>2) I needed to reverse engineer an old test set. The documentation had been lost to time. When I cracked it open, I saw lots of 5400 & 7400 series chips. Now, this is kind of a trite example, because lots of working EEs still have copies of the TTL Data Book at hand. But still, I needed to refer to that old tome when working on this project.<p>3) When I worked at a NASA contractor, a primary piece of equipment failed. We needed a replacement in a hurry. Fortunately, someone had kept the older version of this system around. It dated from 1959 (!) but the manual was still around, too. A quick read through that manual got us back in business.<p>Technology never dies [1]. But without the manuals to understand that technology, things become much harder when you need to use that technology again.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Vertol_CH-46_Sea_Knight"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Vertol_CH-46_Sea_Knight</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2011/02/04/133188723/tools-never-die-waddaya-mean-never"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2011/02/04/133188723/to...</a>",1439776195.0
