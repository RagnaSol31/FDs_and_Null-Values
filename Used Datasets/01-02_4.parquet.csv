But that has nothing to do with our service offerings.<p>I guess I'm asking, why do early-stage startups pay you, and what specifically do you provide them? ""Managing market risk and minimizing product-market mismatch"" is pretty vague. Do you do market research? Do you conduct surveys?<p>I'm very familiar with marketing consultants in later-stage startups, where, in my experience, they are largely used by the management team as a tool to reinforce consensus or sell the CEO. No viable early-stage startup has those problems.",1228615173
2,388547,comment,388268.0,388364.0,0,0,shimon,,,"I doubt that the G1 will ""simply not operate"" without a data plan.  I suspect this is T-mobile's way of avoiding having to explain (especially to non-techie customers who might not realize that a smartphone without a data plan is probably a bad idea) that many of the phone's features require a data plan, and that skipping the data plan is a good way to spend $4 every time you travel with Google Maps.<p>I heard the same thing a couple of years ago regarding a blackberry I was purchasing.  I got a data plan, and a year or so later a friend needed a replacement GSM phone.  The blackberry worked just fine as a phone with her SIM card; of course, you couldn't browse the web or get email on it.",1228615044

15,388533,comment,388097.0,388097.0,0,0,krschultz,,,"I love this part:<p>You can't lend money if you don't have it. And beginning in 2001, the Federal Reserve made sure lots of people had it. In January 2001, when President Bush took office, the federal funds rate, the key benchmark for all interest rates in this country, was 6.5 percent. Then, in response to the meltdown in the technology sector, the Fed began cutting the rate. By August 2001, it was at 3.75 percent. And after the terrorist attacks of September 11, the Fed opened the spigot. By the summer of 2002, the federal funds rate was 1 percent.<p>No mention of the reason for the low rates i.e. to spur economic growth. The administration wanted to PROVE that tax cuts cause enough economic growth to grow government revenue. The way to do that if the tax cuts aren't really working is to keep lowering the interest rate. Now that the whole house of cards has fallen down, it is very silly to be saying that less government would be the solution.<p>I would say that in June of this year I was a hardcore libertarian, and I have been pretty much since I had become politically aware, but after digging through the events and the economics of the crisis, my mind has changed. When it comes to financial markets, they are going to swing. But government's role should be to force publicly traded companies to have transparent books, and the financial industries where anything but transparent in the last few years. A stronger SEC would have helped in that regard.",1228613228
