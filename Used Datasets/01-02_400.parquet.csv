The Global Warming alarmists get by with weak science by saying their preliminary findings appear to be right and there’s no time to debate any further because the world will end if we don’t act now.<p>Lomborg essentially bypasses the science part of that argument and attacks the real issue which is the urgency claim.  In doing so he takes away the reasons for politicization of the issue and puts the focus back on scientific study of the problem.,1289440550

The two don't usually overlap.<p>But I'm not going to suggest there is anything wrong with Cosmo. The purpose of Cosmo is to be a woman's magazine that focuses on various traditional interests of women, including attracting men. Their covers reflect that. My problem with Wired doing it is that it doesn't fit what Wired is about. Wired represents the tech community in a sense, so I feel it reflects on me a bit what they do. Historically, it's been a nearly all-male community, yes; but most of us agree we'd like that to change, and getting rid of things like this is not much of a sacrifice.

If your rent is comparable to mortgage (assumption, I know) you will wind up paying less after the mortgage is over.  If you die at 80, and start paying rent at 20, that's 60 years of rent, compared to, say, a 30-year mortgage.  That's 30 more years of rent.<p>I know, I know, someone is going to say ""well, what about upkeep and maintenance and killing rats and xyz?""  The way I'm seeing this (which, by the by, is originating completely from a 3-beer-deep opinionated loudmouth) is that it's negligible compared to the fact that you are investing your money in something that is of material value.",1289437637
