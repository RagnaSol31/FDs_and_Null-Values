These organizations post lists of project ideas for GSoC, but of course you don't have to participate in GSoC to actually do them. In fact, I would guess that a lot of the project ideas are never even worked on at all. Go ahead and search through the projects for something that interests you and then shoot someone an email or hang out in their IRC (if they have one). Most people would be happy to have you on board.<p>IMHO, OS stuff is really tough. I just recently graduated college, and I wouldn't dare bother with the time commitment required to get involved in OS development (I'm looking at you, linux kernel). It's just not for me.

I personally think a developer relations person who does understand the inner workings of the code base he represents, or at least demonstrates the ability to understand it given time, will be much better at his job than someone who doesn't. So really, I agree with Google here in their decision.<p>There are a number of jobs at google that although do not involve writing code, are closely coupled with the technology google is working on - developer relations actually being a very good example. I think they are keeping the bar high in these instances for valid reasons. I'm sure there are positions where technical background is less crucial, graphic design comes to mind, but that's to be judged on a case by case basis. Everybody wants to work there, so they can demand very high standards, but in most instances i've heard about the standards are not incorrect, just high.<p>EDIT: And probably another reason is they simply want to keep the particular technical culture throughout the company.",1311558891

Or in short, politics. When you've got a public budget and your goals are political ones, you're going to pursue a specific set of capabilities and policies that help your political career.  This is true from the President all the way down to the lowest level of managers at NASA.  I think the real cost, and thus tragedy, of this era is the thousands upon thousands of good engineers who were sucked up into NASA because they believed in the dream of human space flight, and were never able to accomplish much over the courses of their careers.<p>The solution to this problem is very simple:  No government agency with control over space.  Outsource everything.  If government wants to fund scientific research or exploration, great- give grants to institutions that then have effectively complete autonomy.   For instance, JPL, could be a separate institute with little connection to government other than primarily getting its funding from the government.  If politicians want to send a probe to Mars, let JPL be the master contractor, where JPL hires the scientists, while subcontracting out the design, development and production to private entities.<p>SpaceX is much more efficient getting to space, cost wise and reliability wise (I believe) than NASA ever has been, and they are using (IIRC) a discarded russian design, off the shelf as the basis for their system (though certainly they've done a lot of engineering work.)<p>The commercial space industry in the USA has suffered under the government control over all things space since the beginning.  I remember when Richard Branson-- the founder of Virgin Galactic, and the one who funded the design and development of SpaceShipTwo was prevented from seeing the design he'd paid for because he was a british national!<p>In fact, I'm certain that the only reason Burt Rutan and Virgin Galactic were successful is that their ""launch"" requires only a runway, and thus they can easily do it from just about any country.  Previously, NASA and the FAA has made it very difficult for private entities to pursue space access, by denying them the necessary permits to do testing.<p>After the X prize was won, when commercial operation plans were announced, there was a flurry of congressional noise about regulating the space industry (""for safety"" of course.)  I  think the only reason that died down is that there is literally nothing stopping Virgin Galactic from flying off and launching from a newly crated ""space port"" in, say, Panama.   (Well, except that the government apparently considers their designs ""National Security Secrets"".)<p>It is time to dismantle NASA.  Let the capitalists pursue profit in space, and government can get whatever it needs launched (or built) by the same contractors under whatever terms the government wants-- but at much lower costs.",1311558156

We gets hundreds of thousands of applications a year. Who else has that scale of a recruitment problem?<p>There are a lot of myths about our interview process. Take this post: he says he doesn't have a degree from an ""elite university"". Neither do I and neither do most of my coworkers.<p>Having no degree at all <i>is</i> a problem but not an insurmountable one.<p>As for us allegedly not being interested in your open source contributions, nothing could be further from the truth. Recently the guy who did Firebug just got hired to work on Chrome developer tools. Do you really think his Firebug work had nothing to do with this?<p>As for what team you'll be working on, you as a candidate have a lot of power in that regard. You can specify you're only interested in working on something in particular or you can simply communicate some preferences. Those preferences affect the allocation process.<p>Our predilection for simple coding problems and requiring a certain level of algorithms knowledge is nothing new. What constantly surprises me is how many people I see go through the process that obviously haven't just picked up a copy of Skiena's book and brushed up on the fundamentals.<p>I can understand the motivation of people not to go through the process a second time. I was in the same boat. It can be a frustrating process. It's imperfect. Occasionally I'll hear people say they will never go through it because of what they've heard.<p>As Homer puts it, ""trying is the first step to failing"".<p>I'll leave you with three recommendations for anyone interested in applying here:<p>1. Go through the first half of Skiena's algorithm book (the last half is applications, which, while interesting, isn't as crucial). If you're not comfortable with graphs and dynamic programming, sorry but you just haven't prepared;<p>2. Practice some code problems on a whiteboard; and<p>3. Go through recruitment with a referrer. You're MUCH better off with a recommendation from someone who already works here. Even if they don't necessarily know you (and thus can't provide a strong reference), they can chase up what's happening with your application with the recruiter and probably get more information than you, as an external applicant, can.<p>EDIT: let me add a fourth piece of advice:<p>Treat your career at Google, if you're fortunate enough to have one, as a marathon not a sprint.<p>If you're really unhappy on whatever project you end up on or with the team you're with, that can all be changed. A lot of effort is made to make people happy. So you can express your concerns and disappointment with your manager, your manager's manager, HR or whatever is most appropriate.<p>Additionally, the ramp-up time at Google can be significant. 3-6 months. Possibly longer. Another approach is to do what project you end up, learn our tools, build system, processes, etc. In that time make connections to other teams. Find out what else is going on and what you're interested in doing.<p>There is an awful lot of internal mobility that's possible.",1311555853

""<p>Guy Kawasaki was one of the first evangelists.  He was a jeweler previously. Of course Guy has a great many talents, but I don't think anyone would call him ""highly technical.""   Notice the middle sentence says ""you will be an engineer"", but the rest of it talks about being an ""Advocate"" and ""your job is to drive momentum"", etc.<p>The requirements don't seem to be highly technical either.  (most of the languages are scripting languages, for instance.)<p>From the description:\nBA/BS in Computer Science or a similar technical degree preferred.\nExperience blogging and writing technical articles, ideally with an existing follower base.\nStrong command of web application or mobile application development landscapes.\nExperience working directly with large partners, or with press and bloggers preferred.\nConsiderable success as a software developer, architect, technology evangelist, CTO, or consultant working with web or mobile technologies.\nStrong command of web application or mobile application development landscapes.\nSolid programming abilities in one or more of the following languages: Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, .NET, JavaScript.",1311555776

But after closing it, you're left on a summary of the book you just entered with no options to add more books. In order to add another book, you first need to click Home to get to the ""Add Recommendation"" button.<p>After entering a book, it should probably either take you directly back to the Home screen or give you an option to continue adding books. The extra click gets annoying.",1311555646
