CVE-2012-1150 for example.<p>""Hash tables become full, and bad things happen.""  Yes.  Yes they absolutely do.  It depends on your implementation exactly what will happen, but in every case, you are in for some pain.  If you choose the ""linked list per element"" route, congratulations-- your hash table will gradually approximate the lookup behavior of an unsorted linked list as the number of elements gets larger.  If you choose rehashing, you'll have to deal with long pauses in your program during a rehash.  Hello, latency spikes!  Incremental rehashing could improve this, but only at the cost of degrading memory locality even further.<p>""Trees are better.""  For most applications, trees really ARE better.  Trees are simple to use and they use less memory most of the time.  You really should not be using hash tables unless you have a really good idea of how many elements you are going to have, AND you believe that they will not be accessed in any particular pattern.<p>""Hash functions are slow.""  I don't even know what this statement is supposed to mean.  But I do know that there are a lot of bad hash functions out there, and it's easy to choose a bad one as a novice programmer.  The right hash function will depend on your data-- something I note that this article fails to mention.<p>""Hash tables use too much memory.""  A wise programmer once told me, ""fancy data structures are only good when N is large-- and N is usually small.""  That definitely applies here.  Another way to look at this is that you need to keep the hash table half empty to keep the good properties that made you choose a hash table in the first place: O(1) lookup, O(1) insert, O(1) delete, etc.  So you will just have to pay the memory price.<p>Hash tables can be very useful for certain applications.  But in general, they're an optimization that you should make only if you know what you're doing.  You should be very clear on why you're using them, how many elements you expect to have, and what your strategy is if you overflow.  It's not for beginners.  And if you are optimizing, you should also be aware that something like a radix tree or a B-Tree may lead to much better performance, due to its much better memory locality.<p>Just about the only really intriguing use for hash tables on a modern CPU is in lockless data structures, but if you're considering writing one of those-- you already know all the stuff I just wrote.",1349142158.0

Or even storage costs or implementation complexity as the author suggests.<p>My reason for shrugging off hash tables for <i>most</i> requirements: cost/complexity of inserts and deletes. Hash tables are amazing when you do offline index generation (circa Google ""non-realtime"" search).<p>However, if you ever need to have frequent updates, deletes, or inserts, you need to grow the hash table and in doing so managing the hash table usurps any search gains. For some use cases that's fine - perhaps you only optimize for reads. Hash tables are awesome for read heavy loads. Hash tables are sub-optimal for mixed read/write work loads.<p>On that note, I believe the Red-Black btree is far superior to hash tables for mixed work loads. RBtree's tend to be more predictable and when your application needs the insert/delete (ie, for real time updates) you don't have to worry about having to find a new data structure.<p>On a related note, XFS had to switch their hash over to an rbtree to fix a performance issue related to hashes falling over in costs of insert/deletes:<p><a href=""http://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2010-09/msg00203.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2010-09/msg00203.html</a><p>Yes there are myths about hash tables but article doesn't touch on the real truths of why engineers avoid hash tables.",1349141391.0

The Closure Library may have its dark and dusty corners, particularly for recently added/less used components, but on the whole, the library API is quite well-documented. You are mistaken about the API docs being generated from extracted code symbols; rather, it is all pulled from standard JSDoc tags. The library authors are meticulous about defining custom types rather than using ad-hoc enums and the like in their code, making the codebase itself very comfortable to reason about and making these @param and @return types very clear in their meaning.<p>I have my complaints about the library (certain dusty corners of goog.ui and goog.editor have hard-coded CSS classNames and Google URLs, meaning you have to use a patch queue to customize them) but I'm very pleased with the API documentation and examples. Google admittedly leans on Bolin's book (O'Reilly, 2010) too much for the community's manual-style documentation, but this is less crucial for a library than the API docs, and that book is really good :^)<p>The library has an extensive demo collection which is pretty nice too, and the demos generally include a minimum of 2-3 examples to show different ways to use library components (decorating vs. rendering usage of goog.ui package, for instance).<p>Google's real failure with Closure Tools has been marketing, but that is not my concern very much as a user.

This was First Gulf War time, so it must have been 90-91. Fun job, still friends with more people from that job than any other I've had.  It was no one's first record store job, so everyone there was pretty knowledgeable about at least a couple musical genres. Company was not exactly a model of good management techniques, but whatever, as a sales clerk it was great fun.<p>Anyway, I remember one night stuck on the cash register and bored, so I did some literal back of the envelope calculations.  I took the CD storage capacity and the trend in increasing data rates for modems and figured out you'd be able to download albums in a practical amount of time in about the year 2000.  I then told all my co-workers to not make a career of the record store business because we were all doomed by digital downloads in about 10 years.<p>Funny how much I got wrong but still got the end result right.",1349139740.0

Perhaps the reason it isn't more common is that often times it takes an in-house designer or other advocate of design to get the rest of the company on board with good design as a company priority.",1349139711.0

Now the data just needs to fit in a single datacenter.",1349139687.0
