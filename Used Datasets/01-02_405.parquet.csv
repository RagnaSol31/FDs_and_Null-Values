There's no such question on the agenda as choice between one man surviving or everybody dying.<p>>>> My argument is that ultimate good and evil are predicated on the survival of the species.<p>I couldn't care less about the species. Why should I? Who is this ""species"" I'm supposed to care and why its survival has any value to me? I care about real people, but caring about abstract ""species"" does not have any value for me. \nThis approach not only weird but outright immoral - if followed logically, I should advocate exterminating or at least sterilizing genetically inferior individuals - such as ones possessing obviously debilitating genetic diseases, and advocate killing off people that do not contribute anything to the species and the survival of such. \nOf course no normal human being would accept that. Well, some societies tried that - like Nazis exterminating individuals that were considered inferior and detrimental to the Aryan species - but you know how it ended and how it played out before it did. I don't think you want that.<p>>>> If you do not think that individual rights are the ultimate good,<p>I think individual rights are the <i>ONLY</i> good. There are no any other rights but individual rights, everything else is just a metaphor ultimately reduced to individual rights or a fraud designed to trick certain people into giving up their rights to some other people in exchange for plausibly sounding lies (or, failing that, coerce them into the same). Only individuals are sentient, only individuals have feelings and reason, only individuals can communicate and interact on sentient level, only individuals can have rights. I could somehow accept the concept of animals having rights, maybe, since many of them are capable of purposeful behavior and it can be argued they possess some level of emotion and sentience, even if unlike that of a human. However, ""collective rights"" are either just a way of speaking (when you say ""a football team went to Boston"", it means members of the team went there, not some distinct ""team"" entity went there and the members stayed in New York) or invented and fraudulent concept.",1352512593.0

14,4765618,comment,4765298.0,4765298.0,1,0,neuspadrin,,," I just made the switch from QWERTY to Colemak this summer. Basically I started with only using it at home doing typing tutors and using it as my system default. Once I was up to ~30-40wpm after a week or two I switched my work computer's default over too. I'm now ~10wpm faster then I was on qwerty.<p>I mainly program and email at work, and Colemak was my recommended keyboard by the analyzer listed in here. Loving the layout, feels easier on the hands, and a big plus for me is my most used keyboard shortcuts remain the same seeing as the bottom row is almost identical.<p>Negatives is I find it hard to switch back to qwerty on demand on foreign computers where colemak isn't set. Have to resort to hunt/peck, but hey at least any keyboard you come across will be labeled correctly.<p>I'm planning on going back to qwerty for a week sometime and then keep using it occasionally to keep in fresh to try to get around the issue of using other computers.<p>My recommendation? Start with it at home with the basics where productivity won't matter much, once you have the basics down where you know where each key is you just are slow/inconsistent to it switch work over. I then saw a rapid increase by using it so much. The layout is great! :) And if you might run into other computers try to keep QWERTY up with using it occasionally.<p>Oh, and it will piss off others who use your computer, so make sure you have separate profiles set up at home so it's not a language bar war.

I can type at 120 WPM with 2 fingers (QWERTY) and don't want to end up typing at 60 WPM for 6 months while I learn to type with all my fingers in COLEMAK (or DVORAK) to find that I'm back at 120 WPM...

It's a little bit mind bending to learn a new layout, but after about a week or two of practice, your mind sort of ""clicks"" into it, and it's like you've been typing that way your whole life.<p>During that transition period you do not have to use Colemak exclusively. You're practicing a new motor skill, and the returns on such practice diminish rapidly after an hour or so per day.<p>Once you've learned Colemak, you will have to use QWERTY for  just a short time each day to make sure you keep those neural pathways from decaying. I did not do this, and I regret it. I do alright on a QWERTY keyboard though; it just slows me down a bit.

I can try to find out later.<p>Why I use it is simple: when sitting with correct posture, the distance between my eyes and my resting hands is further than just using my desk allowed. The keyboard tray lowers the keyboard further without having to lower the entire desk and raising the monitor to a comical height.<p>> a) home row changes. isn't this a big problem in vim, as in, you have to re-map basically every shortcut (otherwise you are basically de-dvoraking)<p>I found an easy solution for this, see the bottom of my vimrc: <a href=""https://github.com/codemac/config/blob/master/vimrc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/codemac/config/blob/master/vimrc</a><p><pre><code>    noremap d h\n    noremap h j\n    noremap t k\n    noremap n l\n    noremap k d\n    noremap l n\n    noremap j t\n    noremap ^Wd ^Wh\n    noremap ^Wh ^Wj\n    noremap ^Wt ^Wk\n    noremap ^Wn ^Wl\n    inoremap ^] ^[A\n    inoremap  ^N\n</code></pre>\nKeep in mind I mostly use emacs these days, which is an entirely different set of ergonomic challenges :) However, those changes seemed to have worked well for me.<p>> b) wouldn't you need different dvorak layouts for different tasks? ruby needs different keys on the homerow than java, which is different to plain english which is then different to plain german etc<p>You must answer the question for yourself: How much english vs. ruby vs. java do I type?<p>For me? most of my variables are English based, and all my symbols ()[]@$& etc.. are all in different places on a Kinesis keyboard anyways.<p>There may be a case for specialized layouts, but I think the amount of English that is keyed far outweighs any specialization.",1352511176.0
59,4765570,comment,4765090.0,4765090.0,1,0,fjorder,,,"The truth probably lies somewhere in between what the flaming fanboy and Mr.Disgruntled are saying.<p>Apple seems to make the most money when they open up a new market and lock out the competition for a long period of time, as they did with the iPod.  The iPhone's dominance was challenged quicker than the iPod's, and the iPad's quicker still.  If you consider 7"" tablets their own market, Apple is actually late to the party.  Why are other manufacturers catching up quicker or even taking the lead?  <i>They all remember the iPod.</i><p>So what does this mean for Apple?  The profits aren't going to come as easy as they did before because the competition moves a lot quicker than they used to.  If Apple opens up a new market they're going to face competition in it almost immediately because the competition knows they have to move <i>fast</i> and is capable of doing so.  No more decades of dominance and easy-money.  Does that mean Apple is doomed?  Absolutely not.  Apple is still wildly profitable even though they are no longer completely dominant in even one market they make products for.  Their production chain is lean enough that they <i>can</i> compete in markets dominated by commodity pricing.  That focus on production efficiency is not going to change under Tim Cook.  Quite the opposite!<p>There does seem to be evidence that we'll see an extended period of decline for Apple under Cook though.  In the last couple years Apple has released several half-baked products and polish seems to be declining.  e.g. OSX Lion and Mountain Lion have both had an aberrant number of bugs, even by the standards of other OS's.  Jobs, unlike what many people think, was never an idea man.  His value was in knowing who to copy and when to say ""No"", and Cook needed to say no to things like Apple Maps, or at least give them more time to bake.  Even if Cook has truly horrible tech instincts it will probably take a very long time for Apple to decline to the point of losing money.  Despite how far MS fell in some people's eyes, they never failed to turn a profit.  Apple is also sitting on such a gargantuan pile of cash that they could lose money hand-over-fist for decades before running into real trouble.<p>Apple might not continue to be the leading juggernaut it's been for the last decade, but they're in no danger of going out of business.",1352511159.0

I use Chrome, however, not because of its compliance, but because at the moment, it's the fastest, allows for more tabs, and just feels more fun to use. Blackberry will lose this game because they don't know how to do good UI. And this nonsense about working with Facebook is just laughable.",1352509351.0
