Certainly with a long enough timeline we are not at a maximum of ""works only in x"", and -- ignoring those beleaguered Opera users still subjected to crappy UA sniffing -- I can't think of the last time I came across a site that blocked me for whatever my choice of browser (I'm a Chrome and Firefox user as well).<p>If, on the other hand, you're talking about fancy new CSS3 or WebGL (or whatever) demos leaving out some browser due to neglecting to add a particular prefixed property (or whatever), I don't really see that as a problem. Prototype then standardize, right? Yes, not feature detecting and prefixing properly is poor web development practice and yes, they are cutting out part of their audience, but using an experimental feature inherently means that it may break at some point, and almost certainly isn't supported in all browsers.<p>When 3d CSS transforms land in Firefox soon, there are going to be a whole lot of demos out there that won't work. I would say that's an education and library problem, not a fragmentation one.",1315706037

They may just be lucky in that gunk, at this period in history, got to them first.<p>If it isn't luck but something else, there's also the problem of extrapolating a therapy from that. De Vere's solution to cancer was replacing every cell in the body every 7 or 8 years to circumvent the effects of telemerase ( or something like that, I'm not a gerontologist obviously.)

Right now the application is broken up into decoupled modules pretty well (though it could certainly be improved).<p>I think I gave a pretty poor example in the question, not explaining exactly what I was confused about.

Supposed I had a client request a customization that not only requires a username/password for login, but also (as a contrived example) the user's employee number.  I'm not sure how to setup the application architecture to (1) easily allow modification of the Users table to include an ""employee_number"" field (2) update the Auth module to check for employee number in the login function and (3) modify, say, the Login module to update the form that displays the username/password/employee number fields.<p>My ultimate goal is to work some system where the Auth module/Login module/database tables did not have to be directly changed, so software can still easily be updated.",1315704167

As if I would not expect, nay <i>demand</i>, that Gilad and Lars would do better -- much better -- than JS!<p>For the record, I'm not worried about JS being replaced by a better language. I am working to do that within Ecma TC39, by evolving JS aggressively.<p>The leaked Google doc's assertion that this is impossible and that a ""clean break"" is required to make significant improvements is nonsense, a thin rationale for going it alone rather than cooperating fully.<p>The big issue I have with Dart, which you seem to consider inconsequential, is whether Google forks the web developer community, not just its own paid developers, with Dart, and thereby fragments web content.<p>A Dart to JS compiler will never be ""decent"" compared to having the Dart VM in the browser. Yet I guarantee you that Apple and Microsoft (and Opera and Mozilla, but the first two are enough) will <i>never</i> embed the Dart VM.<p>So ""Works best in Chrome"" and even ""Works only in Chrome"" are new norms promulgated intentionally by Google. We see more of this fragmentation every day. As a user of Chrome and Firefox (and Safari), I find it painful to experience, never mind the political bad taste.<p>Ok, counter-arguments. What's wrong with playing hardball to advance the web, you say? As my blog tries to explain, the standards process requires good social relations and philosophical balance among the participating competitors.<p>Google's approach with Dart is thus pretty much all wrong and doomed to leave Dart in excellent yet non-standardized and non-interoperable implementation status. Dart is GBScript to NaCl/Pepper's ActiveG.<p>Could Google, unlike Microsoft ten or so years ago, prevail? Only by becoming the new monopoly power on the web. We know how that story ends.",1315704145

There was a LOT of buzz in the 80's about how Japan (and Asian countries in general, to some extent) were kicking the US's arse in a lot of areas: computers, consumer electronics, cars, etc., etc.  Talk about ""competing with Japan"" was used a motivational material to encourage students (""study hard or you won't have a job when you graduate, because you're competing against the Japanese""), and to justify various research programs, government initiatives, etc.<p>The whole ""Fifth Generation Computing"" thing really lit a fire under a lot of people back in those days:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer</a><p>So yeah... I don't necessarily agree that Cyberpunk as a genre is really focused on anti-asian xenophobia of any sort, but I don't think it's a stretch to say that that ""80's zeitgeist"" thing did influence Cyberpunk.",1315703162

'cmd+right arrow'.<p>So you have to use two hands instead of one, which is great, because two is better than one.  Do you disable right clicking on the trackpad and use command+click for that, too?<p>> Thinkpad's keyboard is much better than that the average PC laptop keyboard, except for page up/down keys getting in the way all the time.<p>Yes, I often have that problem, where I'm in the middle of typing something, and suddenly I think, <i>there's a Page Up key on this keyboard</i>.  Just knowing that the Page Up key is sitting there, all on its lonesome in the top right corner, waiting, such a naughty little key that wants to snuggle in the brief touch of scar tissue at the end of my pinky, distracted me for 15 minutes when typing this reply.<p>> Oh and I absolutely hate the media keys on laptops...<p>This is where you reveal yourself to be a crazy person.",1315702818
