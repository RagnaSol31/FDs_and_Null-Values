Undergrad probability and linear algebra is not a solid foundation in statistics.<p>Statistics is a powerful lens through which to view all data science.  E.g. supervised learning is building a model of the <i>conditional</i> probability P(y|x).  Again, I am biased, but I think that methods that do not have some statistical interpretation are unlikely to be useful.  E.g. if we take the graph of Facebook users and apply some matrix decomposition algorithm, who cares?  What can we do with this decomposition? What does it predict?",1430010415.0
