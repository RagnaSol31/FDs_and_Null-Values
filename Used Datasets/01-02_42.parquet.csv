Ada is usage centric.<p>You see that two ways.<p>First, in most languages any item with underlying implementation X can represent any legal value of X, even if it makes no sense. If you want to represent a quantity whose maximum value is one million, putting it in anything shaped like a 32-bit int will let it contain the illegal value ""one million and one"". Contrast Ada which will let you cap its legal range.<p>Second, in most languages any item with underlying implementation X can contain anything else with the same implementation. Your typedef'd int can be put into anything else int-sized. Contrast Ada, which won't permit you to mix apples and oranges if they are defined as distinct types with int storage.",1306547643.0

The problem is exacerbated by peer pressure: as soon as one tries to change something, one is booed and labeled a social climber. Because many people base their morals on what their surrounding group believes to be right, becoming rich starts being perceived as immoral.<p>> However, the left says ""there is no cultural problem"" and the right says ""screw em, its their own damn fault""<p>Far left says there is no cultural problem because it is infatuated with the culture of poverty itself. There is this belief among many leftists that being poor is ""moral"" while being rich is not. So the left considers the culture of the poor to be superior and more ""authentic"". Similarly, in a perverse twist, the far right believes that being rich is almost equal to being moral (because wealth is God's gift to men or some other such nonsense).

Scoring is when you look at each of those documents in more detail to figure out the actual top ten.<p>Scoring based on regular expressions wouldn't be too tough. Retrieval is the killer. Typically retrieval works based on ""posting lists"", which are basically indices for each word of which documents contain that word. To retrieve based on regular expressions, you would need posting lists for individual characters or short sequences of characters. That would take a lot more space.<p>You might be able to hack together some hybrid that would use existing posting lists.
