Just as in JavaScript:<p><pre><code>    function() { \n      var foo = ""outer"";\n      function() {\n        var foo = ""inner"";\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n... it would make no difference if the language had lexical or dynamic scope, because there are no variables present here that would need to reach outside of their enclosing function in order to perform variable lookup.<p>Lexical vs. dynamic scoping only comes into play when you refer to an external variable. Whether or not that variable is or can be shadowed is beside the point. Putting parameters aside ... In JavaScript, the variable's identity is the closest ""var""-declaration of that variable. In CoffeeScript, the variable's identity is simply the name of that variable, wherever it might occur in the current lexical scope. Both ways are lexical, not dynamic.",1347933230

The big problem though is that the problem domain of RDBMS's is ad hoc reporting which is pretty universal.<p><i>rom my experience, you should be leaning towards NoSQL systems (of which there are many, each suited to different use cases) when you have very large scaling needs (in terms of dataset and qps), heavily polymorphic data, or data that has ambiguous structure.</i><p>On the other hand, you should choose an RDBMS if you are pretty sure reporting needs will change or you will need to accommodate new metrics on a frequent basis.<p>The problem is there is a <i>huge</i> overlap between those two.

What I can say, however, is that much of what we consider to be ""causality"" is just a matter of probability. There's nothing in the fundamental laws of physics that says that a flower pot that fell off the window sill and broke into a million pieces an hour ago, can't now suddenly put itself back together and then fly back onto the sill, just as if nothing had ever gone awry. The fact that flower pots don't typically tend to do so, is that this turn of events is <i>extremely</i> unlikely.<p>In fact, as far as fundamental physics goes, the forward arrow of time and the backward arrow of time are indistinguishable. I.e., if you were to look at a movie of subatomic particles interacting, you wouldn't be able to tell, if you didn't already know, if the film were being played forwards or being played backwards. (As a slight caveat to this--a caveat that does not detract from what I am saying, but should be mentioned for the sake of completeness--there is one tiny aspect of fundamental particle physics that breaks this time symmetry, but it is a rather subtle one. The physicists who discovered this won a Nobel prize, and as I understand it, why this symmetry should be broken--no matter how subtle the effect--is still a deep mystery.)<p>What we consider to be the forward arrow of time comes completely from thermodynamics, not from fundamental law. E.g., if the Big Bang occurred at the end of time, rather than the beginning of time, we wouldn't be able to tell the difference, because from our point of view, that would end up being the beginning of time anyway.",1347932123

Traffic is being directed at an IP address and many customers may share that IP. We have techniques to scatter customers across IPs and watch attacks follow, but we generally only do that if the attack is causing a problem. In this case, we were able to mitigate it at our edge and upstream to the point that we didn't need to do any shuffling so from this alone we probably wouldn't have known exactly who the target was. From what happened next, when they attacker shifted to a Layer 7 attack, we were able to determine the target and did reach out to the customer to let them know what was going on and what we were going to do to protect them.",1347930435
