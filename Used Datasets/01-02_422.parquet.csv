It's generally considered in software architecture that design that's decoupled is a little harder to build upfront, but survives change over time.<p>As a 'real life' example, because Twitter exposed internal details (a tweet ID), clients sorted based on that number, because they assumed it'd be monotonically increasing. Once sequential IDs became a problem with Twitter at scale, they had an issue: if they switched to GUIDs, clients would break, because they were sorting based on the ID value. They had to invent an entirely new algorithm (Snowflake) to adapt to this change. This wouldn't have happened if they hadn't leaked internal details. It's basic encapsulation.",1364781129.0

In our apps we call it ThingService, and I'm sure other groups have a different convention.<p>For example, we're using a legacy codebase now where there is some complicated logic involved in managing attributes for products.  ProductService is a singleton with no internal state that does things like removeAttribute(product, ""foo"") and serves other purposes.  Before we introduced this pattern this kind of functionality was copy-pasted all around our controllers.<p>In short, I don't see the harm in this convention.

Being able to try out different courses and realizing what you like and don't like is so incredibly powerful.<p>What can be improved on is to identify these types of learners. Coursera could start out right of the bat asking, ""How likely are you to finish this course."" The metric of completion should not be used to judge a course either.",1364778454.0
