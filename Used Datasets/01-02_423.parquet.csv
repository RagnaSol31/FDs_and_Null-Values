That is, Israeli citizen going off to a 3 day business trip to Europe is less suspect than an American tourist with a very short length of stay.<p>I know a middle aged WASP lady (pasty white, dignified, looks like someone who might be related to the Kennedys) who had to endure questioning because she fit the latter profile. Not really ""gestapo"", though - from what she told me it sounded better than the normal treatment non-US citizens get at Newark. Many of my Israeli family & friends are dark skinned, never had any trouble.<p>I'm not saying I know better, just that my anecdotal evidence doesn't match yours.<p>In any case, this isn't really applicable for the US. TLV gets much fewer visitors than JFK, and they tend to fit certain trip profiles - few people just go for a weekend in Tel Aviv, for example.

26,1908724,comment,1907513.0,1908121.0,0,0,drusenko,,,"> Bcrypt and scrypt look great, but not fundamentally any better than longer passwords.<p>A technical-only solution is infinitely better than one where you try to change user behavior. You think memorizing a long password is easy because it's easy for you. Try telling that to someone who's 72 and just started using the Internet.<p>The reality is that anything that reduces friction to adoption is almost always a positive choice for any given company. There are exceptions, like banking, but for the most part, this is true.<p>This all ignores the fact that longer-length passwords are almost completely pointless, anyway, for a ton of reasons:<p>(1) The data you store on behalf of the user is probably not important enough to warrant the (very strong) inconvenience.<p>(2) Proper password storage ((b|s)crypt) can already mitigate a lot of these risks. If tuned properly, even a 4-character bcrypt password can become more computationally difficult to ""reverse"".<p>(3) Short passwords can be bruteforced over the wire? Well, you can prevent people from doing this. You control the environment and can make brute-forcing attacks against your login mechanisms unfeasible.<p>(4) For this to matter at all, some attacker has to steal the entire authentication table with all of the hashes. If that happens, the number of ways you're fucked is much larger than just your users having to change their passwords where re-used elsewhere.<p>Fundamentally, for most use cases, it should be a user's choice to opt to use a longer password that would be more difficult to crack, or use a shorter password for convenience.<p>Google already does this by showing a password strength bar when choosing a password. Unless you store very sensitive data, who are you to make that decision on their behalf?",1289871543
27,1908723,story,,,12,6,Skywing,Ask HN: How do I plug myself into the Hacker community?,,"Hi all,<p>I'm 25 years old and have been writing software since I was 12. While growing up I never did have any close friends that were as enthusiastic and passionate about programming as I am. All of my friends were into football. So, while we'd sit at our high school lunch tables and talk about football players, I would most likely be day dreaming about what my next weekend programming project would be or why my Diablo hack was causing the game to crash - the real fun stuff.<p>Anyways, I did Computer Science in College and went to a heavy commuter University in North Dallas. Nobody there seemed to really care about programming, either. I'd ask group members and classmates about any cool things they've programmed and most would look at me like I'm crazy. Some didn't even want to go into a computer science job after college, either!<p>I'm now at my second programming-related job. I worked at Nortel for a year and then we all know what happened to them. I now work at a 6 person company, as one of two developers on staff. It's nothing new-age, or enjoyable, or fun. In fact, I feel like I'm wasting my time there. I feel like I need to be with other hackers. This is what I've always wanted, really. I just figured it would somehow happen.<p>So there's my question becoming apparent now after this wall of text - how do I plug myself into the hacker community? I'm in the Dallas, Texas area. I'm sure there's tons of things going on out here, but it sounds like everything is happening in San Francisco. Is it going to require me to just do it, and take a trip out there for some monthly hacker get together? Or what about New York, would it be worth heading out there for a monthly get together, also? I wouldn't know anyone out there so I don't even know if that'd be beneficial to just go do. (I don't see how it could necessarily hurt either) Should I focus on just making some cool projects and beefing up a github repo for myself? Should I blog? I've always been more of a ""do""-er when it comes to programming so I never did really focus on a blog for myself. I read HN daily and am jealous when I read posts about groups of people living in a house working on websites, etc. That's my eventual goal I guess and am trying to figure out how to get from here to there.<p>I'm not claiming to be a guru or anything but I do have this gut feeling that if I could wire myself into a community of like minded people then the future would at least be highly enjoyable and worth whatever I did to get there.<p>Thanks for any advice!",1289871541

Schmidt disagrees. He thinks people will watch even more television if it’s augmented with the Internet.</i><p>I can't imagine why they'd be worried. It's not like other advertising driven revenue models that came online earlier have been getting ground down into pulp or anything.<p>The networks are in the business of selling advertising (and buying or producing content as advertising delivery vehicles). What's more, they get the lions share of the money spend on TV advertising - there aren't substantial amounts being bled off to intermediaries.<p>Google is in the business of selling advertising, but not content. And they are in the business of standing between the advertiser and the content producer and taking a hefty percentage of the dollars spent on advertising. And they've proven to be very adept at business.<p>A large amount of advantage major networks hold over even cable channels is their ability to deliver large audiences to ad buyers. Because everything is pretty manual and there is no big auction network or the like, an ad buyer can't easily purchase the same reach of say 5M households that the network provides by placing their ads on 1000 programs each with 5000 viewers.<p>Once it's just as easy or easier to reach your audience through many small programs, the money will start to flow away from big TV and into smaller productions. That money will allow the upstarts to increase production value, competing more effectively. And whatever money is still going to the major networks will be getting a substantial slice taken out by the intermediaries and their ""value add"".<p>But Eric Schmidt says it won't be a problem.

If it is not self-funded the founders should have talked to at least Angel investors, they should have a list of questions that investors have been asking them prior to deciding to invest, and they should have a plan for answering those questions. If they don't, then they may have lost their way. If they are lost then staying is a waste of your time.",1289869421
