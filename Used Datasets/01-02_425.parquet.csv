A lot of the technical challenges JA mentioned would arguably be trivial for Google to solve, or attempt to solve (creating a name-hash network tree architecture like the one JA mentioned he'd liked to have seen become popular).<p>The problem I think is two-fold: 1. Google aligning with Wikileaks/JA will be seen as a political landmine for Google, since Wikileaks' agenda is very much at odds with many governments. This would obviously be something Google will have little interest in pursuing.<p>2. It's not in Google's best interest to propagate anonymity (as of now). Google's core revenue model derives from its ability to track people on the Internet. Making it easier for them to don anonymity will undermine and possibly destroy this model.<p>Whether Google's/Eric Schmidt's ultimate goals are good or evil is anybody's guess, and I don't think I gained any new insights into it based on this interview. It does appear that Eric/Google do have an interest in seeing freer access to information, as evidenced by them pushing for faster Internet, more secure/private browsing (https, 2-factor authentication, fighting official requests for access to user accounts [2]), access to the Internet in North Korea, etc. The more people are on the Internet, and the more they browse, the greater Google's revenues.<p>Google's upper management have also allegedly (and secretly) played a part in the Arab springs, which I would hazard a guess was a altruistic move, rather than a purely political one, but that's speculation [1].<p>Oh, and BTW, the timing of this 'leak' a few days before Eric Schmidt's book is highly suspect, no? :)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://thepassionateattachment.com/2012/03/23/stratforleaks-confirm-jared-cohens-involvement-in-arab-spring/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thepassionateattachment.com/2012/03/23/stratforleaks-...</a>\n(sorry this is not the best source, but Googling around will get you the actual Wikileaks cables and analysis)<p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2259557/google-fights-us-government-requests-for-private-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2259557/google-figh...</a><p>Edit: formatting",1366508752.0

So what I end up doing is writing a document that makes sense, then I go back and re-write parts of the app in order to fit the documentation.  Then, before tagging a release and announcing it, get a few other people to look it over first, just to make sure that everything matches.  Oh, and having an automated test suite that at least checks all common cases and various edge cases will make sure that you don't have to hurry up and push a .01 followed by a .02, .03, etc. release.<p>Now, that being, said, what is the best way to get a good group of pre-release testers?

To most office workers, Excel is their hammer.  You can stretch it to extreme limits by using things like pivot tables, and complicated lookup functions.  It's easier for them this way, that is to say they have fluency in excel, but none in programming, which means they fail to realize that a simple well written script could save them from every having to repeat a task.",1366506311.0
