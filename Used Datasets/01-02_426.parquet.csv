Only after 3 doctors visits and a raging fever and cough that was going on for 3 weeks did they prescribe me antibiotics.  of course by that time I already had pneumonia.<p>more recently this may, i had a bad cough, fever, and raging sore throat.  i could tell from how my body felt that everything was emanating from a single spot in the back of my throat, but of course when telling a doctor this they look at you like you have a 3rd eye, and then send you home (telling you to drink plenty of fluids and rest) after crawling there and paying a 50$ copay.  its inconceivable to them that we might actually understand our bodies, but i digress.  Even though I had puss nodules on the very spot (my left tonsil) I felt everything was coming from, I was not prescribed antibiotics because the strep test came back negative.<p>note, these are two severe cases where I was REALLY sick and not getting better.  not only did doctors not prescribe antibiotics for these, but for all general colds and flues that i have ever had - I have never received that as a prescription.  they simply will not do it.<p>lucky for me, I had a plane jane penicillin script that was never taken.  within an hour of taking it, the sore throat abated as did the fever.  by the next morning, I was nearly better.  maybe coincidence, but i seriously doubt it.<p>they love to fear monger about over prescribing antibiotics, about creating super bugs, etc.  but the truth is, they do help.  even with viruses, because quite often these diseases wreck your immune system allowing  many other things to take hold.  for instance, bacterial ear infections are quite common enough with these types of infections and antibiotics totally prevents them - and the good possibility of hearing loss.<p>however, evidenced based medicine is often set up to prove whatever agenda they want to pass.  a few people with reduced hearing is inconsequential to their idea of a greater good.  especially in the agenda to reduce people receiving antibiotics - even when evidence has shown that the amount of antibiotics farm animals are given probably over shadows any lack of antibiotics given to sick humans trying to get better.",1413336522.0
