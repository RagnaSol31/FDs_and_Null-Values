What makes a man attractive on the campus may not last beyond it... Women want powerful guys, and what defines power on campus mostly only works on the campus. You want an ambitious guy, one who will work hard for the family when school ends, not just a popular frat boy or middle of the road jock.<p>5. Be prepared to find a guy after college.

This allows nice details such as a drop-shadow from the minimap when it covers the text and proportional fonts in the file trees filenames.<p> On a Mac with smooth scrolling, you can scroll smoothly pixel-by-pixel, instead of choppily line-by-line.<p> You can easily rename a variable, by using Command-D repeatedly to select the instances of the names inside multiple carets. But I usually forget to do this until after Ive already renamed just one instance of the variable, and then I cant select the other instances without undoing that edit first, so its not that useful.<p> It uses Python as its scripting language, so you can use Python libraries easily, and dont have to learn an editor-specific language. Similarly, it uses JSON for settings.<p>But Sublime Text doesnt have nearly as many editing shortcuts by default as Vim. For instance, there isnt any hot-key to select inside a quoted string  Expand Selection to Scope is the closest, but its hard to predict what it will do and so it isnt very reliable. You <i>can</i> enable Vintage mode, which emulates many Vim key-bindings and thus gives you access to that power. That mode has a few small problems  the biggest one for me is that the Esc shortcut to exit the current mode sometimes conflicts with the Esc shortcut to remove extra carets so you have just one.<p>Its too bad Sublime Text isnt open source.

If you are only spending a few hours a month in front of a text editor, you are probably better off with something simple.  If, on the other hand, you are going to be using it all the time, it is well worth your time to learn an industrial strength one like VIM or EMACS.

If an algorithm is truly unique and worth the patent then in reality it shouldn't need the patent at all.<p>I also don't understand the ""I invented an extremely complicated algorithm for solving X"" mentality.
