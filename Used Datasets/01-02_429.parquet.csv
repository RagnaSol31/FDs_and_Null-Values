It made me ditch Mac OS 8.x full-time instead of just maintaining a 9x box for games. XP wasn't horrible either. Sure, after that things stagnated for a long timeand that led me to dally again with Macs and eventually switch back to OS X for my main machinebut after the initial kinks were worked out Vista and 7 added some much-needed things (especially 7, UI-wise).<p>But I agree that the ""death of Microsoft"" stuff is tiring. Personally, I'm pretty excited to see how this goes, since I like what MS is doing to bring touch-centered concepts to the desktop, and really don't like the direction Apple is going with Lion/Mountain Lion. I just wonder if MS will iterate quickly enoughApple's release cycles may put a lot of pressure on them to get an ""8.1"" out the door very quickly with the kinks worked out.",1338775125.0

It could very well be that S&P 500 companies are disappearing from the list at a faster rate because they're being merged into or acquired by other companies at a faster rate.<p>* To what extent does the rate of churn in the S&P 500 reflect declines in specific sectors of the economy unrelated to software?  For example, US manufacturing has faced challenging times for several decades, so one would expect to see this trend reflected in the list.<p>* How did the inflating and bursting of the Housing Bubble impact the companies exposed to that industry in the S&P 500?  For example, many home builders and mortgage lenders boomed during the bubble and then went bust when the bubble burst. How is that reflected in the data?<p>* How did the growth in financial services as a percentage of GDP affect the index prior to the financial crisis?  How about after the financial crisis?  Think not just about Lehman Brothers's demise, but about all the formerly high-flying financial firms that went bust or whose size is considerably smaller today.",1338775089.0

E-greedy (and e-greedy decreasing) is nice because it is simple. Softmax/Boltzman, is interesting since it is satisfying in that it selects arms weighted by the estimated means, and UCB-Tuned and UCB-Normal are nice because, like AB testing, they take variance measures directly into account when selecting an arm.\nTake a look at this paper from Doina Precup (who is super nice BTW) and Volodymyr Kuleshov from 2000 <a href=""http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~vkules/bandits.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~vkules/bandits.pdf</a> they have comparisons between various methods. Guess what - the simple methods work just fine.\nOf course there are various Bayesion versions - esp of UCB.  Nando de Freitas over at UBC has a recent ICML paper on using the Gaussian Process for Bandits (based on a form of UCB). See <a href=""http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/papers/BayesBandits.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/papers/BayesBandits.pdf</a>\nI have not given it a tight read, but not sure what the practical return would be.  Plus you have to fiddle with picking a Kernel function, and I imagine length scales and the rest of hyper parameters associated with GPs.  \nI did read a working paper from Nando a few years back that used a random forest as a prior - I can't seem to find it now.\nBTW - John Langford is program chair of this years ICML over in Edinburgh.  If you are in the UK might be worth it to pop up and attend.  Plus Chris Williams is there at Edinburgh, so maybe you can corner him about GPs. Although he has moved on from GPs - he still wrote (well, co-wrote) the book and is one of the smartest people I have ever met.",1338775039.0

34,4062314,comment,4061815.0,4062122.0,3,0,jacquesgt,,,"In response to the last paragraph, there's a tension between two different visions for the C language. One of the visions is what's sometimes called ""high-level assembly language"". In that case, undefined behavior lets implementors choose the behavior that makes the most sense in that situation. Someone writing software for a DSP is going to have different expectations for the behavior or integers than someone writing software for a general purpose processor. Forcing both implementations to use the exact same semantics is going to slow both of them down, because extra checks will have to be added to work around the differences in the underlying hardware.<p>The other vision for C is a portable systems programming language. When trying to write portable code, undefined or implementation-defined behavior is a big problem. I'm glad that compiler writers employ a take-no-prisoners approach here. People shouldn't be relying on undefined behavior when trying to write portable code, so compiler writers shouldn't be bound to implement consistent behavior in those cases. That's especially the case if code ever needs to be compiled with a different compiler, which might decide to implement different consistent behavior.<p>It's also worth noting that in some cases, the exploitation of undefined behavior doesn't always happen in a single place in a compiler. Instead, it can be a combination of applying a few different rules in different optimization passes that produces surprising results.<p>With that being said, it sure would be nice if the compiler writers figured out how to give more warnings when undefined behavior is detected. If x + 1 > x is optimized to false, tell me! If a dereference of a pointer that could be null leads to potentially dead code being eliminated, tell me about that too! It's the silently surprising behavior that causes the most problems.",1338774039.0

I plan to visit this year.<p>The site is a bunch of concentric T shaped monoliths - kind of like Stone Henge. Except the stones are cut more cleanly, covered in beautiful animal reliefs and it is nearly 8000 years older than stone henge. Activity suggest its origins could reach as far back as 20,000 years ago. And the reason the site has survived intact till this day is because whatever culture built the place decided to bury it. There are all sorts of theories as to whether a hunter gatherer society could really build such a place. Whatever the case, this discovery gives the typical timeline of history a very hard erm time.<p><i>Until excavations began, a complex on this scale was not thought possible for a community so ancient, and with such primitive quarrying tools. The massive sequence of stratification layers suggests several millennia of activity, perhaps reaching back to the Mesolithic. The oldest occupation layer (Layer III) contains monolithic pillars linked by coarsely built walls to form circular or oval structures. Four such buildings have been uncovered, with diameters between 1030 meters (3398 ft). Geophysical surveys indicate the existence of 16 additional structures.\nLayer II, dated to Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) (75006000 BC), has revealed several adjacent rectangular rooms with floors of polished lime, reminiscent of Roman terrazzo floors. The most recent layer consists of sediment deposited as the result of agricultural activity.<p>At present, Gbekli Tepe raises more questions for archaeology and prehistory than it answers. We do not know how a force large enough to construct, augment, and maintain such a substantial complex was mobilized and rewarded or fed in the conditions of pre-Neolithic society. We cannot ""read"" the pictograms, and do not know for certain what meaning the animal reliefs had for visitors to the site; the variety of fauna depicted, from lions and boars to birds and insects, makes any single explanation problematic. As there seems to be little or no evidence of habitation, and the animals depicted on the stones are mainly predators, the stones may have been intended to stave off evils through some form of magic representation; it is also possible that they served as totems.[31] The assumption that the site was strictly cultic in purpose and not inhabited has also been challenged by the suggestion that the structures served as large communal houses, ""</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe</a><p><a href=""http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/gobekli-tepe/musi-photography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/gobekli-tepe/musi-...</a>",1338772414.0

Complex single cell life is about 2 billion years old. Multicellular life is about a billion years old. Complex animals are about half a billion years old.<p>In about 600 million years (assuming no intelligence intervenes) decreasing CO2 levels will make C3 photosynthesis impossible. Almost all plants will then die. That will be bad news for most animal life, too.<p>By 800 million years from now, C4 photosynthesis will no longer be possible, and all plants go, followed by free oxygen, and we lose all multicellular life.<p>If that's typical for planets that can bear life, there isn't a big window for intelligence to develop. From complex animals to the end of multicellular life is only about 1.3 billion years.<p>In that time, you'll have a few super volcanoes and asteroid impacts and irradiations from nearby supernovas and several trips of your solar system around its galactic orbit (each of which can have a period of exposure to the galactic bow shock, which some scientists think causes dangerous levels of cosmic rays)--plenty of opportunities for a major extinction event to shake things up. Note that humans barely made it--the Toba super volcano around 70k years ago is though to have reduced humanity to between 1k and 10k breeding pairs.<p>It seems quite possible that we got lucky, and developed intelligence much faster than would by typical, and that a species on a more normal pace to intelligence simply doesn't have time to evolve it before their planet becomes incapable of supporting multicellular life.<p>Of course, it is also possible that we were slow, and that elsewhere the first complex animals to evolve go on to develop intelligence, in which case the galaxy could easily be full of intelligent life.",1338772097.0

Hell, why not just offer VC money and own part of the company for far less money. That story sounds like hype.<p>Groupon's real problem is their business model is too easily copied. It's also heavy on the service end, where it relies on a person to person business experience, something Google is kind of adverse to.<p>Around here all I see is advertisements for Living Social. I haven't counted but I am sure there are hundreds of other copy cats out there. It's hard to guess which company is going to have the best business model in a new business type, or really if the business model has staying power at all.<p>Doesn't this business model attract people that want a great deal for almost nothing? It introduces people to a business they might not know about which is good. But can't people just visit local businesses if they care to get to know them? I don't get the business model at all.",1338771745.0

If you've seen either of those, the main character being male could have been an influence (the movies certainly were for me). It wasn't until '95 that Angelina Jolie was in Hackers. Besides such movies, the other role models in popular culture would be the archetypical Einstein (Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future), etc. In the west, engineers aren't held in as high esteem as eg China (where the president is an engineer), at least not until recently (with Zuckerberg as the modern archetype).<p>There are historical female role models: Madame Curie, Grace Hopper, and Ada Lovelace probably the top three (and for a modern one, how about the founder of Adafruit? and so on and so forth). Showing their wiki pages to any young females, if the topic comes up, is a helpful contribution IMO.",1338771655.0
