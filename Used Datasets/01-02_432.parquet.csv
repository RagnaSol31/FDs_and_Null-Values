When the software company I founded was at about $650,000 in annual revenue, I was convinced that it was time to bring in a seasoned leader who knew how to take the business to the next level because I, as a first-time entrepreneur, had certainly not done it before.<p>In retrospect, that mentality was a mistake.  The truth is that you understand the business better than anyone else and there is no magical skill or talent that someone else can bring to the table that will so fundamentally improve things.<p>Do not make the mistake of thinking that if you <i>transfer</i> responsibility to &quot;better&quot; executive that they can do a better job.  That person will bring their own strengths/weaknesses to the table.  They will need to rely on a team to make up for their handicaps just as you are looking to do.<p>In this situation, I recommend the following:<p>- First, clearly identify exactly what issues are vexing you.  If it seems like &quot;everything&quot; or &quot;things are just overwhelming&quot; then make a list of just the most important issues.<p>- Then pick 1 or 2 or 3 that you can actually focus on solving.
