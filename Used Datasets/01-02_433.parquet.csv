People are out defending their languages, frameworks, styles, and trying to convert others as if it were a religion. It used to be fun to read about all that but now it's really frustrating as sometimes you can't even have a decent conversation about such topics without people getting overly emotional... Like when you talk about religion.<p>The reason I mention this is because most people I know do nothing but OO programming and I've seen nothing but people defaulting to either OOP or functional because that's what ""good"" programmers are supposed to do. I agree with a lot of his points especially the part about the code being convoluted. Sometimes it's harder to figure out what's going on by chasing down classes and their members than it should be.<p>I'm not afraid to write procedural code at all. I've had people thumb their nose at me for writing procedural code claiming it would be more ""elegant"" or readable if it was OO. I don't care about elegance and the code is still readable. Their real problem is this snottiness they've developed after learning how program in an OO way. If it works and it works well, and it's maintainable then who gives a damn if it'd OO or procedural or a bunch of include statements linked to files each with a single function in them or something. That's not to say I don't write OO code. I do. When it's the right choice. But when I read an article like this I'm reminded of all the programmers who default to language x, framework x, style x, and platform x because ""that's what good programmers do"" as if bad programmers don't write OO or functional code.

The creator's rights are no less important than the consumer's rights.</i><p>My stance on the matter is that copyright takes away from the general public in the first place. It's not justified, and abolishing therefore means restoring it to the way it's supposed to be. Sorry, but I don't accept copyright as a given something whose abolishing we have to justify. On the contrary, the burden of proof lies on the advocates of copyright to show that it is justified to take away from the general public to hand a monopoly on non-scarce resources to private parties. And I am quite positive that it isn't.<p><i>>Copying is not stealing technically but when something that is meant to be paid for gets copied and passed around free it does become stealing.</i><p>No, it isn't. Stealing has a strict definition: I take something away from you, which you lack afterwards. Copying involves no loss. No, not ""lost profits"" either. It's bullshit. Applying the word to copying is just a pathetic appeal to emotion.<p>Funnily enough, labeling us ""pirates"" in an attempt to villainize us has probably been the greatest thing the entertainment industry has ever done. It was adapted as a proud, if sometimes self-ironic label, and eventually spawned an entire political movement which now operates in pretty much all western countries with varying degrees of success.<p><i>>Arguments about software being non-scarce don't apply.</i><p>Oh yes they do. Waving them aside like that doesn't change the fact that existing software is most definitely non-scarce. There's no limit on how much you can copy it. What you are talking about is the <i>creation of software</i>, which falls under the same category as claiming that without copyright, there would be no music.<p><i>>Should authors only be paid for one copy of their book?</i><p>If you consider writing a book a service, then basically yes, s?he should be payed once. As every other artisan providing services is. There were even business models like that, with varying degrees of success (ask for sum $x, release book under public domain when $x is reached).<p><i>>Why is it wrong to have a choice?</i><p>If that choice conflicts with reality, then no, you can't have a choice. And reality is that you cannot and should not be able to stop copying and sharing. It's pointless and largely impossible without extremely draconian measures, and, again, highly unethical to attempt to do so.<p>Oh, and you have quite a choice. You can either release your works and deal with the fact that they will be copied and shared - or you don't release anything.<p><i>>so why is it that the anti-copyright crowd insists that creators should not have the choice to charge for what they create and should gladly give away their work for free.</i><p>But we are not. We're just saying you can't stop us from sharing. Those are two different, though related things. I can only refer you to the GPL as a good example for this: while you cannot demand access to source per se (and you <i>can</i> charge for a copy of the program if you do so choose), you cannot demand that others <i>stop</i> giving access (share) either. It's basically the golden rule. I cannot demand you to give me a copy of your program. Neither can you demand that I stop giving a copy I received from where-ever to other people. Your rights stop where mine begin. Copyright infringes on my right to share.<p><i>>But at the same time I don't see a way for me, as a developer, to continue to make a living off my work in a world where it's legal for anyone to distribute my work freely against my wishes.</i><p>Well, that's a pity to heard but ultimately not of interest, as hard as it may sound. As I have said multiple times, distribution as a business model is <i>dead</i>. The horde of copyright-dependent zombies which are still crawling around are a danger to our future society and need to be put to rest as fast as possible.

I think it's an awesome idea.<p>I would not assume going for a job interview or talking to a prospective employer necessarily constitutes ""seeking employment"". See this for instance:<p><a href=""http://visaforimmigration.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visaforimmigration.com/</a><p>> <i>USCIS will usually allow a non-immigrant to enter the US to attend a specific pre-arranged job interview in visitor status.</i><p>The implication is that you go for the interview on-site, but do not attempt to actually work; you first have to back to your country then go through the normal H1-B (or other such visa) process.<p>Of course that's not directly applicable to people holding visitor status that want to look for jobs after attending Hacker School. Attending the School might not be allowed in the first place.<p>If you're getting a lot of non-US candidates (either for Hacker School or directly to Hackruiter), I think it would be a good idea to consult an immigration lawyer.",1325898457.0

They're less objectionable than SOPA because they have some semblance of a claim to legality under current law, but I hardly think they're a model of how the Internet should be policed (or that the Internet as a whole even needs policing).  Many, many subdomains were seized by ICE that were completely innocent, and there was still a lack of due process (see the rojadirecta.com case, where a site that is legal in its home country had its domain taken, then returned without explanation a year later).",1325898429.0
