19,10442111,comment,10441976.0,10441976.0,0,0,timtadh,,,"While I do not agree with everything in this article, indeed some of its claims are\nsuspect, I think it raises important points. There is a dynamic interplay\nbetween &quot;science&quot;, the act of discovery, and &quot;technology&quot; putting knowledge to\nwork. In my own work, the desire to accomplish a task drives my scientific work.\nAll of my current work has a &quot;natural application&quot; in my field but has lead me\nto interesting mathematical questions which have potential applications\nelsewhere as well. Thus, the dynamic I have personally observed: progress in one\nspace enables progress in another.<p>Furthermore, without individuals who are largely interested in knowledge\ndiscovery, I maintain that progress would be slower. Someone had to desire to\nunderstand cells and know about x-ray crystallography in order for it to be\napplied. I picked on this example because it was brought up in the article. But,\nby the same token, people interested largely in technological improvement are\nalso needed. It takes a lot to move a discovery from a lab notebook into a\nuseful state.<p>I also categorically reject the notion of technology being a thing unto itself\nthat perpetuates itself. Humanity is the engine of innovation and no amount of\ninnovation is likely to change that any time soon. All technology and all\nmachines are ultimately at the service of humans. We are not in the service of\nthe machine. We are dependent upon our machines but are machines are not free\nfrom us. This is why post-apocalyptic stories of AI destroying humanity remain\npopular. We are uncomfortable and fearful of our own dependence.<p>The fear of both scientists and corporations is we fundamentally do not know\nwhat the world looks like without government involvement. There is no roadmap\nfor a transition. There is no telling who would win and who would lose. In the\npast several decades major research institutions both public and private have\nall had shrinking &quot;time-horizons&quot; for their research. The time-horizon is when\nthe research (if fruitful) could result in technological advancement. In the\nshort term a transition to industry funded research would only accelerate that\ntrend.<p>In conclusion, science funding and science in general is deeply dysfunctional\nright now. A lot of time is spent of obtaining and keeping funding. Our funding\nsystem has likely caused a over supply of entry level researchers which has\nfueled low wages. But at the same time, we do not know of a better way to fund\nresearch at the moment. If non-governmental funding is better there is no real\nway to try it that won&",

RK4 is almost as easy to implement but dramatically higher accuracy.
