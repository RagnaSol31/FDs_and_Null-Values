It wasn't received well and it didn't even make it to the front page. I was a little disappointed that fellow HNers didn't care about my app and that no blogs wanted to write about me since I was overshadowed by a similar app a month earlier (which at the time I didn't know about). But such is life and I hacked on.<p>I tried a few ways to advertise around, but I noticed a common trend: some people naturally bounced, others liked the site enough to rate dozens of things, I got some nice emails from users who liked Archfinch a lot but retention was very low. To my amazement of people who rated anything at all, the average rating count was high:<p><pre><code>    avg    |  stddev  \n  ---------+----------\n    60.943 |  68.147\n</code></pre>\nClearly I was doing something right. But there was no way I could keep people based on movie recommendations alone -- people don't need that kind of service often, and by the time they do, they will have forgotten about Archfinch.<p>I implemented something I planned to do 'in the future': fresh links, HN/reddit-style, with a twist: you get personalized link recommendations. This seems to work well so far, people are coming back for more. And it has a chance to work -- reddit, Digg, etc. have all succeeded in the past and people need their daily fix of links.<p>In theory, link recommendations could be the end to the 'eternal september' syndrome that all such websites suffered in the past: the algorithm could recommend cat pictures to the masses and awesome links to people like us. Time will tell however.<p>Some of you mind find this boring but personally I like reading about people's mistakes and their subsequent analysis so maybe some of you will find this interesting as well.<p>If you feel like checking out Archfinch [2], feedback is very welcome, either here or at luke@archfinch.com, I read (and try to respond to) all emails.<p>References:<p>[1] - http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1601930<p>[2] - http://archfinch.com/",1301277456.0

24,2376755,comment,2376139.0,2376372.0,5,0,jsz0,,,"Apparently Microsoft wants to target WM7 at consumers. They've done very little to integrate WM7 with Windows Server -- in fact WM7 is a big step backwards in this respect compared to WM6. I think you're right that going after the enterprise market would have made a lot more sense but for whatever reason Microsoft is still in denial about losing their death grip on the consumer market and as a result squander opportunities to succeed in markets they already own. As for RIM I think their enterprise credibility isn't what it used to be. Apple in particular, and Android to a lesser degree, have surpassed them in many ways. Not so much on the device management side, which is somewhat trivial on these devices anyway, but more so on pure functionality. There are just so many things you can't do on the latest & greatest BlackBerry. It's great you can manage the hell out of the device but the gap in functionality is massive these days. The only reason RIM hasn't totally imploded is that BlackBerries are dirt cheap which makes up for the lack of functionality. This isn't really sustainable.",1301277177.0

You cannot be negative to customers as an employee in a professional setting, that is a big no-no as far as customer service goes. Most customer service people have it pounded into them to ""leave home life, at home"", while inviting on any negativity that ""how are you doing"" may bring from the customer. You are also under time constraints which you and the customer are usually aware of. If someone really wants to go into the terribly surgery they're recovering from or that they lost their job the other day, you have to cut them short to move on to other customers. No one wants to hear the lonely old mans stories while he holds up the entire line. You will get dinged as an employee for not servicing enough customers if you let this get out of hand.<p>Additionally ""how are you doing?"" rarely will get a completely honest answer. It is a ritual for most people. People don't go into the deep personal crises they're having with a barista, cashier or bank teller. Nor does the company they work for really care. You personally may have compassion for the person but even if you heard the actual tragedy in someones life(which some people do go into), you have very little power to affect the situation. I guess you can say ""well hope that works out for you"", but that doesn't really solve the problem. Worse is when the company you work for is at fault for the problem & the company wants to wash their hands of it while putting all the pressure on you to ""smooth things over"" with the customer.<p>I think it's nice to try and be positive, but I also like to be realistic. My beef usually is more with companies who really don't give a shit about the customer, but burden their employees to represent the business as though it really does, meanwhile usually treating the employee like crap as well.",1301276766.0

57,2376721,comment,2376431.0,2376593.0,5,0,modeless,,,"<i>In key continuity schemes, when your browser is first introduced to a new website, you simply are insecure. If at that moment you are MITM'd by an attacker, you might never again be secure. This isn't a UI issue: key continuity protocols don't have the information available to them on first connection to make that decision.</i><p>What if you add that information to a key continuity system?  I feel like this is an obvious idea, but I've never heard of a system using it.  It's simple: when you first see a certificate you send it to a trusted third party to check.  That third party doesn't need to be or even know about the CA who originally issued the cert; all it has to do is make its own connection to the server and make sure it gets the same cert you did.  That protects against any MITM on your end of the connection.<p>To succeed, a MITM would have to control either the server's connection (which becomes the server operator's problem), or both your connection and the trusted third party's connection (which becomes the trusted third party's problem).  I'd rather trust a single third party of my choosing than a huge list of CAs chosen by an opaque and somewhat arbitrary process.",1301276322.0

Parties means both the Company and Investor. Party means one of them.<p>b.

Next round of funding refers to the very next round of funding that takes place after the current funding round is closed.<p>2. TERMS<p>2.1	Investor Options:<p>2.1.1	Before the close of the next round of funding, Company agrees to notify Investor of the date on which the round is expected to close, the amount of money committed in the round, and the total number of shares that are expected to be sold for that money. This will determine the pre-money valuation of the shares before the closing of the next round of funding.<p>2.1.2	Investor shall have the option of selling back to the Company up to $25,000 of the shares they own in Company, as determined by the pre-money valuation of these shares (rather than their valuation during the Current funding round). The remainder of the shares may be sold to the Company if both Parties decide agree to the sale in writing at that time. Otherwise, they shall continue to be held by Investor.<p>2.1.3	During the next round of funding, Company shall give Investor the opportunity to invest alongside the other investors in that round, and on equivalent terms. Investor recognizes that Company may set the maximum number of shares it is prepared to issue and sell during the next round of funding, and the round may be oversubscribed. In this case, Parties will work together with the other investors to work out an equitable arrangement, which may cause one or more investors in the next round to purchase a different number of shares in Company than was reported by Company to Investor in 2.1.1 .<p>2.2	Time Frames:<p>2.2.1	Company will notify Investor as described in 2.1.1 at least fifteen (15) days before the close of the next round of funding.<p>2.2.2	Investor will have five (5) business days to respond to Company regarding their decision to invoke either of options 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 . If after this period, Investor has not indicated to Company that they will invoke either of these options, then both Parties agree to proceed as if Investor has indicated to Company they choose to invoke neither of the options -- and in particular, that the Investor will continue to own the same shares as they did previously, neither selling any of them nor investing alongside other investors.<p>2.2.3	Should circumstances arise that necessitate further negotiation, Investor and Company agree to participate in good faith in these negotiations, recognizing that the next funding round should be completed in a timely manner and that the terms should be equitable to all Parties.",1301275459.0
