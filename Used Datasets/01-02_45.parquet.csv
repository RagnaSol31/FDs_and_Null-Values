Notice it is fully documented, all the different contexts it works in, what it returns, how it returns it, the different types it works on.  One might consider perl to be OVERLY documented, and navigating the man pages works pretty well when searching from inside less(1).  I wish python and ruby and PHP had their entire documentation, or even just a significant standard library function list, available as man pages on every system they are installed on (although, why Ubuntu's doesn't package up perl man pages as part of perl by default, I don't know).<p>Then look up the Ruby documentation for .. , which is also <i>overloaded</i> to have two different meanings, one that works inside conditionals and one that constructs Range objects when outside of Range objects, which is just as much syntactic sugar as anything perl provides.

That's the complete answer, and it's really misleading to say anything else.<p>I don't think any Java programmers actually have any misunderstanding here, even the worst of them know how this works.  What's the problem?<p>Also, the article tries to use code like this:<p><pre><code>  void swap(SomeType& arg1, Sometype& arg2) {\n    SomeType temp = arg1;\n    arg1 = arg2;\n    arg2 = temp;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nto prove how different references in C++ are from Java.<p>But the reason something like that might work in C++ is not that the semantics of parameter passing are different (references cannot be reseated in C++ any more than in Java), but that C++ uses the assignment operator to overwrite the contents of the lhs, and invokes the copy constructor automatically.  The true equivalent code in Java works just fine, assuming the copy constructor and set method do the right things (which is a potential pitfall in C++, as well):<p><pre><code>  static public void swap(SomeType arg1, SomeType arg2) {\n    SomeType temp = new SomeType(arg1);\n    arg1.set(arg2);\n    arg2.set(temp);\n  }</code></pre>",1260149107

Since they were both generated in the same way, they're also more directly comparable to one another.  The most eye-catching thing about these two are of probably the chains of expressions which encode the precedence rules of their operators.  Java has a boatload of operators, which account for the top half of its graph.  It then has two snarls at the bottom, one for statements on the left, one for declarations on the right.  Most modern languages in the algol family will have statement syntax rather similar to Java's here; if you're interested in what sets Java apart syntactically you'd likely find it clustered about the bottom right corner of the graph.<p>Javascript's operators are only slightly simpler than Java's, and there are two variations, one that allows the 'in' operator, and one that does not.  This creates the two chains running down the bottom-right hand side.  One interesting thing to note is the lack of tight, complicated snarls in the javascript graph.  Javascript's grammar is fairly simple, and ignoring the 'in' operator, quite straightforwards, so I suppose this shouldn't be too surprising.",1260148216

So many people tell me ""I'd love it if I could just pay per channel and forget about the other channels.""<p>That got me thinking it may be something to exploit. Not so, with infrastructure costs swallowing up so much of the potential profits. People will just have to deal with all the channels they end up paying for. So, it's either the internet or bust if you don't want to play the cable game.",1260148198

Empirically, people will pay for LOTS of things that have zero marginal cost.  A short list: airplane tickets, gym memberships, list of bankruptcy sales in Chicago (my dad is a real estate agent and has had stacks of this weekly publication for as long as I can remember -- that info is <i>expensive</i> and worth every penny), and WoW.",1260148196

Unfortunately a lot of (poor) writers can't tell the difference between well meaning criticism and soul crushing negativity. I hate phrases like, ""If you can't find something nice to say, don't say anything at all.""<p>Criticism is an absolutely fantastic tool in entrepreneurship. Want an idea for a company? Try someone else's product and write down all the problems with it. After having to put up with the Common Application as provided by Hobsons.com I can't wait for someone to take a crack at putting them out of business.",1260147826

Though money cannot buy you satisfaction in your job, it does help to alleviate some stress in other factors of your life and can give you an outlet. More money means you can take a mini-vacation every weekend or new toys or what ever floats your boat. The point being that stress reduction in other facets of your life can really help one to cope with work related stress. Not to mention that if the rate is good enough saying ""oh well at least they are paying me a small fortune"" is a coping mechanism in itself.",1260147809
