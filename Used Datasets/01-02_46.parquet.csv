I don't see how useful that would actually be. When Adobe actually ships a modern mobile ARM version of Flash the issue becomes more relevant.

After countless frustrated attempts to connect and establish better communication with Ruby/Rails User Groups in Europe, we came up with the concept of Rubyists.EU ( http://rubyists.eu ).<p>In its gist, the Rubyists.EU ( http://rubyists.eu ) initiative is a free of charge communication platform that aims at promoting awareness, enhancing assistance, and further boosting cooperation and collaboration among individual hackers and User Groups in Europe.<p>We would like to invite all the Rubyists in Europe to join this adventure by registering their User Groups and following us on Twitter ( http://twitter.com/rubyists_eu ), LinkedIn ( http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2400973 ), Facebook ( http://www.facebook.com/pages/Europe/RubyistsEU/188196555796 ), and Google Groups ( http://groups.google.com/group/rubyists-eu ). You can even fork the source code from our Github account ( http://github.com/rock-n-code/rubyists.eu ).<p>We are looking forward to seeing how your participation in the Rubyists.EU ( http://rubyists.eu ) initiative can shape the vision and influence the development of both Ruby and Rails in Europe!",1257296534.0
