The genome is not randomly distributed, and there are lots of repeated elements that make assembly impossible with such short fragments of sequence.  Even shotgun sequencing -- which has read lengths of <i>hundreds</i> of bases -- isn't good enough for the human genome.<p>That said, the technology might be useful for something like large-scale SNP analysis, where (even though they've got error rates >1%), they could sequence the same genome dozens of times, and get an idea of the interesting variations.  Maybe.  But the current technology isn't very useful for genome sequencing and assembly.",1249955859.0

4,754512,comment,754225.0,754225.0,0,0,chipmunkninja,,,"Look, we can get one thing clear here:  ""Communist China"" is not some dark gulag where people are beaten while walking down the street for having vaguely pro-democracy thoughts or something.<p>Indeed, it's increasingly not accurate to call China a communist state any more.  Communism is about collectivism, planned economic policies, and egalitarianism.  China began abandoning these policies nearly immediately after the death of Chairman Mao in 1976.  Granted, there are still warehouses full of grain and pork, and only the government can officially ""own"" land, but the reality at street level is that it's a pretty thriving capitalist state with 100 year leases on land, increasing dismantling of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and a vibrant mercantilism I've not seen anywhere else in the world.<p>What China is, though, is an autocratic state with a single party central government that maintains tight control over the press.  Look closer, however, and it exercises the tight control over a few key topics with which most Westerners are familiar (and porn - porn is bad).  If you are a reporter, then these controls can be frustrating, if not downright aggravating, but otherwise, life here is pretty relaxed and open.<p>The reality on the street?  The locals engage in vibrant discussions and arguments about Taiwan, Tibet, or whatever online on a daily basis.  Sometimes they use encoded keywords to keep the noise level down, but they talk about it all the time.  What the government really cares about is people organising - that is verboten.  I've tried to avoid talking about all these ""sensitive"" subjects in my years here in China (largely because politics stresses me out), and I am constantly approached by locals who want talk about it and give me their opinions.<p>The Great Firewall isn't nearly as big of a deal as you'd think either.  No Twitter?  Facebook? Livejournal?  Guess what?  The locals weren't using it anyway (not in appreciable numbers).  They were (are) using local Chinese equivalents, which are far better at catering to their needs and desires.  I don't know a single foreigner who hasn't found a way around the firewall to use Twitter on a daily basis either.<p>So, to summarize:  China is an autocratic state, it has some definite problems with various values and things that many Westerners take for granted as important, but to just sit on the sidelines saying ""Boo, China"" isn't going to change a thing.  China will gradually change by engaging with them and by working to move forward with them.  Indeed, by not coming here to visit and or spend a bit of time, you're denying yourself experiencing one of the more vibrant and fascinating places on earth.",1249955774.0

12,754503,comment,754348.0,754420.0,0,0,hooande,,,That may or may not be true. Every search has a stimulus. Most people don't wake up with a craving for widgets and go straight to google. Something that they encounter offline or online leads them to believe that they need to buy widgets. The problem with traditional display advertising is that it takes a shotgun approach...the goal is to show people as many banner ads as possible in the hope that you can make an impression with one of them (and prompt someone to <i>search</i> for your product). Someone with the amount of data that amazon or facebook has could do a lot to improve the general quality of those ads.,1249955493.0

They will also match and overlap a lot with each other. This means that you can't tell where they're supposed to go when you try to re-assemble your collection of little bits into a complete sequence. This means that you're always going to be left with a collection of bits left over that you have no way of placing into the sequence, hence less than 100% coverage.<p>I guess you would need to be using reads long enough to ensure that each of your fragments was unique to get 100% coverage.",1249954998.0

(Note the difference between ""close to zero"" and ""zero""... but probably not enough of a difference to matter much.)<p>What I think is the case is that when some papers face the task of generating value, a lot of them will fold, but some of them will find it in themselves to produce good content. Being more directly exposed to the market will almost certainly cull the herd, but I for one would trade the quantity we have now for quality any day.<p>The fact that we're even talking about this rather proves the point that most of them have nothing of value to offer (recalling that ""the media"" isn't actually one monolithic entity). If the content were truly that valuable, they already <i>would</i> have locked it behind pay walls and people would be paying for it, as evidenced by the valuable content that has survived exactly that process.
