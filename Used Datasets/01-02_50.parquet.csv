37,385126,comment,379460.0,379460.0,0,0,gregggreg,,,"<i>In fact, the acquirer would have been better off; not only wouldn't these guys have broken anything, they'd have gotten a lot more done.</i><p>That's where you lost me. Sure, there are companies who add checks without thinking of the consequences, but as a company goes from a startup that is not making money to a more mature company that is making money, the cost of breaking things becomes very, very high. That is why most post-startup companies add more checks, to protect their revenue stream. And any company making decent money has a revenue stream that far outweighs the amount of money that the programmers would be willing to pay to have a faster release cycle. And the risk of the company losing their revenue stream for any significant amount of time far outweighs the risk in losing decent programmers because they aren't happy with the length of the release cycle.<p>You seem to say that these particular programmers would never have broken anything, but I find that impossible to believe unless they are working on something that is not at all complex or is inconsequential to the revenue stream. Every programmer, even the best programmer in the world writes code with bugs in it. The more complex a system is, the more likely there are to be bugs in it and as a company grows and makes money, the more complex their systems will become.<p>As an example, let's say that you were responsible for a web application that brought in a million dollars of revenue a day and you had these supposedly perfect programmers that never made mistakes who were responsible for the code. Would you let them just throw out whatever code they wanted onto the servers because you trusted them to not make mistakes? Or would you be more reasonable and put some checks in place first to make sure that the application worked correctly?<p>Obviously there needs to be a sane balance between the risk of breaking the application and the opportunity cost of not updating the application and the frustration of slowing down development is one of the costs that should be weighed, but to say that there shouldn't be any checks added as a company matures is almost laughable.",1228353815

45,385118,comment,384606.0,384691.0,0,0,kragen,,,"Yes.  As Adam Smith sort of points out, they also make greater specialization possible.  When you get access to a larger market (through dropping trade barriers, improved transportation technology, population growth, or whatever) you can either expand your business or increase its specialization (making it, one hopes, more efficient).<p>What's interesting is that in the 20th Century the big trend was that people expanded their businesses; now, it seems that people are instead specializing more.  Presumably some of the reasons for this are to be found in The Nature of the Firm, but while I don't think Coase has the whole story, I think his viewpoint is helpful here.  It's not that people are collaborating in smaller groups than before; we're all still collaborating with everyone else in the economy.  It's that the nature of that collaboration is changing from intra-company collaboration to inter-company collaboration.  Coase focuses on inter-company collaboration through market mechanisms, but another important kind of collaboration is non-market exchange of information.  The vast common body of free software and knowledge that we all share access to is a major reason that we can launch an innovative web site today with one or two people working together for a few months.<p>If you wanted to launch Reddit (or HN) in 1990, you would have had to write client software, set up a modem bank, and ship starter kits to our clients with a CD-ROM and a modem inside.  The fact that you can just buy access to the internet cheaply instead is collaboration through the market.  So is being able to buy a multi-gigahertz machine with gigabytes of RAM for US$500.<p>But in 1990, you would have had to do a lot more.  You would have had to drop US$500 on a compiler from Borland or somebody and write your code in C++.  (If you preferred Lisp, you could drop US$3000 or so on a MacIvory from Symbolics instead; they weren't dead at the time.  Or Lucid Common Lisp on a Sun, maybe; how much did that cost?)  Now  we can write our software in PLT Scheme or Python instead.<p>If you wanted to do cool AJAXy effects, even assuming that you could transfer the Web software of 2000 back to 1990, you'd still need to implement all the AJAXy stuff yourself, as I did in 2000, instead of just using Prototype or MochiKit or jQuery.  A couple of years earlier, you would have had to use Java.<p>And today, you can run the whole thing on Linux.  In 1990, you would have had to buy SunOS, or HP-UX, or Ultrix, or some other such horrible abortion, and the minimum price for that hardware was around $5000.  And you probably would have had to recompile your kernel.<p>And when you have trouble load-balancing, you can Google to find out how people set up reverse proxies and round-robin DNS and the like, rather than inventing it for the first time and publishing a paper about it.<p>This growth of the information commons means that you can <i>afford</i> to be much more specialized today.  You can focus on the unique aspects of your site, rather than figuring out how to run the first or second global information service.",1228353249

One day they are the gatekeepers of the internet and the next day they are trying to make ends meet.  They still make billions a year don't they?  Yahoo has gone downhill...MS isn't a threat search-wise.,1228352966

The way git figures out what you've done to a directory tree using sha1 hashes is interesting; incidentally it won't automatically add an empty directory. In bzr, you tell the VCS what you're doing so it can track operations better; git generally doesn't care about anything but the contents of the files in your tree. The staging area and in-place branching in git are pretty cool, but not essential, and I suspect they'll be picked up by bzr and hg in due course.<p>Mark Shuttleworth wrote a series in his blog about what he cares about in version control, and why he picked bzr for Ubuntu and Launchpad, which is an interesting counterpoint to the git lovefest we've been seeing here.",1228352814

Thus, depending on the variation of the user population, it could theretically be possile for small stimuli having large effect to a user base. If the users are similar, but are part of a niche, if that niche gets hit, the business could be wiped out.",1228352788

Highly recommend reading this but if you don't want to..<p><i>SPOILER - though you should be reading the article first anyway if you care!</i><p>An accidental downgrade of Sendmail made Sendmail have a zero second timeout on sending mail that ultimately worked out at 3 milliseconds, just enough to hit servers within a certain radius..<p>I bet there are several pieces of software that could have a zero timeout triggered in a similar way. The difficulty of figuring it out? About the same as with this guy ;-)",1228352758

It says that the company won't instantly allocate 20 engineers to somebody's 20% project.  Which is really just sound business sense - what other startup gets 20 engineers to fool around with before they even have a product?<p>The impression I got when I visited the Google campus two weeks ago was nothing like this article suggests, and the Googlers in the comments seems to indicate it's basically made-up too.",1228352561
