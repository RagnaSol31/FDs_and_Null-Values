I think that both parties are somewhat to blame if such a situation arises, if it is 'within scope' then a tweak should not end up costing significant amounts of time that indicates a less than general attitude towards coding things, on the other hand there should be some penalty for changing the design after it has been nailed down and agreed on, even if it is within the scope since it will require re-work of at least some portion of the design.<p>I'd probably negotiate a reasonable adjustment of the price in that case (also to dissuade from further tweaks, or to get paid for them), and a note to the effect that the deadlines will be pushed back as a direct consequence of this.<p>I'd also want that documented in email with the consequences clearly stipulated.",1284168021.0

If you're still in college it might be an issue, but if you have something to point to you still have a shot at getting into the interview process.<p>The interview process is hard.  I won't lie to you about it.  Even if you belong at Google, there is a good chance of not making it through on the first try.  But your odds are infinitely worse if you don't even try.<p>Speaking personally, I didn't apply to Google for years because the core Google languages are Python, Java and C++, while my professional experience was all in Perl.
