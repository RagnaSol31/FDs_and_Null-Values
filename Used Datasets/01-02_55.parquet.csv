It's in the notion that Mark Hurd was fired for no reason beyond his ethical indiscretions. The article rather questionably refers to him as a 'popular CEO' (with whom?). There's repeated mention of 'Playboy model'. Of course it's lurid. Did Mark Hurd's behaviour harm shareholders more than, say, Apple (which still retains its CEO of the time) backdating stock option grants?",1286589571.0

Most of the comments on this thread are defending this app and yes, it does what it sets out to accomplish.

73,1774044,story,,,21,17,Vishnevskiy,Rate My Startup: Guildwork.com,,Guildwork is a guild host with a social layer. The MMORPG market is growing each year. World of Warcraft has 12 million players alone. The current offerings for guild hosting are poorly made and outdated. So we decided to give a better shot at it. We gained 1500 members last month and got 600k page-views before reaching beta (which is today). An example of a site hosted on Guildwork is http://www.ex-online.com/<p>Our downside at the moment is that we do not have a designer on our team and its hurting us. So if anyone here is a designer and interested in working on something like this feel free to contact me stanislav@guildwork.com,1286586505.0
