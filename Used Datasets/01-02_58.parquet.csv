It was a huge diversion from actual economic growth into pyramid building.<p>If done for a profit, going to the moon would <i>be</i> economic growth, but as it was, it was essentially a program to build a legacy for Kennedy and Johnson, at which it was immensely successful!

2,644355,comment,644007.0,644297.0,0,0,rams,,,What's innovative about WebDAV ?  It's basically a design by committee standard pushed by Rational to web enable clearcase; it's a very verbose protocol and there was an entry in Sussman's blog about replacing WebDAV with a better wire protocol like Mercurial's. Getting WebDAV into SVN was basically Greg Stein's idea - he had worked at Microsoft and had observed them transitioning over to WebDAV in a big way and started pushing for its usage in SVN as well - a move that was not well thought out. WebDAV is not very popular even with some of the SVN hackers.<p>Berkeley DB was certainly old when it was adopted by the SVN project. It's not like the NFS issues with  BDB were unknown.,1244253566.0

7,644349,comment,644007.0,644293.0,0,0,durin42,,,"You say that ""Subversion was not that great of an idea"" but if you go back to 2001 (which is when svn became selfhosting), or even 2004, CVS was <i>such</i> a disaster for some use cases that the need for a replacement was readily evident. Add to that the fact that svn was a compelling replacement for Visual Source Safe, and it was definitely a worthwhile idea. Sure, it's now the ""old safe standard"" of version control, but there's a lot of value in that for many companies.  Several of the original svn team (including these two) have admitted that some of the design decisions (the handling of tags and branches most notably) were probably mistakes, given the value of hindsight. They got a lot right too, though. The delta editor interface is nicely abstracted to the point that hgsubversion uses the same delta editor as the svn command line client to do something the original design spec never would have anticipated. Yet it works extremely well.<p>Subversion is <i>much</i> simpler for people to ""get"" than other systems. I've been a heavy evangelist of DVCS tools and workflows for a while at work, and it's taken since October (8 months) to get any critical mass behind actually even <i>investigating</i> switching to those from SVN.<p>Let's face it: Subversion is many <i>many</i> times better than nothing, which is what a ton of people do. Most college graduates in CS or CSE come out of school <i>never</i> having touched version control in my experience, and the ones that have seen it were exposed via open source, not their coursework. Evangelizing Subversion is (really lousy analogy warning!) like convincing people to smoke cigarettes instead of doing illegal drugs. At least it's less bad for them, and the barrier to entry might be a bit lower. When we had a poll of the local Python users group one meeting, ""email"" was the most popular version control solution, followed by a basic dead heat between svn/bzr/git/hg. The fact that people still view email as a valid answer is <i>far</i> more troubling to me than evangelizing an old and very mature tool instead of one of the new upstarts.",1244253186.0

I've learned from painful experience that if the ad server doesn't respond to a JS ad tag, the entire page will stop loading until the ad server times out (up to 10 seconds).<p>I'd rather have a page be 10-20% slower with IFRAME tags than use JS ad tags that are effectively a single point of failure for my site.",1244250973.0

That is:<p>cost of providing housing and essential care to homeless + cost of treating any of those with mental disabilities < economic benefit from increasing general quality of environment.<p>Sure housing prices would rise, but the left side of the inequality is direct tax payer money. The right side comes indirectly from sales, public facilities, and property. Knowing that prisoners are locked away in interest of lowering crime rate, at a $20K+/year/prisoner [1], that seems, on a hunch, difficult.<p>It looks quite intricate. And, knowing that modern corporations will have no business in doing this, it is a public service; some people might not be interested in paying this tax. Hence, doing nothing seems to not be very far from optimal, as it looks.<p>Or, is that inequality correct, and RHS - LHS gives a good number?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisons_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisons_in_the_United_States</a>",1244250488.0

Part of what I mean by that term are things that look good in the demo, but it turns out the demo is pushing the idea to the very limits. A demo of a good idea by necessity can only scratch the surface, not exhaust the idea. With demoware, it only works as long as you don't bring the idea into contact with the real world. It looks <i>great</i> as long as you stay in demoland, but that's it.
