Logic Audio is a pretty good piece of software, and it's benefited a bit since Apple bought Emagic but once again, it's not anything particularly special that I can't find for Windows or even Linux. If I used a Mac for multitrack recording, it would be near the top of my list. In other words, nothing to put myself out a few thousand dollars over.<p>And again with an unsubstantiated claim of productivity.<p>I had a car once, a 1982 Datsun. It was small, low to the ground, handled poorly and made a hell of a lot of noise, vibration and drama when you hit the gas. You <i>felt</i> like you were going like a bat out of hell.

So you've never had to install software on your Mac before? Everything you've ever wanted to do was pre-installed when you bought it? Wow, that's amazing, my Mac Book Pro couldn't do almost anything out of the box, it must be defective.<p>Pointing at a singular minor feature (PDF creation) that just happens to come with your OS is not ""switch-worthy"". If I asked you ""could you RDP connect to Windows boxes without thinking about it, and did you ever have to explicitly think about installing some extra software just to make it happen?"" You would scoff at that just like I'm scoffing at your PDF example. How about connections to Exchange servers? Did you have to install some software to make that happen or did you sit down in front of your 1-button keyboard (labeled ""go"") and it just did all you could ever want for you? It's not a knock against the system that it can't do those two major features out of the box, it's just that both OSs can't do some things that the other can do. Again, roughly equivalent.

You'd know that the two games are equivalent and there's a one-to-one mapping, they should have exactly the same difficulty, but some humans would find one easier than the other.<p>This would give us a great insight into how  people think, and help us understand the relationship between the representation of a problem and it's underlying complexity.",1256346050.0
