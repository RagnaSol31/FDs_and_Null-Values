They are judged on many other things: attending conferences, publishing research, writing their dissertation.  They prioritize accordingly.<p>2. The courses with the highest attrition rates are always the 100-level weed-out classes taught in 500-person lecture halls.  At my school, a 40% drop rate in Intro CS was normal and 60% wasn't unheard-of.  Were the drop-outs all too dumb to learn programming?  Did some of them have trouble getting their questions answered?  Nobody lost as much sleep over those questions as they did over their thesis defense.  See ",

Debt has to paid off and you can't just take it on endlessly. I wonder what the future looks like if the United States continues to take on more and more debt. Right now we can't really pay it off ever so we're stuck servicing it forever. Seems like we're giving our children a much worse world than the one we were born in. When I was born the debt was pretty manageable and over the course of my lifetime it exploded to something that's basically never going to be paid off.,1275873638.0
