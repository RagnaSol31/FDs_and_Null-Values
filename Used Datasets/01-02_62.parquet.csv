A friend of mine was looking for work as a freelancer and asked me to what he should ask for by way of a rate. I asked him how much he'd be happy with, he replied ""60"". I said, ""so ask for 100 and negotiate down if you must"". He was blown away that someone would pay that much.",1310176783.0

If you could ensure passively, that the data would become unusable after a certain time period it wouldn't.<p>A physical example would be an briefcase rigged with small explosives. Opening it without the code or waiting to long to enter the code would trigger it to destroy the contents. I imagine this would be considered willful destruction of the contents. On the other hand, if the materials inside could decay into ash in a short time peroid, then it's not willful destruction.",1310176603.0

16,2744767,comment,2743292.0,2744708.0,3,0,davidhollander,,,"I'd contend the opposite, polling is better for dynamic content.<p>Let's say you have 1000 requests for a landing page, and the landing page has a data request that scrapes the entire database to find the popular-maximum-geo-similarity-reccomendation-zone-geo-user-thing list for the entire site, but only updates once every 10 seconds.<p>Ideally, you want to only send at most 1 request to your database every 10 seconds, without having to open a new connection. If you are doing a polling server and have all 1000 clients waiting for the data, you can trigger a callback to all of them when the database reports back without having to recopy data, use shared memory, do more ipc, or context switches. And for the 1000 clients to pause to wait for that single combined data callback, no extra blocking reads\connections to anything were necessary.<p>If by static content you are referring to file transfers, polling does not actually work on regular files in Linux. I believe they will always return ready to read even if reading would block. So usually a thread or forked process is actually required when handling files unless you dont mind disk seeks pausing the entire event loop on your server.",1310175939.0

26,2744757,comment,2743375.0,2743375.0,2,0,jarrettcoggin,,,"I had a similar situation while I was at a university. I was taking extra classes, trying to work a part time job as close to 40 hours a week as I could to pay the bills, interviewing, and a significant other. I did this for about a year before it all came crashing down. When it did come crashing down, I was apathetic for about a month. I bombed out of classes, almost got fired from my job, and the SO stopped seeing me for a while.<p>My biggest suggestion is to find something that lets you blow off a lot of steam/release a lot of stress in a short amount of time. For some people it's sports or boxing or whatever. For others, it's partying. Whatever it is, it has to be something you do alone, away from everything else. When you do this activity, it has to be your full focus. You can't think about the startup or the job or anything else.<p>I didn't figure out what this release would be for me until I had graduated and was working. It turned out to be lifting weights and just fatiguing my body until I pretty much couldn't walk. I tried to do this before everyone else woke up so there was no one there to grab my time. I did my best to make it to the gym 3-4 times a week at 6am-7am. There were plenty of days I aimed to be in the office at 8:30, but I would be so exhausted that I would need to nap for 15-20 minutes. I still made it a point to get in by 9am.<p>My three requirements for something like this is:<p>1. It has to be physical.\n2. You have to be alone. No one interrupts this sacred time.\n3. Whatever it is, put more than 110% effort into it. Make sure you are putting everything you got into it and that you aren't spending any energy thinking about something else.<p>On the other side of this coin, you need to talk to someone about it. Let them know what's going on and that you need someone to vent to. The worst thing you could possibly do is bottle it up.<p>This is what works for me, but at the same time, your mileage may vary.",1310175513.0

Most people would consider trading modern convenience for a little labor or discomfort(say, washing dishes manually, or lawn care) to be a fate equal to desperate poverty.<p>This entitlement is truly fear, and it motivates otherwise capable entrepreneurs into a life of bland wage slavery.  When starvation is invoked as a warning here, it is truthfully in regard to modern privilege.  A warning that the service and maintenance of modern life will fall on the misguided consumer.  If they should choose to be self sufficient on small income, they will have to learn how.  A fate apparently worse than starvation.  Fear motivates this attitude.",1310175198.0

If they lose their money it's because they invested poorly, and it was their decision.  They are asked to weigh up their other investment options such as the  stockmarket and property and make a call.<p>If friends and family want to 'help out' then investing is probably not the vehicle.
