I kept thinking, ""I must be slipping, I know this stuff wasn't as hard for me in college.""<p>Then at some point I needed to look up a couple things in some of my textbooks (I saved them all) and as soon as I picked them up I thought ... wait?  That was the hard stuff?  This is all so ... trivial.  Since the progression from textbooks to academic papers had mostly come at some remove, I'd not noticed that I was gradually reading much harder material, to the point that the stuff that I found hard in computer science in college now seems all rather easy.<p>Now, I'm 28 at this point, but already I've noticed that I'm not as fast as I once was, but I've got more momentum.  When I throw myself at a problem it's with the goal of crushing it rather than dancing around it.  This seems to be what's awesome about smart folks that are in middle to older ages.  There's like this blunt force of knowledge that can be thrown at hard problems.  Great systems programmers in their 50s are awesome to work with.<p>Note, also, that the article also mentions that knowledge based abilities increase up until you're 60.",1237168694.0

In Argentina, after the 2001 crisis, many factories and other buildings were taken by former employees. Several of those ventures were highly successful.

I think the rest of the country is just sitting nervously, thinking ""what if that happens to our city?!""<p>The funny thing is, when I was growing up we NEVER went to downtown Detroit. There were basically only two reasons to go there: (1) to watch the Red Wings or Tigers (the Lions didn't even play there until recently, and the Pistons still don't), and (2) to go to the Auto Show. We would just spend all our time in the beautiful suburbs. However, now, when I go back home to visit, it's amazing, we spend ALL our time downtown and talk about how much better it is and how much we love it. Quite the opposite of how the press talks.<p>If you want some perspective on how Detroiters feel about all this, I highly suggest reading Mitch Albom's article, The Courage of Detroit (<a href=""http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/the_bonus/01/07/detroit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/the_bonus/01/0...</a>).

Don't we all (er, mostly all) keep our own names as we grow up and change?<p>Being a singularly self-obsessed person, I've gone through several noticeable Facebook phases. At one point I unfriended all but 40 people, to limit noise, deleted profile information, to avoid being easily judged, and got rid of pretty much everything from my profile. Now that filters exist (as well as for a few other reasons), I've become much more open and expressive, friended a bunch of people I don't actually know (including people from HN), and changed things. I've gone through similar things with blog writing and web design.<p>People aren't scared about the future. Very few people censor themselves, even knowing people are watching them. Perhaps we've developed a conscious blindness to our numerous followers. Perhaps we just really could care less. Either way, people aren't going to worry about their pasts for long. Even when it's there, the attitude of people I know is, ""Either they won't be damned to look far into the past, or it's entirely unreasonable for them to judge me for who I was three years ago - or for who I am outside of work.""<p>That's a good attitude to have. You can determine some things by how a person acts when they aren't watching - but not everything. I have a bunch of wise, friendly, sweet friends who like getting wasted, and a bunch of wise, friendly, sweet friends who go to debate championships on the weekend. I've met introverts and extroverts that I liked. I'm friends with a few fairly racist people and a few fairly sexist people, and each one is a good person despite all the stuff they do, and some of them are people I'd really like in a working environment because despite all that, they're <i>good workers</i>.
