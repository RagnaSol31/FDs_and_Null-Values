They change existing APIs and add with every major release -- but they do so in a new SDK. Apps that were linked against the 10.4u SDK use the 10.4u libraries, even on 10.6. <i>This is fucking amazing</i>.<p>The only way Win32 stays as stable as it is is by just not changing anything or even adding new APIs.<p><i>For instance I compiled nmap yesterday for snow leopard, and guess what, it was not working, unable to open the interfaces. The compiled binary I downloaded from insecure.org worked against the loopback interface but not against the wifi one. The interface to capture raw frames from the airport extreme changed again with snow leopard, breaking valuable programs like Kismac. It's not an open platform so this changes are even worse.</i><p>Now you're effectively complaining about Kernel ABI compatibility!",1257386033.0

For instance Metcalfe's law is widely cited, but more careful analysis of actual behavior suggests that n*log(n) tends to be a better scaling estimate than n^2.<p>Moving on, be careful about moving to a sales force driven strategy.  When you're selling with a sales force you have to cover the overhead of an expensive sales process.  This is one of the big reasons why a lot of software is priced low enough that someone can pay for it with a credit card, and lots of software priced over $50,000 but very little between those two numbers.  Also once you go down the enterprise software route the quality of your sales process matters more than the quality of your software.

14,923135,comment,922715.0,922841.0,0,0,akeefer,,,"As far as guidelines go, my personal rule is ""test at the highest level of abstraction possible.""  That could also be phrased as ""test those invariants that are the least likely to change.""  In practice, the two guidelines turn out to be pretty analogous.<p>What does that mean, exactly?  Any code you write is obviously in the service of some goal.  Some code, like a method to split a String that's part of a standard library, is its own end:  it's a complete API, so it should be tested as such.<p>A whole lot of other code, though, is in service of some larger component.  Maybe you've got 15 classes that all work together to form the e-mail component, and hopefully only one or two of those classes really encapsulate the external API (whether it's an explicit API or just implied) exposed to other components, and the rest are logically part of the implementation.  So instead of unit testing every one of those, you get more mileage testing at the level of that API.  That lets you change the implementation of that component without having to rewrite a bunch of tests, and the tests themselves then become a much clearer documentation of that API.<p>But plenty of times, the overall API is so complex that there's a combinatorial explosion if you try to test at that higher level; in that case you have to find smaller chunks that have few enough paths through them that they can be tested thoroughly.  Sometimes those chunks are the level of a single class or method; often they're still a collection of things.<p>Rather than starting from the classes and say ""let's test everything,"" you look for logical groupings that form logical or explicit APIs, say ""let's test this API,"" and then push the tests down a level only insofar as you can't test that API thoroughly enough to execute all the code paths in the related code.<p>To put that yet another way:  test APIs, not implementation details, and the more things you can treat as implementation details, the less friction your tests will exert on your development process and the more value you'll get from them as a result.",1257385714.0

Not one of those stupid motivational books, but rather a good theory source with real-life cases as illustrations.<p>Some of the chapters move you away from the major subject while trying to prove a point, and discuss things like, for example, delaying gratification studies or skills acquisition processes. These topics, however, are presented in a great scientific manner (well, maybe not a scientific, but at least authors are not bullshitting with you and consider you to be smart) and are supplied with data and good examples, so it's a pleasure to read (listen to) them.<p>I also think this book is a must-read for entrepreneurs, as they are the ones, who must influence people all the time and be good at it.
