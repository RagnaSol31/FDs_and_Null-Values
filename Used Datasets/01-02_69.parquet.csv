The idea behind the posts separation is that you can search according to the city you are in. I guess that a short paragraph at the top of the homepage or an about page would be a good addition.<p>Quick question. From a user standpoint, is creating an account more annoying than filling out a captcha everytime you want to post? Or should I find a way to avoid both?",1267063197.0
