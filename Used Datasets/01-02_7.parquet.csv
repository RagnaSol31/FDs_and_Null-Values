Japan's robotics are cosmetic and hardly taking over anything. With something like robotics it is difficult to weigh who will end up funding you.

To refer specifically to the example you gave, what is it about computer science that can best be learned (only be learned?) in college? Does showing that lack of college study of computer science is correlated with lack of basic programming knowledge (which I would believe, for the sake of discussion) the same as showing that lack of college study of CS will CAUSE, inevitably, lack of basic programming knowledge? Can't anyone who desires to improve programming knowledge self-educate through multiple channels in today's world?<p>After edit: It appears that the reply to which I am replying has now been deleted.
