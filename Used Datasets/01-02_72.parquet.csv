It's not meant as a competitor to other lisps!<p>Some special features are micros (closer to C macros than true Lisp macros) and partials (partial evaluation). Documentation for those can be found near the end of the linked page.<p>It is by no means close to completion.

I get email to that effect.  You'll note that that miscomprehension doesn't hurt either the customer or myself -- they get two more-or-less functionally equivalent ways to access the software they paid for, I get $29.95 either way.

So they're probably using their premium stock price as a good way to pick up some bargains while their core business revenue is slowing down with the rest of the economy (and with tough competition).<p>In my mind, it makes me think that they worry about (or are at least are hedging against) their core market being eroded by other players. If they did believe it was VM/VDI for the long haul, then they'd be investing in technologies with far better synergies than the ones they're picking. I mean ""cloud"" technologies pretty much applies to anything these days, so it'd be a stretch to say these are really ""good fit"" acquisitions.<p>I have a feeling this could work out okay for VMWare, though it feels more like a business play than a technology one.",1263431692.0

This kind of ""pure evil"" doesn't really exist, and by assuming it does you are glossing over the <i>real</i> causes of the native genocide. It's far too easy to ask ""why did the Europeans murder the natives?"" and answer with ""because they were evil, ruthless, and completely with morality""<p>It's a feel-good answer, because moral absolutism makes us all feel better. But it's far from the truth - and masks analysis that can <i>actually</i> help us prevent things like this in the future.<p>For example (and apologies for the Godwin): we know that not every Nazi soldier was for exterminating the Jews. Heck, we know that many German soldiers <i>guarding the extermination camps</i> were not supportive of the cause, yet they went along with it. Why?<p>The simplistic explanation that makes us feel better is that these men were evil, without morals, and participated willingly in mass slaughter. But this ignores much more useful insights on mob mentality, the power of coercion, propaganda, misinformation, and a slew of other things that actually help us understand what happened, and prevent these things from happening again.<p>We're talking about an event that occurred hundreds of years ago - playing the blame game is pretty pointless at this point. It really doesn't matter what is whose fault; the importance of understanding the European conquest of the Americas is to determine the factors that caused a bunch of perfectly reasonable people to exterminate entire civilizations, so that we may better understand our present selves and hopefully prevent such things from repeating.<p>Which leads back to your original question:<p>> <i>""Why does it even matter who was ""evil"" and who wasn't?""</i><p>It matters because by playing the blame game, and telling this story as a fairy tale of black and white, good vs. evil, you are bypassing the need to analyze what is, in reality a complex situation of many causes and effects. You are robbing a heinous and dark event of its proper gravity and complexity, and grossly simplifying something that carries relevance today.",1263431407.0

This kind of thinking scares me, not so much because it's so myoptic, but because it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: ""I have never seen success"" becomes ""Success is not possible"" which becomes true because we stop trying.<p>There is so much to examine here, but I'd like to focus on OP's 10 examples of things that change.  Mere mortals throw up their hands in futility, blaming the user, the state of the art, or the alignment of the planets, without ever understanding the fundamental principal that great systems accomodate great needs and the greatest need of all is constant change.<p><i>the company recategorizes its product line based on utility and lifestyle rather than brand and designer</i><p>This is incredibly common and can easily be accomodated with proper database design, decoupling products from their associated attributes.<p><i>the parent company divests itself of you and withdraws the connection to its parts and inventory database</i><p>So now you have to treat them like any other vendor?  You do have some of those, don't you?<p><i>a manufacturer starts using more than one UPC per product because they changed the packaging</i><p>A simple database design consideration.  ""One to one"" is just a special case of ""one to many"".<p><i>the law now requires that national holidays must be counted against vacation time if the employee takes a vacation day immediately before/after that holiday</i><p>Rule driven logic.  What's the big deal?  (Your logic was rule-driven from the outset, not hard-coded, right?)<p><i>a loan company files to become a bank and store deposits that earn interest</i><p>Additional logic to existing data.  We do this all the time.<p><i>CSV files exchanged with a partner were always denormalized, but then one company starts using normalized records with mixed column mappings</i><p>Any decent batch file processor should be able to handle anything thrown at it.  Companies that do a lot of this build uncertainty into the design of their systems.<p><i>another partner decides to ditch file transfer as a way to submit data, and creates a web service that you're supposed to invoke commands on</i><p>Sounds like you'll need an extra piece of software to create a feed.  Not exactly like no one's ever done this before.<p><i>the shipping carrier reveals that their tracking numbers are all recycled at the end of each year</i><p>Not a problem if they were never used as the primary key to a table.<p><i>new rules require every credit card number to be encrypted, but you still have to be able to quickly search for matches in a database of millions</i><p>Ahh, but the last 4 digits do not have to be encrypted.  Start your search with them and resolve synonyms.  Pretty standard stuff.<p><i>a partner switches to mixed-case alphanumeric PO numbers</i><p>As an identifier, a PO number is always a string even if it looks like it's numeric.  (When was the last time you added 2 PO numbers together?)<p>OP's roadblocks are experienced developers' speedbumps.
