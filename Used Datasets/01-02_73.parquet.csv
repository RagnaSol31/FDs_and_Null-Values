For example, if we want to scientifically manage steel production in a way that maximizes steel output per given cost, then we need highly skilled statisticians and logistics supply-chain people in charge. Presumably it's possible to develop objective tests for someone's skill at statistics or supply-chain management (that's why we have technical education, right?), and then put those skilled people in charge, rather than someone like Brezhnev. Or, if you want to develop electric cars, then put the country's top engineers on the project, rather than someone who happens to be the brother of the oblast governor's wife.<p>(I'm not sure I actually believe that. But I'm not sure I believe the market answer either, since on the scale of large companies, there are so many factors involved, that luck and timing more than skill tend to be huge ones determining who ends up in top management positions of successful companies.)",1313200614.0

In this case, I wouldn't even call it ""competition"": I'd call it ""cooperative experimentation"".<p>But this argument breaks down when you look at the nginx vs. Apache example: proponents of nginx tend to just pummel Apache with pain, even when many of the claims aren't even true (which is extra stupid as I don't even think it is correct to believe that nginx and Apache are trying to solve the same problem).",1313198136.0

As somebody who taught himself CSS first and HTML second, at a later age, with a master plan, I advise you to learn javascript to the hilt, and have a complete tooling shop. You could also use to learn about other structured document types besides HTML. Keep an eye on the avante garde. Set some goals. Javascript enabled, choose your next adventure: the way of canvas, webGL, svg, and the great growing mass of libraries for browser graphics and interactivities; or the way of software architecture, and crack Node.js and familiarize your self with all its modules; learn networks and databasing. You can maybe do both, eventually. Either one will allow you significantly to experiment and invent, and/or become involved in IRL collaborations. You have nothing but lots of time to become a craftsman, to build a people network, interact with the growing base of young adults gearing up to inherit a galore of industry overdue for innovations. Maintain a simple life.  An occupational cycle of learning and practice is as good as it gets. Read everything. Become an apprentice and glean some hard-won knowledge ahead of time itself.
