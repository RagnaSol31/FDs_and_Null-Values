However, I will still list my annoyances, although I'm prepared to reserve final judgement for now.<p>I'm forever getting mixed up between the status menu and the messaging menu. The only thing I really use them for is Empathy, which now seems to be split between two menus. And to bring up the contact list it now takes two clicks (or more often three because I clicked the wrong menu) instead of one.<p>I don't like to just minimize Empathy or Rhythmbox since that gets in the way of my ""working set"". As a programmer working on distributed systems I often have perhaps up to a dozen windows in a workspace in each of eight workspaces. ""System"" stuff gets in the way of my window management. I'd like this stuff to be somewhere distinctly different.<p>> No competent designer, sitting down to design an operating system from scratch, would say to themselves “I know, let’s have two completely inconsistent ways to hide windows”.<p>I disagree with this. I <i>want</i> two different ways, because they have two different purposes. One is my for the working set: stuff that I'm doing. The other is for stuff that's always there, like a new email notification, an IM contact list, background music and the clock. I don't see a problem here.<p>I think that a notification bubble worked just fine for notifications. You'd have the icon pointed out to you, and then it would be there in the background using minimal space until you attended to it. That's about as unobtrusive as it gets. Grabbing clicks has never been a problem for me, but not being able to see under it has. I'd prefer to be able to close the notification bubble rather than being forced to wait; being able to click through is pointless if I can't properly see through.<p>Instead I now have an annoying popup telling me that I should update appearing in a separate window that I have to close only for it to pop up again. I understand that this is intended to be improved, but at the moment it seems to keep demanding attention and interrupting me and then it forces me to wait while it loads.<p>I suppose that the problem is that as an experienced user I know what the notification icon for ""updates available"" meant and I want it to stay there as a reminder. However, I only want to be interrupted once. At the moment (on Karmic) I get interrupted repeatedly and the only way to stop this is to remove the notification entirely.<p>I agree that the UI should be consistent. I would prefer if any suitable application had the capability to either minimize to the system tray or to the task bar based on a user setting with a sensible default. The close button should always close it (or if not, the behaviour should still be consistent across all applications).<p>I understand that some of my complaints are intended to be addressed already, so I look forward to my experience getting a little better, at least. I thank Matthew for the blog post - at least I know that these things are being worked on.",1271985793.0

78,1286926,comment,1286173.0,1286173.0,0,0,pyre,,,"One issue that I have with wget (and IIRC curl too) is that when downloading a file from a URL like, ""<a href=""http://example.com/file.php?id=1234"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/file.php?id=1234</a> it will download the file to 'file.php?id=1234'.  This fails because the HTTP headers could specify the filename when returning the data (which wget will ignore) or that URL could be a redirect to the actual URL which contains the filename (but wget blindly uses the first url supplied). I understand that this functionality is probably desired when it comes to wget's mirroring functions (since the src= and href= values won't point to the redirect URL or actual filename) but there is no option to parse out the original file name even if all you are doing is providing a list of URLs to download (not mirror).<p>{edit} To be fair, this is a pain in the ass to do w/ LWP::UserAgent in Perl too:<p><pre><code>  sub download_file_callback {\n      my ($response,$useragent,$h) = @_;\n      return undef if $response->code >= 300 and $response->code < 400;\n      my $fname = $response->filename();\n      $useragent->remove_handler('response_header',owner => 'billy');\n      return $useragent->get($response->request()->uri(), ':content_file' => $fname);\n  }\n\n  $ua->add_handler( response_header => \&download_file_callback, owner => 'billy');\n  my $response = $ua->get($url);</code></pre>",1271985473.0

97,1286907,comment,1284266.0,1286802.0,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>Your analogy breaks down a bit because you can't really lose a car the same way.</i><p>Naturally not, but one might easily lose the keys, and I read your example of the car as a proxy for the phone prototype.<p>I see where you are going with the bar example, but I'm not sure I get your point. Presumably in the case of the Facebook identity the finder of the phone remembered it at least well enough to assist Gizmodo with finding the Apple employee. And obviously it did not get handed into police or anyone else, (like the bar or an Apple store).<p>Anyway, rather than arguing by increments I'll cut to the chase: if I were actually a lawyer seeking to take action against Gizmodo, I'd be basically arguing a claim of misappropriation under section 3426.1.(b).2.C of the California civil Code (which is basically the Uniform Trade Secrets Act), as follows (heavily edited for clarity):<p><i>""... (b) Misappropriation"" means: ... (2) Disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who: ... (C) Before a material change of his or her position, knew or had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake.</i><p>In plain English, we might dismiss the guy in the bar as a tipsy opportunist who was told there was a reward on offer (and who had no especial duty to guard Apple's secrets, vs. a duty to hand in lost property in general). However, Gizmodo had reason to know an iPhone prototype would be a secret thing: they published entire articles demonstrating their knowledge of Apple's secretive policies, as well as recent C&D letters from Apple's outside counsel asking Gawker to stop offering money for secret information. As I said before, they may not have known for sure if this device was a real Apple prototype, but they surely hoped that it was - it wouldn't have had news value if it wasn't. If it had just been a first-gen iPhone, there'd be no story. They materially changed their position by exchanging money for it. And they knew it had fallen into the hands of the seller by accident (at best).<p>If the fellow who sold the phone had instead taken pictures and set up weird_found_iphone.com, he could plead ignorance about the significance of his find. But it seems very hard to me for Gizmodo to claim the same thing. $5000 says they perceived the thing to have major newsworthiness. The prototype didn't cease to be secret just by virtue of its being lost and found; were that the case, then it wouldn't have been worth paying for. On a side note, there have been successful prosecutions for sale of trade information by a waiter employed to help cater a boardroom dinner; the careless sharing of company information to this non-employee's benefit didn't lessen the information's secret nature.<p>So Gizmodo purchased the device with the specific intention of exploiting its secret nature. The employee who was (we assume) field-testing it was meant to keep it secret, and did so by leaving it in its plastic disguise as an iPhone v3. He failed to keep it securely on his person as he should have: but whether careless, drunk, or both, this was surely a mistake. It's not as if he handed it to someone saying they should check it out, and then wandered off and never retrieved it. Nor did he disclaim ownership by throwing it in a garbage can or something. Loss is involuntary by its very nature; the guy called the bar repeatedly in hopes of finding it (as any reasonable person would expect). And while the finder might not have appreciated just how Apple would feel about their prototype, Gizmodo could hardly have been more aware, being in receipt of formal warnings from the company.<p>So my argument is that they distributed and used the info (as news to attract traffic and sell ads); they did so knowing it belonged to Apple; and knowing that Apple would not be happy; and knowing it was a prototype of an unreleased product; and knowing that it had come into the seller's possession by accident; and handing over a large sum of money because they understood the huge potential benefits of gaining this specific information.<p>Don't even get me started on the legalities of dissecting, photographing, and publicizing the innards of the thing.",1271984606.0
