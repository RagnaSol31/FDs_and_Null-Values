I said that the state of being poor imposes such a high mental cost that even the intelligent poor struggle to apply their intelligence consistently.  Even if we assume (incorrectly) that poor people are exclusively those on the left half of the intelligence distribution, the answer to their problems isn't charging them more money, thus making their problems generational because they can't afford the education, nutrition, and childcare necessary to end the cycle of ignorance.  The answer lies in making a positive life more appealing, e.g. by making healthy foods more affordable, more available, and tastier; improving access to education (MITx/edX/Khan Academy/etc.); making education and societal contribution more culturally appealing through changes in entertainment and early education; etc.<p>It's probably worth mentioning the philosophy that drives my opinions on these issues.  I want to minimize individual and total human suffering while maximizing individual and total human potential.  In other words, I believe that every human being should have the right not to suffer, along with the opportunity to make their best contribution to the progress of humanity.  Being poor and trapped by the mental stresses of staying alive leads to suffering, fast food temporarily alleviates that suffering, and increasing the cost of health insurance will exacerbate that suffering.  I still care even if it's someone else suffering while I enjoy the money I might save each month by not paying for their lifestyle.",1340589342.0

34,4154776,comment,4153397.0,4154310.0,2,0,Dn_Ab,,,"Ivo's answered so I'll just say the main trick to turning a function tail recursive is to have the function lug its state around. So always look to see if you can rewrite your function so it passes the current value explicitly to the next iteration.   Non tail recursion is like winding a spring and then having it unwind, a jack in a box. Tail recursion is like a snowball rolling down a hill. You should always try to make a recursive function tail recursive if you can.<p>As for fold it's a bit involved and has a lot of scary sounding jargon on the way to understanding it. You can write a fold for a tree and then code depth first search in a couple lines. Folds follow some basic properties that allow for program derivation. I rarely use those but it does inform my programming. It's kind of like how knowing Lisp informs your python. There is also an opposite or dual to fold called unfold. You can write many algorithms efficiently just using fold and unfold and a couple techniques to prune inefficiencies. Fold is the same kind of object to your initial tree as say a matrix is to a vector, or a derivative is to a polynomial.",1340588143.0
