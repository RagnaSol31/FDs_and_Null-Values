This could even be highly automated like it is now, where the catalog available to you would be based on the nature of your content and the catalog could provide you with estimated rates based on historical data.<p>In my opinion the key distinction is that you're directly serving ads as part of your content, instead of embedding some arbitrary external content into your pages.

I'm not interested in dating ads, but ads for better bottles could get my attention.  Keyword-driven or site-demographic-driven ads are a start.  As dpcan suggested, browsers could allow us to tag ourselves and our interests, which would be even better.<p>3) Get rid of common annoyances: flashing ads, ads that eat CPU and grind my browser to a crawl, ads on sites I might visit from work or with my kids that aren't safe for work/kids, popups/popunders, ads that block my view of the content I'm looking for, and misleading ads.  (Again, if you're a host, vet your ads!)<p>4) Do not compromise user privacy.  Don't track my browsing; base ads off of the site I'm on or information I voluntarily tagged myself with.<p>Many of the webcomics I read use Project Wonderful, and they seem to have a pretty good model.
