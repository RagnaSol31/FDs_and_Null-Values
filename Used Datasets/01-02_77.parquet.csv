The dragon is dead and his egg warped into the end portal back before I could collect it.  Sorry about that.

Usually, you end up doing lame assembly projects like lighting a few diodes or dispensing change from an imaginary vending machine.<p>When I learned assembly, the class had us typing our programs into a Vax computer older than I am and watching everything execute in a debugger and doing page after page after page of hex math by hand, or writing out the actual hex values for our programs by hand.  To this day, I remember that 0x20FE is the shortest infinite loop.  Every byte wasted lowered your grade.  That was all very educational, but not the least bit fun.  The best part was at the very end of the class where I learned a bunch of cool tricks from reading the professor's solutions.  He wouldn't show us <i>any</i> of them until the whole course was over.<p>With the DCPU, your programs might help you destroy enemy space ships, mine and scan for resources, or even hack enemy computers.  It could become almost like the demo scene of old and knowing Notch, it will be waaaaaaay more fun than learning assembly usually is.",1333935714.0

Split your money between 4 ETFs like RSP, DIA, QQQQ, and VEU.<p>1.  Get on a budget.  Save 10% of what you earn or pay off your credit cards first by saving 15%.  Read ""The Richest Man in Babylon""<p>2.  Mutual funds suck.  One out of 10 years will be terrible and they only spend a few years on top.  How can you get consistent returns?  They have high fees.  Instead invest in equity traded funds or ETFs.  Read ""The Big Secret for the Small Investor"" by J. Greenblatt and ""One up on Wall Street"" by Peter Lynch.\n<i>Be a value investor not a trader!</i>  Plan to let your investments sit and grow for years.  \nIf you want to buy individual stocks, pick for the list of ""dividend aristocrats"".  These are safe bluechips and you can re-invest the dividends for a compounding effect!<p>3.  The fees and limited investment choices make 401ks a bad deal, even with matching.  A self directed Roth IRA will tax shelter your growth, but you have to invest with money you paid income tax on (unlike a 401k).<p>4.  Bank account interest rates are a joke!  For savings you get 00.05%   CD 00.35%  Over 500k in money market 00.3%\nInflation is around 3%!<p>5.  For small investment amounts, a US Treasury savings bond is not bad.  There is no charge to buy or sell them and you do not have to pay taxes until you cash them in.  I Bonds pay the rate of inflation and possibly a bit more.  There are some penalties if you cash these bonds in before 12 months pass.<p>Be aware of things like how much it will cost to buy and sell an investment and when you will have to pay taxes on your earnings.<p>For me it was very hard to save until I created separate accounts to keep my funds in.  I have been value investing in stocks and my portfolio has earned 8 - 10 % growth plus 3% in dividends.  The dividends get reinvested so my holdings grow like a savings account.<p>Read ""How to Invest $50-$5,000"" by Nancy Dunnan",1333935487.0

45,3815493,comment,3814020.0,3814870.0,5,0,sirclueless,,,"None of those things are really roadblocks to Getting Shit Done though, except maybe dynamic loading.<p>Go has plenty of support for global constant values that take the place of enumerations, even to the point of having an ""iota"" syntax to make initializing constants easier.<p>Exceptions are generally an anti-pattern in my opinion: a hack to get around the ability to return multiple values from a function, so that error conditions can be handled in-band. The other technical challenge exceptions sometimes provide -- guaranteed cleanup after code that might fail to execute -- can be handled by Go's deferred function execution.<p>Generics are a powerful abstraction, but Go has very good support for (un)boxed values and interfaces, so the only thing you would get from generics is a bit more type safety. The additional complexity required to support generics isn't worth it.<p>Dynamic loading is arguably a blocker for certain modes of development and distribution, but by not supporting dynamic loading, Go can make tremendous simplifications in its module system. Making the assumption that every go library is distributed in source form greatly reduces compatibility friction and runtime bugs. ""DLL Hell"" may be a ""solved"" problem on most systems nowadays, but there are a lot of moving parts to enable that.<p>The simplifications that Go makes are 100% worth it in my opinion. There is one place where Go sacrifices something that can't be replaced is that a stop-the-world garbage collector may be unacceptable for some applications. Other than that, codebases aren't actually served by having too much power in their languages, even if an individual programmer might be.",1333935142.0

Zivilsenat des BGH) has, over the years, meandered back and forth regarding the patentability of software [1].<p>Currently, it's hewing pretty close to the EPO's criteria, which do allow a fair amount of what most people would consider software patents (though the criteria tend to still be a bit more restrictive than those of the USPTO).<p>As in other European countries, an invention involving software must still be ""technical"", meaning that it must manipulate ""controllable forces of nature"" [2]. While that was originally interpreted fairly narrowly, starting with the BGH's ""Dispositionsprogramm"" decision, which pretty much ruled out anything that could run on a general purpose computer, recent interpretations of this ""technicity criterion"" have become far less restrictive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.swpat.org/wiki/Case_law_in_Germany"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.swpat.org/wiki/Case_law_in_Germany</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.swpat.org/wiki/Controllable_forces_of_nature"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.swpat.org/wiki/Controllable_forces_of_nature</a>",1333934550.0
