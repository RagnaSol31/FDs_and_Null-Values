It also ""fixes"" all the code generation issues with a much more elegant solution (i.e. macros).",1228527912

(Assume something like 10x good developers at frequency 1:100 or 1:1000 in the population of all developers.)<p>It's hard for a company to realize the value from a 10x good developer, because their work is averaged with that of their 1x, 2x, 0.5x good teammates.  Therefore the 10x good developer isn't worth much more than their more conventionally stellar 2x good colleagues; all he's doing is bumping up the average somewhat.  The salary difference he commands is the the amount he bumps up the average.<p>Startups are more easily able to increase the concentration of 10x good developers, and that's where developers can make 10x+ money.",1228527798

I'm sure everyone who has built even a simple page has had the urge to break something after seeing their perfectly designed page in Firefox explode in IE6.<p>That said, you'll want to test on a small segment of your IE6 users before full implementation if possible. IE6 users are actually more qualified buyers a lot of the time depending on your industry. As a gross overgeneralization, IE6 users tend to pirate less, are less likely to be aware of competitors to your services, and might be more likely to be business customers at work depending on who you to sell to.",1228526852

The only thing we've had to pay extra for is space (because we're growing).<p>I do have other RoR apps running at Slicehost with passenger. They work great but there is definitely a noticeable performance difference compared to our EY app. I think most of this has to do with how Apache is configured (the first time you hit the app, it's very slow as Rails is being fired up).<p>As long as EY is keeping up with best practices, that works for me.",1228526824

This, of course, is the <i>easiest</i> thing to fix in IE6, so I'm still spending an inordinate amount of time making sure everything still works in IE6.
