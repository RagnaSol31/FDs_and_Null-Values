I know of several people personally that are pirating satellite TV right now. It just required a lot more work and physical access to hardware and not just a simple software hack.<p>The other thing about satellite TV is that once broken for one person the knowledge has to be given to many other people for them to gain anything from it.

11,3634511,comment,3634078.0,3634078.0,5,0,evmar,,,"(I'm yet another Google engineer.)<p>Personally, in my interviewing I don't care at all about schools or GPAs.  (I think the only time I've even considered the school is when candidates are from a big name school like MIT, where I will modify my interview to ask more culture questions to try to see whether they are too full of themselves.)<p>Instead, consider this: hiring someone who isn't good is much more costly than not hiring someone who is good.  It's not only that you need to pay a person who doesn't do good work, but they're also a drag on everyone else who is already really busy.  That is to say, it's much better to err on the side of ""no hire"" when you have any doubt; Google has plenty of employees already, and while they surely want more (and the bar is continually lowering), there's also no shortage of people who are willing to go through the legendarily Kafkaesque interview process repeatedly.<p>So it is possible that your one bad interview sunk you, even when it wasn't indicative of your skill.  Everyone has bad days or bad luck sometimes, so don't feel too bad about it.  You're in a good position in the world where there are many other tech companies eager to hire you as well and even compete on what they offer you.",1330221068.0

16,3634506,comment,3634078.0,3634230.0,2,0,RuggeroAltair,,,"I don't think this is true at all. I'm not saying that they will never hire an extra person in case they find two truly exceptional people (exceptional as in they feel like they really are missing out sending one home, not just that they are good programmers), but I'm sure that most of the times the hiring mechanism is quite compartmented.<p>If you interview with a specific group/organization, they need some people to do something in that group/organization. Now, it's possible that they leave a good comment about the ""second"" candidate, and it's possible that other groups eventually will contact them I guess, but I find unlikely that they will just hire two people in a group if they need one.<p>It's not like the people who interview you are interviewing you for the entire Google.<p>Most likely for 100 positions they are interviewing several hundred candidates. If their reasoning was like you were suggesting they would end up hiring about 200 people each time. 100 of which would have to find a group to work for.<p>Not a good idea.",1330220909.0

It's a big mistake to go in with a memorized script. Too much pressure, and the Dragons don't have to let you finish your pitch if they don't want to.<p>In my case, Robert started making comments to me and the other Dragons at about three seconds into my pitch. Kind of threw me off (but then again, Robert is the wild card).<p>Just know your product and the numbers inside and out.<p>A few other surprises during the pitch. A Dragon made an agreement with me (not for investment though) then reneged. I'll leave it at that.<p>Something that became perfectly clear early into the pitch: the Dragons aren't risk takers. Not at all. They want proof of sales (and lots of sales) or a promising intellectual property. Or maybe you have a tonne of orders you can't fulfill until you get some manufacturing capital.<p>In most cases, those who land a deal are those who could get a deal elsewhere.<p>My most valuable takeaway from the experience? People's feelings get hurt on that show. On Shark Tank, I've seen Kevin call someone pitching a line of fashion belt buckles a ""lying pig"". On national television.<p>I should've sworn off the show after seeing that, but I underestimated how that can irreparably harm someone. I'm more sensitive of people's feelings now, even public figures.<p>Walk a mile in a man's shoes, as the saying goes.<p>For me, it was obvious I wasn't going to get investment from the Dragons. I was like a lamb to the slaughter and I knew it.<p>Thing is, one of the cards in the Rejection Therapy Entrepreneur Edition is to ""apply for Shark's Tank or Dragons' Den"" and I did. It was a failed rejection attempt! I got on!<p>The experience wasn't so bad though. I got along righteously with Bruce Coxom. He totally got it. He defended the idea all the way, and even stepped out of his chair to give me his glass of water (I got the dreaded cotton mouth). Arlene was a doll. Very polite and understanding.<p>P.S.

67,3634448,comment,3629137.0,3633847.0,3,0,icebraining,,,"I'm assuming ""wrong"" means unRESTful.<p>Yes, because the clients have to know that <i>for your service specifically</i>, when they get an ""application/json"" response, they have to look for that property. That kind of information, unless defined in the standard - in this case, the HTTP or JSON specs - is considered out-of-band information, which breaks the Uniform Interface constraint.<p>To quote Roy Fielding:<p><pre><code>     A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial\n    URI (bookmark) and set of standardized media types that are appropriate\n    for the intended audience\n</code></pre>\nAnything besides (URL, mediatypes) is unRESTful.<p>Of course, I believe you could easily bypass that by making up a single new mediatype (e.g. application/vnd.my-service+json) and then use that for any JSON response with that type property. \nSince the clients know knew how to distinguish <i>your</i> JSON responses from everybody else's just by their mediatype, it wouldn't break REST.<p>But on the other hand, if you're using a different mediatype, why not go all the way and just use different mediatypes instead of a type property?<p>EDIT: As an addendum, the point of this constraint is to reduce coupling and enable the REST clients to be as generic as possible, enabling code reuse and modularity.<p>Using your example, I could write an application where the core was composed of an HTTP client, with support for plugins that would register themselves as ""mediatype handlers"". This way, the core could fetch the representation for an URL and then dispatch it to the right handler using the mediatype.<p>If I wanted to process your API, now my core client would have to include a JSON parser and an hack in the middle of the dispatching code to process all 'application/json' responses looking for your type property. It'd be ugly, bloated (multiple JSON parsing instances), harder to maintain, etc.<p>Of course, right now we don't see this as a problem because everyone writes a client against a specific API anyway, but frankly I think that's a bug, not a feature. If the REST APIs out there were truly RESTful, I think we'd see much more interesting clients that could combine dozens of different APIs, which is now impossible due to the sheer manpower required.",1330219233.0
