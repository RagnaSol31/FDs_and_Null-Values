The theme website puts your theme back up.<p>5.

The article concludes that therefore, having sex with more partners will make us unhappy. However, this conclusion is hasty.<p>Another explanation can be made, based on two correlations that I think are likely: having multiple sexual partners is negatively correlated with having at least one stable romantic partner, and having at least one stable romantic partner is positively correlated with happiness. Given those two correlations, it is easy to see why having multiple sexual partners might be negatively correlated with happiness. The people who sleep around a lot are doing it because they have not found a girlfriend/boyfriend, so they are lonely. Thus, they are unhappy.<p>If this explanation for the study&",
