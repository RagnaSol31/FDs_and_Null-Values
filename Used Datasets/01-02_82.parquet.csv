As far as the other obligations go, I believe the law also states that you can have a contract which explicitly overrides these severance obligations.<p>The obligation to have Chilean citizens (or permanent residents?) involved in most kinds of incorporated LLCs (I think particularly for single-founder companies) is much more of a big deal, but even it is not really that big a deal if you hire a lawyer and have them do it.

Language - Obviously English isn't their first language so some complications are to be expected, but:<p>a.  I think there has got to be some serious disconnect going on between people with relatively proficient English speaking and writing skills, and companies that need that skill.  I've been in contact with some rather large companies ($25+ million in sales or much more) whose sales people are just helpless.<p>b. Product Descriptions - sometimes just bad spelling/grammar or honest mistakes, but other times they're just plain wrong - like, differentiating details that are <i>really</i> important are ambiguous, or worse.  Perhaps this is deliberate to a degree (which I would also like to see go away)<p>2. Culture - There's stretching the truth, and then there's lying, and it seems where this line is drawn varies greatly between cultures.  It's very frustrating when you're trying to source a product, and every person you contact has it, in fact they have everything.  Except they don't.  Maybe there's something you could do along the lines of a comprehensive catalog of products, so when they list something, they ""have"" to tie it to a ""fairly"" strict item number(s), so I don't have to rely on text searches (which go against dishonest product descriptions).  And, if they are doing a deal on 2 items and the buyer needs a 3rd, maybe you could somehow offer collaboration capabilities between sellers, ideally ones that they'd actually <i>want</i> to use (share the profit on a sale perhaps?)<p>3. Product listings - I'm sure you know all the issues here, but the ones that most bother me are the atrociously low-res pictures, pictures from other unrelated products the seller has listed showing when clicking ""next"", terrible ambiguous/misleading descriptions, etc.<p>4. Quality control - With modern technology, why <i>some</i> sellers don't do what your platform offers on their own (provide hi-quality photos, etc) is an absolute mystery to me, so it will be nice if you can show them how to do this, and affordably for them so it doesn't cut into their margins.  However, for a lot of sellers, the total lack of quality control is a tremendous benefit to them so they can bait & switch, ship different product than ordered, etc.<p>5. Affordable Escrow service - as others have mentioned, a lot of sellers like to move transactions off the system.  I hope you guys can resist the urge to take too much of a cut of the action and find some affordable way to provide security for the buyer and not cut into profits for the seller.<p>It's good to see some competition for Alibaba that's for sure, I really hope you guys can pull this off.  I wish you the best of luck!",1350006435.0

It's a nice use pattern: you want to expose some of the internals of a server over a firewalled-off port, so you whip up a few HTTP endpoints in Flask, start an HTTP server in a background thread, and declare victory. It's quick and easy, and can save huge amounts of time later when you're trying to figure out why something isn't quite working.<p>There are other reasons to avoid GAE -- price, datastore latency, lack of flexibility -- but my main one is that GAE just doesn't apply to most of the things I use Flask for.",1350006383.0

This also might help you to think throught.<p>> Growth/Learning: If you had N+1 (degrees, title, experience) what would you be doing different at this company? Would advancement hurt the team dynamic or is it just the inertia of the system (no excuse to promote). What if your team added +1 people, would that have any effect on you/your prospects? Good/bad/indifferent<p>>Pay. This is also worth thinking about. What are the barriers to market pay? Do they have some-reason (stong brand, etc) or is it tactical (cash management)? Why so stingy with option/ect? How old the company is and what its brand/risk profile are are worth considering (when doing the grass is greener, both sides compare). Did you get a raw deal (because you got hired at a low rate with x% raise) or is everybody on the same bare-bones diet?<p>The more difficult case is when there is a team they just want to stay the same. everyone is paid the same. and everyone else but you is happy.  If its a heterodox mix of pay, its easier to at least ""true-up"" to market. If its a heterodox mix of experience, consider saturday night live -- at some stage almost everyone moves on -- but the younger folks get a lot of exposure and skill, until they too have their fill.<p>Most managers won't rock the boat unless its a mission critical situation.

It's certainly very pretty, and has some interesting results (e.g. that Rule 110 is Turing-complete) but a lot of the work is summary or rehash of other extant (and often non-cited) material. There are often more thorough, more concise, and more lucid resources on cellular automata from other research; I'd cite Zuse's <i>Rechnender Raum</i> (Calculating Space) off the top of my head for a work that comes to many of Wolfram's conclusions several decades prior to Wolfram.<p>In fact, a good strategy for becoming familiar with cellular automata as a field is to read reviews of ANKOS by people with degrees[1], collect the works and authors mentioned, and trawl them.

62,4643518,story,,,1,2,EvaPeron,Ask HN: How might one transition from commercial software into research?,,"The first company I worked at during the ""dot-com"" era, back when we were all worried about Y2K, lol, used genetic algorithms to solve mobile resource management problems - hence I developed an interest in ""deep-search"" problems, those problems whose solution space is too large to be solved precisely but solutions can be approximated via heuristics. I still have this interest, but have sort of found myself dealing with logistics types of solutions, i.e., working with solutions that ""talk to"" SAP supply chain solutions, fine, but does not sort of have the theoretical aspect which I have an interest in.<p>I am proficient with C and Java mostly along with UNIX commands and some auxiliary skills, but really have more interest in cool problems to be solved rather than the latest/greatest web fads like Ruby and so on. My question would be, how does one, having ""cut one's teeth"" so to speak in commercial software, sort of ""transition"" to more research. I also have a bit of a side-interest in AI as I have some experience with back-propagation neural networks written in C as a solution to predict energy markets. I think my biggest interest is sort of ""big problems"" that require heuristics to solve them but since while I think I have a pretty solid resume in terms of work experience, both in the area of mobile research optimization and in logistics, I don't have the academic ""cred"" (e.g. B.S. degree) to sort of ""back that up"" so to speak.<p>Most recently I have come across the concept of functional programming, of mathematical interest to me, so my current idea is to study a bit more about that. I just wondered if anyone in the HN community had any thoughts in terms of how to ""transition"" from a rather sucessful career in the commercial/enterprise software world towards more getting into the research/theory end of things, without perhaps the letters after my name to back that up, lol. Any thoughts appreciated! :-)",1350004927.0

However, ongoing it takes little time to maintain (less than an hour a week, if averaged). Every three years, I build new servers and place them into service (2 to 3 weeks of time to perform). I also do periodic hardware maintenance roughly every three months (typically 1/4 of a day to perform).<p>Due to the cost savings, we also are able to do quite a bit of redundancy, such as: dual PSUs, SSDs in RAID 10 on non-SAN servers, RAID-Z2/3 on SAN servers, offsite backups, complete server redundancy, spare servers ready to be slotted (I live an hour from colo), spare parts on hand, even multiple physical colos.<p>If components are selected carefully (i.e. sharing components between server roles), regular maintenance is performed, and  redundancy is ensured on a per component, per server, and per datacenter level, it's not very time intensive or costly.<p>I am a software engineer by trade, but love the ins and outs of hardware/ops.
