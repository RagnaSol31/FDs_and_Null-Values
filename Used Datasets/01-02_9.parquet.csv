MS has 2500 employees for Windows 7, with 40% of that being developers (it would be really sad if most of the other %60 were just paper pushing managers). Moreover, the size of the dev team does not necessarily mean it's a quality dev team",1219197483

The text on the Bold is so much sharper than anything else -- I can read it at the smallest font setting at arms length, no problem. Besides, the keyboard isn't just for typing novels.

The graphic designer can act as judge.<p>(You may have better luck with 2 teams of 2. That's the conventional wisdom around here, at least -- better for everyone to have a cofounder.)<p>Plan B: For extra credit, try the <i>Ender's Game</i> version of Plan A.

You want one for the same reason I bought one - a large screen for multimedia and web.<p>Now, if depended on your smartphone to get stuff done, you'd be scratching your head over the iPhone. It may have eye candy, but what about the features, reliability or stability that you'd actually need? I don't think the HN crowd appreciates how many people out there can do 80% of their job with just a BlackBerry. I didn't understand what the big deal around the BB is until I actually used it in such a scenario for a bit, and I know using the iPhone like that would be a no-go.",1219197101

Building a Lisp operating system may be interesting from an academic point of view, but it fills no need. A waste of 6 months.<p>In 6 months you can only do something mundane. For instance, adapt SBCL so it flawlessly interacts with CPAN and remove all the legacy lisp stuff. Then you'd have a clean lisp with a great library environment. People could actually -use- it. Still not a great business idea, but it has a small chance to rock the world. Especially since Ruby and Python are slowly becoming popular the ahead-of-the-curve guys are getting edgy.

It won because it allowed scores of OEMs to make all sorts of computers targeted at all sorts of consumers.<p>That's the same with the iPhone. Believe it or not, a lot of people hate AT&T. Or they have family on Verizon, and get free minutes when talking to them, so they sign up with Verizon. Or Sprint or T-mobile or whoever else. Or they get 15% off from work.<p>No matter how great the iPhone is, being tethered to AT&T means that >2/3 of customers won't even consider it. What this means is that Android, by being on whichever carriers want it, immediately appeals to at least 2x the number of customers. It could be significantly less good than the iPhone, and it will still sell more.<p>Then there's the form factors. It might be hard to believe, but most people just want to talk on their phone. Android can be on a cheap-ass clamshell. People with cheap-ass clamshells might still want to check the weather, play simple games, etc, so there will still be a market for apps there.<p>A lot of people use their mobile for business. They care about call quality, battery life, and a keypad, all things the iPhone sucks at. Those people will, on whichever carrier their company has a deal with, have Android phones available to them that fit that needs. (No idea if any will make inroads on Blackberry though.)<p>The iPhone has Apple/AT&T's marketing budget. Android has Google, a bunch of OEMs, and a bunch of carriers.<p>All of those are inherent benefits of openness.",1219194785

It's such a common problem and start-up founders are well advised to carefully vet not only their own advisors but also the VC's or Angel's ones.  The truth is that many, many advisors are inexperienced (no one knows all of the answers in a world where human knowledge doubles every few years) but it is the advisor's failure to admit a lack of experience or knowledge which is potentially fatal to YOU.<p>Congratulations on the great article, Graham.  I've read tones of this sort of stuff over the years and I believe that your article is the closest to an honest, sensible guide to fundraising I've ever seen.  It should be mandatory reading for all would-be startup founders.<p>Please, please keep up the good work!",1219194053
