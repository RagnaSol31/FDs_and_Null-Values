It focused attention away from the brand, it was weird, and it raised a lot of criticism that attracted people who wouldn't have heard of the ad anyway.<p>I'm all for ""edgy"", and I love CP+B's work, but they were competing against Apple, and that means competing against possibly the best advertising machine on the planet. Apple has excellent reputation, they've got beautiful products, they were competing against a heavily-criticized product, and they had a brilliant two-pronged ad plan. Part of their ads only discussed product, and nothing else. No ""Let's see people using this."" No ""Look at people using this in real life."" It was, ""We've made something beautiful."" No more than that. It was the revolving iMac, the Macbook Air in the envelope, the rack of iPod touches, the chromatic Nanos, the many videos of the app store. Emphasis on ""groundbreaking.""<p>Meanwhile, they took out a heavy ad campaign against Microsoft. They made entertainment pieces. Slapstick. All of it gently teasing Microsoft. No hard edges: just two funny actors joking around. Even if it was unfair and imbalanced, even if Hodgman was the funnier of the two, it was <i>fun</i>, and it was fun like satire is fun. It didn't make the case that Microsoft was bad, it <i>took that fact for granted.</i><p>Against this, CP+B put in an ""edgy"" ad. Weird stuff with Gates and Seinfeld joking. Only problem is, edgy is good when you've got two equal, generic products. CP+B's Burger King ads stand out because McDonald's has nothing. In this case, Microsoft is bland, but Apple is a hot product. It's one of the most fashionable brands on the planet, and even among hardcore tech geeks, it has a pretty good reputation. (Some people hate it, but some people love it.) Furthermore, it was a big risk, and Apple - seated in a comfortable niche - was able to launch attacks directed at the sole fact that it was a pricy and edgy campaign.<p>I'm interested in seeing how the ""I'm a PC"" ads end up doing. They're nice, even if they still have that feeling of Microsoft's avoiding talking about their product - and that, I think, is MS's Achilles Heel right now. They're a nothing brand. They're the biggest but they have no impressive positive reputation. Their computers are designed by other companies, none of which stand out. Apple, meanwhile, has an extremely tight product line and they control every aspect of their product, including ads.<p>Yeah, Microsoft is the bigger company, but they're at a disadvantage in this campaign. Apple has a definitive image. Microsoft does not.",1233885224.0

I distinctly remember the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated--the most memorable day of early childhood for many people in my generation--and I remember the ""long hot summer"" and other events of the 1960s civil rights movement.<p>One early memory I have is of a second grade classmate (I still remember his name, which alas is just common enough that it is hard to Google him up) who moved back to Minnesota with his northern ""white"" parents after spending his early years in Alabama. He told me frightening stories about Ku Klux Klan violence to black people (the polite term in those days was ""Negroes""), including killing babies, and I was very upset to hear about that kind of terrorism happening in the United States. So I followed subsequent news about the civil rights movement, including the activities of Martin Luther King, Jr. up to his assassination, with great interest.<p>It happens that I had a fifth-grade teacher, a typically pale, tall, and blonde Norwegian-American, who was a civil rights activist and who spent her summers in the south as a freedom rider. She used to tell our class about how she had to modify her car (by removing the dome light and adding a locking gas cap) so that Klan snipers couldn't shoot her as she opened her car door at night or put foreign substances into her gas tank. She has been a civil rights activist all her life, and when I Googled her a few years ago and regained acquaintance with her, I was not at all surprised to find that she is a member of the civil rights commission of the town where I grew up.<p>One day in fifth grade we had a guest speaker in our class, a young man who was then studying at St. Olaf College through the A Better Chance (ABC)<p><a href=""http://www.abetterchance.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abetterchance.org/</a><p>affirmative action program. (To me, the term ""affirmative action"" still means active recruitment of underrepresented minority students, as it did in those days, and I have always thought that such programs are a very good idea, as some people have family connections to selective colleges, but many other people don't.) During that school year (1968-1969), there was a current controversy in the United States about whether the term ""Negro"" or ""Afro-American"" or ""black"" was most polite. So a girl in my class asked our visitor, ""What do you want to be called, 'black' or 'Afro-American'?"" His answer was, ""I'd rather be called Henry."" Henry's answer to my classmate's innocent question really got me thinking.<p>So to agree with the submitted post, it is in some sense a defeat of the civil rights movement that we think of ""black"" as a category rather than as one arbitrary grouping of individuals among many possible groupings. The headline for the story about the recent release of the fifth AP Report to the Nation<p><a href=""http://www.collegeboard.com/html/aprtn/pdf/ap_report_to_the_nation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.collegeboard.com/html/aprtn/pdf/ap_report_to_the_...</a><p>could just as well have been about which state had the highest performance (Maryland) as about ethnic group differences in performance.",1233883894.0

These companies are involved in many diverse business lines and, bungling in the mortgage-backed business aside, many of these businesses are hugely profitable.  This is why institutions like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were able to report large losses instead of collapsing: mortgage losses have been mostly offset by gains in other businesses.  A CEO will need to continue to invest in the profitable business lines, with an eye on risk, to avoid being shut out of them by aggressive competitors, leaving the bank with nothing but toxic assets and low margin operations.<p>In ""How to Make Wealth"" pg wrote about how salesmen are an exception to compensation rules because their performance can easily be measured.  The same is true for traders who do not deal in positions that must be held for a long time the way mortgage bonds are.  If a trader makes $30 million in this way, he is in a position to demand, say, $5 million to $10 million or he will be happy to join a different firm that will pay him that amount.

The good resources have been discussed in many other HN posts.)<p>For the super-basic stuff any dynamic language will do fine, so just mark it up in whatever stack you're comfortable with the tools for (I'd recommend PHP, Python, or Ruby in increasing orders of complexity for a basic site.)<p>You might also consider a real CMS in case you want to bring more non-technical people on, or add authentication later.  Wordpress is fairly full featured on the editor, has user privileges, and I believe it has plugins to support LaTeX and other Math markup easily. Again, any leaders in the space should be fine for what you want to do.<p>On the actual code side, mark it up in strict html or xhtml, test it in at least FF/IE6/IE7/Safari, and try to seperate your CSS into classes in external file(s) as much as possible so you can change your design later with less headaches.  If things are set up right, adding a css stylsheet for mobile would be trivial, which might be nice for times when you need a formula at the library.<p>I hear good things about the book 'Head First HTML' from beginners, and if you're at any high level with computing you should breeze through it.  Alternately, just get a CMS and file a style you like and be done with it.<p>In your case, I'd argue that there's an explicit tradeoff between simplicity of the code and simplicity of the final implementation. If you want a basic site with slim, clean code, you're going to have to do some learning. If you want a quick deployment that 'just works', you could do it in a few hours, but have less control over the elegance of the solution.<p>P.S.: Cool idea.
