The financial one is sort of trivial: you will keep more and need less money. The more interesting, philosophical side has to do with what it means to be rich. If you define it as &quot;the ability to do whatever you want&quot;, then you really can be as rich as you want just by playing mind tricks on yourself. It sounds kind of like Buddhism to me.",1432345595.0
