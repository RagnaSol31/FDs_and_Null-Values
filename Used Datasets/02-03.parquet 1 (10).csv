And if indeed this was really a case of insurance fraud rather than a straight theft, perhaps the outcome was good for everyone except for the insurance company.  To the extent that the vault was good enough for them to obtain insurance, the vault was good enough.<p>To obtain better security, the motivation of the participants needs to be analyzed.  Perhaps this is a problem best solved through obscurity, with two competing security teams installing two totally separate alarms systems, each standing to lose if their alarm is defeated.  Or perhaps skip the alarms, and rely on threats of deadly force.<p>But although any new insurer will properly demand the technological improvements illustrated here, it would be foolish to believe that technology alone will keep out a dedicated team of insiders with full access to the system.  Real world security is not equivalent to public key encryption where security can be established by 'proof'.",1236999099

5,515581,comment,515233.0,515233.0,0,0,jksmith,,,"For an aside, I like the comment about the developer being unapologetic about using Delphi for development.<p>The unfortunate thing about the argument for what makes a programming language productive (dense language or the libraries available to it), is that the argument is strongly rooted in open source, IMO, where the tools continue to be mostly deficient in the productivity department compared to working in a language environment like Delphi, where millions and millions of lines have held up to commercial rigor.<p>Delphi is a counter example to show that no matter what advanced language features are available to the programmer in another language, lisp, haskell, clojure, whatever, these languages still can't compete under commercial conditions with Delphi in a native win32 desktop environment. Delphi is the hemi engine of the legacy world, and would be a great candidate for integrating some advanced features to make it a good tool for ramping into a more advanced functional mindset.<p>I've written my share of Delphi code, and I've been sick of declaring variables, sections, typing begin/end, and writing a host of other tiresome cruft for a long time. But for development speed it really is hard to beat. Programmers who have been successful in the windows world expect the total package - language, libraries, dev environment. Maybe none of the three are perfect, but together they still make the alternative of just language and libraries mostly unacceptable under commercial conditions.",1236998857

10,515574,comment,515444.0,515573.0,0,0,FraaJad,,,"Ramayana is not ""from"" the Vedas. Vedas predate Ramayana.<p>However, ""Bhagavadgeetha"", which is popularly* considered to be the holiest of Hindu texts is from Mahabharatha, which takes place after Ramayana.<p>* I say popular because there is no universal agreement on Bhagavadgeetha to be canonical source of Hindu philosophy and religion. However, it has a very good condensation of the teachings of various hindu philosophical schools which can be understood with comparatively less study than the Vedas, the Vedanta and other bodies of knowledge.",1236998228

I just watched it in its entirety.<p>I just watched it with a friend who is a film maker (has done some Radiohead DVD films among other impressive work.) It sparked a discussion about business models from an artist's perspective. Still mulling the implications of our discussion so no conclusions yet, sorry.<p>Oh, it helps (for me at least) that it is the story of the Ramayana, an ancient Hindu text from the Vedas. Amazing!",1236997996

They've recognised that the threat from Twitter is that people are engaging well by following business accounts and are more receptive to corporate messages as a result - that's incredibly valuable if you're the conduit. Had they not done this, I think they risked losing a lot of business interest to a growing competitor.",1236997308

Filtering is simple and easy.<p>* The primary right-hand thing I haven't used yet. Not sure if I need that when I have the main stream.<p>* I like that it's all bigger. Facebook's moving away from compression and towards ultrasimple streaming.<p>* The new ""post things"" bar is incredible. I like how they combined wall posting and status updates.<p>* I love that they added the [X] button to replace the click-menu for stories.<p>I can't think of much to dislike. This keeps people connected more, and that's what matters. So far I don't notice a feature missing that I was using in the first place.",1236996248
