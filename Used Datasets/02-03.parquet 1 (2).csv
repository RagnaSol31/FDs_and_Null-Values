The best example I can think of is the repackaging of 80's nintendo games in a single joystick you plug into the TV.  \n",1174013648

If you want to see if a lawyer is going to be a good fit, or if a SEO person is going to really help you out, there is no immediate corrolary to vesting in an LLC.  So it makes hiring fast/firing fast difficult to do.  You don't want a large chunk of your company held up by someone if it turns out the designer you gave 2% in leui of cash to design your UI is actually a complete flake.\n",1174013588

I plan on using it in the next project, but I don't have the Experience yet.<p>\nBeyond the fact that it's open, there's also that you can tie in other JS libs- So you have a lib you really like, you can import it's functions into JS, and use them as part of your application.<p>And while I agree that you could hack up the HTML/JS, that'd get really hairy for complex stuff- Although I think some people are doing that now to break things up better into modules.",1174011553

Very insanely great, indeed. Reminds me of a certain information minister for both coherence and modesty:<p><a href=""http://welovetheiraqiinformationminister.com/"">http://welovetheiraqiinformationminister.com/</a><p>He's a good businessman, though. He took an early lead in the PC business and turned it into this generation's Sony Walkman knockoff + an overpriced Intel machine running Unix. Oh, and Wired magazine thinks his utterances are ""insanely great"":<p>""The products suck! There's no sex in them anymore!""<p>Steve, I owned an Apple II. There wasn't a mother Theresa pinup calendar's worth of sex in it.",1174011433
