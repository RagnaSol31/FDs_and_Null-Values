I'd love to be able to pick a period (by dragging along a timeline of logs), zoom into to a period, and get any messages regarding LDAP from that time. Then I'd like to take that group of server and regenerate a certificate for each of them to fix the problem<p>>  I have no idea what you're talking about.<p>It seems like you haven't used Splunk at all.<p>I know your a lot of your competitors (eg Plesk) are similarly basic. This doesn't mean that it wouldn't be good to innovate.<p>> I wish you luck in your endeavors. ;-)<p>One doesn't have to build something to have an opinion on it.

I became interested in programming because I wanted to make games, and that naturally lead me to learn higher math to do 3d graphics.  Plus, this gave me the background of trying to solve some important problems myself, so the solutions I was taught in school made sense and stuck a lot easier.<p>I think it would be possible to base a comprehensive education around making a computer game.  Comp Sci would provide the technical and theoretical background, while classes such as history, english, art, etc. would provide the material for the game.  This gets around the problem of a person having to waste comp sci time on non comp sci game related problems, and they learn to integrate everything they learn to a much higher degree.  Plus, it'll be more fun to grade their work.",1191207292

4,61450,story,,,6,1,lisporama,Boilerplate code says a lot about a language...,http://lispy.wordpress.com/2007/10/01/boilerplate-code-says-a-lot-about-a-language/,"""That's the important point: the  difference between merely implementing something in a language and embedding something in a language so that you don't lose the original power of the language. Lisp is a lousy language for doing any particular problem; what it's good for is figuring out the right language that you want and embedding that in Lisp. That's the real power to this approach to design.""  -- Hal Abelson",1191206823

You'll see that all of the random ass-headed cruelty of the world will suddenly make perfect sense once we go Inside the Monkeysphere.<p>There's plenty of cruelty between acquaintances in the world, and a great deal of it is random and ass-headed. Lots of that cruelty falls under the headings of oppression, crime, and racism too. (War and spam are between strangers almost by definition.)",1191204049
