The proof is in ""Falsely shouting fire in a theatre."" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_thea...</a>)<p>Point being: Some people do believe that there is a minimum amount of decency required on the nation's airwaves to preserve ethical standards particularly of children whose values are highly malleable. It is justified as not being a violation of free speech with the same idea as that of the schenck ruling, that there indeed are limits to what a person can say without punishment.<p>Personally I feel people have a right to their belief in something like this, while others feel it infringes on our rights. But again, no matter what society we live in our rights are always limited by boundaries anyway...and boundaries serve a good purpose in shaping the morality of a nation. Morality...is often useful. I'll leave it at that?",1210733965

I went to a predominantly white suburbia school, and have plenty of friends who use the term ¨dirty jew¨ as a derogatory comment without second thought. Totally Acceptable.<p>I don´t know if ya were livin in a utopia, but I imagine racism is higher with people forced to pretend PC.<p>I still don´t understand why PG is taking his school experiences and painting that brush as what all schools are like, but apparently quite a few here have had the same experiences ...",1210733153

Being able to instrument ANY OS call with zero off overhead is pretty useful.<p>It's a shame that (for some reason) it's crippled on OS X and the FreeBSD port is progressing so slowly (my dev and deployment platforms).,1210732436

Part of the value of the sites you listed is the community helps bring the better content to the top without the distraction of the second-rate posts and articles.<p>It's a great start to the site though and if you're able to offer sorting options or search in the future (by topic, keyword, whatever), it could become a site worth using on a regular basis.",1210731327

27,189198,comment,188489.0,188771.0,0,0,randallsquared,,,"I think you should show respect for others' beliefs, at least to the extent of not ridiculing them, <i>except</i> when those beliefs are themselves the topic of conversation.  In that case, there's really no way to have the discussion without being willing to disagree.<p>When talking about lies people tell each other, the beliefs <i>are</i> the topic, whether or not you believe they are lies or truths.  If you don't want to have other people weigh your beliefs in such a context, I would suggest not mentioning them during such a discussion.  There are beliefs I have which I'm sure most don't share, but which I don't feel the need to defend (anymore) at every opportunity.  For example, as an atheist, I wouldn't typically go to a Christian forum and announce that God doesn't exist, unless I were prepared to have my views ridiculed.<p>Please don't take this as meaning I think you shouldn't discuss your beliefs in this thread, but only that I think you shouldn't try to influence others not to debate you honestly by implying they're being uncivil.",1210730433
