Among other techniques, it uses the recently developed PSLQ integer relation finding algorithm to identify any root of a polynomial with degree <= 5 and reasonable height, or linear combinations of Pi, log(2), log(3), square roots, et cetera.<p>Interestingly, the ISC's job is made easier by the fact that numbers which come up in ""real life"" tend to have linear combinations of ""similar"" values.  For example, Pi behaves like a logarithm, so linear combinations of Pi and (poly)logarithms tend to pop up, while Pi^2 tends to occur in combination with the product of two logarithms.  As a result, the ISC is optimized to pass sets of ""similar"" inputs to the PSLQ algorithm, which makes finding relations much faster without missing anything interesting.",1199586902

The Bush tax cuts and the Reagan tax cuts before have freed up tremendous amounts of venture capital that sparked economic growth.  The venture capital market didn't exist in America when the top income tax rate was 70% under Jimmy Carter.  Vote Democrat and the only way you'll be able to get funding is through government grants, and the government will seize your income if you are a success.",1199586565
