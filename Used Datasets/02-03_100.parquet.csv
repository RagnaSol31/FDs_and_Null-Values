I have a few contacts who are either affiliate program managers for large online stores or are otherwise involved with affiliate-based marketing on some level higher than simply being users of some affiliate program. One person expressed interest in the service after a debacle involving Live's CashBack program. I'm going to gather feedback from potential customers via adwords campaigns. This should also give me some idea of the level of interest.<p>Edit: I don't know who downvoted you, or my other comment, but this is basically abuse of the voting system and it's been going on for a while now.

How can we help if we don't even know something's wrong?</i><p>(Assuming that wasn't rhetorical): By treating people with real respect and gentleness.  You never know whom you are dealing with or how your behavior will impact them.<p>I was molested and raped as a child, something I'm pretty open about.   For me, a big deal moment was after the birth of my second child when the doctor took off his gown and, apparently without really thinking about it, gently wiped some of the blood off of me.  I have no idea what his name was.  The birth of my second child happened pretty fast, so I interacted with this man for probably 15 minutes or less.  I had never known a man to be that gentle or considerate before.  I have no reason to think he ever had any idea how big of a deal that one action was to me.  It made a big psychological and emotional impact and I still remember it with some clarity -- how startled I was and how strange and wondrous it seemed -- more than 21 years later (even in spite of the 9 or 10 years I was doped to the gills on prescription and non-prescription medication for a serious medical crisis, which has left me with ""swiss cheese for brains"").

I know you keep thinking it's about me making a secure authentication that competes with bcrypt+ssl.  It's actually for the purposes I laid out in the blog post:<p>1. An easy to setup secure auth system that's at least as secure as the others available.  Not more secure, but just as secure.  For example, your attack of protecting against content modification applies to <i>all</i> login systems.  Every last one.  Phishing also applies to <i>all</i> of them.  I'm trying to tease out what ones are particular to autho.me and cover those.<p>2. The ability to manage users across multiple domains and organizations.<p>3. The ability to share or trade accounts with other trusted partners.  This one is dubious because I don't know how users will like it.  Really gotta figure out the usability of this.<p>4. An easy way to do 2-factor authentication with phones.<p>So, don't be blinded by the SRP.  That's just there to make the other features work.  I'd also say if you're going put up specific attacks, then you should give ones that aren't also attacks against the things you promote.  If you evaluate autho.me from the point of view of an infinitely capable super hacker who can always modify content, then all logins are vulnerable.<p>I'd also like demonstrations of actual javascript turing completeness or mathematic failures that aren't handled by Tom Wu's SJCL.  If there's flaws in Javascript's math such that it causes failures, then I'd like some concrete examples that don't require ""infinit super hacker injects code"" attacks.<p>In otherwords, I'd like demonstrations of the SRP data that's publicly sent and an attack against it because of a failure in javascript mathematics, sjcl, or my code.<p>Anyway Thomas, I don't take it personally, even if you are a bit sensationalist about it.",1294453692.0
