(In the context in question single-digit miles per second is not ""really fast"", it's just the cover charge.) You can pour arbitrary amounts of energy into a kinetic kill projectile, and there is no known reasonable way of defending against such a thing except to not be where it hits.<p>Just as people worry about nuclear weapons and biological weapons, we get planet-killing kinetic projectiles rather earlier than we get anything else useful from space. In fact if we put our minds to it, and were willing to be patient, we could probably do it today. The same tech we're looking at to divert existing planet killing asteroids can just as easily be turned to tweaking one of their existing orbits towards us instead of away.",1325040779.0

Once you've chosen those, you must then choose a carrier and a plan. In the US, there are now three carriers to choose from, none of which have anything like identical plans you can just price-shop. Each carrier then has a variety of options, from talk time (4 different ones on AT&T, I believe) to text messaging to data plans, and they can often be mixed and matched in various combinations. If multiple family members have phones it gets even <i>more</i> fun, as you then get into the various family plans.<p>Compare this with how the iPhone was originally: there was one model with a couple of different storage sizes, one carrier, and one data plan.
