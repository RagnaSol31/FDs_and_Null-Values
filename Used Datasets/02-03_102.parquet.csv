Neither IMF nor EU did anything to cover our corruptive politicians. But they can’t substitute our constitution or our courts. Neither is their duty to govern Greece. Their duty is to set goals and check whether we implement agreeable reforms. Everything else is just conspiracy theories or pure speculations. They don’t have executive jurisdiction to enforce implementation of this or that policy.<p>You mentioned the Siemens scandal for example, by the way your numbers are off by an order of magnitude. This is a typical example of a cover-up from our part. We let the key witness escape to Germany where he is protected from extradition. It’s not their fault, we shouldn’t have let him leave in the first place. Taking responsibility for our mistakes would be a first step in overcoming our inefficiencies. And the previous government was anything but obedient, as a matter of fact all three governments that were called to implement reforms resisted as much as they could.<p>So please, let’s just stop the speculation about EU wanting to rule Greece through puppet governments. I’m sure they have better things to do.",1436064460.0

It switches edges to connect points to neighbors that have similar values. It will get rid of some of the spikiness and leave more smooth gradients.<p>3. The running the edge detection twice scheme mentioned in the comments works because you want the change of the gradient, and you need both sides represented.  So the double edge detection will give you manifolds, which is good.<p>4. Instead of having arbitrary vertex positions, you can just specify the offset to the next point.

Even Keynes would not have said so: it is only during recessions that Keynes (correctly) said that the economy needed to be stimulated.<p><i>If there are only 1000 people who can afford an iPhone, or to drive cars on roads, there will be no way to finance the development of iPhones (plus infrastructure) or roads.</i><p>This kind of verbal reasoning was replaced by mathematical models in economics.  The most fundamental such model is called General Equilibrium Theory, which states that the economy is driven by the creation of <i>value</i> (see sibling post) and as long as the technology to create value increases, so will the total value of the economy.  Keynes (who set the tone for all subsequent macroeconomics) pointed out a major deviation from General Equilibrium Theory can occur, where the economy produces less than its theoretical output.  To remedy this, he recommended fiscal stimulus (e.g. &quot;coming up with new labor-intensive occupations&quot;) but this was only a short term measure.  In ordinary times, Keynes did not recommend fiscal (or monetary) stimulus.<p>Now in practice, zero redistribution of wealth would result in a really terrible society, and the negative externalities from poverty (and extreme wealth) would probably result in much lower economic growth.  Wealth redistribution is not only ethical, but also makes a more stable and orderly society.  Nonetheless, the fundamental reasoning that growth is drive by consumption per se, is wrong.",1436061870.0

The other is that besides the government IMF fucked up too by setting unrealistic goals, like a 4% surplus by 2016 which led Tsipras denying continuation of the program to avoid further damage to the economy (those goals were eventually reduced but it now seems too little too late). Everyone is looking for a scapegoat. The government is blaming ECB and the Germans, EU is blaming the government, and IMF is blaming everyone including Lagarde who can’t seem to get her head out of her ass.  Then there is US who see what a clustefuck this whole situation is but can’t do anything but nagging the Germans to become a bit more flexible and in order to put some pressure on them decided to make the report public just when Tsipras abandoned negotiations.<p>There is a Greek proverb saying that when too many roosters sign the dawn comes late.",1436061862.0
