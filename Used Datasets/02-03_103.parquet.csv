Problems with DC that I can think of off the top of my head:<p>- Utility companies need to change out pole pigs for DC-DC converters.<p>- When electrocuted, muscles grab and lock up, rather than a mere painful buzzing.<p>- Lower mechanical switch ratings (no zero crossing for arcs to self-extinguish). Check out the printed DC ratings on a listed switch some time.<p>- Corrosion on exposed conductors due to constant potential difference.<p>- Low level magnetization of things next to power conductors.<p>- General disruption and uncertainty that change brings.
