SpaceX was paid to develop a commercial crew variant called Dragon V2.<p>Spacex was from its start conceived by Musk to develop low cost systems that will be used to colonize Mars. He has said this from the start.<p>Nasa contracts were never necessary for SpaceX to succeed as they have contracts world wide to lift payloads to space for  many nations. These contracts help to accelerate the company  timeline for crewed missions to the Moon and Mars.,1417831507.0
