Dell can then just use the Intel Ultraboard and not have to worry about the hardware (CPU, GPU, RAM, Wifi, Ethernet, Audio, SSD, PCI/USB etc.) Let Dell worry about offering Pink and Magenta cases. Let Intel work with Microsoft closely so Windows 8 rocks on Ultraboard. There should be only one driver per Ultraboard and it should include the Chipset, Video, Audio, Network drivers. I never want to install Dell/HP/Asus drivers. Ever. They are all horrible across the board.<p>Reinstalling Windows should not take more than 15 minutes, it should require no user-interaction, and it should leave the data partition alone. The data partition is where users images/photos/videos/music go. Intel should work with MS to ensure that executables do not run from this partition. If my mom downloads a virus, she shouldn't have to call me to fix it. Hardware DEP hasn't done much to stop viruses. Intel needs to come up with hardware features to remedy root-kits without my assistance.<p>Intel thinks of itself as one of the hardware makers with competitors. It makes CPUs, like AMD or Samsung. It makes boards like MSI or ASUS. This is red ocean. It needs to make its own blue ocean and of all the companies in the PC industry, it is actually capable of doing that. Instead of offering $300m to others, it should put $3B into creating the single Ultraboard that any PC seller can build a case around and sell tens of millions of these. Dell can't do it.

As a <i>user</i>, it offers me a smooth widget experience, no hard crashes, and a ginormous store full of toys and a few useful widgets. As an appliance, it is sterling.  My music player works as reliably as my toaster. <i>Exactly</i> what I want, actually.  I have no need to tinker with my appliances; they do exactly what I want, and I free my mental cycles to do things like work on my Master's without fiddling around with configuring my toaster.

It's a pretty sweet gig, in my opinion.<p>Apple <i>really should</i> open up the hood to tinkerers, in the ethical sense. It does us as a society no good to have a society of 'couch potatoes' and spectators. We need doers & thinkers, people who can get the job done and also reflect on their existence. I strongly believe that Apple should incorporate that awareness into product policies: there should be something like a 'enable tinkerer mode' in my iPod system settings.  However, their corporate DNA goes against that, from the early 80s on. They really want to provide a unified and 'beautiful' experience for their customers. Tinkerers open up the hood and cause variety and divergence from the norm. (Think all the weird kludges in Windows because it has to support such a variety of hardware).",1315277337.0

There are a lot of these. IBM's Linux/AIX servers are all PowerPC and IBM incidentally makes the chips for the above game consoles as well. Not to mention the number of PowerPC chips in cars and other embedded devices dwarfs all the above in units sold.<p>2) Intel (probably) got out of the Xscale game not just because of hubris, but because it was necessarily enriching its competitor through licensing fees of the ARM architecture. Unless Intel could buy ARM, which it couldn't due to anti-trust, it should probably seek out a home grown solution instead of sealing its fate as another fab for ARM's designs. I'm not sure Intel didn't see the writing on the wall, it just failed to execute on a solution. Intel was probably very wary of trying to make a new architecture after the failure of the Itanium so it concentrated its efforts on a low powered x86 aka Atom. Unfortunately this was and still is a colossal failure. Intel still has no products for low powered devices and the arguments for an x86 solution are starting to fall apart fast.<p>3) Apple's success is a culmination of Steve Job's vision and Tim Cook's operational mastery. Apple's products before Tim Cook were beautifully designed, over priced, and under performing. Apple's product line without Steve Jobs was boring and unappealing. These last few years have been a golden age for Apple. To expect things to only get better from here would be to place all the emphasis on the company and ignore people inside it, not to mention history.

I don't know if there's a particular business word for this, but for me, it's 'trust'.<p>When buying a Macbook, I know I'll be able to get parts and service for it - often from a local Apple store - for several years.  If I buy a Dell N5040 today, and need service for it 2 years from now, will I be able to get it?  Dell's got a reputation for good service for <i>businesses</i>, but that's because they're paying a lot extra for service contracts and such.<p>Looking at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Inspiron"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Inspiron</a> then looking at <a href=""http://www.dell.com/us/p/inspiron-laptops"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dell.com/us/p/inspiron-laptops</a> - I don't see some of the Dell models on the Wikipedia site (granted, they may not be 100% up to date all the time) but I also see a long litany of model variations, none of which inspire much confidence in me.  With all the differing parts that change between models, will <i>Dell</i> even be able to get the same parts for my model in, say, 3 years?<p>Some of this is just trust in the brand - I know Apple's changed their macbook lineup several times, but rarely enough to warrant an entirely new name change - usually just spec upgrades.  There's a certain amount of trust I and many other friends seem to have in Apple because of the simplicity of the product line.  Yes, it's better for Apple as well, to streamline cost/operations, but from my standpoint simpler == less cognitive dissonance.  I say this as someone who grew tired of building my own desktops years ago, speccing out parts (and trying to find linux drivers for them during my linux years), and have gone more mobile.  There's usually far less ""build it yourself"" in the laptop world, so you go with what's available from manufacturers.  Apple's models have a consistency between them and over time which builds confidence in the brand itself, not just any one particular model.<p>Trying to compete on specs with new models being introduced quarter to quarter will <i>not</i> work - Apple competitors need to rethink their long term strategy if they want to win back customers.  I still run Windows sometimes, but I don't need a dedicated Windows machine from HP/Lenovo/Dell to do it on, and I'm not sure what would ever get me back to that camp.<p>Would I pay a 'premium' price for a Lenovo?  Possibly, but there's gotta be a bigger faith in the brand, and I don't have that right now.",1315275895.0

Windows 3.1 put a huge dent in this. By the time Windows 95 came out, Apple was essentially dead.<p>During all this, Intel and Microsoft had an uneasy marriage of convenience. They were dependent on each other but had clear lines of separation between hardware and software.<p>Microsoft tried to branch out. The original versions of NT ran on other architectures, like Alpha and MIPS. Under Steve Jobs (many may remember that Steve Jobs was only interim CEO for years after the NeXT purchase while the Apple board searched for a replacement for Gil Amelio).<p>5+ years ago, with a resurgent Apple in the PC space, Apple abandoned Motorla for Intel, killing the PowerPC in all but name. Microsoft had long since abandoned all the non-x86 architectures.<p>Intel was so dominant that they sold their low-power chip division (XScale) and seemed to have an answer for low cost computer devices in the form of the Atom as the netbook market just exploded.<p>Intel basically discounted any device smaller than this. So did Microsoft. Apple completely transformed the mobile space with the iPhone and then the iPad, catapulting ARM from a niche embedded product to something eating away at Intel from the bottom end, potentially threatening their entire business.<p>In the 90s the churn of forced obsolescence made MS and Intel a lot of money and solved a lot of problems. There were no old versions of Windows to support as the market for PCs was growing at a huge rate and hardware just didn't last that long.<p>Now the CPU power that the average user needs has plateaued. Any PC made in the last 5 years (maybe longer) will be fine for most people. The trend now is towards lower power and more mobility, which is why ARM is a strategic threat to Intel.<p>It's incredibly funny (""the ironing is delicious"" as Bart would say) that Apple is now one of Intel's biggest customers while being the driver to the threat to Intel.<p>And now Microsoft, once an unstoppable juggernaut, just doesn't get it when Ballmer describes tablets as ""just another form factor"". They failed for 10 years to make tablets just another way to sell more Windows licenses. They're still kicking that dead horse with Windows 8.<p>All the while Apple is making money hand over fist and HP, Dell, etc are struggling to make a buck or, in HP's case, getting out of the PC business entirely.<p>All of these companies try to imitate Apple releasing vaguely copycat products but none of them get it. They're engaged in what I call ""shotgun marketing"" as they have no idea what the market wants and just fire off a shotgun blast, hoping something will stick.<p>Only Apple seems willing or able to put the consumer first. The Apple-haters will I'm sure violently disagree with some or all of this.<p>Microsoft I believe will continue a very long but now inevitable slide into irrelevance (companies that large take many years to die). The jury is still out on Intel.<p>The only companies that seem to have a long future ahead of them are Apple, Google and <i>maybe</i> Facebook.",1315275586.0

In C++ and Java, even 90th-percentile is a bitch to read, hence people don't. At best, those responsible for maintaining it will skim it. This is also why the ""broken windows"" pattern (once things get ugly, people ""hack"" them and they get uglier) sets in so rapidly in C++/Java projects.<p>Functional programming encourages beautiful code (although it certainly <i>can</i> be ugly.) A consequence of this is that people, even if they're not skilled enough to write pretty code, actually read code-- not because they need to, because they want to-- and become better programmers as a result.<p>Functional programming, for a passionate programmer, refines the aesthetic sense and 2-4 years of it will give most people the skill to be a passable software architect (whether they are passable or great depends on talent IMO). Not so with C++ or Java. You can spend 10+ years in those languages and get really, really good at optimization but still have no aesthetic sense.<p>You also learn faster when using FP languages because you can <i>do</i> more in them. You get to see the consequences of your architectural decisions long before the project goes multi-developer and is handed off to someone else or a team.<p>Functional programming is not a great career move.
