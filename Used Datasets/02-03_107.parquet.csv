Compared to an LED, a wristwatch uses <i>very</i> little power (about 1W according to Wikipedia). Of course this lamp may be more comparable to a grandfather clock than a wristwatch; I don't know how much power a grandfather watch requires, but the energy you store winding it up can't be that high since it's not that much work, and the strength of the mechanism is that the stored energy is then delivered over a long time, ie. days.<p>Also, with clocks, you get to skip the conversion of the energy completely. That immediately gets you a much higher efficiency than this lamp, which is potential energy converted to electricity (losing heat), converted to light (losing heat). Of course energy transmission losses still apply, ie. it's not free to get the mechanical energy from the spring to the hands of the watch.",1356144880.0

Bookmarks are treated as long term archives for links, and more trouble to manage, curate, and organize than is necessary for ephemeral sites you'd like to read later.<p>Some people mention ""read it later"" features, which I personally use. Safari has read lists, but I would argue these are also poorly understood and under utilized by most people.<p>For me, I believe a solution is something like ""read it later"", but lighter weight, easier to manage, and more integrated so that it doesn't just end up being another out of sight, forgotten backlog of things you wish you had read.",1356144867.0

Granted I don't remember the book outright (perhaps I could do with another reread...), but the gist is that if you're having trouble with a ""thing"" on your list, you just need to reduce that ""thing"" down more because it's too broadly scoped as stated.<p>Instead of ""work singlemindedly and with complete focus on MyNewWebApp"", perhaps ""Write user authentication module for MyNewWebApp"" or even ""Get basic username/password authentication working for etc.""<p>Just about anything and everything can be broken down this way; in fact I struggle to imagine something that is incompatible with this! The author of this piece even fails to give any examples of what he means by something that couldn't be broken down.<p>The other thing is that GTD is a framework. You can follow the way the book tells you to do it to the letter, but then you're missing out. Start with the book, add a little, take a little, mix in whatever works for you. Once you've got the foundation, improvements will come naturally.

When he returned to Apple he made a series of bold decisions to essentially wipe out large portions of the product line and focus focus focus. NeXTStep formed the basis of OS X. OS X enabled the iPhone and iPad. Steve delayed both until things were ready instead of jumping in too early with a half-baked product.
