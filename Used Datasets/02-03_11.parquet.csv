If we're still in this situation after ten years despite all the artificial stimulus I think it's just a joke to call it anything less than a depression. I'd argue we've been in a depression since the tech bubble burst and that we've just been papering over the mess for the last ten years. Considering that job growth has been basically zero for that period I'd say we've been kidding ourselves with statistics for awhile now.",1259290141.0
8,963355,comment,962658.0,963024.0,0,0,jswinghammer,,,The Community Reinvestment Act encouraged banks to make risky loans and if banks didn't make such loans the government would start snooping around in their business. The understanding has always been that the government would bail out massive losses in these loans. Some of the deregulation made things easier for this to happen but the recession would have been regardless of these factors. Job growth over the last ten years has been almost entirely focused in housing and related industries.,1259290029.0

Those who intended to profit from this politically and financially, and those who are into it for purely environmental reasons.<p>It seems if there is no real causative environmental impact happening, the pure environmentalist should be happy to embrace the truth at this point whereas those who were into it for other reasons may still attempt to spin and re-spin facts and push for further legislation and increased taxes.<p>Another thing to consider is now that it has become a political issue and is at the global center of attention a lot of people are going to look like they were participating in something that was a fraud and a deception.

Instead (to me) they look byzantine, obtuse, and obfuscated.<p>This leads me to believe that either lots of really smart people have vastly underestimated the complexity of the problem, or that the people currently charged with fixing it are unable or unwilling to work in a direct manner.<p>All three of these are interesting conclusions.",1259289859.0

Shakespeare, notably, wrote his plays in the vernacular to connect with his audiences. [1]  Chaucer did the same with Canterbury Tales. [2]  Of course we forget that now because we revere those authors as purveyors of great literature.<p><i>To call it a dialect may be technically correct, if you're merely arguing semantics.  However to accept it as a legitimate dialect is another thing.  If your child spoke that way you would constantly correct them, for their own good.</i><p>Matt, I'm a young, intelligent, black male in America: I would never let my kids grow up speaking AAVE exclusively.  Trust me.  But neither I nor the author are arguing the prestige of the dialect.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare%27s_influence",

There is no right or wrong language. If you are communicating you're doing it right. 2) Most all societies have a ""high"" language and a ""low"" language. Sometimes there are multiple layers. People who want to move in better circles learn to conform and work fluently in the ""high"" language.<p>The continuum question was especially interesting. Is Old French just bad Latin? Or is it a different language? What about those languages that have one spoken form and two written forms? The same language with different names because of political considerations? Lots of neat history and trivia here. I really enjoyed the series.",1259288520.0
