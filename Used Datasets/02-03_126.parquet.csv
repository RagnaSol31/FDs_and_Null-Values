Query groups of two to three words in a search engine and look at the word count.  Then replace the word in question with other words that are similarly spelled and run a query with each.  The word with the highest result count is extremely likely to be the correct word.  Really, it's surprising how accurate it is.<p>The glory of this is that it works with proper nouns that don't occur in dictionaries (IE: xkcd).  In Google's initial demo for Wave, they showed ""Icland is an icland"" be corrected to ""Iceland is an island.""  I'm fairly confident they took a similar approach.  There's also a good chance it could work for other languages, because it doesn't use anything specific to English.<p>The disappointing part is that most of the accomplishment comes in ""Suggestion Intelligence First,"" meaning that from a list of 5, the top result is the correct result.

How responsive are the startup founders when I e-mail\n     them about problems?\n\n  2. How portable is the work I'm going to put into the \n     site? Data portability is actually probably my number \n     1 concern.\n\n  3. Does the service give me value that I couldn't \n     create with my own server after an hour of coding? \n     (Why would I sign up for yet another contacts service \n     when I can host my own LDAP server for free?)\n\n  4. Is there a vibrant community supporting the startup \n     from the get to?\n</code></pre>\nAt least these are the first that come to mind.,1292551231.0
