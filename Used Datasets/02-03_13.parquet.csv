I have my blog at a standard domain name, www.charlesju.com, and I have that domain name go straight to my blogger account. I think Blogger really provides everything you need for a good blog:<p>1. Analytics through Google Analytics\n2. Some extra $$$ through AdSense\n3. Auto-saving editing for blog posts<p>I just go tired of having to constantly worry about upgrading my Wordpress plug-in or making sure I pay for hosting and all that jazz, I'd rather just let Google take care of that stuff for me.",1224557933

Look no further than Facebook, a company with a multi-billion dollar valuation, negative revenues, and no business model in sight.  CEO Zuckerburg says that for the next few years he is more worried about growth than turning a profit...well he can say that because he has a healthy cash reserve and therefore the time to come up with a business model.  So for at least 3 more years their plan is to lose 50+ mil a year while they come up with a way to make it all back.  This is an example Google set that everyone else seems to be content to follow.  That is why fb's valuation really irks me.<p>Even though Facebook is arguably the premiere social networking site in the world they have been unable to figure out how to make money.  It is one of the big questions in the Web 2.0 world, especially with social networking- we have users, now what?<p>Ironically, I think part of the reason they are so popular is because they have no business model.  Like many popular web sites, users can get a whole lot of value for free.  The magic advertising pixie dust dollars are disappearing fast, so relying purely on serving ads is no longer viable (unless you are Google).  Running a simple web forum with a lot of users is one thing, but the magnitude of data being shared on Facebook is unprecedented really, and arguably should not be free.",1224557685

So, it is more like putting off the opportunity of making $300,000 now by three years.

Gates, while aging, is a powerful and loud person when it comes to the use of technology in a modern society.  He understands not only the needs but the potential for technology in our world.

How exciting! I'm always so happy when we finally give power to a single individual to let us know the best way to spend other people's money. Life is so complicated with people arguing over better ways to do things with their products and services and all that rubbish. I'm genuinely looking forward to VictoryOS and the new VictoryBook laptop that the Ministry of Technology has in store for us. They will likely be leagues ahead of all the other horribly sub-par technologies we're forced to put up with today.<p>Personally, I think our new Chief Tyranny Officer should be someone who has the following qualities:<p><pre><code>  - extensive experience forcing other people to do their bidding\n  - no regard for civil liberties\n  - a deeply flawed understanding of technology\n  - passionate interest in maintaining and extending her power\n  - desire to get filthy rich by propping up companies and providing subsidies to suffering industries\n</code></pre>\nWell I guess we can just put about every name of Congress and the Senate in a hat. In fact let me just reflect that it is truly amazing to think that we live in a time when almost all our representatives share such patriotic qualities. 2009 is going to be great!",1224556904
