I expect that there would be significantly more discussion, and reviews, of papers in the future if there was a credit system that allowed people to get credit for reviews and comments they made of papers. I think that credit system is possible and will be built.<p>There is an interesting question regarding the immutability of content. Right now, once you publish a paper, you can't edit it, or delete it. It's an immutable piece of content. Before the web was established, there was a line of thinking, developed by Ted Nelson, according to which the internet should evolve like that, and that a link should always work: once some content is posted, it can never be taken down. Most people are probably glad that the web developed along the lines of Tim Berners Lee's thinking, rather than Ted Nelson's, and that they are now free to edit and delete content they have posted. I think similarly people would appreciate being able to update a paper in response to a comment they have received.

Just the mere comment that a watchdog ""is very low load on the system"" is a disturbing comment to me.  It's a signal you think that the watchdog need not be very accurate and that you can slip a few milliseconds.  Simply not true.  When you miss your timing things stop working.  Your hardware reboots itself if the watchdog isn't kicked on time, you wind up with bus errors on a vehicle network if you don't send the LIN break signal precisely on time or you're preempted when you've sent the break and now you're breaks are too long.

I'm sure there are sensors that operate at even higher frequencies if need be. The GPS module doesn't have to be updated too fast (maybe 10 Hz?) because it only serves to correct for horizontal drift.<p>I run the 100 Hz flight control loop for my tricopter on an ATmega1280 clocked at 16 MHz. A _lot_ more could be done with something like the Beagleboard, including generating a 3D map of the surroundings if I mounted a Kinect on it.<p>I want to agree about the decentralized operation because there would be so many wireless signals that could interfere, but those guys seem to be controlling 20 quadrotors without problems. I know XBees can be configured to communicate on different channels, but decentralized operation will most likely require something beefier like wifi (and that, I don't know how to configure to work over so many different channels).",1328495498

Jelly Gamat ini merupakan pengobatan herbal, sehingga aman di konsumsi dan tidak menimbulkan efek samping.\nMengapa Pengobatan Alami Diabetes Dengan Jelly Gamat?<p>seperti yang kita ketahui sebelumnya, jelly gamat ini terbuat dari ektra teripang pilihan yang di olah secara modern dan telah tebukti secara klinis sembuhkan penyakit diabetes mellitus. Menurut Dr.Ir.M. Ahkam Subroto, M.App.Sc., Periset Bioteknolog LIPI, kandungan protein tinggi pada teripang yang mencapai 82%, baik diberikan kepada penderita diabetes. Protein tinggi berperan meregenerasi sel beta pankreas yang memproduksi insulin. Hasilnya, produksi insulin meningkat. (Trubus 441, Agustus 2006, halaman 109). Dari penelitian juga terbukti bahwa teripang/gamat memiliki kandungan Cell Growth Factor (faktor regenerasi sel) sehingga mampu merangsang regenerasi/pemulihan sel dan jaringan tubuh manusia yang telah rusak/sakit bahkan membusuk, sehingga menjadi sehat/pulih kembali. Contoh yang mudah misalnya pada kasus penderita diabetes melitus. Selain diminum, gamat juga dioleskan pada luka yang sudah membusuk, bahkan hampir diamputasi. Ternyata, Cell Growth Factor mampu bekerja dengan baik sehingga luka menjadi pulih dengan cepat.\nKandungan kromium teripang juga membantu kinerja insulin untuk menurunkan diabetes. Caranya melalui penyerapan glukosa berlebih dalam darah dan menyedot glukosa masuk jaringan darah lebih cepat. Ini menyebabkan konsumsi teripang mencegah serta memulihkan penyakit diabetes mellitus. Itu sebabnya penyakit gula tinggi Suharmen lenyap dan pembusukan paru-paru terhambat. Gamat kemudian meregenerasi sel paru-paru sehingga penyakitnya pulih, walau membutuhkan waktu 2 tahun. Banyak orang yang telah membuktikan akan khasiat dari pengobatan alami diabetes dengan jelly gamat. Untuk pemesanan silahkan klik cara pemesanan obat jelly gamat",1328495326
