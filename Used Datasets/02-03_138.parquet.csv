But how large is the net positive effect?<p>Think about the difference search engines can make to finding information.  Without the web and search engines, how can you find information on a topic?  You have to go to a local library - hit or miss on what information you'll find, especially for something obscure, or find some magazines or a book on the topic, or maybe find an expert who's willing to explain it to you.<p>Think of the difference social networks can make for keeping in touch with people.  Without social networks, you have to remember to send them an email to see what's up, maybe pick up the phone now and then and give someone a call, meet up at a pub now and then, send a card for Christmas.<p>Now, to me both are incredibly convenient services, but by FAR only one can be described as world-changing.",1288580302.0

Less often are we asked to automate a known prediction and more often we are asked to cluster, characterize and segment wild data. In my opinion the hard problem in machine learning has moved from prediction to characterization.""<p>I would say instead we are in the age of Discovery. The hard problem is discovering causes that give rise to coherency in large sets of real world data.<p>As to whether we are in the age of large computers, the classification is irrelevant. We are in the age of sufficiently large computers. There is sufficient power and scale to accomplish everything that the brain does with our current infrastructure. Is it highly inefficient on a watt/thought basis? Yes. But that's a secondary metric.<p>To address the concerns the author outlines:<p>Dealing with lack of training data - when you move to discovery labeled data is far less relevant, which should relieve research assistants who are currently being asked to label images as cat/not-cat.<p>Dealing with large sets of unstructured data - this is a processing problem for which the current infrastructure is sufficient.<p>IMO we have plenty of data, we don't need many more labels, and we have sufficient processing power. That leaves algorithmic work for the discovery of causes.  (My bet is on systems similar to the kind of sparse distributed hierarchical models that Numenta is working on.)<p>One thing that I don't think most people have realized is how far past the quantity of data and processing power we need we already are.<p>If you were to take all the visual information the brain receives in the first 30 years of life (plenty of time to become intelligent) you'd arrive at a number around 1.4 petabytes. This is hardly a large number compared to the amount of information processed by YouTube on a monthly basis. Hearing, taste, and smell all add in a fraction more, and touch (well I don't have any good numbers there yet).<p>The hard part now is going to be convincing machine learning researchers to actually expose their algorithms to a swath of data similar to the inputs we humans get, over sufficient time, so as to allow for the development of a robust hiearchy of stored causes (aka understanding.)<p>AFAICT - Experience <i>is</i> understanding.",1288579480.0

The movie, whether you like it or not, raises some valid points, and I think calling the whole system a debt-money system is a good thing, at least it raises awareness about it's nature. Most people don't have the slightest clue how money is made.<p>Not only that; but I think it's more accurate, factual, and honest to call it debt-money rather than ""fractional reserve banking"". Fractional reserve can have a different meaning: it could mean you lend out most of what people entrust you with. That would still be a fractional reserve, because you're only keeping a fraction of what's in your trust.<p>> but just like real hacking, there's another side.

Chances are, having a six year history of being an intern there (which is, btw, an extremely long time to be an intern in my opinion), just getting a different title will not make people treat you any different than they have up to now. Did they offer you a single raise in six years? If not, they don't see any value in you that is specific to you, rather, you are easily replaceable. We've had interns at companies I worked for before, and they all either moved on after six months to a year, or got hired full time. Not a single one has stayed an intern for six years.<p>I'd strongly suggest looking for new positions for multiple reasons.<p>1. You will have a clean slate and can grow as fast as you want, without the history of being the eternal intern.<p>2. You will get experience interviewing and talking to different kinds of companies and teams.<p>3. You will almost certainly get paid considerably more than you are now.<p>4. You will almost certainly find a position doing work that is more interesting/rewarding than dumb copy and paste grunt work.<p>That being said, if you like the company, like the team, and/or like the work, definitely talk to them first. Ask for a competitive salary (do some research of what the position you are being hired for normally pays). Ask what kind of benefits they offer. If they really want you to stay on, they should have no problem offering you a decent rate.<p>I wouldn't worry about staying unemployed. Engineers tend to take their skills for granted and not realize how valuable they actually are. You can always find freelance work if you work on it, and despite the economy, the hiring in IT sector is not slowing down as far as I can see. If you are bright and good at what you do, many companies will even pay for relocation if you are not local.<p>You are young and just finishing college, this is the best time to take these kinds of risks. You'll have a much harder time deciding to join a startup or quitting an unsatisfying job if you have a family to support.<p>Companies that truly value you, will want you to be engaged and fascinated by the work you're doing - that is how you get the best work from the engineers and they know it. Companies that don't understand that, end up with teams of unhappy engineers. In some companies, you can transfer to a different team, work on new projects, and find new interests - other companies have a set hole for you to fill, and if you are not happy being a cog, you are stuck.<p>In the end, ask yourself whether you feel like you are growing and learning anything from the work you are doing and the team you are working with. If you are stagnating, it's time to either change your position in the company if they are simply not utilizing your potential, or look for a different company if they have no work for you that challenges you.",1288577298.0
