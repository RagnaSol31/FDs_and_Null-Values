I'm afraid it's not that simple, though. IANAL, much less a constitutional lawyer, but I'll play devil's advocate and look at a possible rebuttal by the communications industry:<p>""The existing industries provide a time-tested way of asserting artists' rights (which itself promotes the progress of 'useful Arts'), by way of providing a stable system for the collection of royalties, and preventing distribution of materials, when such distribution is not desired by rights holders. An entity which seeks to interrupt the continued operation of this stable system could plausibly <i>reduce</i> the security upon which rights holders have come to rely. Therefore, Congress is within its rights to <i>ensure the survival</i> of this system as a means of implementing Article I section 8.""<p>So it's not an open-shut case. The argument would have to be made that ""disrupting the progress"" of communications innovators, does more harm than ensuring the security of existing rights holders does good. I think everyone reading this site believes that, but I'm afraid it might not hold up legally.",1349058393

They will know that they are doing a dangerous thing.<p>The idea with bike-share programs is to get people using shared bikes to move around a city instead of either public transport or private cars.  If carrying your own helmet (or using a publicly shared-helmet) is a requirement, fewer people are going to use the bike-sharing.<p>This is a simple argument about the increased use of bike sharing programs against the increased number of people with head injuries from that bike sharing program.  I don't know what those numbers are, but it would mean higher head injuries but also higher bicycle use.  The number of head injuries can only be measured by the set of people who chose to ride the bike without a helmet, who had an accident and hit their head.  Some people (regular users, for example) would choose to still use helmets when riding bike sharing, so it's not like removing the law will mean nobody wears a helmet anymore.  At the margin there will be more injuries, but also more bike-miles ridden.  It's up to people to make a decision which is more desirable.<p>It might sound like a tough decision, but really, this type of decision is everywhere.  Speed limits are set with the balance of people who will be injured or killed in more serious accidents, balanced with the ability for more people to get to their destination more quickly.",1349058373

It'd be merely crappy if zooming required vertical scrolling. It's disabling all methods of vertical scrolling entirely that really make this design special.<p>It replaces normal page navigation with a custom version, which is already bad. They then compound that error by mapping that custom navigation to the wrong keys. An example: maybe you'd like to check one of the footnotes they have. In a sensible design those would be hyperlinks, but for whatever reason that wasn't done. Ok, so I guess you need to go to the end of the document to see the footnotes. Wouldn't still be too bad, but they forgot to map the ""End"" key. So the only way to get to the end of the document is with the slider. And after doing that, how do you return to the original position? Well, I'd expect to be able to do Alt-Left for that. Except that this keybinding has been overridden too, and you need to instead click on the back button.<p>Doing this kind of stuff might be just about acceptable in a web app. But this isn't an app. It's a document. And they've managed to break the only two things that matter for a document. I need to be able to read it, and I need to be able to navigate it.",1349057019
