From the tutorial:<p><i>Many programming tutorials either gloss over the command line or assume you already know it. But understanding the basics of the command line is absolutely essential to becoming a skilled developer. Indeed, if you look at the desktop of an experienced computer programmer, even on a system with a polished graphical user interface like Macintosh OS X, you are likely to find a large number of “terminal windows”, each containing a series of commands at a command line (Figure 1). Proficiency at the command line is also useful for anyone who needs to work with developers, such as product managers, project managers, and designers.
