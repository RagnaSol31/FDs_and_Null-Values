I understand that is just being parasitic, but it is free after all- why pay for it? So, I think Linux is strong and will be strong with or without RH. Sure it's great that they provide a major paid option for customers that feel like they have to pay something, but I don't respect any tech company that pays for Linux because they feel they need to just to have the support. If they like the distribution and want to support them, fine. But, don't do it because you feel that you have to have support.<p>Also, I interviewed for RH several years ago and was not impressed. Their employees seemed fairly unmotivated, and despite the number of people I interviewed with, it didn't seem very well thought out. I didn't like their distro at that point, so it was a bad idea in hindsight to interview with them. I just didn't believe in RH anymore, and going there only solidified that.",1333421692.0

But I don't agree with the latter part of your comment on principle: not everything that is <i>legal</i> is a good idea or something we should cheer. I think there is a general ethical requirement to give something back to people who got you where you are, even if you aren't legally obligated to do so. (And RedHat does in fact do so.)<p>Things actually work better in the case where there's an ethical but not legally codified understanding, imo, enforced informally through community pressure rather than lawsuits. If you try to add it into legal obligations, complex licenses start piling up; the old BSD advertising clause, for example, was an attempt to turn the ethical principle of ""you should prominently acknowledge the work you built on"" into a legally enforceable license, which in retrospect most people agree was misguided. But you should still prominently acknowledge the work you built on, anyway, and it's fair to call people out on it if they aren't giving sufficient credit.

It is _not_ to find out whether the employee will be any good - that can only be determined by observing the employee in your new workplace for some probationary period.<p>The hiring decision is traditionally made on the strength of a hiring-manager's conviction and only the hiring manager - the interview pool can inform, but never make a decision.  I've seen many situations in which the entire interview group  said no to an individual who was hired, and became a star player.  I've also seen scenarios where everyone said yes, and the employee was terminated for non performance within a year.<p>The interview is just a numbskull filter - you usually can't identify great people, but usually (particularly for technical positions) - you can eliminate the people who don't know anything.<p>So, what then, is the purpose of the ""Reference Check"" - it's to determine if this employee you are hiring burned down, assaulted, or otherwise was convicted of some horrible crime at a previous company.  In general, with larger corporations, all you'll ever get out of them was ""He was an employee from XXX to YYY in the position of ZZZ"" - but, if he was terminated for killing a coworker, you might discover he was terminated for cause.  (unclear whether they'll tell you _what_ cause, but do you really need to know?)<p>I've done over a 100 reference checks for employees - and, over time, I've realized that's all I'll ever get.

You just can't do the same with Windows. You have to download every part's driver and install them one by one before you got something working. Linux distros have come a long way and now they are simply amazingly easy to setup.",1333418551.0
