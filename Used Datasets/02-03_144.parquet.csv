29,3092073,comment,3091616.0,3091999.0,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>1. I am saying you should only do great things.</i><p>I disagree. Most of the things you'll be expected to do are not great and to attempt to do great work will actually get you in trouble. You'll get into personality conflicts with people who don't care as much as you do, and your pace of work will be considered slow.<p>It usually demands 3 times as much time and 10 times as much energy to do a great job of something than a passable job. Sometimes, a passable job is enough and more is wasted effort. People who have to do a great job of everything they are asked to do end up getting asked to do a lot of things, some unrewarding, and eventually burn out because they just can't do everything that people want done.<p>Example of minimal effort being ideal: your boss says you need to be in at work at 9:00 am, even though there's no hard reason (it's just a demonstration of power). Let's say your commute is under 40 minutes 98% of the time. A passable job would be to leave at 8:20 and be on time almost every day, and average 8:40-8:50. You won't get yelled at for being a few minutes late once every couple of months. The ""great job"" would be to leave for work at 7:30 and arrive at 7:50-8:10, when no one is in the office, thereby ensuring that (unless something very unusual happens) you'll never be late. Does this extra effort really win you anything? Is it more rewarded to be an hour early than on time? In most cases, no.<p>You need 3 ""buckets"" for your projects. A: things where you'll do a great job. B: things you'll do just well enough to satisfy the minimum demands. C: things you won't do. If your A bucket is empty, you'll probably get bored and start itching for a side project, but you do not have the time to put everything in your A bucket and will burn out if you try. Generally, you end up splitting the things you have to do (your paid job) between A and B and your personal side projects between A and C (i.e. either doing a great job, or not doing them).",1318214776.0

Not in the least. I'm all for more moderate formulations of that, such as ""pay attention to what you want, not what others expect of you"" and ""value your integrity and creative freedom highly; money and esteem are unimportant in comparison"". I can get behind those ideals. I do not think it is responsible to tell young people that when they are adults they will be able to define their role in society and have society say, ""OK, sounds good, and here's the money to pay your bills"". It don't work that way.<p>We have a generation of neurotic, emotionally stunted, psychological cripples in this country, and one reason for that is that we've had 40+ years of kids being told they could be whatever they wanted, only to reach bitter disappointment in adulthood upon discovering reality. Which means that normal lives feel like abject failure to them. If they grew up with lower expectations, they might not be so miserable.<p>Our parents weren't told this shit, because our grandparents grew up in the fucking Great Depression and knew better.<p>Every time you tell a kid, ""You can be whatever you want to be"", you're setting him up for despair if he ends up in an average job and social position. You're better off telling him that life is hard and full of compromises and that most of whether he succeeds or not is out of his control, so he should focus on the 1% he can actually control. I am all for inspiring people to do work they love instead of the work that is best-paid or most esteemed, but they need to be prepared for sacrifice.<p><i>I don't understand how someone's age precludes them from following their dreams.</i><p>Like it or not-- and I'm definitely in the ""not"" camp because I think it's disgusting-- in the work world people are judged on where they got to at what age.

First you have to quote the attributes (or put a : in front of them?), yuck. you need to use the => operator which is two times too big, and whats with the unnecessary outer braces?<p>non-idiomatic hamlet isn't far from that haml snippet (note you would never put bits of urls in the template as strings, instead you provide a url rendering function which converts the @{} bits into url strings):<p><pre><code>    <",

For example, that it's ""ludicrous"" for him to gain muscle with so little gym time is not responsive to the argument that not allowing muscles time to recover retards growth.<p>Moreover, I think it's a misinterpretation to say that Tim is promising people, say, 2 hours of sleep per day by reading his book. His book is a documentation of experimentation by himself and others, and especially for sleep is partly theoretical. But his analysis on how to cut sleep time is still helpful, especially given the scheduling constraints Ferris recognizes for a 2 hour sleep schedule.",1318212086.0
