The very very low end of what I've saw is $45k+. I've heard of offers of over 100k for really talented graduates.<p>I asked around in Hong Kong, and graduates there are only offered around HKD$15000 a month. That is only $25k per year.<p>I haven't mentioned the long working hours, expensive rent, and relatively expensive cost of living compared to the salary.",1326161063.0
