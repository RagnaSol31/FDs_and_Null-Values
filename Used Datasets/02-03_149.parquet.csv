This also gets around the screen suid root issue (though not necessarily the config issue), if you're both logged in as the same user. How has this been working, any caveats?<p>I'm not sure why you need to set suid on tmux. Before we created the pair user I just used the -S option to specify a socket path and then chmoded the created socket so my pair could access it.<p>So far so good with the new pair user. The only thing that's different is that to push our changes up to the main repo we need ssh keys and we haven't gone through the trouble of creating a new ssh key for the pair user and adding it to our teams github repo, so we have to git push and pull from a non-pair login. That can be fixed when it gets annoying but so far I'm always logged in to that machine as myself as well as the pair user so I can just switch tabs and git push/pull when needed.<p>> I use ` instead of C-a/C-b in both screen and tmux, so it could be a bit jarring to others.<p>I use C-\ myself since C-a and C-b are both prominent Emacs keys.",1334113164.0

17,3825697,comment,3822314.0,3825251.0,1,0,turar,,,"Look, I totally get the debt part of the valuation, and what enterprise value is. I also completely understand that enterprise value is an important measure of valuation. All I'm saying is that using market cap to indicate the value of the company is not that misleading either. Enterprise value is just one way to value a business, there are others. It's not precise science.<p>So in your latest example, and also throughout the thread, you're confusing (or using interchangeably) the concrete sale price and a fuzzy intrinsic value. Why would the buyer of your business pay $300K upfront? All other things being equal, the sale price of the business would still be $60k, and they can be paying off debt for the next 15 years for all I know. The conventional media-reported value of the business would still be $60K, and it won't be very misleading.<p>In addition, not all debt is created equal. A company like Google can probably easily get, say 1B of super cheap debt on favorable terms, while something like Barnes & Noble would barely get the same 1B at much higher interest rates and repayment schedules. It's still 1B in enterprise value, but it's clearly not the same debt.<p>You also mentioned cash flows. So to continue with your example, if your business is actually losing money hand over fist, and has negative cash flow on top of $240K of debt, what do you think its value would be? Would it be equal to your simple enterprise value formula? What if the same business is growing at 100% per quarter with super high operating margins? Enterprise value can be just as misleading.",1334112768.0

Can't have the population forgetting that the world out there is a scary place - think of the starving defense contractors!<p>If this is a precursor to any push for legislative changes (and increased enforcement powers) then the target is more likely non-state players and the likes of anonymous: Terrorist is a little overused these days and spy is the next best scary label.,1334109955.0

Filtering to 100 miles in distance still returns results that are significantly more than 100 miles away (results from IL when using a CA zip code).<p>It's interesting for a new site but not that useful for searching for vehicles yet as it probably needs more filters. For example, searching for a Ford F-150 returns a lot of results but someone buying an F-150 is probably going to have a specific subset in mind. Getting a ton of two wheel drive, standard cab with bench seat models when you want four wheel drive, king cab with bucket seats is going to be very frustrating.",1334109929.0

146,3825565,story,,,10,12,kuripyon,"Is there any interest in a ""hardware"" DCPU-16?",,"First post, so please bear with me...<p>I've been intently watching the development of Notch's 0x10^c, and more specifically the CPU that's emulated within the game. I suspect a number of other people feel similarly but it seems  like this could be an ""antidote"" to what another poster described a few days ago, the apparent lack of ""casual,"" ""for-fun"" programming as of late.<p>I work with FPGAs for a living, so of course when I saw the DCPU spec I thought ""I wonder how many LUTs it would take to synthesize this."" Unsurprisingly, in its present incarnation it really does not take too many and could easily be burnt into a tiny FPGA and deployed in a 48-pin DIP package (with necessary voltage regulators, caps, buffers etc on the same board).<p>So I'm curious - would this sort of thing be interesting to anyone except me? I'm thinking I would want to do the CPU, make sure it's user-updateable, then also develop a PPU/APU and memory mappers for a real ""retro-computing"" experience (I would want the PPU to output HDMI signals though... I'm not retro enough to want to feed it to a TV through an RF modulator^^)<p>What do you all think? Is this something that interests anyone else?",1334109653.0
