Key takeaway for me was the need for explicit sequencing of product market fit and growth hacking (i.e, don’t bother with growth hacking if you don’t have PM fit). I suppose it is obvious intuitively, but demonstrating PM fit via retention metrics (“make sure your retention flat lines at the appropriate level”) was an interesting take. It can be easy to create work and activity doing growth hacking creating an illusion of progress. Keeping PM fit/growth separate and sequenced is a good lesson.",1412907557.0
