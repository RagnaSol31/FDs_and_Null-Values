I've found it far more effective to do things like randomising form field names (instead of using names like 'username' and 'password') so the spammer has to scrape the site to figure out which fields he needs to submit for each and every account he registers, silently dumping registrations that don't use the correct field names, and then applying various heuristics to successful registrations to detect patterns common to spammers.<p>For instance, one particular spammer always seemed to use the same user agent string and didn't ever trigger any of the AJAX calls on the page. It was trivial to detect registrations coming from that one spammer and silently dump new accounts when he created them.",1343530757.0

6,4307361,comment,4305717.0,4307189.0,3,0,josephlord,,,If Samsung is asking everyone for the same absolute (not percentage) rate and isn't demanding cross licenses then Apple should have to pay that rate (assuming the patents are valid). I'm not sure that contradicts anything that I said.<p>I think Samsung can raise invalidity issues in the case before the judge/jury. If Apples patents are deemed invalid then they will get nothing.<p>The Apple patents that I'm aware of are fairly basic but can be worked around. E.g. by stopping scrolling dead at the end of the range and requiring something other than a swipe to unlock.<p>FRAND is a commitment made in standardisation to prevent the standards group from being an illegal cartel. That commitment should be kept. But a single company making a patented feature desirable would not trigger antitrust concerns in the general case so they wouldn't have needed to make an FRAND commitment. The potential exception would be for the Microsoft FAT patent because FAR is effectively a standard and while not created by a group of companies Microsoft was a monopolist. This is a rare case when I think FRAND may be appropriate rule for MS to adopt even if not legally require.<p>Yes the patent system is currently ridiculous and needs to grant far fewer but that is a complaint against the system which I would like to see reformed but you have to play by the rules in force. As I've said in a few posts I don't remember any tech giants (even Google and Samsung) campaigning against the patent system or even software patents. If the rules as they exist are enforced maybe that will change and the big players will want to change the system.,1343530554.0

So this programmer discards PHP and picks up another language and is all excited about this new world of doing things robustly!  ""I'm going to write the <i>best</i> UUID generator.  I'm going to unit test <i>every line</i> of the admin console.  I'm going to make an ORM that batches queries in the <i>most</i> efficient way.""

As if nobody can be productive with PHP or would choose it for a new project. Or that PHP doesn't have better practices than what the authors have experienced.<p>If you like Python, that's great. So do I. Just get over it, these threads are so lame.",1343527352.0

As I noted in another comment, Knuth's Pascal solution appears to be open to the same criticism.",1343527222.0
