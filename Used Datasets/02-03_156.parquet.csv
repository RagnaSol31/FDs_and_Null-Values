He can easily make the point that the main reason for the large cost is that he had a much smaller scope in head.  He might not understand that the project is larger than he thinks due to dependencies.

5,2141919,story,,,5,6,naithemilkman,Ask HN: Am I learning Python the right way?,,So I have some previous SQL experience but I don't think it counts for much. My objective is to eventually build a databound website using Python/Django by June this year.<p>What I have done so far:<p>1) Finished Learning Python the Hard Way<p>2) Went through the Django tutorial online. Realised I was still a long way off from trying to understand a Python framework and I wasn't grounded in the basics yet.<p>3) Did HeadFirst Python but stopped half way. Didn't like their approach. Thought their HTML/CSS series was better.<p>4) Spent the last week attempting to do exercises here: http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/PracticeOfComputingUsingPython/index.php. I found the site randomly. Found myself asking more questions on Stackoverflow after I couldn't find the solutions through googling.<p>5) Got stuck on one of the questions where I needed to access a specific value from the tuples inside my list. I realised that must be a really basic thing you have to know<p>6) Once again googled for it but found nothing. Posted the question on SO and getting flamed for asking a newbie question.<p>I think I'm doing this the wrong way. I like material/books that encourages hands-on participation rather than books that just 'talk at you'. Should I just read a whole bunch of them beginner books over and over again?<p>I'm pretty sure that I still wouldn't have found the answer to my question (use list comprehension) by doing so.<p>tl;dr: What's the best approach to learn python for a beginner?,1296010671.0

Finish at 9pm come back very early, etc. People have a life and sometimes families. Working 8 hours a day, is almost a crime, even if you only take 10 mins for the lunch. As the company is a family everybody gets to eat together frequently which means one hour lost, leave the job one hour later.<p>- A one man show: Usually you have to do everything depending on what's expected or how great you are.<p>- Poor recognition as in no real way to advance(cash, tasks, help by hiring new guys) even if the company becomes more profitable.<p>- Very short holidays sometimes 2 weeks max per year in some companies. For a very young guy it might not be a problem, but for someone with family in town and abroad it is an issue;<p>- Usually in a startup, you don't get to influence strategic discussions. For example, someone might think that some architecture needs some change to follow X or Y specification, but it doesn't matter to his boss ""Fake communication. Listen and execute"".<p>- Young startups often try to play psychologists as they tend to try to understand/predict/control everything around them, which is impossible.<p>- Often you need to cope with developers that were around, have influence and make poor decisions. As the new guy comes in, he's not involved in architecture decisions and need to fix trivial, annoying but silly errors for a while.<p>- Sometimes there are no meetings. The master plan is known only by the founders and there's nothing explained to the engineers.<p>- A startup doesn't usually encourage initiatives, new ideas, modern development practices.",1296008664.0
83,2141836,comment,2141562.0,2141562.0,0,0,callahad,,,"I have no doubt that you can get 11-14 year olds to understand Java's Hello World in a single hour, but understanding a pre-written snippet of code is a wholly different beast from being able to make appropriate predictions and inferences based on knowledge gleaned from that code.<p>Could your students explain how main() was called? Could they create their own functions and invoke them based on what they had learned? And how forgiving would Java be of minor errors, say, creating class a class named HelloWorld inside a file named Hello.java? Why does the filename even matter, if the class's name is defined right inside the file, or vice versa? And if the class is in a block inside the file, why can't they just create another block like the first one and have two classes in the same file? Why do they type 'javac HelloWorld.java', but not 'java HelloWorld.class'? How can java find the HelloWorld class if you're not pointing it to the class file? Why is 'javac' so damn picky about the file name matching the class name when you don't point 'java' to any files at all?<p>Seriously, there's a <i>ton</i> of voodoo in there. Things break in surprising ways, and it's hard to synthesize new knowledge based on prior experience.<p>Take Python, on the other hand. You can address things in a much more controlled order, with each step yielding practical information, starting with<p><pre><code>  print(""Hello, world"")\n</code></pre>\nwhich tells the students how to call a function, and pass it an argument. Every other time they call a function or pass it an argument will look like this. Then you can show them how to make their own function:<p><pre><code>  def hello():\n    print(""Hello, world"")\n</code></pre>\nBut nothing gets printed? Hey! You've just explained defining a function, and based on the previous example, they can probably suggest how to invoke hello(). At this point, they can easily make and call new functions of their own. Then you can go on to introduce the basics of OOP:<p><pre><code>  class Greeter():\n    def __init__(self, name):\n      self.name = name\n    \n    def say_hello(self):\n      print(""Hello, "" + self.name)\n</code></pre>\nSure, the ""self"" is a little magical there, but hey, you're comparing this to Java. Plus, you've got an interactive console that you can jump into and poke at the darn thing. Hey, what do I get when I say g = Greeter(""Saundby"")? Oh a ""Greeter object"". That makes sense. What can I do with it? Well, we made a say_hello, so what's g.say_hello? Oh, a ""method Greeter.say_hello of <Greeter object>."" And hey, it's the same Greeter object as g!<p>What if the students want to make a new class? They just put it in the same file, like you would expect. What if they want to rename the class? They just do it.<p>And you run it with ""python filename.py"" which appears to work exactly like how every other command that operates on files. There's no explicit compilation step to forget or trip over.<p>Yes, you can teach kids to read and understand a Java program, but what do you gain by handicapping yourself and foregoing the pedagogical tools, like an interactive console, available elsewhere? Similarly, what do they gain by being deprived of such a wonderful and frictionless means of exploring and experimenting with the language?",1296008630.0

In doing so you (probably subconsciously) reframe the question to something entirely different.<p>Professional ethics and personal morality are completely different things - just because you don't like one word doesn't mean you can substitute a different concept. For example: as a professional ethical standard, you must maintain client confidences, even if they tell you where the bodies are. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Garrow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Garrow</a>)<p>Most lawyers probably find that morally quite challenging, but are ethically obliged to do so.<p>Similar to the cab-rank principle - you might not want to act for a paedophile, wife beater or the RIAA, however in most common law systems a barrister is obliged to do so.<p>(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cab-rank_rule"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cab-rank_rule</a>)",1296007488.0

The name you drew was your target.  When you made a ""kill"", the person who was eliminated gave you the name they'd drawn and that person was your next target.  The game proceeded until only one person remained.<p>It turned out to be considerably more dangerous than expected.  Entertech motorized squirt guns were popular at the time.  They were made of all black plastic and looked very much like real automatic submachine pistols from a distance.  Players in the game liked them because they could fire a nearly continuous stream of water and they had good range.  Unfortunately, because they looked so realistic, misunderstandings occasionally happened and a player of the game could find themselves staring down the barrel of real policeman's very real loaded weapon.",1296007319.0
