I’m speaking in the abstract here. If harassers know that ex-employees might be willing to speak out against them they might be less likely to do it in the future. It’s pretty simple. That’s pretty much how societal change works.<p>That’s also why one person doing it is not enough.,1394938793.0

6,7407586,story,,,2,3,lgp171188,Ask HN: HP makes its laptop unusable on removing OEM installed Windows,,"My wife has a HP Pavilion G4 1201tx laptop which came with Windows 7 Home Basic and a lot of crapware installed by default. Over time with a lot of usage, the computer with 4 GB RAM and i5 processor became slow as hell. So I purchased a copy of Windows 7 and tried to install it after erasing the existing Windows installation. There were 4 primary partitions on the laptop already - 1 system reserved partition, 1 partition for C: drive, 1 partition for HP Tools and the final one for recovery. Since I was going to do fresh installation, I wanted to delete all those partitions and have a clean layout. I tried to delete the 100 MB system reserved partition and the installer hung trying to do that. I rebooted and started the installer again and it was stuck at the &quot;Starting Windows&quot; screen forever. Confused by what was happening, I tried to boot with Ubuntu Live CD, GParted Live CD and as well as Debian installation CD. All of them faced some out of memory error and ran into a kernel panic. Surprising because, they were all working fine before I tried to delete the system reserved partition. So I went to ",
