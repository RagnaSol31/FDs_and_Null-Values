Basically what we could already do in 1996 but using more resources and full of ads and other distractions. And yet to many people this step backwards represents state of the art computing. ""Productivity"" is highly overrated. Computers are already extremely useful without a bunch of gimmicks. Most of the Web 2.0 companies are creating the desire for their own product. Facebook has turned family photo sharing into a circus show. It doesn't serve any need other than to push for more neomaniacal computerisation. Some people will want to share family photos over the web. We can do that with very simple software. It can even be loaded on demand and sandboxed without any configuration without a hugely complex platform. _Simple_ virtual machines capable of this kind of work aren't hard to construct. But people keep chasing idiotic benchmarks instead. And if it's too slow then change the hardware to make sandboxing easier.",1332125815.0

It turns out that the way randomization was done differed across countries. Detection of what procedures were done differed across groups. Treatment also differed across groups: for those randomized to screening, treatment was at major academic centers, suggesting that they may have had better care. I would think that this would make it more likely to cause a false rejection of the null hypothesis re: all-cause mortality, so I don't think it calls into question that part of the study. But it does trigger some concerns re: study design. A related editorial in the NEJM raises some of the points, too.",1332125740.0

I currently have about 6 tmux tabs open, each split with various windows.  Some will have vim inside, and vim will have it's own windows and tabs separate from tmux. It sounds confusing, but it's actually very simple to keep everything straight.<p>My tmux tabs are all named for their purpose.  So, if I'm working on different areas in a project, I can easily move to that area and focus on that.<p>tmux also supports having different sessions.  So, I can open one session, and if I have to move to a completely different project, I can open up a session for that.<p>As for file access, their are numerous plugins for vim that accomplish that.  I think they are NerdTree and something else I can't remember?  Not sure, I don't use them.  With tmux, I can have a pane opened up and just use the command line to see everything.<p>But as for seeing what you have open, tmux and vim give you numerous ways to do this, as well as move through all those screens, easily in many different ways, far easier than any IDE I've ever seen.",1332125658.0

It's fantastic for reproducible performance, but it's a specialized environment and people want to do things like run Python (as ""glue"" for some scientific applications) which needs dynamic loading. Since <i>all</i> IO is exported to separate IO nodes, and due to file system consistency semantics, dynamic loading is a tremendous bottleneck. This has escalated to the point where people burn a quarter million core hours to load Python (plus C extension modules) once on a large machine. To really solve the scalability problem, we needed to make dlopen() avoid touching the file system (by patching ld.so and implementing the POSIX file API with collective semantics served over the fast network).<p>The point here is that there are good reasons to want to use different systems together and then you end up putting in lot of effort working around the limitations of the specialized environments.",1332122703.0

If there were some way of monetizing this digital content that did not benefit only a few well-positioned social networking hubs and that did not require draconian intellectual property legislation (which mainly benefits a few monopolists), then there might be some hope.",1332122650.0

So a given satellite in orbit does not necessarily need to pass over the United States. This is why you have to get on your roof and point the dish at some magical place in the sky. You're pointing it at the satellite,1332122473.0

Some of the problems don't carry over (the ones about the audience as a mass), but some do (sentences going by like a stream neither the speaker nor the listener can as easily go back and forth over). I feel we're losing something from when a book was the way to reach an audience, and we could add the interactivity and a lot of the other new advantages without losing the benefits of text.<p>Funny how that line about ""The moving finger, having writ"" has it backwards now with text easier to revise than speech.
