It's not up to date for Leopard (which is why I didn't mention it before), but the option is there: <a href=""http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/bootstrap-macos.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/bootstrap-ma...</a> - Though it requires slightly more then basic knowledge of a Bash (or $insertYourPreferredShell) to set up.  There's also way's to use rpm5's on OS X - And there's patches to get dpkg working on OS X if you fancy apt.<p>But, again: <i>Mac OS X is not Linux</i>. Setting Portage up is a huge hack to hold things together though. So if you have the time to set a .deb or .rpm-based system up, you should really just get a Linux box to use instead and then take the time you saved and do something productive.

Two people with BSCS degrees from the same institution may have vastly different levels of ability and accomplishment.<p>3. There exists a spectrum from EECS majors who can write any program and build the computer to run it, down to BACS who can code a form in VB if someone sets up their IDE for them.<p>4. Because the demand for competent programmers is so strong, smart people who trained in many fields find employment as programmers and often do better than those trained.<p>5.

Computing is so ubiquitous (and also the cause of lots of frustration for some people) that those who drive the field don't get the recognition they deserve.  Maybe the whole startup culture will change this, since the risk and self determination gives it more of a romantic flair.<p>At any rate, quitting, or even moderation, may not truly solve things if a person has a very deep love for their work.

There will come a point where to improve the lot of programmers the industry will welcome regulation and certification.<p>They will grandfather in the self taught but slam the door shut on those coming in later.
