If so, have you tried going to any?<p>Two years ago, I was a guy with a business degree and some open source web apps, but no official programming experience. I started going to meetups, and ended up meeting the CTO of a really interesting company at one of them. We had a good chat, I showed my open source apps, and I've now been working there as a developer for a year now.<p>So, I think the takeaway is...you might have more luck with a bit of social engineering than by just applying for job openings.

He didn't throw up a landing page with a coming soon graphic. He didn't validate the concept with Google Ads. He didn't impress investors, or even customers. In fact it's likely that no one would have ever invested in the concept.<p>He created something that, based on his experience and judgment, that he thought users needed. Turns out he was right.<p>Maybe this kind of inspiration isn't productizable, which is why SV shies away from it. But is there no room for this sort of thinking? Even Google began in an academic environment, not in the business world. It seems to me that entrepreneur-thinking can get you only so far.

I had to work around a lot of things with model binding and routing to come up with my solution, and even after that, I still find it kind of hacky. In addition to that,  IIS fights you at several points along the way, for example by adding spurious HTTP headers or doing things like automatically redirecting certain status codes.<p>With a framework likes rails, this is baked right in. With the PHP framework I used to use, the framework was so transparent and lightweight that it was trivial to bend it to my whim.<p>A lot of this was exacerbated by the fact that it was much harder than it should be to set up my project to use the source code for the framework that it should be. In thoery, you just grab the project from MS, add it to your solution and change some references, but in practice, if you're using any other libraries that were built against the DLL from Microsoft, you run into issues, because the MS DLL is signed, and the DLL you build from source is not.",1310611363.0

I was pretty skeptical about the prospect of writing in Java and having it compiled to Javascript being a viable way to create a web app.<p>Fast forward almost a year, and I've built a complex user-facing app for my company using custom CSS styled components and HTML5. I was worried about GWT being a leaky abstraction, but thus far it has, for the most part, just worked.<p>The biggest win for me isn't even the Java to JavaScript compiled. UiBinder has ended up being a great way to design custom widgets using html and css, and having them be easily reusable throughout the app.<p>So, while GWT <i>can</i> be used by Java devs to avoid having to learn much about HTML and CSS, using it this way results in missing out on a ton of its potential. In the hands of the right developers, it can be quite a good tool for creating great looking, complex client-side apps.<p>I realize some people hate Java with a passion, but I've found that the non-enterprisy style of Java I use when writing GWT apps isn't painful at all.",1310610568.0

There's the go-big-go-home crowd, the facebooks and groupons and squares and so forth.  There's the ramen profitable crowd that operate like typical small businesses: the fog creeks and the like.  Then there's the flippers.<p>We all know the story of the Go Big or Go Home guys; they've been a part of the SV psyche for decades.  Similarly, the ramen profitables/small businesses are pretty standard.  My uncle started a small game development house about a decade ago that makes FPS training programs for service rigs in the oil industry.[1]  It's a new take on a very old business model, and while they make a very comfortable living they're under no illusions of a $40MM buyout.  They expect to be doing roughly the same thing ten years from now that they were ten years ago.<p>Compare the above with flippers.  We have founders who come up with an idea for a cool, if maybe gimmicky app.  They build it; it's flashy and does something interesting.  They iterate, pivot, and find a userbase.  Then they sell to Google/Apple/Microsoft/whoever.  Now, there's nothing wrong with this <i>per se</i>.  The issue that the author and I both have is that this appears to have been the plan all along. There appears to be no <i>desire</i> on the part of the founders to build a business, rather they're spending a couple years on a fancy tech demo in the hopes of landing a sweet job with a fat signing bonus.  It's almost like a practicum as opposed to a business, something that you do for a few years after college so you can get a better job.  The defining question for me is this: how many of the founders would be happy if in 10 years their company had experienced healthy growth and they had 15-30 employees, taking home $300k/year?  Alternatively, how many are shooting for an IPO and a company that will still be around in 50 years?<p>I'm not saying flipping a small startup is a bad idea, just that it feels a bit disingenuous to call these ventures businesses.  They feel more like a graduate degree combined with an innovative investment engine.  And, while I understand why you took umbrage at the author singling out YC, these ventures are exactly the kinds of startups that YC churns out.<p>[1]Shout out: <a href=""http://cooleimmersive.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cooleimmersive.com/</a>",1310609276.0

Instead, I expect something like the following<p>1. Google+ APIs are released.<p>2. Developers add Google+ support to their Twitter apps (the way some apps have Facebook support). Beyond directly improving their apps, developers may have some extra motivation to do this because of the state of Twitter's developer relationships.<p>3. Google+ support in Twitter apps will accelerate the movement of <i>users</i> / conversations (not developers) from Twitter to Google+ that mikecane has already documented.<p>4. I can't see a viable countermove that Twitter could make, so the bleeding from Twitter to Google+ will just get worse. Enough cuts like this one and the bleeding will get critical.",1310609073.0

So when you hit the main page (results 1-30), HN has to remember what 31-60 is at that particular point in time, so when you later hit the More link, it can give you 31-60 for a time in the past.<p>Obviously it can't remember an infinite number of these, there's a limit, and how quickly you hit that limit probably depends on a combination of how many people are hitting the home page, and how often the order of items in the list is changing.<p>When HN was younger, you wouldn't see the expired link message that often, as fewer people were hitting the site, and the item order changed less frequently.<p>At least that's my theory.",1310608903.0

Can get visa - maybe - after 6 month wait.\nEnormeous amount of info to give to get it delivered. Costs a lot.<p>So if a company lays off someone for a H1B I guess the previous employee was just bad.
