The additional technical skills (Writing, Mathematics, Finance, Law, Accounting) and interpersonal skills (Networking, Explaining complex topics) I've gained have been invaluable. I now look at the world in an entirely different way.<p>I share the same feelings as marcamillion regarding having the ""veil"" lifted on world affairs. I have a BEng in Aerospace Avionics (Electrical Engineering for air and space craft) but have always worked as a Software Engineer / Developer. After a few years of working full time (big multinational then small ~20 person company) I was wondering ""there has to be more to life than this.""<p>While reading online I came across recommendations to read this weekly magazine called ""The Economist"". It was super hard to get through at first: I didn't know the people, some of the countries, or the financial jargon. But I persisted and each week I'd go and buy it at the newsagent. I'd systematically read each issue from cover to cover. Those first ~15 issues looked like a rainbow; multicoloured post-it notes fanning out from three sides. Whenever I came across a person, word, country, concept I didn't recognize I'd write it on a post-it and affix it to the page. Later, I'd systematically revisit the notes and resolve my ignorance using Google + Wikipedia.<p>A lot of the time I didn't want to read the whole thing, only the Business, Finance, and Technology sections. However, I forced myself to read about issues in Sudan, or Kyrgyzstan, or politics in South America. I am now so much more aware of the way the world works, what's happening in world politics, financial markets, business, literature. As marcamillion mentions, acquiring this knowledge was liberating.<p>Programming: Persisting with Haskell until it ""clicked"".<p>Over the past 5 years I've revisited Haskell a number of times. Reading tutorials and books; watching videos. I ""got"" Monads as a mathematical concept, but didn't have a strong grasp of how and why they should be used.<p>On about 6th crack at it I just sat down and read code. Thousands and thousands of lines of code. Once I'd ""groked"" a concept from seeing how it was used in real world code I'd go and implement it from scratch. I'd recreate Maybe, then build the Monad typeclass, and finally implement the Monad typeclass for Maybe. I'd do this for Monad transformers, Monoids, Applicative, etc. This was really hard for me. Looking back I realise I was optimizing my learning by always pushing the edge of what I could do.<p>Over time I gradually became competent at writing Haskell as well as reading and understanding other people code. This additional understanding of functional programming has dramatically change my programming style. I now create a lot more immutable data types. In C++ I'll liberally use const, in Python namedtuples. I get frustrated when a language prevents me from easily mapping and composing functions. I really really value algebraic data types and use them wherever I can.<p>tl;dr Read The Economist and went to grad school. Learned Haskell and now use immutability and pure functions much more often.",1354503562.0

That doesn't mean there aren't legitimate interests represented by those regulators, and those legitimate interests will be the rhetorical focus of the incumbent protection campaign.  Uber would do well to appreciate those legitimate interests and get well and truly on the right side of those questions.  Uber would also do well to understand the unstated agendas, legimate and otherwise, and strategize for meeting those.<p>Legitimate questions?  IANA taxi expert but I would guess:\n- Value of incumbent licenses.  In NY cab drivers and companies spend hundred of thousands for medallions.  There are whole financing structures built around those values.  Protection of those values is probably a key objective of the regulators.<p>That really is a legitimate problem.  For one thing those values support an industry that provides jobs to working class people.  For another the city probably views those values as a signal of the stability of its policy environment.<p>- Stability.  Policy makers may well believe that the taxi system works on a number of dimensions, that systems like Uber may not work as well on all those dimensions, and that they may disrupt the system with unknown consequences.<p>- ""Universal service"".  One of those dimensions may be service availability to low income neighborhoods.  Cabs are supposed to take fares anywhere.  Regulators may fear that poor people may not have iPhones to play in Uber, and that drivers would discriminate against some neighborhoods if the poor people did.  It would not surprise me that the tacit model behind the cabs is ""you take the high fare business traffic to the airports, but also the lower revenue low income traffic.""  The high revenue types effectively subsidize the low revenue types.  This model happens EVERYWHERE in the regulated universe.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if the regulators were also simply trying to maintain their nests by maintaining control, and maybe some actual hard corruption.<p>But these folks are very, very capable at city politics.  They've got their 10,000 hours in and they will kick your ass if you don't.  I don't care how right Uber is, if they find themselves going up against race and class politics they will get erased.<p>My advice to Uber?  Slow down.  Figure out what the other side is about, and I mean all about, good and bad.  Figure out how you're going to meet the real problems and the legitimate and / or understandable objections of the incumbents.  Figure out the arena where the final decisions will be made (probably the city councils), get to know those players, and figure out how you can win there.<p>Uber can't probably do this on current staffing.  They need first class political advice, and at a local level.  Finding the right people won't be easy.  But they need people with those 10,000 hours in the right places, and pronto.",1354503443.0

Apologies if this was not your intent; in any case, in that paragraph you have done essentially to Assange's views what I did with my comment to yours.

In the time that Facebook got big, hundreds of millions of people were beginning to use the internet to socialize for the first time. They didn't have to unlearn how Friendfeed worked, or abandon their contacts on Myspace, because they had never used these services. It was all new and Facebook snapped them up.<p>There aren't hundreds of millions more for the next social network to snap up. In the developed world, the internet is done growing. Every North American or European who is ever going to use the internet already does. Everyone who would be interested in using a social network is already on Facebook.<p>Not literally everyone (we all know a few people who aren't on Facebook), but close enough that the trick they pulled off can't be repeated.",1354500084.0
