First off, 98% of your customers are not going to complain publicly.  They are simply going to leave.   And as I keep saying, the people who don't complain are the cash cows... the silent majority, from whom you get most of your money.<p>Now, I'm not saying you should ignore public complaints... that would be bad business.  Respond publicly and solve the problem, or at least give a refund.   But  you must treat the complainers like canaries.    for every valid complaint (and yeah, you will get invalid complaints... respond to those too, and offer a refund, but it's okay to say ""I'm sorry my service does not meet your needs.""  - you can't be all things to all people.)  you need to review your processes, and figure out why the complaint wasn't resolved through normal channels.",1284951523.0

Since I'm not an accountant I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make here, unless it is to suggest that in some way DonorsChoose.org is misrepresenting its finances to the world --- which we absolutely do not do. All the financial reports I've ever seen are quite clear about where the money from donors goes, how much of it goes towards operating expenses and how much goes directly to the recipients of aid. In what way does making the operational expense donation optional affect anything having to do with reporting of these numbers?<p>The reason DonorsChoose makes operational expense donations optional is simply to give donors a choice. They can choose to donate all their money directly to the teachers and students, or they can choose to donate part of the money to fund overhead. If they choose the former, all of the money goes to purchase materials, and all DonorsChoose overhead is drawn down from our general fund (which is currently funded from private donations and corporate donors, etc.) If they choose the latter, a portion of their donation goes towards overhead. In fact, we only currently cover about 40% of our operating expenses from the optional donation; we rely on external donations to cover the rest, but our goal is to reach breakeven (and we are on course to do so, as I understand it).<p>There's no sense in which the ""official"" ""% of donations used for operating expenses"" figure is fudged at all. The optional donation is precisely as described, and it's simply to give the donor choice, pure and simple.",1284950851.0

That 1% does make it worth a look, though, and I personally have lost about 15 lb in the last twelve weeks by (more or less) following it. My BMI is down from 27.4 to 25.7, and I fully expect to get back into ideal weight range within another month or so.<p>I went into it extremely skeptical of almost all the claims, but what I <i>did</i> buy was the claim that you feel a lot more full after eating a meal of meat and vegetables than you do after a meal rich in grains and potatoes. So I tried it, and lo and behold I find it quite easy to eat as much as I feel like of all the allowed foods and still consume only ~2000 calories a day.<p>I also find that I no longer have any craving for anything sweeter than fruit, whereas I used to be able to talk myself into milkshakes and brownies with excessive frequency. I think it's a blood sugar effect -- all the food I eat is low in GI so I'm not getting the blood sugar spikes I used to. This effect might be specific to me personally, though.<p>The fact that the diet supposedly replicates what our distant ancestors ate is important only in that it at least guarantees that you're eating a subset of foods that are nutritionally sufficient.<p>Other side effects? None that I've noticed, neither good nor bad. It's possible I've felt a little bit more tired, but I can't be sure... and in any case that's not unexpected if you're maintaining a 500-calorie-a-day deficit.<p>I should also mention that I'm not quite strict paleo because I eat moderate amounts of dairy -- I'll be damned if I'm giving up milk in my coffee. Speaking of which, I'll be damned if I'm gonna give up coffee, which is also non-paleo. And I'm not one to panic if a salad happens to have croutons, or my fish happens to be crumbed. But breads, potatoes, sugar and beans/legumes are out (I don't buy the logic behind exclusion of beans, but I never really liked beans anyway).<p>In conclusion, it's not a miracle and it's not nearly as amazing as its most far-out proponents claim, but if you need to lose some weight it's worth trying out for a couple of weeks to see what happens (maybe your body chemistry is different to mine, so it might not work for you). If you don't need to lose weight I wouldn't recommend it, because frankly it's hard to eat enough paleo food to maintain weight while physically active. When I've lost enough I think I'll reintroduce grains at breakfast and maybe lunch but keep the paleo dinners.",1284949727.0

I'm basically doing this as an experiment - the argument that we should eat what we evolved eating is compelling as a general principle.<p>I haven't lost or gained weight.  My workouts haven't been much worse or much better.  I don't notice a difference in energy levels, although I find it harder to ignore hunger now.  My major impressions are that a paleo diet is expensive and inconvenient.<p>This is just my experience.  The scientific arguments that I've seen made follow the general pattern of this article: neolithic foods contain chemicals (e.g. lectins, phytates, etc.) that are bad for our bodies.<p>These kinds of arguments are extremely unconvincing.  Digestion and metabolism involves thousands of chemicals and reactions.  Trying to piece together how it works is important, but a couple isolated components are not nearly enough with which to make judgements for your health.<p>Arguments from personal experience are even worse.  If you ""feel better"" on the diet, are you sure it's the diet?  Is it the placebo effect?  Is it the fact that you are likely eating more fiber and nutrients?  Is it a difference in blood sugar levels that you notice?  Even worse, is the advice to cut out foods, and then test how those foods make you feel when reintroduced.  Any change can easily be interpreted negatively.  Also, your body has adjusted to the new foods (which quite likely caused their own painful adjustment period).<p>Good arguments would make actual health claims, such as\n  1.  The chance that you develop heart disease will fall.\n  2.  The chance that you develop cancer will fall.\n  3.  The diet will prevent some other diseases (e.g. diabetes).\n  4.

I bought a stolen laptop on ebay, got in contact with the owner and got him his laptop back, and my money back through paypal. We gave the police the ebay and paypal account information of the seller, including name, two physical addresses, phone number, email address, and pictures of the laptop inside their apartment.
