Then, when you\nrealize that &quot;list all files by size&quot;, really is &quot;ls --sort=size&quot;,\npossibly with &quot;-l&quot;, you could just add another definition:<p><pre><code>    alias lss=&quot;ls -l --sort=size&quot;\n      doc = &quot;&quot;&quot;List files -- sorted by size, long list format&quot;&quot;&quot;\n      natural_match = &quot;list all files sort by size long format&quot;\n      natural_exact_match &quot;list all files by size&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAnd now have:<p><pre><code>    &quot;list all files by size&quot;\n</code></pre>\nScore higher for lss than for ll (the scoring function is assumed to be\nsome combination of tag count, proximit match, substring match etc, a\nso-called hard problem, but only needs to match over defined aliases --\nand trying hard to first match the &quot;exact_match&quot; part...).<p>Of course, it should all be paired by a define-command or something that\nautmatically saves these monstrosties to a file or other db.
