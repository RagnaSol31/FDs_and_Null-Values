Sketchy, but all on the founder's part -- all suppositions to/from the founder, not the publication. Did they even get a story? Doesn't look like it.<p>This article sort of destroys the credibility of its own publishers, though. An email from a pushy founder doesn't show any guilt on the recipient's side. I would've dug into it a bit more before throwing out accusations. Maybe would've gotten a <i>really</i> good story out of it?<p>Disclaimer: TC covered our little startup and we were pleased as heck; no payola involved, we're not funded, we're not in any cool kids club.

You can plug together module functors with complementary provides and requires, like building with toy bricks.<p>Many languages support the <i>provides</i> half of this feature (e.g. Java's interfaces) but few support the <i>requires</i> half (Scheme's units are one of the few that come to mind).  The advantage of supporting both provides and requires include ability to swap out equivalent implementations of some module, perform massive code abstraction, and to better isolate unit tests without resorting to conditional compilation.  (You can quite literally plug a high-level module into a fake lower-level module in order to test the high-level one using one line of code.)<p>The ""language of 2020"" <i>will</i> have this, or an equivalent, means of massive abstraction.  Or better still, such a mechanism will exist as a separate language unto itself which can work with multiple languages.  (Think C-style symbolic linking combined with a .NET ABI.)",1317264833.0

All you had to do was just READ what the heck I wrote.  So far you have let your arrogance and resistance at believing something new to you keep you from just elementary READING.<p>So, return and just READ the post.<p>Or again, yet one more time, just for you this time, to repeat, to pound the head of the nail a half inch below the surface of the wood, for some positive integer n, consider a system of n linear equations in n unknowns.  To this end, let A be an n x n real matrix, x be an n x 1 real vector, and let b be an n x 1 real vector.<p>So, the system to be solved is just Ax = b. Here we seek x.<p>Matrix A is assumed to be non-singular but otherwise may be horribly 'ill-conditioned'.<p>Assume that the numerical data is given in base 10.<p>Then for some positive integer m, all the components of<p>(10^m)A and (10^m)b<p>are just whole numbers.  It is also permitted to pick a different m for each of the n equations, that is, each row of Ax = b.<p>This is the second time I've made this very elementary point.  The point is correct, 100% rock solidly correct.  All that is needed for the technique is that the components of<p>(10^m)A and (10^m)b<p>be whole numbers, and clearly, with total crystal clarity, the 'condition number' of A is not, Not, NOT<p>N O T<p>involved.<p>Twice now you've missed the VERY simple point.  TWICE.  And it's DIRT SIMPLE.<p>You continued:<p>""The backward error remains and those powers of 10 depend on that error critically.""<p>Wrong.  Totally wrong.  Uninformed, misinformed, just plain wrong, badly wrong, totally off the subject wrong.<p>There is no such ""depend"" at all.  None.  Zip, zilch, zero.<p>If you are sober and paying any attention at all, which so far is doubtful, then you have just ASSUMED that you understand the technique and drawn totally wrong conclusions.<p>Maybe you just bitterly resent the idea of learning something new to you.<p>With 99% probability, you have missed the technique.  Just MISSED it.  You just didn't 'get it'.  It didn't register with you.  You totally missed it.<p>Once again, yet again, over again, just for you because everyone else in this thread long since 'got it', given the system of equations where all the given data is integers, we pick a list of single precision integer prime numbers.  There are a LOT of such prime numbers, far, far, far more than there is any danger of our needing.<p>Then for each such prime on the list, consider the 'algebraic field' of the integers modulo that prime.  In that field, the GCD algorithm is JUST how to find a multiplicative inverse.<p>Now, so armed with the GCD algorithm, use Gaussian elimination, essentially as usual, to solve the system of linear equations in the field of the integers modulo that prime.  In this work, will need essentially only single precision integer arithmetic.  The result will be just single precision integers.<p>A large condition number does NOT make anything about this use of Gaussian elimination more difficult.<p>Do this work for each prime on the list.<p>Then using the Chinese remainder theorem, we can assemble the exact, rational answer from the results from the primes.  Of course the solution will be in the rationals, that is, a ratio of integers.  In this case, the integers will be multiple precision.  Finding these integers is nearly the only multiple precision arithmetic needed by the technique and is routine.<p>This is NOT a joke.  It's rock solid.<p>It is true that we need an estimate of the number of prime numbers to have on our list so that the result of the Chinese remainder theorem will be correct and not too small, but this estimate is easy and, for anything like reasonable input data, is comfortably small, typically no more than a few dozen.<p>As I warned you, I will provide rock solid support for my claims at which time your uninformed objections will make you look like a fool before HN.<p>Actually what I am describing was worked out by M. Newman in the 1960s at the old National Bureau of Standards.  He wrote a paper on the work:<p>Morris Newman, ""Solving Equations Exactly,"" 'Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards -- B. Mathematics and Mathematical 'Physics', volume 71B, number 4, October-December, 1967, pages 171-179.<p>That is peer-reviewed mathematics from a quite good and fully competent mathematician.<p>He also wrote software to implement the technique and ran it on a Univac 1108 computer.  It worked GREAT.<p>His paper shows how to find a sufficient list of prime numbers.<p>You have shown all of HN that you think like a FOOL.<p>Apparently you don't mind acting like a fool in public.<p>It is difficult to fathom how someone sober could have learned about condition number and backward error analysis yet fail to see the middle school point that<p>(10^m)A and (10^m)b<p>can be all integers, presented, now, TWICE.",1317262082.0

125,3050803,comment,3050603.0,3050603.0,41,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Some context/theorizing about Edison, NJ. Edison is a largely Indian town. In particular, it attracts many people who don't want personal exposure to the US or non-Indians - such a lifestyle would be difficult anywhere besides Edison or Jersey City. They are only in the US to earn USD.<p>My theory as to why Edison wages are so low: most of the Edison companies are low end bodyshops - if you need a warm body with J2EE, they will give you a warm body. Their competitive advantage is that the Edison guys they hire never talk to non-Indians [1] and never discover they are ridiculously underpaid.<p>Incidentally, the food in Edison is fantastic. Jersey City also has good low end food (e.g., dosas), though nothing great at the higher end.<p>[1] It's not even an Indian nationalism thing - many of them avoid socializing with Indians from a different state/ethnicity. I get dirty looks when they see me with an Indian girl.",1317261858.0

It was crazy, actually, but I was losing half my working day (shortly after that we joined Affinity Lab).<p>Of course, now that I can't get to a co-working space, I had to get way better at planning and finding good places. Now I don't waste much time.<p>For that matter, I think I am more productive (for now) because I can't chit-chat and get distracted as I would when I'm around people I know. All of our work is offsite and online right now, so no productivity is wasted.<p>The biggest trick is, if it's a 3hr commute there and back to your office (plus settling in time) you have to weight it each time whether it's worth the trip or not. But I hit the coffee shop every morning, like it's my office, and gain 2.5hrs. You just can't slack off.<p>I wouldn't suggest doing it forever, but if you're going to do it, that's how.",1317261701.0
