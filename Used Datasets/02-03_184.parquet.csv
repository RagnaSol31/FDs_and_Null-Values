The examples you've raised are off to a good start there. Once brands and marketers see that these folks can reach bigger and more dedicated audiences each week than a typical TV show can, dollars will be taken away from TV spend and placed on YouTube instead. It'll be a slow process, but we're already seeing some really big brands and companies placing big bets on YouTube, Facebook, etc. There are plenty of cases where spending on a YouTube star makes more sense than spending on a TV show (when reaching a targeted audience or youth demographics, say). That said, YouTube -- and its associated studios -- have a ways to go before theyr'e taking serious bucks away from TV network advertising.<p>As for the movie business, that one's a bit tougher to kill. The barriers to entry for Hollywood-quality movies are fairly high. But there are some levers to pull. In recent years, hedge funds have quietly emerged as one of the biggest sources of film financing in the business -- bankrolling everyone from production companies to studios themselves. Independent producers looking to work outside the Hollywood system should find a) distribution paths that make sense, and b) court this sort of money, which will be agnostic as to who's making the content if the content is good enough.",1327287485.0

There's only one way to sell a script on Amazon.<p>So, if your script's been floating around for a year or two and hasn't gotten any traction -- no agent, no options, hasn't made The Black List, hasn't placed in any notable competitions, etc. -- then sure, submit it to Amazon. But the hard truth in that case is that the script is likely just crap.<p>On a side note: the point of writing a spec isn't necessarily to sell it. Specs are to screenwriters as GitHub is to coders.

Invent processes, gear, whatever was needed to produce the films faster and cheaper. Be the lab.<p>You could actually hire pretty pro crew for below the line work since you'd be spreading the cost of any individual over say 20 films a year.<p>You'd lose above the line people along the way.

It's difficult when it's threatening the revenue stream of the guys lining your pockets.<p>> that both parties supported the bills by large margins (or they wouldn't have been reported out of committee) until they got caught<p>Look, as much as we want to believe that our representatives actually <i>read</i> the stuff they're pushing, the truth is, they don't. I would be shocked if a singe member of the <i>committee</i> responsible for the bill actually read the damn thing. Each of them is on quite a few other committees, responsible for quite a few other bills, have speaking engagements, businesses, books they're writing, etc etc.<p>They decide on what to vote for and push based on who's supporting it. Some members of the GOP saw the Chamber of Commerce as a supporter and jumped on board. Commerce = Business = Good. Seriously, that was the thought process.<p>Once they saw the push-back, they realized things were more complicated than that, and dropped support.<p>Can the GOP be a strong ally for leaving the Internet alone? Absolutely. As long as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, etc. line their pockets right before re-election time. If that happens, I promise you, they'll vote for whatever bill the ""Internet"" endorses. Without reading it. It's a promise.",1327285997.0

Taking down only links (whether they're HTTP links, or pointers in a software app, etc) pointing to the material does not meet that requirement -- the material is still there, and it's still accessible through the other links.<p>So while it would be sensible to only remove the one link that you were notified of, if there are others, then by not taking them all down the service provider does not gain the safe harbor protection of the DMCA and remains liable for copyright infringement. Right now, as a non-lawyer reading the DMCA, it looks to me like any storage service that dedupes files is required to remove the file (from everyone's account) when any link to that file is reported, even if the other accounts have permission to store that file.",1327284365.0

There is just one problem with deliberately giving some people more power than others: those whose power is taken will try to use the same arguments used by those doing the taking.
