8,3312751,comment,3312313.0,3312695.0,13,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Seriously? That seems to speak to a lack of knowledge about how economics actually works. Would they say 'stomping out programming tools that let people write evil code' ?<p>My confusion stems from the fact that political corruption and the plight of the middle class have less to do with 'capitalism' (an economic theory involving free markets) and more to do with 'some people are evil.' There seems to have been as much 'political corruption' and 'middle class stomping' in the Soviet Union and they didn't actually have capitalism as an economic theory. That is why it confuses me when capitalism seems to be the target.<p>The institutions in the US that protect citizens have been under served by people who they represent. That I get. How many times have you heard someone ask for ideas for 'avoiding doing jury duty' or 'only one loser is running for school board seat 12'. Those institutions, the justice system, local governments, are the pre-cursor institutions of Congress and federal departments.<p>What is more impressive to me is that you have to let someone serve who gets elected and a lot of places you can get elected just by throwing your name in the hat (I'm talking various cities and counties around the US, no Congress).<p>So why isn't it ""OccupyLocalGovernment"" ? Then you could do stuff like prevent disasters of Bell California [1]. You know, ""Think nationally, serve locally."" kind of thing. Get some experience running the city, move up to the county, then state, then you'll be well trained and positioned to run for Congress and fix things.

14,3312745,story,,,1,4,ArunB,Ask HN: Would you use a service to review your Android game?,,"Hi,\n  We are considering building a service that lets developers upload Android games to get subjective reviews/feedback from a community of reviewers. This is to help developers get the critical feedback they need to make an impression out of the gate. We still have not figured out how to build the reviewer community. Our first thoughts are to incentivize them using points/rewards/bragging rights. Granted, that is going to be really tough but we would like to gauge the interest level of developers in such a service. If you are wondering how is it different from the reviews developers get in Android Market,  we encourage reviewers to give detailed feedback on a questionnaire set that is not annoying but still useful.<p>The real question to you is, if you are an Android game developer, would you use such a service? How much are you willing to pay per game? Does $100 sound too much?",1323053629.0

I should do a follow-up post to elaborate on this, but since you brought it up, I will answer it right here right now.<p>The majority of techs were supposed to sit there, take calls, and work tickets.  When they were actually at work and not on a break, in the bathroom, or on lunch, they should have been ""Auto-In"" on the phones while working on tickets.  If they finished a ticket and a call wasn't presented to them, they should have immediately gone to the ""unassigned"" view to grab something new.<p>You're right that it could represent a long phone call.  That kind of stuff happens.  I used to run these tools on myself and see a dip in my data.  I'd worry about what happened and then realize, ""oh yeah, that's when some Enterprise customer called up and needed hand-holding through fixing Tomcat"".<p>The difference with a long phone call is that their idle time would then be followed by a ticket being created or updated to document what happened in the call.  I had another view of the data which would let you spot this situation easily.  It's not evident on the graphical view shown in this post.<p>Also, long phone calls were relatively infrequent.  Most issues could be resolved in a couple of minutes.  ""Please unlock my control panel"" is short.  ""Your hardware just took us down again and we are hopping mad"" is long.  Most of the calls resembled the former and not the latter, fortunately.<p>It's when you see the same people, day after day, with these l-o-n-g gaps and no ticket updates to suggest a phone call that you start wondering.  After long enough, you realize there are some who are just not pulling their weight.",1323053529.0

34,3312725,comment,3312502.0,3312502.0,34,0,compay,,,"I'm a partner at a Ruby outsourcing company in Argentina. I sympathize with the author, but I think the conclusion that outsourcing doesn't work is overly broad.<p>The crux of the problem is that working with a remote team is a <i></i>very<i></i> different proposition than working with people onsite - a fact that is obvious but that people generally fail to act on.<p>Quite often at my company we're contacted by clients want to hire folks in a foreign country and expect them to work like remote employees, but cheaper, and with fewer legal responsibilities. They think that through the wonders of Skype and email, people in India (or South America) can work just like on-site employees.<p>The reality is that outsourced development to remote teams only works when the client is willing to adapt their own work patterns to it. As a client, you need to:<p>* Have a <i></i>crystal clear<i></i> idea of what you want built. The less communication overhead you have with the remote team, the easier your life will be, and the more likely it will be that stuff gets implemented the way you want to.<p>* Have frequent and early deliverable dates. Don't start a project that will take 6 months to get a first release out with a remote team. Shoot for as early a release as possible, followed by frequent small releases. This lets you pull out almost whenever you want and also reduces the likelihood of burning out the developers on the other side.<p>* If you already have a company with a bunch of people, have the remote developers work outside your regular dev cycle. Don't expect to plug in a couple of guys located 5 times zones away into your regular team, unless your regular team is already distributed.<p>* Be linguistically very compatible with the folks you're outsourcing to. If you have any difficulties understanding or being understood by the folks you're hiring, then you're significantly increasing your risk.<p>The well known Ruby consultancies like Pivotal, Thoughtbot and Hashrocket will all tell you, that outsourcing to foreign countries is a mistake, and that developers <i></i>need<i></i> to be on-site. This, of course, while basing a huge amount of their business on Rails and a bunch of other open source libraries and frameworks which are developed almost entirely by distributed teams. These companies have an economic incentive to lead people away from outsourcing to cheaper countries, so follow the money.<p>It just also happens to be the case that since many clients don't understand how much their own workflow needs to change, many outsourced projects fail and reinforce the idea that outsourcing doesn't work.",1323053365.0

But you are forced to use the 10 freeway because its the only infrastructure that provides for MANY routes [ santa monica - downtown ], [ culver city - hollywood ] and so on.

So essentially, you get what you pay for because the good programmers can command (and deserve) salaries close to what their American/international counterparts make. Many of these better programmers are snagged by the Amazon/Microsoft/Google of world who have development centers in India.<p>- A lot (most?) of firms in India that employ programmers do not invest in educating/developing their employees' skills. This is partly the result of employees jumping ship very often (hence making the investment in their development not worth it), and partly the result of the business (they do one-time contracts and paid by the hour, so delivery == success. Quality/sustainability isn't as much of a concern).<p>- For a large percentage of programmers, career development is defined by a larger paycheck, not necessarily stronger experiences/skills. Therefore, their motivation is to switch jobs very often and do the same caliber/quality work, and yet make more money with each switch. So they too aren't motivated to excel.",1323051739.0

The Limbo programming language, for example, provides typed channels (which, as I understand it, also made it into Go) and its standard library provides functions for treating arbitrary files as typed channels.  So, the OS need only concern itself with ""files"" (really, in Plan 9 and Inferno, these are less like files and more like names in the processes' respective namespaces), and whatever complex objects the language concerns itself with are easy to ship around between a process and the outside world without hacks (unless marshalling objects is considered a hack).",1323050561.0

In a way they remind me of another aging Rochester company - Xerox.<p>Regarding other comments about the town...  If you're a specialist in a small or medium sized city, and not willing to move, you are at risk.  This is true if you are branding specialist in Cincinnati, a Russian literature specialist in Albuquerque, an also if you're an imaging specialist in Rochester.
