Engines with rev limiters (all modern passenger car engines) will not exceed redline, and any well maintained and designed engine should be able to redline for a minute or two without locking up, long enough for most emergencies to come to a close (regardless the outcome)<p>This is not to say killing ignition is a bad idea, but it does not seem to be required.  In any case, the worst things that can happen to the driver that I can think of is fire or accidental re-engagement of the tranny.  Only real way I'm aware of for an engine to blow and hurt somebody is when a motorcycle shoots a piston straight through the head of the engine and up into the rider.  I don't think transverse V6's can launch pistons through the head AND firewall.<p>Also while the steering wheel may not lock, power steering will vanish.  I want to say the driver will just have to deal, but an 80 year old probably can't turn the non-power assisted wheel of their 4000lb luxury car, and that's not their <i>fault</i> persay.  Which brings up other questions.  This is a dilemma, and partly why I have never truly liked power steering.",1268189935.0

No: Moz decided not to hire Metalab, and someone ripped off some existing work of Metalab's for some mockups.<p>Now, I think that was an inexcusable thing to do on the part of whoever did it, but even if it was actual Mozilla staff, I just don't see why Mozilla ought to pay Metalab for not working nor hire them unless they happened to be the second choice.

75,1180018,comment,1179691.0,1179691.0,0,0,Dove,,,"The point of concern for me in modern mythology is not the unrealistic amount of effort required to succeed, but the portrayal of risk.  If the main character is likeable, good-hearted, and he gives it his all, he never fails.  Things just work out for him.<p>Winston Churchill said, ""It is no use saying 'we are doing our best'.  You have got to succeed at doing what is necessary.""  And at the time he said it, it was an unremarkable sentiment echoed in literature.  The modern rule seems to be more along the lines of, ""If you're nice and put in a decent effort, things will work out.""<p>Some examples: Modern little orphan Annie is met with success after success and kindness after kindness in response to her charm and ingenuity, encountering only minor setbacks; her counterpart in Dickens' <i>Oliver Twist</i> meets nothing but disappointment and injustice for a very long time.  The slight justices in the story are only those which are <i>achieved</i> by the characters with a lot of work and risk -- and even they, they often fail.  <i>Titanic's</i> Rose drifts into and out of a beautiful adventure, but <i>Gone With The Wind's</i> Scarlet toils and schemes endlessly to gain what she has, even after losing everything through no fault of her own.  The central romance of <i>Casablanca</i> does <i>not</i> simply work out as a modern audience would be accustomed to expect; the characters focus on doing what is necessary to achieve their aims.<p>The older stories have it right.  In order to achieve something, one must assess the cost.  You can't just do your best and hope.  Rather--in the mode of Churchill--you must <i>do what is necessary</i>.  And failure is familiar even to those who do that and proceed with best effort and intentions.  A generation raised on Disney happy endings is learning the wrong lessons about the necessity of planning and perseverence.",1268187276.0
