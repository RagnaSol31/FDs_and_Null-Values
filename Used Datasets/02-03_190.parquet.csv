Protein folding is an intractable N-body simulation problem that relies on number of different methods to approximate the 3D state of the protein throughout its folding sequence.<p>In reviewing the patent, it looks like this is an incremental improvement to simulation based off some findings in recent years, but does not seem to be any kind of breakthrough in understanding of proteins.  Something called 'Vibration Mode' seems to be an empirical observation that explains how the internal dynamic of the protein can limit the number of future 3D states based on a previously observed folding cycle, and a model of the local energy minima and maxima.",1317003684.0

Currently, in the media-delivery industry, Netflix is elbowing out the un-innovative rent-extracting cable TV industry, which is unequivocally a good thing. Delivering better choices for lower prices, while consigning cable companies to delivering commodity broadband access can only help consumers.<p>In the longer term, however, I fail to see how Netflix can avoid having its product turn into a commodity. Delivery of digital video to consumers will only continue to get cheaper and easier. Obviously Netflix has gotten amazing deals on bandwidth (see their recent spat with Comcast) but other the prices it pays will only continue to converge with the prices for commodity CDNs.<p>The only major part of Netflix's business that's resistant to commoditization is having a huge base of subscribers that allows them to cut deals directly with studios like Dreamworks. Obviously Netflix is trying to position itself as a cheaper, better middleman between consumers and content producers than the combination of cable channels and cable companies. This could be very attractive to studios in the medium-term, but ultimately why not cut out the middleman? When (not if) quick, flexible, and easy online payment comes to the internet, what's stopping Dreamworks from simply charging and delivering the movie to consumers directly?",1317003435.0

Paul is a tiny company based in California, Avid is a brand of SRAM (one of the ""big three"" bicycle components manufacturers).  Paul's brakes cost $110 per wheel (for the polished aluminum).  Avid's cost $88 per wheel (on Amazon, but list for $110) and aren't polished.<p>(I am not 100% sure that SRAM outsources to China, but I'm sure they move many many more units than Paul.)<p>Another example is Shimano freewheels vs. White Industries freewheels.  Shimano makes fine equipment, but the White Industries freewheels are much better built and have proven to be much more durable.  The price difference is something like $20 for the made-in-southeast-asia Shimano part, and $80 for the made-in-the-USA White Industries part.  So, people will pay for quality, and there's only going to be a big price difference if you make billions of widgets per year.<p>If nobody even competes with you and you aren't making enough units to justify buying your own CNC milling setup, I can't imagine why you would deal with the hassle of China.<p>(Once I get tired of programming I think I am going to make bike parts, so I always read these manufacturing articles with interest.)",1317002533.0
