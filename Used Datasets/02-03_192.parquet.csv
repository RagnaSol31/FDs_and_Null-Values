Having watched my grandparents' and parents' generations age, and being the age I am, it's easier for me to discern what constitutes an individual failure and what is simply a mistake of ignorance. If only the problem of poverty were as simple as sloth, ignorance, lack of opportunity, insufficient education, poor habilitation or mental depression. Any one of those problems is easy to solve. Any two of them in tandem may also be easy to solve. But if you've got all of them AND add happenstance to that list; things that, even at your most cynical, you could not plan against, the complexity of the problem of poverty requires more consideration that any single one of us has.<p>To some people, all the little things that foster individual success are just background noise -- you aren't aware of the noise until it's not there anymore. This has never been more apparent to me than now, as I am raising my children. Somehow I would like them to be grateful that they have so much more than I did, but the only way that can really feel that is to suffer like I did... and I can't let that happen.<p>Volunteering is part of the solution, though.

They should have to live with the consequences, and especially if they still have it better than others who do act responsibly as you feel is the case with the Eisens.<p>You know, there are people out there who feel that we shouldn’t help those of have contracted AIDS through subsidizing drugs or health care when the person got the virus due to risky behavior.  I’ve heard people say that although they feel sorry for someone who contracted HIV through a blood transfusion, there is no way they are going to feel sorry for “some fag who got it from romps in a bathhouse”.  Hopefully that sounds abhorrent to you, but it really is not far off the logic you are using in the case of the Eisens.<p>Or think of the Katrina victims, which hit the impoverished the hardest. City officials knew there were problems with the levies, and some of the victims behaved in a pretty reprehensible manner (shooting a police/rescue workers, looting, etc.)  But you know, despite the clear path of blame, I don’t think the right thing for the rest of the country to do would have been to stand there with arms folded saying “It’s your own damn fault, you fix it!  Don’t look to me for a handout!”<p>I know there are people out there who are suffering due to their own irresponsibility, and yes, it is hard to feel sorry for them at times.  But what do we do? Let them die?<p>I am not proud to say it, but I once felt the same way as you do about people like the Eisens. But then someone helped me understand that poverty and disease, no matter who is at fault, ultimately effects all of us (e.g. when my neighborhood starts to crumple, my own house starts to lose value.)
