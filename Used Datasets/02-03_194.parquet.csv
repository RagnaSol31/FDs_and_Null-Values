51,797186,comment,797050.0,797050.0,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"A Cleveland-area landlord was offering a year's free rent for a somewhat urban restaurant space (Shaker Square for the locals here).  I presume a longer-term lease was required at the beginning of the deal.  For the tenant, it was like some mix between venture capital and an option.  If he fails, he can leave and not have spent as much compared to a normal lease deal.  But, if he is successful, the landlord wins with a long-term tenant, and the tenant sticks around because of the signed lease and the switching costs of moving.<p>I don't know a lot about lease deals, but it seems that some additional complexity would make the market more efficient.  The article repeated the question, ""What restaurant would sign a one year lease?""  I presume the restaurant owner was referring to a contract that offered no guarantees about renewability or the price at renewal time.  Why not structure a lease as a combination of rent and an option on a future contract?  At the end of a one-year lease, the restaurant could pay $X to get out or sign a similar contract for no more than $X/month.  This is just one of many examples.<p>In general, markets are less efficient because parties stick to contractual terms that are standard for an industry rather than being creative for mutual benefit. Fear, stupidity, and irrational doubt lead to this.  When I bought my house, I modified the contract (at an attorney's suggestion) to include a ""liquidated damages clause"" which limited both the liability of both sides to the amount of earnest money provided.  And, I provided a significantly above average amount of earnest money to reduce the seller's risk of taking the home off the market.  The seller's real estate agent did not understand the economics of the change and therefore did not help the seller understand the mutual benefits.  So, the seller ended up hiring his own attorney to review the contract, and the deal was almost delayed.",1251772287.0

Hooking up batteries is no more dangerous than jump-starting a car, and we are all adults here -- just think things through carefully.<p>Car batteries, or if you want to go even cheaper, the ""lawn and garden"" riding mower batteries from Walmart, are not made for repeated deep discharge, as some other alarmist posts in this thread have pointed out.  However, you start your car several times a day, but the power goes out much less frequently, and every power outage doesn't run it all the way down (if so, the UPS isn't helping much).<p>A few additional points:<p>1) The wires that attach to the battery should be big.  Canabalized lamp cord or such will not work;  worse, it will appear to work, until the compture runs off the battery for an extended amount of time, and then it can get hot enough that the plastic gets bubbly and then bursts into flame.  (Not my personal experience, I use super heavy wire from old well pump wiring, that is about the size of the leads to a starter motor on a car -- about 12 or 4 gauge).<p>2) If a cheap UPS says it will keep the computer up for 15 min, it is likely not cooled enugh to run continously for hours without burning out.  Look at refurbished computer places, or Goodwill Computer Works in Austin, and get the APC brand UPSs or similar, and look for those that have  fan to actively cool them when they run on battery.<p>3) For reasons 1) and 2) above, TEST THE THING outdoors, giving it a full change and then putting several 100 watt lamps on it and letting it run down.<p>4) I put the entire thing in one fo those big plastic tubs, that looks like a big tuperware container, to keep acid from the non-sealed battery from ever getting on the floor.  I leave the lid on loosely, so the power cords can get in and so hydrogen gas can not accumulate.<p>Another thing, is you can put jumper cable style clamps on the battery wires of the UPS, not close it up, and use it to make AC current for running saws and such where there is no electricity.  If you do this wtih cheap UPSs from garage sales, you will swiftly find that you can light the cheap brands on fire, and that APC rocks.<p>A battery that may not be good enough to start your car on cold mornings may keep your computer up through occasional 3 min outages for several years.",1251771602.0
