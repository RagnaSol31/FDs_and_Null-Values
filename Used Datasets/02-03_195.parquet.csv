I don't think that's true for most scripting languages. Inference refers to determining facts which were not explicitly provided, and usually implies a statically typed programming language where inference is done at compilation time. ""Runtime type inference"" might be used for, e.g., Python's Psyco project, where the just-in-time compiler infers properties about a particular variable (such that it's always an integer) and can therefore compile out boxing, unboxing, runtime type checks and so on.<p>Speaking of runtime type-checking, I inferred that that's what you meant when you said ""runtime type inference"". Type-checking IS something that happens at runtime almost everywhere in dynamic languages. It is also more closely associated with RTTI -- a dynamic_cast in C++ would not be termed type inference (the previous and new types are known), but a type check does occur at runtime.",1255920059.0

A poor keyboard is guaranteeing murder on your hands.  I had issues for years, which were/are exacerbated by an injury I sustained when I was younger (nerves, all tendons and significant portion of artery destroyed in my left hand, which required extensive surgery).<p>The one change I have found, repeatedly, that has made the most significant different is a keyboard.  I won't go overboard in recommending any particular setup, as I find different people have different preferences - I find the best relief in mechanical switch (I used das keyboard for years but have moved to majestouch recently as DKs have wonky controllers), but a lot of people swear by ergonomics, etc.  I can't use ergonomic/split hand keyboards well because of limits on my bad hand, but YMMV.<p>One of the best resources I've still found is from JWZ, who talks about all the different steps he went through in his own wrist pain:<p><a href=""http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/wrists.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/wrists.html</a><p>Another set of things I recommend is to make sure you use your muscles in different things than just typing.  Get a stress ball and some light-weight finger exercisers (You can usually get them at guitar stores, it has a spring loaded ""weight"" for each finger and you can flex individually).<p>I am by no means a doctor, but I've dealt with a lot of re-constructive therapy on my own hand, and my own typing issues (seriously, look into a better keyboard.  The $20 membrane switch piece of crap that came with your computer is NOT helping things at all).  On top of it my mom was an OR nurse for ~30 years and had hand issues of her own that stemmed from the fact that apparently holding medical instruments in one position for ~12 hours a day is bad for your hands too.<p>Make sure you get good tools, not just augmentation (like padding) to the tools you already have.  And give your stressed muscles other things to do, so you aren't just straining them in the same positions and actions day after day.",1255918884.0

The key is make sure your elbow/shoulder doesn't move, while you type. This is guaranteed if you rest your elbow on the same surface as your wrist.<p>* When placed on a table, don't keep your keyboard away from your chest - keep it at an arms length(almost). Once you have found your chair's relative position to table, stretch your arms towards the monitor and place them on the table (placing the elbows first) - place your keyboard in the area  where your fingers landed(wrist pad helps)<p>* Surely helps, if you can forego the laptop keyboard and move to a regular keyboard.<p>* most keyboards have a ""lift"" option at the backside- in my experience, I had some pain when I kept the keyboard flat. The lifted keyboard in conjunction with the wrist pad worked fine for me (took few days)<p>* Never, Never - use laptop (or wireless keyboards) on your lap, pillow etc or places that prompt your shoulder movement.<p>* Never, Never lift your wrists or elbow while typing?<p>* (my most effective weapon against pain) - Never, Never use  the  mouse keypad. Don't touch it. I have disabled mine and use the mouse all the time (again the elbow rest on the table rule applies)<p>* (edit) work out: swimming helped me.<p>PS: use the keyboard as you would use a pen.The pain/symptoms of using a pen ""abnormally"" are similar to  pain inflicted by a keyboard.<p>public places like airport and other places where you don't get a table and cannot rest a mouse, I prefer to read a book, rather than code with hunched,lifted shoulders.
