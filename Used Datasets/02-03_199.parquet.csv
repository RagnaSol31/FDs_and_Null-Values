Unskilled players are much more likely to bluff, call bluffs with weak hands, and over or underestimate their hands. In a low stakes, beginners game, there's enough variability that one player with a little more skill won't have much of an advantage. In a professional tournament, the best players show up in the top spots time and again.",1275879593.0

That said, I know a great many more people who have sold web businesses and never have to work again than those who are reaping millions in profits via the same. Honestly, I'm amazed at how many people I meet who are financially set based on some obscure web business they sold to a non-traditional acquirer. I'm not even that plugged into the startup community and I've met a couple dozen folks easily. Heck, among YC alums alone I bet you would find a bunch, even the under publicized ones.<p>Are the odds long? sure. Are you more likely to become wealthy spending a few post college years doing a funded startup rather than working at Google? Hell yes.<p>I really liked Rework, and like the ""Profitable and Proud"" series, but there are opportunities for people to fill small product niches and ""sell out"" quickly.

The entire industry gets reshaped by Apple's product moves. So Gizmodo being as aggressive as the law allows for scoops is to be expected.<p>Also, the argument that the news was ultimately a social triviality works both ways. No one's reputation was besmirched. The alleged-stolen property was returned to its owner fairly quickly.<p>Gizmodo's peek confirmed a few things and refuted a few others already rumored about the 2010 iPhone. While that info wasn't released exactly as Apple may have preferred, whether there was any net economic damage to Apple is debatable. Apple lost some surprise value around next week's announcements, but they also got tons of free publicity and hype about their flagship product.<p>So indignation about Gizmodo's actions should also be scaled to match your observation: it's just some exclusive pictures for a gadget blog. No permanent damage to any involved; perhaps a net win for Gizmodo and Apple.",1275877474.0
