I'm 23.<p>While the fund is being raised (probably about 10MM), my first task is to ""earn $100k in one month.""<p>There's no catch, no reward, and no consequence. Just do it and win, or don't do it and fail.<p>The conditions are:<p>- 100k profit. Donations are OK, too.<p>- Selling equity doesn't count towards the goal. Neither does equity valuation of any ventures.<p>- 100k must be cash equivalent, US dollar.<p>\nBUT there IS a loophole. I don't have to earn the 100k myself. I merely have to be ""responsible"" for creating it.<p>That means I can get help. From you.<p>So how about it, YC News?<p>This is a concrete goal and it's the right kick to actually get your business started beyond just ""thinking about it."" I have a big plan to make this happen, but I'll need good brains on keyboards. If you don't have an idea but have skills, that's fine.<p>Our base of operations is at my office at in Mountain View (<a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=415+Clyde+Ave,+Suite+105+Mountain+View&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=51.754532,82.265625&ie=UTF8&ll=37.395869,-122.047355&spn=0.012802,0.020084&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q...</a>)<p>Oh, and it starts NOON tomorrow (10/8/07 @ 12:00 PST).<p>There is a meeting at Neto Cafe (<a href=""http://www.netocaffe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netocaffe.com/</a>) on Castro in Mountain View noon tomorrow (Monday) for those interested. RSVP here or just show up.<p>UPDATE\n=================<p>I can spot up to $3k for expenses this month per person if you qualify.<p>UPDATE\n=================<p>You keep your own money.<p>Think ""Profit Pledge Drive."" You keep your own profits, but you do have to create them with something that you do within the space of the month. It's the spirit of the thing that matters.<p>Do you log the time you walked to the store in a ""walk for cancer research"" pledge drive?<p>My personal motivation is to simply see this happen for the hell of it. The company motivation is obviously to gather ambitious and intelligent people, which is significantly more expensive and difficult than spotting a few business expenses to try a few ideas.",1191812246

It's having the ingenuity and work ethic to make something out of the (rock) idea that will separate you from everyone else who has a worthless idea.,1191811102

The strategy here seems to be ""setup complete straw men for all of the arguments you don't like, then dispense with them not by making counter arguments but by showing the (straw man, distorted) arguments to be silly."" Plus it's hard to read.",1191810110
5,64582,comment,64475.0,64574.0,0,0,veritas,,,"This is ridiculous. <p>Trade Deficit = Current Accounts.  <p>Current accounts are primarily composed of a nation's trade balance, plus any interest paid/received and things such as foreign aid.<p>Investments = Capital Accounts.<p>Capital accounts are the flip side to the coin which helps balance the books.  Capital accounts are a measure of capital flow in and out of the country.<p>The United States with its ridiculous current account deficit needs to attract tremendous amounts of Foreign Direct Investment.  I.e, since we're owe money in our current accounts, we have to attract investments in our capital accounts (sell off assets) to balance the books.  <p>When a country has surplus of money (China and its trillion dollars in reserve), it means it is running a surplus in the current account.  There's only two things it can do with it: hold it (which serves no purpose... as Milton Friedman said: you just exchanged goods for paper) or invest it.  China invests it by buying up US T-Bills (hello Foreign Direct Investment), buying assets (oil rights, mineral rights etc), improving infrastructure, and creating government backed private equity firms to invest heavily and well to ensure future growth.<p>This is also similar to what the smart Middle Eastern countries do.  This way, down the line a country running a current account surplus will have a diversified and growing rate of return (interest/dividends) and can cover any dip in the trade balance.<p>So that, simplistically, is how the system works.  Trade deficits aren't inherently bad (after all, someone has to run a deficit since trade is a zero sum game), but running huge trade deficits and then running huge budget deficits on top of that is really, really bad.  <p>I hope that made sense.<p>EDIT: wording.",1191809305

It strikes me that big multi-nationals might be better able to deal with the cost of European bureaucracy than startups. My opinion of Europe is that it is a place where a person is dependent on his corporation and his government to shelter him, provide for him, and make decisions for him. ",1191809021

Plus, it's not academic -- Python is a full-fledged, big-boy language, and people use it regularly for real work.<p>There are other languages that you could learn first, but Python offers a really friendly cross-section of features and flexibility that makes it an attractive beginner's language.  It's definitely the language I would teach to first-time programmers, given no other constraints.",1191808879
