19,1564626,comment,1564391.0,1564580.0,0,0,shasta,,,"In ordinary language (though perhaps not in law), ""truly innovative"" is not the opposite ""obvious"".  I believe the language involved in US patent law is ""the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.""  So in my non-legal opinion, the standard is two low on it's face, whether or not it's enforced.  I wouldn't consider a solution obvious if it took me even an hour of brainstorming, but IMO that shouldn't typically warrant a patent.<p>Regarding your proposed test for patentability, I've thought about similar tests before.  There would be many practical difficulties, like deciding who frames the problem.  Some of the most innovative inventions are just properly identifying a poorly understood problem.  But I think something along these lines is the right way to go.<p>Another possible variant would be to force licensing of the patent for an amount proportional to the expected cost of developing the solution from scratch, maybe weighted by the potential market.",1280630384.0

21,1564623,comment,1564599.0,1564599.0,0,0,Saavedro,,,"WEP uses the RC4 cipher. The RC4 cipher generates pseudorandom bytes to XOR (mix) with your data to create the encrypted data. It generates these using an algorithm that ""shuffles"" the numbers 0-255 around in an array.<p>The initial arrangement of this array is derived from the key, by what is called a Key Scheduling Algorithm. In certain cases, this key scheduling algorithm can be worked backwards from the output of RC4 (the pseudorandom data) (if you can figure out enough about what the state of the array is) to get the key.<p>It is not secure to use the same key twice when doing symmetric crypto, so an Initialization Vector (just some extra data that is different for each message) is usually combined with the ""key"" to create a new key for each message. The IV is not a secret and usually sent along with the message in plaintext since you have to know the rest of the key anyway. However, in RC4, certain IVs cause working the Key Scheduling Algorithm backwards to be much easier.<p>All of the fake-auth attacks, deauths, and whatnot that aircrack does are for forcing machines on the network to generate more packets, because that increases the chance a packet will have a ""weak"" IV.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluhrer,_Mantin_and_Shamir_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluhrer,_Mantin_and_Shamir_atta...</a>",1280630300.0

When I'm trying to track down some information (say, understanding a bug) I'll generally open 3 or 4 tabs near-instantly (variously-worded google searches, checks on the appropriate bugtracker or forum, etc), then keep on opening new tabs until I track down the answer. Once I solve the problem I forget or don't bother to close the tabs -- it's a PITA selectively closing tabs, and they don't do much harm. Instead I'll do a close all every now and again, when I reach a point where there aren't any that I want open.
