Most users that would conceivable want to track a single campaign will be individuals with projects or very small businesses. Neither of these groups would be likely to acquiesce to a ~$250-a-year service. The top tier is probably too feature-sparse and large companies will demand more.",1353812368.0

If you remain in the areas heavily traveled by tourists and remain in these tourist areas, I don't think you'll come across these issues.  I'm sure ex-pats, depending on strata, would encounter these situations, given they need to go places to conduct whatever business they conduct (i.e. they likely do not remain indefinitely in the tourist areas)<p>One might only come into these situations if you veer off well known tourist areas.  If you take local transport (non-tour buses) then you might be subject to the same shakedowns as locals.  So, if you act like a tourist and walk like a tourist, then most likely the biggest problem would be picked pockets.<p>Take Mexico, for example.  My understanding is that so long as you stay in the tourist areas --say Cabo, Cancun ,etc., you'll, for the most part, be fine.  Go outside the tourist safe areas and you're taking a bit of a risk.  The size of the risk would depend on many factors, but it certainly increases.  Mexico earn a sizable fraction of GDP from tourism, they'll do all the can to insulate tourists from the violence.",1353812124.0

Solar produces electric power which needs to be moved across a large capital intensive grid and also has to have supply and demand balance in realtime, solar has problems producing power when it is needed.  Biofuels are high density portable energy sources that work with a trillion dollar base of invested infrastructure.<p>The portability/infrastructure view can be seen by a market based approach.  \nOne MMBTU of natural gas delivered at Henry Hub, sells for $3.50 \nA Barrel of Brent oil sells for $110 a barrel \n6 mmbtus of Natural gas has the same energy content of a barrel of Brent, or you could buy the energy content of a barrel of oil for $21 with natural gas. The FORM that a unit of energy comes in matters a lot.<p>Regarding Elon Musks claim on nuclear power plants I think there must be an assumption hes made that Im not aware of.   On its face I dont believe this is true, there likely is an important assumption missing like perhaps every single inch of the site is covered.  Also even if the absolute outputs of energy are the same because solar isnt going to always deliver a steady planed  amount of power output, peaker power plants are going to be needed when days are shady etc. changing the economics.   \nThe FORM of energy matters, Nuclear power plants run for months at full capacity and when they need to be out of service that is planned ahead of time to occur during times of the year when demand is lower.  My job at Enron was to know everything about every Nuclear power plant in the country because there was a lot of money to be made in predicting if one wouldnt be able to produce.<p>The compressed air storage investment that PG recently made is all about the timing and form of energy, being able to shift those has a LOT of economics value.\nPG",1353810534.0

68,4827052,story,,,1,2,imechura,Ask HN: Java or Python - Stack Selection for Enterprise Apps,,"Hi All,\nI'm aware of the current trend to build SAAS based web applications. I have an idea for an application that would contain sensitive IT information targeted for large enterprises.<p>The CIO's and CTO's I've worked with in the past would want an onsite solution for this type of application and it would probably not be targeted well for smaller companies. Also most decision makers at the companies I would target would want a solution integrated with their internal security infrastructure (SiteMider, LDAP, Active Directory, etc).<p>My background with webapps is mainly in three stacks Python/Django, PHP/codeigniter and Java/Spring. My preference is to work with python/django and I feel it would be more than capable for this offering not to mention bringing the app to market faster, however I am afraid that IT rules, politics, internal standards could make it more difficult for me to close sales if I go the python route.<p>The downside to developing in the Java/Spring stack is the time and effort involved in development. The upside is that Java on Tomcat appears to be the defacto standard for enterprise installations. It certainly is not hurting the adoption of Atlassian products.<p>Does anyone have some insight from with this aspect of product development to help me steer my stack selection decision?<p>Thanks,\nIan",1353809659.0
