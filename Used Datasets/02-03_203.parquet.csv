You would use any GSM phone.  More importantly, they allowed you to use any feature on your phone.  Conceding to Apple control of the apps on your phone was a very radical idea at the time.  Typically carriers dictated what application would be on the phone.  On Verizon, you had to use their phones (there was some lipservice around this time about allowing any <i>fully compatible</i> phone on its network).  In addition, included features such as bluetooth PC syncing, which had zero impact on the network, was disabled on my Nokia candybar.

For example, a C-Corp allows you a variety of different classes of shares.  Generally the only time this option is realistic is if you will be guaranteed a large source of income at least 200k plus or a huge influx of funding.  Lastly, C-Corps are the most stable entities with the most case-law.<p>LLCs are agile, quick and lean.  But, as an investment vehicle there are variety of problems that are related to tax and legal issues.  Its great for a company that's starting out small, but you'll have to pay the self-employment tax on all earnings (15.3%).<p>S-Corps are awesome for small business as well because you avoid paying self-employment tax (15.3%).  Theres a bit more paper work but if your bootstrapping then its definitely an awesome option.<p>I'm not going to get into all that much detail about the LLC and S-Corp but I did write a blog post of them with more detail at:\n<a href=""<a href=""http://www.thekenggroup.com/2010/04/26/incorporation-%E2%80%93-part-deux>s-corp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thekenggroup.com/2010/04/26/incorporation-%E2%80%...</a> and llcs</a><p>Please note that if you incorporate in NYS, there a few quirks you should realize.  First, you have to pay a fee here no matter what every year, used to be 300 dollars for city and state but they recently changed it to 100 dollars total.  Also, NYC does NOT recognize the S-Corp status and they also consider an LLC an ""unincorporated business"" for taxes.  Setting up shop in NY can be pricey in general, but if you're located here your going to have to pay these costs either way.<p>Lastly, Delaware is often cited because they have assloads of caselaw or guidance for how a legal issue is going to play out.  Corps like certainty and Delaware provides that, more importantly, Delaware is majority ownership friendly.  Delaware will generally side with the majority stockholder for any reasonable business decision.<p>Hope this helped.",1279593699.0

Part of the whole problem with Jobs' handling of this is that he has repeatedly failed to tell the truth (at very least not the whole truth, but arguably he has lied in an absolute sense).   To be specific:  Jobs stated that all phones have this flaw.  But <i>all phones do not have this flaw</i>.   The flaw is that the phone has an antenna that is shorted by the user holding it a normal way.   No other phones have this flaw.   It is an outright lie.   Jobs himself made a big deal on stage about how no other phones have this kind of antenna when he was selling it as a good thing.  Now he says that all phones have the same problems that are caused by this unique antenna design.  No they don't.  It's a lie.<p>The real tactic here is simply to gloss over the truth and hope you get away with it - at the moment I'm not sure whether Jobs has or not.",1279593570.0

To get the signal to degrade I had to hold it in a position essentially embedding in the lower left corner of the phone in my palm while holding it unnaturally tight. Then there was only a single bar loss in signal.  Holding the phone in a comfortable left or right handed position had no effect on the signal. If there would have not been the news around it I would have never noticed it. Even the technology press seems to be degenerating to Fox.,1279592029.0
