The tactics listed in this post are mostly for distributive bargaining, which works more when you have some set pie that you're dividing up (it's a zero-sum game), as opposed to coming up with out-of-the-box solutions, and particularly if you don't expect to have to deal with the other person again. Part of the beginning of a negotiation is figuring out which path the negotiation is going to go down. Textbooks on negotiation cover both - distributive approaches just make for better ""quick advice"" and ""self help"" content, particularly since advice on integrative approaches is a bit less actionable.",1304132191.0

Consider a salary negotiation for a entry-level software engineering position. Both parties know generally what the range could be. In Arizona, it is roughly $40k to $100k. That's a fairly big range. The first offer always narrows this range. If the applicant said he was looking for at least $50k, then the employer would magically be right inline with that (assuming their willingness was at least that) when they may have well had an expected range of up to $80k.<p>If the first offer is wildly favorable for the receiving party, you generally hear ""that's about what I was thinking too.""
