Paradigmatic means that two words occur with similar other words, e.g. these two words typically have the same word immediately to their left, like ""blue"" and ""azure"". Syntagmatic means that the words typically co-occur in usage, like ""blue"" and ""sky"".

Green is what you experience when (roughly) the difference between the amount of light w/ those wavelengths and the amount of light w/ wavelengths outside that range is greater than it was a (temporally) little while ago, or in comparison with the light coming in from areas nearby, and strongly affected by reasoning about what color the object ""should"" be, and what the quality of light is that is hitting the object. As you say, green is a ""feeling"", not embodied in the light itself, but only meaningful in the brain. So the ""color"" of a neutral gray card (or even something which emits no light at all) surrounded by a bright red object or looked at just after a bright red object is just as ""legitimately"" green as the light reflected from a ""green"" piece of paper or emitted by a ""green"" LED.",1289009386
