I know little of US tax laws but in my country if an arrangement has no legitimate purpose other than to minimize tax then it can be seen as tax evasion and the tax department can choose to tax under an alternative regime that they decide matches its ""true"" nature.  Similar to how if you claim to be a contractor but you do all your work for one company they can decide to treat you as an employee.

The core issue is <i>lack of hope.</i> When hope is gone, all is lost.<p>And then you see someone driving by in their brand new Mercedes, and you can see in their faces that they've never had to work a day in their lives, it fills you with a boiling rage at the unfairness of the world.

Growing up, the only times I went hungry were when I was too lazy to cook - there was always food in the house. So I was kind of naive. I remember my father (he was a pastor) once telling a congregation that he told the Lord that if he ever reached a point where he couldn't feed his family, he would just run away. So I didn't really know the facts of life.<p>Now, the veil is being lifted.<p>This, perhaps, is where religion is most useful. If you can convince the poor that there is some sort of 'divine plan,' then people can come to terms with their suffering.<p>On my way to work each morning, I pass people in the streets, begging alms. They gather at the stoplights, and come to the car windows with their hands outstretched. That is their life, day in day out. Are their lives <i>really</i> worth living? I'm not sure.

You don't want to use mutt's built-in IMAP support because it has to load a message (if it hasn't already been read) each time you to move to the next one. So rather than being able to zip through 1000 new messages in a mailing list every night without any delays, you have to sit there waiting a half second for each one to load as you read. Doesn't sound like much until you realize that's adding 10 minutes to a routine that would otherwise take about 20 or 30.<p>The setup shown in linked article is ok. But there's a better way.<p><a href=""http://wiki.github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/</a><p>Creates a maildir from an IMAP account. Syncs read/unread, new messages, IMAP folder moves both ways. Supports filtering, renaming/mapping, and more. Has a special Gmail mode. I run mine on a cron job to pull new mail from various accounts every few hours, and then go through all of my mail once every couple of days when I feel like it.<p>I can run it on multiple computers to keep them all in sync. Unread/read status is correct and synched across multiple machines, messages aren't deleted from the server when you fetch them, reading messages is super fast, I can still use other IMAP clients if I want (like GUI clients, or my phone). Love it to death.<p>It's not updated very frequently anymore (at all?) but it still seems to work.

The said ""This judicial direction has resulted in substantial economic, technological, and societal benefit because software patents promote innovation both within and beyond the field of software"" and had a footnote to elaborate on that point.<p>The footnote said:<p>""Without the benefit of patent protection, software companies would be forced to rely on secrecy which limits the public’s ability to learn from software innovations, since patent documents are a significant source of technological disclosure. See, e.g., In re Alappat, 33 F.3d 1526, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Newman, J., concurring). Given the reality that software source code is human readable, and object code can be reverse engineered, it is difficult for software developers to resort to secrecy. Thus, without patent protection, the incentives to innovate in the field of software are significantly reduced. Patent protection has promoted the free sharing of source code on a patentee’s terms—which has fueled the explosive growth of open source software development.""<p>Another interesting brief was the one from the FSF. They spent <i>13</i> <i>pages</i> on their ""Interest of Amicus Curiae"" section (where the submitter explains why they have an interest in the case). That's something like 40% of their brief.<p>In this 13 pages, they talk about how Linux should be called GNU/Linux, the 1992 US Air Force contract with NYU to produce a GPLed ADA compiler, how RMS is a genius, and much more.
