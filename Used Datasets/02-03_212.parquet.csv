That creates a situation where sharing software is almost always the better opion than not sharing it (cheaper, easier, faster, stronger  etc).<p>If somebody creates a complex non business-critical piece of infrastructure, they have incentive to open source it. Because By doing so they can still use it as before, but get bug fixes and additional features for free from the community.<p>If I create an improvement for that open source code base, I also have an economical incentive to share that improvement back to the maintainers. Because I too can give it away while keeping it. If it gets merged, others maintain it for me, and all future updates to the software already contain my improvement. If I keep that improvement to myself, I have to patch all future versions of the software myself, which becomes harder over time as the software changes.
