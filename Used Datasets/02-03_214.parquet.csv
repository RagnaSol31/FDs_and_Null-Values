Bones?<p>""I'm perplexed by people who initiate insane diets that deviate from the dietary habits of humans for thousands of years;""<p>The Inuit, Athabaskans, the Siberians, and Masai, and many other groups of people are keto or close.<p>""I agree that less intake, more exercise is vague advice, but aren't nutritionists a better source of advice? ""<p>The ADA is unfortunately sponsored by many fast food companies like Coca Cola. My own story is that I started the course track in undergrad to become a dietician, but switched out because I was frustrated with it. I was mildly overweight at the time, but my main problem was continuous GI issues (IBS and GERD). The school dietician (who was VERY overweight and a professor for some of my nutrition classes) told me to eat more fiber, low fat, and that I could control my symptoms with medication if that didn't work. It didn't work and the medications I had to go on had significant side effects.<p>Thanks to googling and messing around on Pubmed, I found some small promising studies with low-carb and GI problems and decided to try them for myself, even though they violated the typical advice for my condition (low-fat, high fiber). And it worked really well. And I also lost weight. And felt awesome.<p>Later on the internet the FODMAPs concept for GI problems, which is hilariously popular with Australian dietitians, but unheard of in the US until recently because US curricula is so miserable outdated and slow to change. FODMAPs is a diet that restricts certain types of foods that ferment in the colon. And because it only restricts certain carbs, I have been able to broaden my diet significantly.<p>In the end, I have more time to hack my own condition and read random crap on the internet than any dietician or doctor ever will.",1344740374.0

15,4371670,comment,4371057.0,4371057.0,7,0,peterwwillis,,,"Obesity and Fitness are not revolutionized by a forum full of people telling you what worked for them. The revolution comes when people find what works for themselves. So far, it's very far away.<p>News flash: Most people don't go on Reddit. <i>gasp</i> Calm down. I'm sorry I frightened you. But it turns out you don't get a revolution by a small number of people who use a particular forum looking for fitness tips from their formely fat peers.<p>In the future, you will be able to go online, fill out a questionnaire, and for a small monthly fee receive one of several pre-programmed diet and exercise programs, complete with local gyms that are part of the program and can help you perform your exercise requirements. A local food store will also be part of the program, with a special aisle of diet food for you to buy from. The solution comes from tailored, marketed, cult-of-the-self products that suck you in for long enough to make a dent.<p>The problem I see with the fitness portion is creating a fitness product without real user engagement. You've seen it before plenty of times: CrossFit. P90X. Tae Bo. Yoga. The Brazilian Butt Lift. They can all pretty much work to get you in better shape, but there's nothing keeping a random person engaged in it enough to continue for long. For someone starting out for the first time, they have to have an enormous amount of motivation to continue once they see how difficult it will be to begin.<p>To my mind, the easiest way to get people stuck on fitness is to Facebook it. Make it addictive and interesting, and make them obsessed with how they are doing. Give them micro stats. Gimmicks and social fluff to turn it into a game. Anything to keep them hooked, to the point where the exercise is just a small component to them. The diet becomes the same, giving lots of interesting variables and an infinite number of simple user-friendly options to continue getting healthy while being obsessed with a new toy.<p>If it's done right, they'll have gone weeks with the program, eating right, and working hard, and suddenly find they've made some noticeable gains. The rest takes care of itself. The revolution comes when people don't really notice that they're being healthy.",1344739860.0

I don't want a different IDE for each language. I want one Editor to Rule Them All.<p>Making the infrastructure to understand a programming language shareable between all the ways to edit/refactor/analyze code in that language is far from dumb. It's something Eclipse/IntelliJ/VisualStudio should have done a long long time ago. Heck I once attempted to pick apart the tooling in Eclipse into something I could use headless without booting the entire thing and the code was so tightly integrated into their GUI I gave up in disgust. I mean this is architecture 101. Clear API's and division of labor should have been on everyone's mind but instead the whole thing is a pile of spaghetti code.<p>Even something as simple as a CLI interface to your IDE's language support features so I could integrate them into editor of my choice would have been smart. But no one did that. I work with 4 different languages minimum every day at work. I'm not going to context switch my editor/IDE for each one of them. For this reason I'm cheering Yegge on like mad.<p>(Full disclosure: I work at google same as Yegge. I've had these opinions for longer than I've worked there though.),1344737551.0

Teaching yourself to read and do math before most children can use complete sentences requires something more than pure effort.  My son is well above average, but there is absolutely no way that it would be possible to get him to work hard enough to compare with average high school seniors on the SATs before he was 10, let alone scoring near the top.
