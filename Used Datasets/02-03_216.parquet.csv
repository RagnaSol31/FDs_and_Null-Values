It was really painful, because my internet would go out sporadically for at least a minute every once in a while. My problem was also too much noise coming from a crowded apartment complex.<p>The solution I found was to upgrade to a 5 GHz router. The one I bought can transmit on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, but I configured it to only transmit on 5 GHz. This forces my computer to always use the 5 GHz connection, which has less noise. The 5 GHz signal decays faster when it goes through walls, so the signal will not be as strong as a 2.4 GHz would, but the signal-to-noise ratio will be much better because 5 GHz is significantly less crowded.",1423364082.0
