27,1376296,comment,1375823.0,1375823.0,0,0,eklitzke,,,"One solution that Steve didn't discuss is JSON. To be fair, JSON wasn't that popular in 2005, but it's still a great solution.<p>The way it works is that their are no mandatory newline characters in JSON. Whitespace between lexical elements is ignored, and any embedded newlines in strings can be escaped (i.e. as \n). So a log format that a few people are using today is like this:<p>{'kind': 'foo', 'id': 1, 'msg': 'hi'}\n{'kind': 'bar', 'id': 2, 'msg': 'there'}<p>Each log message takes up a single line in the file. You can trivially deserialize any line to a real data structure in your language of choice. You can (mostly) grep the lines, and they're human readable. I do this at work, and frequently have scripts like this:<p>scribereader foo | grep 'some expression' | python -c 'code here'<p>In this case we're storing logs in the format described above (a single JSON message per line), and scribereader is something that groks how scribe stores log files and outputs to stdout. The grep expression doesn't <i>really</i> understand JSON, but it catches all of the lines that I actually want to examine, and the false positive rate is very low (<0.1% typically). The final part of the pipe is some more complex python expression that actually introspects the data it's getting to do more filtering. You can of course substitute ruby, perl, etc. in place of the python expression.<p>I feel like this is a pretty good compromise between greppability, human readability, and the ability to programatically manipulate log data.",1274755177

Other browsers of that era implemented the API as well so it became a bit of pseudo-standard. It's been updated over the years in various ways, some bad, some good — allowing bidirectional interaction with JS and not requiring the plugin to render something to the page are probably the main improvements to note.<p>NPAPI is useful in the context of Chrome extensions as it is the only method (currently) available for running native code in an extension. Firefox extensions are able to bundle NPAPI plugins in this manner as well however this is a less common approach as XPCOM components are generally a better fit for that environment.<p>One notable difference between extensions in Firefox and in Chrome is that Chrome allows you to specify that a plugin is only executable by your extension; a handy thing as you may not want any arbitrary web page to run your plugin (XPCOM components are not by default accessible via any old webpage).<p>Internet Explorer no longer supports NPAPI which is why ActiveX support is a useful target.<p>Native Client as far as I understand is targeted more towards producing one-off executables rather than reusable components.",1274753618
