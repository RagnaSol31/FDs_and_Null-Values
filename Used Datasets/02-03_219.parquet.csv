40,1111361,comment,1110689.0,1110689.0,0,0,jerf,,,"""Time to play"" is a big factor, certainly. I've been playing Bayonetta lately, a Devil May Cry-style fighter, and while I'm pretty sure I have the raw skills to master the game, I sure don't have the <i>time</i>. (Or, if I had the time, the desire. But I certainly don't have the time.) I'm not lost in the action on the screen or incapable of understanding what I should do or what's going on, I simply don't have the time to put that stuff in my cerebellum where it needs to be to play at the highest level. For example, in the ""Hard"" mode, there are sounds that when you hear them need to immediately trigger a particular button press (dodge), ideally with a high degree of accuracy as well. I can do it when I concentrate, but you need to be able to do it without concentrating because there's other stuff to concentrate on, too.<p>But I also observe that these are also exactly the games you hear about the younger folk being so dominating in, that is, the games you need to have the time to download reflexes into the lower brain.<p>Oh, I don't deny that you get worse as you get older, nice and slow so as you can pretend it's not happening, and in a hypothetical fair fight my 15-year-old self could presumably beat my 30-year-old self in reaction-based gaming. But I don't think that explains the utter domination, I think that explains only a small part of the difference. The utter domination comes from having the time to train reflexes.<p>Also, interesting counterpoint: <a href=""http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=1399"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=1399</a> , the part in the first blockquote.<p>The other thing I would observe is that the controllers I grew up on were <i>terrible</i>. Everything pre-Nintendo was mushy and introduced what I now consider readily-visible latency into the game control. In hindsight, the Genesis controls were pretty mushy too, and even the Nintendo I call out was noticably more mushy than the Super Nintendo controller, the oldest controller I can still use today without cursing at the latency. This robbed my generation of valuable years of high-feedback gaming. I've played some of these old games in emulation in the past few years, and they are distinctly easier than I remember them, and I think that's mostly because when I play them in emulation I'm using modern controllers. (In particular, I played Beamrider on the Atari 2600 with original controllers and on the GBA through the Atari collection cartridge, and on my first try on the GBA I got further in the game than I could back when I was 12 or so on the original controllers. (If you think that doesn't jive with my age, you're right; it was old even by then, but the device was still functional. Those 2600s were pretty robust.))",1265682890.0

I'm pretty sure we can figure out how to make a turbine that works and harness solar & wind power efficiently and reliability. I have doubts we can convince OPEC nations to keep selling us cheap oil as their production peaks and declines in the near future. I have doubts that the existing energy cartels will ever invest serious time and resources into making carbon energy cleaner. I have serious long term doubts that we can continue to extract carbon energy sources from the Earth in the required quantities to provide energy for 6 billion+ people.

We all make our mark as we go and we want to write about it. We know and understand the oral traditions of our own generation but what gets passed down from one generation to another is that which is put into writing (or that is otherwise preserved in some lasting form). And that is what is fascinating about history: seeing what the men and women living in a particular time and place had to say about what they were doing and why there were doing it. Such writings bring to life the world in which they found themselves - its problems and challenges, its hopes and fears, its expectations for the betterment of the society in which they lived. Thus, it is <i>contemporaneous</i> writings and chronologies, not necessarily written self-consciously as history, that make for a fascinating view of the human condition in any given age. And this in turn inspires or depresses, as the case may be, but inevitably offers lessons on how the world might be profitably viewed and shaped to those who are attuned to learning from those who have preceded them in facing life's challenges.<p>The more common approach to how history is taught is to wade through survey books done by academics who have tried to sum up ages long gone by while sitting in their remote seats of learning. This can work, depending on the imaginative strength of the historian, but it is inherently inferior (in my view) to a study of history based of immersing oneself in original materials from the era itself. The survey emphasizes ""facts"" as ends in themselves; the absorption of original materials, in contrast, gives one the sense of a living drama of life, where the ""facts"" are indeed important but only as woven into the desires and yearnings of the generation that lived out its challenges and then sat down to write about them.<p>History can be invaluable to our learning but, unless it is well taught, we can so easily miss its significance. The author of this piece emphasizes this point and is correct in it. But the ""original source"" idea adds an important dimension that is missing from his analysis, though it is, in my view, perhaps the most important piece of all.",1265682074.0

Opportunities for tax avoidance increase substantially as your business gets more complicated and your resources for researching the tax law get bigger.
