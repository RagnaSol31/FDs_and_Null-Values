For example, if the sun came up and in 6 minutes your solar power station went from producing 0 to producing 2.2 gigawatts, that would be an increase of 22 gigawatts per hour.

If your intended use overlaps with an existing license that has exclusivity, you can't use it. Even if you're the first one in, your use affects the remaining licensable rights in the image.<p>Let's take the katana image, f'rinstance. You want to use it for your French-language extreme cookery magazine? Cool. That leaves the image available for the Karate-gi supplier's worldwide site and catalog, as well as for publication in languages other than French (unless you wanted a worldwide print publication exclusive). If you want first publication rights and exclusivity for a year, you've tied up all other rights in the image.<p>The rights you want in the image may or may not be available, and if they are available, they will determine the licensing fee because they affect the remaining rights. If you go to a place like iStockphoto, you don't get any kind of exclusivity, and can find that every one of your competitors are using exactly the same images you are using. Oh, and so is the weekend ""contractor"" down the streetyou know, the guy with the Skilsaw, cordless drill/driver and Workmate who ruins people's bathrooms and kitchens (but is <i>so</i> affordable).

With a SEM you only get to look at the surface of things, which is going to be either glass or metal or polysilicon.  The only way to see a transistor in a sem is if you chemically remove all the top layers (which are the connections between transistors), or perform a cross section.<p>In the cross section case you are going to see a few dozen transistors out of the millions in a design of any complexity.<p>It would be remotely feasible to discover some sort of shenanigans if you knew the exact layout of the design, which would basically mean you are a foundry yourself.  In that case you might get lucky and spot some difference between the mask you made, and the mask that was used to produce the part under inspection.<p>But the scales involved make this not believable to me.  It would be roughly like scanning the whole of, say, America, and checking every street and intersection of every town, and comparing it against some known quantity to see if something changed in Springfield Missouri.<p>Maybe somebody could automate this, but the chemical processes for removing layers is less than perfect.  Those strands of metal stretching across the ASIC have some built in tension, and if you remove the layer of glass above them, then tend to spring up and jumble.  Good luck trying to do something with that.",1338173478.0

I'm currently slowly working my way through a text on Information Geometry and another on Ideals and varieties. There is only a limited time one can devote to constant learning so I try to learn things that cut through as much territory as possible. I feel strong discomfort when reading about subjects like say machine learning where a lot of stuff is seemingly arbitrary rules of thumb* .<p>Turns out that a bunch of geometric ideas that are useful in physics also unify ML concepts. The idea of Information Geometries. There are three ways I have seen the concept used. One is based on differential geometry and treats sets of probability distributions as manifolds and their parameters as coordinates. Many concepts are unified and tricky ideas become tautologies within a solid framework (fisher information as a metric) <a href=""http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notabene/info-geo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notabene/info-geo.html</a> .<p>The other approach is in terms of varieties from algebraic geometry.  Here statistical models of discrete random variables are the zeros of certain sets of polynomials (which describe hypertetrahedrons).  Graphical models (hidden markov models, neural nets, bayes nets) are all treated on one footing.<p>The final approach is an interesting set of techniques where a researcher abstracts Information retrieval with methods from quantum mechanics. The benefit is that you get a basic education in the math of QM as well.<p>* Arbitrary in the sense that you just have to accept a lot things that only become less fuzzy in time. Where as a proper framework provides handholds that reward effort with proportional amounts of understanding. The last time I felt this way was when I was first learning functional programming 7 years ago. The terminology was different and heavy going from imperative programming but I knew the rewards in understanding, expressiveness and flexibility would be well worth the effort. Confusion dissipated linearly with effort (unlike C++'s nonlinear relationship) and I knew that I was picking up a bunch of CS theory at the same time that would make learning programming (and C++) much easier.",1338171537.0

69,4031676,comment,4030665.0,4031008.0,4,0,Nutella2,,,"Most languages were proprietary and expensive through the 80s.  When C took off it wiped out (or much reduced) the use of expensive proprietary languages.  C was free so a lot of people learned it in university and wanted to use it on the job later because they were used to it.  Since it was free it was easy to introduce to companies.  It established a base and then when Java came out in 1995, also free but a higher level language than C, it took off like a rocket.  Now the idea of expensive proprietary languages seems absurd.<p>Many tools have been developed that support C-family languages and most programmers depend on those tools.  It's a huge job to move out of that and into an image-based language like Smalltalk because everything changes at once.  That's a major reason why new frameworks like node.js or Rails can take off quickly now:  They fit into most programmers' normal workflow so they are easy to adopt.<p>I worked in an image-based language in the 80s and it drove me crazy that I didn't have diff and grep.  I was glad to leave that language when I moved on to a job that used a conventional text-file language.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who found it awkward.",1338171413.0
