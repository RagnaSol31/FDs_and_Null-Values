Unless you get everyone to switch to it, you will be disabled whenever you switch to someone else's computer, a kiosk, etc. Why bother?<p>He mentions having switched to biphasic sleep. If he said- I don't use electricity at night and just go to bed and wake up with the light, then if he got up during the dark hours, that's fine. But scheduling it and forcing your body into a strange deprived sleep pattern is bad for you. Napoleon slept ~4 hrs a night. He was successful for a time, well- except for attempting and failing to conquer the world. Poor decisions may not have been made with more sleep.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphasic_sleep"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphasic_sleep</a><p>So, that leads us up to the 30/30 work cycle.

From my experience, an average college student in Ireland might expect to binge drink twice a week, on Thursdays and Saturdays; on Thursdays with your fellow students because it's the last night of the week before a lot of people go home for the weekend (it's a small country), and on Saturday with your friends at home.<p>I say average, because what we'd want to call alcoholism would go further than what's normal in the society; it would need to be drinking to excess to escape your life, and ending up with other problems, like being kicked out of places, waking up in strange places (possibly with strange people), not remembering the details of the night before until you piece it all together out of fragmentary memories, passing out in parties, pubs, clubs etc. These are a couple of stages beyond mere ""binge drinking"".",1289357816.0

10,1888948,comment,1887306.0,1888423.0,0,0,Perceval,,,"The article intimates at the answer to why alcohol withdrawal can be more difficult and dangerous than hard drugs. Recall the part where they explain how cocaine and heroin and speed only work on one neurotransmitter principally, whereas alcohol works on a large number (dopamine, seratonin, GABA, norepinephrine, etc)â€”scalpel vs. hand grenade.<p>So in withdrawing from cocaine or heroin or nicotine you can prescribe someone a drug that works on the relevant receptors, blocking or even reversing the effect of the drug. For example, I recall that buproprion is prescribed to treat nicotine addiction because it blocks nicotine's effect on norepinephrine receptors.  The strategy with heroin or cocaine withdrawal might be similar, targeting the opioid or dopamine receptors respectively.<p>Contrast this with the wider effects of alcohol, influencing half a dozen or more neurotransmitters.  There's no easy strategy to target the chemical dependencies your brain has built up because there're too many.<p>So while heroin and cocaine are more immediately addictive than alcohol, withdrawal from alcoholism (once it has developed) can be just as dangerous and sometimes more so.",1289357522.0

32,1888924,comment,1888295.0,1888367.0,0,0,bluesnowmonkey,,,"I started working from home about five months ago.  I lived alone.  It took a couple of months for the social isolation to take effect, but it was severe.  I didn't realize at the time how much of my drive at work came from collaboration, both cooperative and competitive.  I like the joy of achieving things as part of a team, and I like the challenge of trying to be the best.  (Yeah, that's not always great for team dynamics.)  With nothing to prove and no one to help or to help me, my productivity tanked.<p>Three things really turned it around.  First was moving in with a roommate.  It provides some of the community at home that I used to get from the office.  Second was doing volunteer work.  In a way it's a huge waste of time, but the feeling of accomplishment is irreplaceable.  (Lot of women there too... just saying.)  Third is releasing code, parts of my project, as open source libraries.  Never mind that nobody uses or even looks at it--just the concept of making code public drives me to raise the quality bar, to keep it modular, and to get parts finished.  Instead of toiling away in preparation for one huge launch date, each module becomes a mini launch.<p>The conclusion I take from my experience is that telecommuting will foster communities, not scatter them.  There will be less demand for one-bedroom apartments and more for houses to be split by roommates.  We'll see more involvement in community activities and OSS.",1289356726.0

It works by allowing you mind to work on the problem while you play.<p>By the way, to let another secret out of the bag, this process of engineered distraction also works very well with teams.<p>Many times we confuse stubbornness with determination. Sitting there staring at the screen does not a work product make.<p>But I'll add one caveat -- the reason I got away from this (and am now only getting back to it) is because the internet itself has become the ""getting away"" activity. This leaves you at your desk checking emails, updating twitter, etc. In such a case, you're not allowing your subconscious to work on your problem at all. Instead, you're throwing a bunch more stuff at it. So in retrospect I think its critical to physically detach yourself from your technology. A stand-alone game would be fine. Sitting at the terminal listening to your email and IM chimes while you play a flash game would not.<p>EDIT: It's also interesting to note how hard it is to pull away from your work -- both when you're loving it and when you're hating it.

This is similar to the Twitter widget that displays your most recent tweets. This widget automatically polls for new content (every 30 seconds) and recently we have been embedded on several high traffic website. This is resulting in incredibly high server load.<p>Our widgets are receiving around 50/60 requests every second. These include both widgets loaded for the first time, and also subsequent requests where the widget asks for new content. We are running our database on a large instance using Amazon EC2. The database is not the problem, however. We recently moved the code that serves widget content onto a dedicated small server instance. Immediately traffic has been phenomenal and CPU usage is very high right now.<p>We operate under a LAMP environment using PHP as our server-side language and MySQL as our database platform. We take advantage of memcached by storing the content for 30 seconds at a time (this makes sense because our widget refreshes every 30 seconds). This means that on most occasions the content that is served comes directly from memory (with 0 queries being executed). After a request is sent, we deliver back HTML content. We know that it would be smarter to return simple JSON containing only the newest updates. This is something we will implement.<p>It seems that with 50/60 requests coming in every second, even though the majority of the content never makes a request to the Database, the sheer volume of traffic is what is killing the CPU.<p>Do you have any suggestions on how to handle this smart?<p>Move to a Large instant on Amazon to serve widget content?\nScale horizontally with small instances and load balance them on Amazon?\nCould PubSubHubBub be used to push new content to the widgets? I would love more information.\nIs memcached having any effect on CPU - since there is such high traffic?\nShould the widget be served using Java?<p>Thank you ver much!",1289355701.0
