It's just a childish phrase used to indicate dislike for something. If you don't like the ""it's offensive to use a phrase indicating some form of developmental disorder as a pejorative"", then please consider the argument that it accomplishes and communicates nothing except the fact that the speaker / writer lacks the ability or motivation to articulate his objections.",1347850713.0

I need to consume a number of domain specific java libraries, and the native support for logic programming with core.logic and datalog is a big win. Clojure certainly wasn't the easiest choice - I would be much further ahead if I started with Ruby.<p>> Clojure to me seems like a language culture that would likely tend towards smaller libraries that do specific things than something with batteries included and such like Rails.<p>I should clarify that I think Clojure's favouring of smaller composable libraries is ultimately a better approach than the monolithic framework.

The liberal cryptographers will design dozens of protocol implementations with starry-eyed visions of new unformalized properties that don't actually exist. Most will be used in places where TLS would have sufficed and most of them will be broken. But eventually <i>something</i> new will come out this mess, provide enough advantages to gain traction, and become hardened canon over the years. Conservative philosophy will never design a crypto protocol, but it will prevent a lot of damage from the redundant badly-designed protocols.
