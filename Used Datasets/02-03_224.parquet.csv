The 3GS is much faster, such that I don't feel like I experience lag in most operations.  I had no idea that improving the speed could make such a difference in the entire usability of the device.<p>I am now using my iPhone more than I had ever used previous versions.  I think because the time to accomplish a task is so much shorter, I find more opportunities to use it.  I'm using the browser more, because the speed is close to a regular computer (or at least feels like it is).  Sure, the screen is small for browsing, but I'm finding myself using double-tap to quickly zoom in and out of parts of the page (whereas before I used a lot of pinch zooming), and panning around the page is quick and painless now (I think it holds more of the rendered page in memory and has to re-render less).<p>I don't know if my next phone will be an iPhone or Android, but I do know one thing: it will be fast.<p>Warning on the 3G and iOS4: Iif you upgrade to iOS 4 on your 3G, you may fall into the large subset of people who are experiencing <i>extreme</i> slowdowns.  I was one of those people.  I had never seen such terrible slowdowns on an iPhone.  With a bit of hacking, you can downgrade back to 3.1.2 or 3.1.3, but it's not supported by Apple and requires some 3rd-party tools.  There are supposed fixes for this (such as turning off spotlight), but I'd suggest waiting for this to get ironed out before moving to iOS 4.  Maybe 4.1 will fix things.  iOS 4 doesn't give the 3G much of value anyway.",1281495221.0

And technology often offers increasing returns to expertise and experience rather than headcount.<p>Thus, if faced with a choice between hiring 5% more employees, or doing other things (such as capital investments or new incentives) to get 5% more productivity from existing workers, the latter is becoming more attractive. Hence, fewer employees -- but employees that are higher-paid and higher-skilled.<p>(Many of the things intended to help low-wage and low-skill workers -- minimum wages, minimum benefits packages, new legal protections -- actually wind up raising the breakeven point for taking such workers on. Businesses then prefer other less-labor-intensive strategies to increase production, and the intended beneficiaries of these policies wind up worse off.

It's going to be years, if not a decade before I can get FiOS here. The reason Comcast is the only carrier in my area is a result of taking government out of the equation. The big telecom companies don't give back to the government that gives them the tax breaks and concessions that allowed them to become big companies in the first place. At every opportunity they get, they seek to undercut the very country that makes their existence possible.<p>Take Comcast for example. In Pennsylvania, we have special zoning for dilapidated parts of cities and towns that are designed to encourage renewal - Keystone Opportunity Zones. Google 'em for more detail, but essentially, businesses in a KOZ don't have to pay state or local taxes.<p>When Comcast announced it was building their HQ in center city Philly (which, despite the piss smell, is hardly dilapidated) they lobbied HARD to get the zoning changed on their plot of land to a KOZ so that they wouldn't have to pay state or local taxes. Sure, they're bringing in jobs, and those people are taking trains into the city and driving cars into the city, and roads and train tracks totally just maintain themselves.<p>I don't give 'government' a free pass, but I absolutely lean toward government - an entity that arose to further civilization, believe it or not - over corporation, which is entirely selfish. Both can do good and bad, both can be abused.<p>. . . . . . . \nMy own experience and why I'm pro net-neutrality:<p>For the first few months that I lived in the city, Hulu was a stuttering mess. We have cable internet, which wasn't as fast as the FiOS we had in the suburbs (which was both faster and cheaper), but was by no means so slow that Hulu should have to buffer. YouTube worked fine. Downloads were fine, but Hulu? Couldn't get through a half hour show without three or four pauses to buffer.<p>It took a number of complaints to Comcast, and maybe it had something to do with me whinging on my twitter account with the 8000 followers, but after a number of phone calls, Hulu suddenly worked fine.<p>I can't stand watching cable television, our entertainment center is a Dell Zino HD hooked up to a wall mounted LCD, and we watch Hulu and Netflix almost exclusively. Do you think Comcast are sitting on their thumbs while Hulu eats their lunch? It's not like I can get anything else decent in the city.<p>If they can get away with crap like that, they will. That is why outside regulation needs to step in.",1281494191.0

Something is seriously messed up in the setup; Varnish can easily handle thousands of req/s for something as simple as looking up a cache entry and returning a static file for 100 clients.

Flawed benchmark testing procedure<p>You can't expect a simple `ab -c 100 -n 10000` to provide any insight whatsoever towards the general handling of a server. The only thing obvious is that Litespeed has been saturated with 100 concurrent connections. If you're going to do a benchmark, you must post varying concurrency levels at least (along with exact setup configurations). Likewise, cpu and memory usage are just as important to providing valuable insight.<p>4. Comparing apples to oranges<p>I'm not entirely sure what Litespeed is doing (eg. does it cache statically?) since you haven't specified it exactly, but considering that almost 70% of the requests failed and almost all requests after the first few had a different content length, I would assume that Litespeed is returning a dynamic request each time, whereas Varnish is returning a static file. I have no doubt in my mind that if you ran the same scenario (ie. Litespeed serving a static file as well) the results would be much different.<p>5. Irrelevant to the article benchmark<p>Saying ""But Nginx is a bit slower than Varnish"", then linking to a terrible <i>irrelevant</i> benchmark and using circular logic (based on another completely crap Litespeed vs Nginx for serving <i>php!?</i> benchmark) to infer that Varnish is faster than nginx hurts my brain.<p>I ran a really simple benchmark on Varnish 2.1.3 and nginx 0.8.49's proxy_cache directive on a single url; nginx is faster.<p>However, what if we test a heavy config with a bunch of complicated rules? Varnish's VCL compiles straight to C and might give it the edge in those cases. What if we use test a million different urls and really test how each one handles their cache hit/miss procedures. How do they fare under real world scenarios where thousands of different clients on various connection speeds are connected? I know nginx is damn efficient memory wise when dealing with a load of keepalives.<p>6. Conclusion<p>Good benchmarks are difficult.",1281493460.0

I think contracts between corporations and government that have the result of reducing competition in the marketplace should be legislated against.<p>Take a look at the competition that exists between ISPs in places like Europe or Australia to see how it could be. Capitalism works best when competition exists. Obviously it's in the best interest of corporations to attempt to reduce competition in their industry. That doesn't mean they should be free to do so.,1281493411.0
