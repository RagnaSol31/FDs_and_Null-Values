1,1496328,story,,,8,2,makecheck,Ask HN: How to deal with anonymous rants about your project,,"There are thousands of open-source projects out there, so lots of maintainers.  Who among you has seen this problem...<p>Basically, a user downloads your software, and finds a bug; but, instead of actually <i>telling</i> you about it, they angrily ""go public"" and rant somewhere.  If you're really unlucky, they'll choose a place with enough pageviews that your project's reputation is quickly tarred, and others wonder why they should even bother to download.<p>What's really insulting about this behavior, is that these are people who have sent no E-mail, filed no bug reports, and donated no money, code, time, or anything else.  The bugs can be obscure, and even hard to reproduce.  These people feel entitled to shred your years of work: they spend a few minutes clicking on something, and head straight for the forums.<p>How do you deal with this?<p>I can tell you as a maintainer that it hurts, but I still try to suck it up, and I respond to even destructive criticism with <i>action</i>.  If I can figure out what problem the person is referring to, I fix it, even if I'll never be able to tell them that it's fixed (and they probably wouldn't care if I did).<p>But sometimes I think people need to be educated again.  Clearly anonymous posters feel invincible in a way that wouldn't translate to real life.  Imagine coming to my house, receiving a wonderful free meal, and then throwing it in my face while screaming how horrible it is because it's missing a dash of salt?",1278557959.0

Microsoft's shareholders are not well served with stock in a company that's half mature, dividend-paying, high-market-share titan and half scrappy innovator.

For example, when you put an RSS feed on your site - a feed that a content site owner made available - you're keeping the user off the original content owner's site too.  Interestingly, the RSS feed that I pulled to put content into the app (<a href=""http://andrewtrusty.com/2009/06/29/readable-feeds/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andrewtrusty.com/2009/06/29/readable-feeds/</a> by Andrew Trusty) has 578,925 ""hits"" (don't know if he means subscribers).<p>So I guess in a round about way I'm asking, is taking that existing (awesome) and publicly available feed and putting it into a mobile app for consumption on the go what bothers you, or just the fact that the feed exists in the first place? - DROdio",1278555793.0
