For someone who is suddenly out of their comfort zone, I can understand the frustration. A few tips:<p>1. Before thinking of names, get meta. What's the company about, what would a ""good"" name connote, what are the ideas the name should express? Write down a narrative of all the awesome things the name should convey. If you're diligent in following this recommendation, all kinds of new ideas will emerge.<p>2. Say any potential names aloud. Do they roll off the tongue, or are they awkward tongue twisters?<p>3. Do your domain lookups via the command line, not some web site. It's been suggested that domain lookup sites snatch your queries and register them. True?

17,2659937,comment,2659012.0,2659012.0,1,0,JTfor2032,,,"There is no doubt that this is good cause.  Yet, there is much to be pessimistic about it. First off, it will be excruciatingly difficult to produce a documentary of decent quality, comparable to ones such as ""Inside Job"", with only a budget of 150,000 USD. You definitely need to look to acquire a budget of at least 300,000 USD. Secondly, this documentary is extremely vulnerable to being thwarted by the ""big six"" media corporations. The only thing that stands in the way of corporations having complete power over the American people and their government is pro net-neutrality regulations. We will of course witness the perhaps the most determined onslaught on a small organization than we have ever seen taken by the corporations. Finally, creating and releasing a documentary presents the challenging fact that the current political situation concerning net neutrality changes at a rapid rate. A couple of examples would be how Obama campaigned  on net neutrality, yet when he came into office his administration had corporations make a law that protected their interests over  individual citizens. The other example is how Meredith Baker approved the merger of Comcast and NBC Universal and then resigned from the FCC to become the leading lobbyist for Comcast. This ever changing nature of net neutrality would make it necessary to release the documentary shortly after it has been filmed.",1308192552.0
