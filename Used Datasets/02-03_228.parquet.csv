Spectacular Gigantic Unbreakable Security Chains</i><p>It reminds me of when I used to work in Holland and would cycle to the train station to commute to the office.<p>The train stations in most large cities have HUGE bicycle-carparks, literally bikes as far as the eye could see, so people would generally get in the habit of parking in the same spots.<p>Anyway, I had a fairly decent bike compared to most others around i.e. I bought it new from a shop so it had yet to get beatup and was given a huge cycle lock like this.<p>My colleagues used to say there was little chance of the bike being stolen.<p>One day I came back from work and returned to my bike only to find someone had broken the padlock (and it was a tough padlock) and stole the security chain leaving the bike.<p>I told my colleagues the next day and they laughed saying this was not unusual, often the chains are desired more than the bikes.<p>I didn't know how to feel as I kinda thought it was bad my bike was not stolen, given it was a decent new bike (and worth more than the security chain). I was told there is a certain etiquette where it is ok to ""borrow"" old, beatup bikes (especially if it is a cold night and you need to get home and live far away) and many people do it, but taking a new bike would be ""stealing"", the thief however probably ""needed"" and nice big chain for his new bike.<p>I like to think there is a certain truth to that (atleast for the place and time I was there) and to this day it is one of my favourite memories of that country.<p>Anyway, remember having a big chain is useless without a very good lock!",1232765531.0

Rather than making the world a better place by making intellectual property free, you're putting it into the hands of the very people many in this crowd hate.<p>I'm not saying that intellectual monopolies/oligarchies such as those seen in the 20th century are sensible; I'm merely saying that the free culture is, quite literally, economically retarded.  Allowing creatives and intellectuals to pursue their art as a profession is one of the greatest accomplishments of modern society, I think; even better is the fact that you can pursue these things and make a significant amount of money which can be used to do lots of interesting things.

As such, I would have to say that this is really a gift to the 18 year olds.<p>I often try to explain to my friends in Northern Europe (who are in their late teens, early 20s) that the average American doesn't read the newspaper.  They really don't believe me, but then they start to think about it and realize that this is one of the reasons we have such a ridiculous political system.  When you have a large populace that doesn't read, their source of news is entirely through sound bites; thus, everything becomes dumbed down and sensational (for example, Howard Dean yells at an event and is suddenly no longer a viable political candidate?
