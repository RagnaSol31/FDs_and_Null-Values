That being said, Japan has had similar technology for way longer.  While the marketing machine that is Apple made sure to let everyone know how magical/revolutionary/awesome/brilliant this form of payment it, Apple is late to the game.

Thanks Apple for finally catching up.<p>2) Apply Pay will, however, finally give cardless payment the push it needs.  Apple has the market power to get retailers to start (read: more than rarely) embrace this technology (for example: Passbook & tickets).  That I can fully support Apple for as the iPhone is the single best selling phone and will get NFC into the hands of millions very, very quickly.  And with the volume of devices + Apple&",
