When you come out and say it's only 20% probable for a given outcome to happen, and that outcome happens, it doesn't mean you were wrong, it just means a long shot happened. In fact, you would expect just about exactly 1 out of every 5 20% longshots to end up happening.",1282791554.0

Here's what I see as it's advantages over striking up face-to-face conversation:<p>1. the other people actually want to chat -- If the other people are signed on, then they're looking to chat and you're not interrupting the guy trying to read the paper.<p>1.5. the other people are also on messageparty -- which is a filter in itself, especially at this point. like begets like, and the chance of engaging conversation multiplies.<p>2. it's mass broadcast -- you're talking with everyone, not just one person, so you're more likely to find one person interesting among everyone at your location. I find this a much better than the ""live"" alternative of ""speed dating"" everyone at certain location just to engage in conversation that both parties actually care about.<p>3. people are uninterruptible -- just try getting 20 people talking in a room at the same time in the same place and still understand what's going on. with text chat, everyone's writing is on the screen and you don't miss a thing.<p>4. distance is relative -- sure, the hot chick 2 seats away from you in class is literally only 3 feet away, but the douchebag stranger between you two obviously won't appreciate being bothered.<p>5. as a student, i would totally use this in class -- sometimes you miss what the prof said, sometimes you just don't care what the prof says, or you want to find some tech-loving geeks to be in your study group<p>PS: for the founders -- please release for ipod touch and ipad wifi! we have (approximate) location abilities too!",1282791404.0

However, power consideration for portable devices further prefer PWM frequencies to range within, for example, 100-200 Hz. ...

No new powers can be created by not ruling. By definition nothing happens when refusing to hear a case.<p>2. Second reason no new powers were created: The 4th Amendment to the US Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The 9th Circuit has interpreted GPS to not be an unreasonable search and seizure. Therefore the restriction on government never existed because the Constitution does not protect people against reasonable searches. The police power to install GPS devices on cars was not abolished when the 4th Amendment went into effect 220 years ago. No new powers because the power existed 220 years ago.",1282790139.0

Twitter, Google, Yahoo, and Facebook all fall into this category.  Data driven companies derive their primary business value from the quality and quantity of their underlying data.  They give away their software because it is free PR, endears developers to their platforms and it is a big morale booster for their engineers.  Google will never give away its search index.  Facebook and Twitter will never give away dumps of their graphs.  Those things are the crown jewels, not the software that supports them.<p>The other kind of company that benefits from open source is companies like Red Hat, Basho and Opscode.

Basically, a potentially interesting topic that could have generated interesting comments and discussion is forever buried because it was submitted at a low activity time and never got any traction.<p>My thought, would it not make sense when someone submits a duplicate that is far enough away from the original, but still within a reasonable time frame like more than 8 hours since the previous but less than 2 days since the original, to just put it back in the new list and see if it picks up traction at this different time of day, day of week etc. Then good stories originally submitted on weekends, middle of the night where most HN readers are, etc aren't buried just based on the happenstance of when they are submitted.<p>Just a thought.

If someone had suggested that government should be involved in running schools, maintain massive ""Education Departments"", etc., I'm sure Jefferson, Franklin, and the rest would have had the same reaction that they had to the idea of government-run churches.<p>If it is dangerous to a free society for government to be involved in telling people what to think via religion (and it is), how much more dangerous is it for government to be involved in telling many of the youngest and most impressionable members of society what to think?<p>We should demand the separation of school and state and end government control over education in the United States. Schooling is not the only means to getting an education (Mark Twain famously said ""Never let your schooling interfere with your education""), but if universal schooling is deemed desirable, you could simply take the amount of money spent by government to run schools and maintain bureaucracies, divide it by the number of students, and issue each student a voucher to spend at the non-government, voluntarily funded community school of their choice.<p>To support freeing children from the dangers of government indoctrination and control, visit and join the Alliance for the Separation of School and State -- <a href=""http://www.schoolandstate.org/home.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schoolandstate.org/home.htm</a>.

Right now, the prevailing opinion among Apple detractors seems to be that all the little touches are ""fluff"" and polish that don't add up to any monetary value at all.<p>Evidence of this abounds: my favorite example is the multitouch touchpad that Apple uses. If somebody is saying something good about a pointing device on a non-Apple laptop, odds are good that they've never spent time with Apple's touchpad. It's that much better, but if you haven't used it and you don't trust Apple or anybody who uses Apple products, you'll probably never assign it more than about $5 of value, when experienced users would easily value it at ten times that. (That's why it isn't insane for apple to release a standalone touchpad for $70).<p>Fortunately for Apple, far more people have been willing to try the iPhone than have been willing to try their computers, and many of them have discovered that ""not sucking"" is worth more than a few hundred megahertz. The ""halo effect"" is real, and is not due entirely to people ""buying in"" to an Apple lifestyle.<p>The people who have strong technical or financial barriers to using Apple computers are far outnumbered by the proud Apple haters who haven't actually used a Mac long enough to appreciate the little things. However, unless somebody else starts releasing well designed computer hardware and software, Apple will eventually win over most of the haters through sheer ubiquity. (I expect that at some point, there will be a tipping point where hating Apple becomes uncool. If we pass that tipping point before Apple has serious competition, Apple will probably achieve a near-monopoly.)",1282788080.0
