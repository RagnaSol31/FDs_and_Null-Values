With two machines, it's simply good engineering. As your stable of machines grows, it's less a style point and more a necessity. It's hard to keep a group of machines in sync with a single policy, and virtually impossible to avoid mistakes and windows of vulnerability over the long run.<p>An attacker that truly wants to target your network can continuously profile your network, and is more likely to spot your mistakes than you are.

The fact that 99.99% of people are not terrorists.<p>Airport security checkpoints cannot be considered a last stand against threats.  It is one link in a chain including intelligence, passenger awareness, and aircraft design.  The chain I describe is not security, but safety.  ""Screen for every potential danger"" is not a viable goal for airport security.  I prefer a statement like ""decrease the likelihood of death (whoever's you care to measure) by 10x"".  While still vague, it gives some framework for comparing costs.  To make up numbers, suppose for the same cost you could install backscatter machines and get a 10x reduction, or better radar infrastructure and get a 50x reduction.  I know where I'd want my money.<p>One externality here is the perception of safety.
