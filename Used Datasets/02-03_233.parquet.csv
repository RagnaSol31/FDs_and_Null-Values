You can set the book down and pick up another, or look up references when they seem interesting.<p>Reading books and letters never got less interactive with the development of telephones or IMs, which are the long-distance extension of the face-to-face conversation, and they won’t with the adoption of video chat either. The media (conversation vs. reading/writing) have completely different uses. Writing things down (or recording in general) is a way to crystalize knowledge. Talking in real time is inherently ephemeral and driven by instant reactions.<p>In response to the grandparent post: sitting down around the dinner table has always been an “interactive audiovisual experience” (tactile too!) – the addition of widespread video-chat seems unlikely to transform society nearly as much as the internet already has.",1286247451.0

You need a full-language for a great template language. Smarty, for instance, sucks. HAML, which is terse, but has access to the full syntax of ruby rocks. You can do things like:<p><pre><code>  = @users.map {|u| sprintf(""%04d: %s"",u.id, u.status.capitalize)}.join(', ')\n</code></pre>\nSure there's some special operator is smarty to do this, but I don't want to have to learn it, and they're always more clunky.<p>Additionally, I always hit complex, weird situations where I need a full-language, and migrating that logic out of the view makes no sense. For instance, I was working on a site where I had repeating content, with ads at predetermined offsets. I rendered it something like:<p><pre><code>  ads_positions = Set.new(2,8,10,12)\n  content.each_with_index do |content,i|\n    if ad_positions.include?(i)\n      content\n      ad\n    else\n      content\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\nI hate expressing that stuff server-side or in half-baked templating languages.",1286246139.0

While only having <i>professional</i> experience in PHP isn't a big deal, I have to say that folks who've never shown an interest in another language or facet of software development don't tend to impress.<p>PHP is a very pragmatic, simple language with a complex and baroque set of libraries. It's great for hacking together websites, but working with PHP (even for many years) doesn't tend to teach you the kind of technical and aesthetic judgement that differentiates an assembly-line coder from a productive, engaged hacker.<p>Learning Ruby or Python might be the shortest path to another gig, but it probably won't push you outside your comfort zone far enough to really improve your programming if you stick to the usual Rails/Django garden path. If you want to really push yourself and grow as a developer, learn something completely unrelated to the standard LAMP stack.<p>Lisp (especially in a modern form like Clojure) is a good choice, as are Smalltalk and Erlang. C++, Java, or C",
