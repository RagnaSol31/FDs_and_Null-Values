So I have a few questions for the HN community:<p>1) We have ideas of what the theme of some of these banner ads will be, but we don't know the best wording that should be used. Should we get a copywriter? If so, where? How much should we expect to pay?<p>2) We can do the ads ourselves from a creative (art) perspective, but it may make more sense to have someone else do them for us if they are better. Where can we find a good designer for banner ads? Again, how much should we expect to pay?<p>3) Is there a resource online where we can gauge the potential success of these ads? We're interested in knowing what we can expect for CTR rates and/or CPC.<p>4) Any additional information that we should consider?<p>Thank you for responses ahead of time!",1277693997.0

17,1466889,comment,1466288.0,1466288.0,0,0,10ren,,,"No one's mentioned the revolutionary perspective of this story: learning a JVM language in its own right, without regard to the JVM, nor Java, its libraries nor infrastructure. Most JVM projects do have regard to Java, because: the developers know Java and indeed are using it; and access to Java libraries and infrastructure is a key selling point. But it doesn't need to be that way. You can treat the language like a clean abstraction: most python programmers don't worry about the C underneath; most C programmers don't worry about the assembly underneath; most assembly programmers don't worry about the hex underneath. This a different way of seeing a JVM language.<p>It seems that the problems mentioned are common to all JVM languages (I was especially struck by similarities with JRuby, recently on HN).<p>Ideas: (1) look at other JVM languages. Copy their solutions. (2) someone develop a ""JVM language support environment"". It might include eg. a java server, so startup times disappear. (the JVM is damn fast, once it's going. And, kinda freaky to witness, it gets perceptibly <i>faster</i>, through JIT). Oracle might even include subsume it into Java, should it serve their business interest.",1277693382.0

26,1466879,comment,1466356.0,1466637.0,0,0,chipsy,,,"Stack languages present a troublesome problem for documentation. Forth in particular is untyped, but my own experience was with a small compiler/interpreter I wrote over a dynamic language(haXe). The language was easy to implement, and it solved one domain problem very well(in-game dialogue) and another not so well(choreographing two-dimensional movement patterns). I've filed it away as ""cool experiment."" My implementation allowed the same syntax to be used with different semantics - a batch compiled word, or words sliced up into lists of function calls, which made them usable in continuation-passing style - very useful for my in-game dialogue.<p>The debugging I encountered mostly revolved around correcting stack manipulations so that things lined up with the right parameters. The brevity of these languages comes from the stack allowing implicit parametrization; just list your data and then the word you want to use. The downside comes from this property also allowing the stack to leak when under or over-parametrized - enabling mystery behavior or crashes that you wouldn't see with C-style calling conventions.<p>On the other hand, a major plus: Working with the stack lets you avoid littering your code with named variables. This is what enables Forth words to have extremely high density and readability, and I've incorporated more of this style into my coding elsewhere, so that in the most extreme case, I might go ahead and set up a stack in(for example) an object, and then list out method calls like a high-level Forth operation:<p>obj.wordA(); obj.wordB(); obj.wordC();<p>Blending this with more imperative or functional constructs, I can get the best of both worlds: something compact and readable but also self-documenting, with decent type and parameter safeness.",1277693012.0

I have a feeling that you are attempting something <i>more difficult</i> that AI - ie, algorithmic inference <i>without the data that your competitors have</i>. Because of their better information, they will find a regularity (eg. 0.01% dip on Wednesdays) quicker than you - and trade it away.<p>It would be awesome if you could do it though - forget the philosopher's stone aspect of gold-for-nothing, this would be a very cool intellectual achievement.<p>Idea: focus on small markets/exchanges (unpopular metals, unpopular countries, even non-financial markets, like eBay) that don't attract the attention of big players. Easier to find arbitrage there; you can make some actual money, and <i>then</i> move onto a bigger market with your learnings, earnings, and confidence. Sort of a niche strategy.<p><i>Personal Note</i>: My AI research depressed me, and I (wisely) decided to shelve it. It's been incredibly more satisfying to work with others, to achieve doable goals, that benefit others. Fortunately, AI comes up in everything; and my current approach (of not doing AI directly) may well be the most effective way to approach the goal.
