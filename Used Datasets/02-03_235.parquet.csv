8,2108491,comment,2107238.0,2107238.0,0,0,xenophanes,,,"If anyone is serious about proving things about chess I would suggest they start by proving things about simpler chess variants.<p>The variant of chess ""wild 5"" where your pawns start on the 7th rank and pieces on the 8th (so pawns promote in one move) has far fewer choices than in chess. It's a simpler game. It has a significant advantage for white, much larger than in normal chess. Humans came somewhat near to proving it's a win for white just by learning the (relatively few) openings out to 20 or so moves. At each step there's usually only a couple moves that aren't terrible. For the first six moves there is a <i>single</i> way of playing which is considered best for both sides.<p>Yet even in this much simpler game which humans are near cracking, I think a pure math type approach would have a very hard time getting anywhere.<p>If you can't do anything there, you could always try an even simpler game. There is a game called pawns where you start with only your pawns. If you promote you win instantly. Math ought to be able to solve that one. If you crack that, move on to little chess (normal chess but only with pawns and kings). Little chess should no doubt be a draw (you can waste moves with your king unlike in pawns where it's less clear) but proving that would be a good accomplishment I think.",1295146360.0

As you alluded to in your second point, it should be part of the broader system of minimizing the damage to society.

But if I was playing a queen up against anyone I wouldn't repeat, I'd just make progress until I won. Repetition wouldn't come up, it's rare enough in close games. It's most common in (near or exactly even material) end games which queen odds games won't reach without hanging a queen.<p>A minor piece odds is a win for sure, any chess play can tell you that. But a pawn up .. that is <i>unclear</i>. You speak of GM games being decided by a pawn which of course happens but what you do not speak of is material sacrifices in GM games which are common too. And there's all those endgames which the pawn-down player wins (often by superior play, sometimes other reasons). And there's all those well known ways an extra pawn in an end game can be a draw, including for example king+pawn vs king is drawn unless it's set up so you can force promotion quickly (e.g. defending king is out of position). King+rook+pawn vs king+rook is common and this is also drawn in general (the defense is called the philidor position) unless the pawn-up side starts in an advantageous position (something equivalent to the lucena position)<p>One of the interesting facts about pawn odds is that you now have an open file b/c of your missing pawn. And pawns restrict moving out your pieces so having one missing can save time. The worst thing you could do is take away black's f7 pawn at the start. That is, first guess, a loss for black. Take away some other pawn and do it from white and it's a lot harder to guess.<p>The rule of thumb taught to beginners is that a pawn is worth 3 moves in the early game (and a knight is 3 pawns so you might think it's worth 9 moves, but that conversion doesn't work well, with 9 free moves you could set up checkmate). I think a pawn is worth somewhat less than 3 moves but it really varies and the comparison doesn't entirely make sense.<p>BTW there do exist well known openings leading to an unclear/unknown result that involve a piece sacrifice (lines in the King's Gambit or Najdorf for example). Losing a piece for nothing is a clear loss but various kinds of compensation are possible.",1295145183.0

Drug use affects your family and friends negatively, it affects your coworkers, your employer, random people that you run over with your car or attack violently while high, and it raises taxes or insurance premiums since it's very costly to treat drug-related issues at hospitals.<p>Sure, <i>in the beginning</i> drug use may be a personal decision that doesn't affect too many people - but once addiction kicks in - and it does to a very large percentage of users - your drug use has a hugely negative effect on everyone around you, and even strangers.",1295144480.0

Since tries don't need to re balance on insert we avoid memory operations R-B trees spend reorganizing interior nodes. Even though these are amortized in the R-B, we're still saving work.<p>Likewise, these are faster than small hash tables since we avoid resizing-rehashing overhead. Searching the binary trie is also likely faster than following a collision linked list we might find in a naive hash table implementation. However, for larger containers hashes begin to catch up, since at these sizes the trie involves increasingly more memory accesses.<p>I'd like to see these tries compared to generalized cuckoo hashing.<p>I'd also like to see them compared to the bagwell array mapped tries used by clojure and others.",1295144325.0

The latter, however, doesn't necessarily require knowing the theory, fundamentals, and ins and outs of a programming language.  If you only want to build a single app, your time would be more wisely spent jumping into development and figuring things out as you go.  This way, you'll learn everything you need to develop your idea without wasting precious time (and brain space) on things that may not apply to you.<p>My own experience is similar to what you are describing.  I had a startup idea but had never programmed a day in my life.  I figured out that Ruby on Rails would work for me so I started reading every single tutorial/ebook that I could get my hands on.  I tried for months but nothing stuck - I just couldn't get the hang of it.  Eventually, I said screw it and started building my app (with very little knowledge of what I was doing).  Currently, I wouldn't say development is finished, but I do have a beautifully working MVP.  When an obstacle crops up(and they do quite often), I google my very specific problem and 99% of the time the answer appears as a blog article or stackoverflow question.  On the rare off chance that I can't find a solution to my answer, I post a question of stackoverflow with a detailed description of my problem (and usually some code).  Every single question I've asked has been answered in minutes - an invaluable resource.  A few weeks ago I started working on my second and third apps.  I was amazed that I actually knew what I was doing, but it validated that I had actually been learning how to program the whole time I was hacking through my first app.<p>Good luck!",1295143561.0
