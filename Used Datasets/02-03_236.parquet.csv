I’m trying to think of the best word to describe them… haunted? bizarre? chaotic? random? mysterious?  No wait, I know; the perfect word is <i>opaque</i>.  They do weird stuff and you don’t know why, and <i>you can’t look inside them and find out why</i>.  Hmm, now that I’ve come to this conclusion, the answer seems to be the same obvious one that we already have for the similar problem of opaque software and operating systems.  <i>Free software</i>, so you can actually look inside and debug the things when your system/printer has found some new way to confound you.<p>I seem to recall that the original story about how Richard Stallman was inspired to create the concept of free software was that he was stymied by proprietary software <i>in a printer</i>, so this would simply bring the concept back to its roots, so to speak.",1443840631.0

I’ve only worked as a sysadmin on and off for closer to 20 years rather than 30, but I have only ever had perfectly amiable customer contacts.  Even though there have been some of them (there’s always a few) that have been very upset about something that my employer did, I seem to recall many of them apologizing to me for being so upset and saying that they are angry about the situation, and not upset about me.  This have happened at many different companies in different fields, both technical and non-technical. I don’t know why people have this experience that “<i>Support is an absolutely nightmare</i>”.  I mean, I can believe that people have that experience, I just don’t know why.  I can understand someone in general not wanting to <i>talk to people</i>; I am myself somewhat reluctant to talk to people if I don’t actually have to.  But I have learned to do it.  It’s a bit like driving – some like it, some don’t, but if you need to do it, you learn how to do it and that’s that.  (The only thing I have against customer contacts is that being the primary person who answers the phone is distracting when you’re doing other sysadmin stuff.)<p>No, the reason why that comment is strange is that if I’m a sysadmin, the users who use the systems that I keep running <i>are my customers</i> just as much as customers of the company.  Why would you <i>not</i> count them as customers?<p>Maybe the article author liked having contact with people outside the company, as a sort of social interaction substitute?  If that’s the case, I can only say that if I needed social contact that badly, all I needed to do was to go outside <i>after work</i>, where I could socialize on my own terms with people I could choose for myself.  But I can only speculate about what the author actually meant by that comment.",1443839263.0
