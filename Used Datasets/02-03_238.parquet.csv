Consumers rely on government to have adequate standards that are enforced. Without such standards people would make bad decisions.""<p>Bullshit.  What government agency prevents us from having exploding lightbulbs.  There isn't one.  It's done by Underwriter's Laboratory.  There is no good reason why we can't have an Underwriter's laboratory for food.  Or an underwriter's laboratory for medicines, instead of the FDA.  In fact we are seeing en mass rebellion against the USDA (particularly in the organic-certification area) where the USDA is seen as basically an agent that prevents upstart food producers and entrenches big-food interests that can afford to pay for extremely expensive certification.<p>You know what, the FDA screws up big time, too.  Remember how we had an e coli outbreak?  So what are you going to do when 'government standards' are 'inadequate'?",1286852364.0

Why, for example, was the interest rate so low, making it artificially easy to take on mortgages?  Why were home mortgage payments tax-deductible?<p>You think that these economic decisions are made in a vacuum, but you really ought to look in to the political decisions that were made to push people en masse into a series of economic moves that were probably unsustainable.  The notion that the most recent economic crises were a failure of the market is completely laughable.<p>Ironically, it's exactly the notion that government is supposed to ""prevent bad economic decisions"" that has resulted in centralization of economy (via the fed, via subsidization of bank risk, by subsidization -i.e. stealth corporate welfare- of retirements through 401ks, IRAs) - so that instead of a few bad actors getting punished for poor choices, risk is socialized and we all have to bail out the rich guys.",1286852118.0
