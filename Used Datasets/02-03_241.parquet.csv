To me, it's purely protective: you put violent people in jail to physically incapacitate them until the threat of them causing more violence diminishes as they age. That's the reason most Scandinavian countries give sentences of under 10 years for most crimes, and under 20 years even for murder, because the risk of older people committing violent crimes is <i>very</i> low. So if your goal is to protect society from reoffense, the biggest win is to keep people locked up for their 20s; the 2nd-biggest is people in their 30s; and it gets increasingly pointless beyond that. In fact, giving supervised release instead of jailtime is often warranted, because keeping people tied to their communities / sources of employment is one of the best ways to prevent recidivism, while a few years in jail tends to turn people into hardened criminals (with fewer ties to the non-criminal world, and more ties to criminal gangs).<p>In this case, 18 years seems pretty clearly excessive from a protective point of view; it's not even clear any jail time at all is warranted, since some sort of probation with supervision of internet use would likely suffice to prevent him from reoffending.<p>My impression is that many people, especially in the U.S., have a notion of justice that's either more retributive or deterrent based, though. If retributive, that's a pure ethical disagreement. If deterrent, then we might have an empirical disagreement, about which lengths of sentences in fact deter crimes.",1310525892.0

For example, perhaps 'things' would keep coming back for say 30, 60, 90 days. You complete the thought and turn it into a habit and now you're good, so you can archive it. The more you turn into habits the better visual feedback you get.\nAnother idea: Add video to this. Help ingrain the lesson learned by doing a full-blown reflection on what it means to you and why its important. Also, to see yourself to yourself  to-do/NOT-to-do something every so often could be interesting.\nBTW: I have a folder in Evernote for things like this, I just dont check it that often, but a system that could automate this and push things to me could be interesting. One step further: sharing. Famous people could share short videos of their 'lessons learned' and you could subscribe to their lessons until you complete them as habits (remember not everything will turn into a habit though).<p>Just a few thoughts, hope it helps!",1310525333.0

Here's what comes to mind right now...<p>The sin that takes the cake was Facebook's attempted smear campaign against Google:<p><a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/05/12/facebook-busted-in-clumsy-smear-attempt-on-google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/05/12/facebook-bu...</a><p>I can't currently remember other acts on a similarly questionable level.  Most don't sink that low, and are ""only"" irresponsible, such as allowing newly-created accounts to be used without first verifying the user's e-mail address:<p><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/10/being-eric-schmidt-on-facebook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/10/being-eric-schmidt-on-faceb...</a><p>(Was this security hole ever closed?)<p>Facebook is a pioneer in on-line human interaction, and a reckless one at that (not a good thing).  Privacy is one area in particular where FB keeps pushing the boundaries and exposing its users to new dangers.  Is the company clueless about its users' privacy needs?  Are FB's goals at cross-purposes with its users' goals?  It's hard to tell which of the two is a better-fitting explanation.<p>Other FB actions aren't evil or irresponsible, but are still careless.  One type of carelessness is FB's willingness to throw away users' valuable information.  For example, FB has been announcing its intention of wiping out membership information for old Groups as it archives them.  Does FB really think this is in users' best interest?  (I value the Groups I've joined through the years, and most of them will apparently have their membership lists purged.  This is not the only case where information I value was/will be destroyed by Facebook.)<p>Another sign of careless is FB's apparent unresponsiveness to user feedback.  I understand that it's hard to be responsive with a 1 : 250,000 employee-to-customer ratio.  I understand that many aspects of customer service would need to be automated.  However, because of this, FB needs to be very careful about how and what it automates, as exemplified by stories like this one:<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/04/facebook-takedown-followup-what-happened-and-what-facebook-needs-to-fix.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/04/facebook-tak...</a><p>Incidentally, I really appreciate the fact that you are personally responding to FB-related complaints.  Keep it up!  (I hope you don't become too discouraged.)  Make no mistake, I've greatly enjoyed using Facebook and derive great benefit from the service.  However, actions like the ones I've mentioned chronically fuel my distrust of and annoyance at Facebook.",1310524418.0

However, there needs to be a way to switch partners instantly. For example, I was speaking to someone who had video and microphone problems and the only way I could switch was to navigate back to the homepage and start again. I also didn't find the automatic matching, in its current form, an advantage over personal selection. For example, I only wanted to speak with girls around my age. Allowing the user to set criteria for partners (e.g. age, gender, region) would be useful, along with the ability to switch as desired.<p>The second key feature of this site, compared to alternatives, is the use of video. However, I didn't find any benefits, e.g. in terms of usefulness for language learning or fun, from the use of video over just voice/text communication. Staring at the head of a stranger for the duration of the chat didn't add anything. Need to add some feature or features that make the use of video an advantage and relevant for language learning (this would also encourage people who want to engage in video chat to simply switch to skype once introduced).<p>I didn't find the suggested topics feature very useful, as it isn't hard to come up with such topics on your own and simply going through suggested topics one by one with partner led to a conversation that felt awkward and jilted. An alternative idea: add some interactive role play puzzles that the users must solve by speaking the foreign language with the user. For example, you could shows a street map with a route shown to one user, and the same map with only the initial position to the other. The latter user must then ask the other user for directions to determine the correct route . Or a restaurant role play where one user is the waiter the other the customer, and the latter is told the dishes they must order, which they must communicate correctly to the waiter. This would lead to more realistic, two-way, conversations, be a lot more fun and be genuinely useful in generating conversation between two strangers.<p>At the moment, it doesn't offer anything compelling over sharedtalk.com in terms of finding language exchange partners, nor does it offer any of the learning material for which I find Bussu useful. On the plus side, I did find the site easy to sign up for and use, and the call quality was good (call quality on sharedtalk is generally very poor, which is why, even in voice chat there, people almost always suggest moving to skype - hence sharedtalk acts more as an introductions agency).",1310522447.0
