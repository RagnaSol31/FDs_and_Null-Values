16,1385558,story,,,48,32,thrownaway,Ask HN: Non-tech solo founder scored $100k to develop product. Finding a dev?,,"Long-time reader, first-time poster.<p>Thanks to HN and several other forums on the web, I've cobbled together a business that makes me about $5k-7/month. I'm not seeing a whole lot of growth in demand for my product, but one of my sales tools (a twist on a common tool that I faked together in PHP despite having no engineering background) always gets a very positive response and closes me a lot of sales at prices way above typical for products like mine.<p>The space I'm in is a sexy, popular space.  Can't say what it is, but lots of people want to work in it.<p>Recently I heard about a prestigious grant contest for businesses in my space and applied.  To my pleasant surprise, I've recently learned I'm being awarded $100k specifically to further develop the sales tool I cooked up (sorry for the intentionally vague language) so I can offer it to other businesses in my space who sell products like the one I've been selling.<p>This seems like a pretty good idea.  To use an obvious allusion, I've been mining gold with middling success, but while doing so, I unwittingly invented a really kickass shovel.  Eventually I learned that my shovels were in fact awesome and now I've got some capital to develop and sell these shovels to other miners at scale so they can make a better go of it.<p>Here's my problem.  To really capitalize on this windfall I need someone who can actually hack.  I don't know the first thing about creating a web app that scales.  Unfortunately, I live in a remote area and there aren't a lot of programmers around here. Furthermore, I've never hired a developer before so I suspect any job posting I put up would be a big turn-off to the sort of person I'd want to work with.  I read all the posts on here making fun of bad job listings and they make me really paranoid.<p>Suggestions on how to proceed?<p>Edit: If anyone wants to reach out to me, you can get me at rexfaraday at gmail dot com",1275014809.0

I've been participating in them for longer than that. And I've seen the same pattern occur over and over again: as a community grows, the members become more and more concerned with what's appropriate and less and less concerned with whatever actually brought them together in the first place.<p>You can see this happening here, now, on a regular basis: ""is this really appropriate for HN"" is almost at meme status, and occasionally we see waves of blunt enforcement through downvoting of comments, or through posts designed to shame people.<p>There are basically two ways this can end:<p>1. The community becomes extremely rigid and insular, developing rules and conventions to protect itself at the cost of new members who get run off or never join in the first place. Wikipedia seems to be at this stage right now, if you'd like an example.<p>2. The ""old guard"" (who aren't necessarily original or even early members) either migrate away or get over it, and the community adapts and keeps on growing. Places like Fark, where stupidity and outright trolls just get mocked mercilessly, provide useful examples of this.<p>Reddit, I think, is either at or approaching the second option. Yes, there's dumb stuff posted, yes, there are comments making fun of people, but the community there seem to have realized that's not the end of the world. And because they're much less rigid and much less concerned with ""is this appropriate for reddit"", there's a lot more room for creativity, for humor, and for lots of other stuff that just couldn't happen on HN. And I'll take that any day, which is why I spend most of my time reading reddit instead of HN.",1275013121.0
