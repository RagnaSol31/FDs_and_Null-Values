The rest of the world seems to have reached a consensus on that.<p>I'm sorry if what I said about his painting was confusing. I consider da Vinci to be a great painter when judging from the reputation that he has with people knowledgeable about art. His paintings are simply not to my personal taste, mostly due to the expressionless faces (now Caravaggio, he has some amazing paintings). Whether you agree or not, I think you'll agree that art is a subjective thing (unlike science/math/engineering). The world also seems to have reached consensus that da Vinci was an amazing all round genius. This is demonstrably wrong, drawing into question the judgement of the world (also note the general belief in the existence of a god, and that the world is flat).<p>> This really is covered in most undergraduate history and philosophy courses. If you want a discrete list of Da Vinci's major works and his claim to fame, well, Wikipedia is your friend.<p>The list of science and inventions you gave contains nothing of significance except in painting. Whenever it is even remotely about math/science/engineering, it's mostly about his job as an illustrator, plus a couple of bogus inventions that neither got built nor work (though I'm sure you <i>can</i> find something trivial that he drew that actually worked -- if you draw enough things one of them is bound to work).<p>> Da Vinci defines the term Renaissance Man. He had his nose into everything. He was prior to the likes of Galileo and Newton and a departure from Aristotle and Plato.<p>If your point is that he came before them, so he had the time against him, then I'll say again: it's about the delta not about the absolute achievement. Also note that there were lots of proper geniuses LONG before him, like Pythagoras (math; ~600BC), Eratosthenes (math, measured the diameter of the Earth; ~250BC -- what's truly astonishing is that humanity not only forgot the diameter of the Earth, it actually believed that the Earth is flat!) and Euclid (math, physics; ~300BC). On a related note: Aristotle is <i>not</i> in that list; his works on physics are basically bogus, why people ascribe some kind of physics genius to him in history lessons is again beyond me. For amazing engineering just look at the pyramids and the Roman empire.<p>Lets simplify this: name <i>one</i> important contribution to science, math or engineering.",1327719531.0

In fact, for sufficiently well-targeted advertising, it doesn't need anything - as when you seek a product.  Overture/goto made money like this (google used its ideas for adwords).<p>Consider advertising on TV and print media: you try to hit your demographic and hope for the best. Next is direct marketing: you can measure your success based on response rates. Then, internet advertising (eg google) accelerated this feedback to be instant.<p>But it's still hard to know what people want or need to buy right now - ideally, it would go far beyond your demographic (a huge set of which you are a member), beyond an ultra-fine-grained demographic (a tiny subset), beyond what you want right now, to anticipating your need so exactly that you don't have to ask. Like consultative selling (or perhaps a PA/butler), it stops being advertising and starts being a service in itself.<p>Google has a lot of information, and can do some of this really well; but Facebook is much closer to the user, and so has much more and better information about them, so they are better-placed to do this.<p>Google has the long-term goal of anticipating the information you want; and they are doing well (e.g. search suggest). But it's primarily aggregate prediction, not personalized. They can (and do) personalize it somewhat, but just aren't as well-placed as facebook, because they aren't as close to the user (people).<p>People are ultimately where the money comes from.

I disagree, however, that it would require tanks.  They could do the same as they did in Libya, which is far more justifiable and politically expedient.  The dissidents in Syria are gearing up for war[1], so the ever-problematic boots on the ground would be unnecessary.<p>The US would only have to make Assad think it was serious about another Libya in order to give him some serious misgivings.  Get NATO to make some rumblings, which would encourage Chavez to issue one of his proclamations against American Imperialism, then make a backroom deal to get Assad out.<p>At the end of the day, the Bush Doctrine of democracy-at-swordpoint is simply ineffective.
