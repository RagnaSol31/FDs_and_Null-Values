If you look at the Feedback section of railscasts.com you'll see that the second most popular request is for Ryan Bates to ""Build an entire application over a series of screencasts"" and it has almost 1500 votes.<p>Others have already pointed this out, but it's important to keep the screencasts short and try to split each project up into smaller videos by topic. I like screencasts, but there's nothing worse than sitting through an hour long video for 10 minutes of content.

A corollary is that Joel was unfairly labeled a ""blogger"" even though <i></i>he never really blogged<i></i>.<p>A blog is a reverse chronological list of short posts. Readers often assume a kind of exponential decay of usefulness, where old blog posts are far less interesting and relevant than new ones. Consequently, tech bloggers keep posting the same content, as if to say <i>pay attention to this, it's still important</i>.<p>What we really need is a new label for content like Joel's, one that doesn't carry any negative stigma for text written long ago. I have no suggestions for what that might look like, but I have to imagine there's something better than the status quo, which is:<p>(1) People keep posting the same stuff, and\n(2) I send around a giant, growing list of old articles to every newly minted CS graduate I meet",1268621435
