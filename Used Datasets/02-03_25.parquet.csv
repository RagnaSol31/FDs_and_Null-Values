I believe there was several instances of this happening in WW2 in Europe. Yes, the american citizens weren't directly targeted in WW2, but there wasn't really much in the way of directly targeting anyone in WW2. In the new world where we target individuals in war, it was only a matter of time before an american national was found on the battlefield to be fighting against his or her own country. He should have expected to have the same amount of attention as any other AQ operative.\nHowever, if he was given more attention or captured and executed without trial, we would have a different conversation on our hands.

31,3059166,comment,3058127.0,3058127.0,1,0,filthylucre,,,"There are three painfully obvious reasons Android apps do not look as good as iOS apps. iOS has UIKit and Android has fragmentation along with a myriad of devices with different resolutions.<p>1. UIKit - Apple made it easy for developers to implement consistent navigation, views, and transitions. Android Ice Cream Sandwich is providing a new UI library which will bring this much needed iOS advantage to Android. Is it possible to mimic UIKit on the current Android devices? Yes, but it's a pain in the ass and not practical for most developers on a deadline.<p>2. Fragmentation - Device Android version lock has caused problems with development. You are only as strong as your weakest link which unfortunately rings true with some developers who choose to develop on an older version of Android to remain compatible with as many devices as possible. Google has addressed this issue by obtaining agreements from many manufacturers to update their devices on a consistent basis.<p>3. Screen Resolution - Any web developer will tell you it's much easier to create a beautiful and consistent website if the site is fixed width. This is especially true for mobile development because you dont have to concern yourself with repeating tiles, resolution detection, and adjustable spacing when you know the exact dimensions of the device. There are only 2 iOS resolutions (not counting retina) making it easy to utilize space and perfect the UI in the most efficient way possible. Can it be done on Android? Sure, but without a UIKit to handle many of the little nuances it will yet again be a big pain in the ass and will take up time that the developer does not have.",1317436326.0

It wasn't a bad idea to switch early but at least two glaring mistakes were made with the implementation:<p>1. The European establishment decreed that no sovereign in the region would ever default on its debts and backed that decree up by allowing banks to hold the debt without allocating capital against it.  This was the European equivalent of US rating agencies rubber-stamping toxic mortgage securities with a AAA rating.<p>2. Member states have been allowed to cheat outrageously on the Masstricht treaty criteria, even before shenanigans like Greece window-dressing its numbers by disguising some debt as currency swaps, without much enforcement.<p>If these errors hadn't been made, they probably wouldn't be in a situation in which member states were allowed to paper over their problems with cheap credit while digging the entire continent into a very dangerous hole.",1317435968.0
