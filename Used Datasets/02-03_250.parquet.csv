The value it offers has tremendous potential.<p>That said, I think the company needs to explain to developers what happens if they build a hugely successful site on top of the API and depend on the embed.ly functionality.<p>For example, I see no Terms of Service -- So can I cache the output to reduce requests?  Can I re-syndicate it in other formats?  Can I power my meta-data scraper through embed.ly?  Will they start to charge me?  Will they release stats on most frequent API request URLs?  Will those be aggregated or per user-agent?<p>I'm all for supporting new startups, but I'd like to know how they will support me for using them as they grow up.<p>PS, Please don't comment about how building a popular site or service on top of embed.ly (or someone else's API) is a bad idea – their entire business depends on you assuming it's okay to do that, so I'm just taking that assumption and rolling w/ it.",1281063556.0

Maybe you could offer them some flexibility in this area.<p>Will the PTA flip out if you involve the students with selling wine? Maybe you could work a deal with some local business where the students websites act as a reseller but carry no inventory. Farm supplies, or something. The customers can be local, if the newspaper does a story on this it is free advertising. Maybe somebody's mom cans preserves or something. Be imaginative.

You said that start-up investing is a seller's market now. Why is that? In general ""a sellers market"" would indicate that there a lot of investor money in comparison with startup opportunities.<p>Is it because there profitable exists which are bringing more money in? I have been following the news and while the number of buyouts seem to be increasing, many of them are at valuations which would not indicate much profit for the investors.<p>Also VCs keep telling me that they have trouble getting funds as their traditional institutional investors have soured on the VC investment class. So that would indicate something other than a seller's market.<p>Or do you think that because there is so much activity with start-ups, investors have already decided that some companies that have not yet reached an exit (e.g., Twitter, Foursquare) are defacto winners, so that there is an assumption of high profitability even without the exits.<p>Or do you think it is a sellers market because more money is going to silicon valley now that many of the wall street profit making schemes have stopped working.<p>Or is it possible that it only seems like a seller's market to you because Y-combinator is so successful and popular that investing in Y-combinator startups is indeed a seller's market, while this may not be the case overall.",1281063145.0

It's hard to tell whether these folks were submitting quality stories with a different slant, or were actively submitting crap. Obviously it's hard to trust the views of a site that says:<p><i>There are a few differences of opinion within DP, although for the most part, they are extremely similar in perspective. They hate Obama. They hate progressives. They hate the UN, diplomacy, and peace/disarmament efforts. They hate reforms of health care, Wall St., and immigration. They hate science, in fact many are creationists, and some even blog about it. They hate the secular nature of our nation. They hate environmental protection, requiring polluters to be responsible for their own cleanup, and especially hate climate efforts. They hate unions and any attempt to level the playing field to give all Americans economic opportunities. They hate the government, except the military-industrial complex. They hate abortion rights. They hate public schools and really hate higher education. They hate anyone in the media except far right personalities like Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, and Michelle Malkin. They hate anyone who doesn’t think Obama is a secret islamist and/or marxist who was born in Kenya.</i><p>And follows that up with the unironic:<p><i>They just love to hate.</i><p>Fortunately, this article makes it easier for voting sites to detect cabals and manipulators by seeing which accounts vote in tandem. That might lead to false positives, but that may not be so bad--if only a tiny minority cares very strongly about a single story, I don't have to care whether or not they're coordinating their votes.

This is true (there was no warning that I saw when I was downloading it, although one was added later, or maybe I didn't notice it).

Maybe that's all they're talking about. But the way it's phrased it sounds very dependent on protocol, which I would say is very non-neutral, because it's only possible to implement if you have a whitelist of protocols, and it's pretty much impossible for the established players to fairly arbitrate which protocols are which.

The difference between the two designs was night-and-day.<p>This time through, I put up a quick landing page with some basic ""coming soon"" boilerplate at the beginning. Since I enjoy a minimalist and clean design, I can hack together a site rather quickly.  Yes, it is functional. Yes, it appeals to me. No, it doesn't look professional. But most importantly, updating and maintaining it occupied a lot of my time that I could have spent working on the back-end.<p>The 2nd design was crafted by a designer. Unfortunately, because I had spent all of my time doing the design the first time, I now had no content to give to the designer to work with. I'm sure that he hated the fact that I kept changing my mind on the public pages every other week. To his credit, he created a very impressive set of internal pages for the web-app even though that wasn't his strong suit.<p>With some content finally available, I hacked the public pages to create the 3rd (and current) site to accommodate the new content.<p>With an imminent launch, I've finally done what I should have done first: place an ad in Smashing Magazine and hire a designer!

Not sure if it will be a shooting war -- but these things usually turn out that way.<p>Are we morally obligated to obey unjust laws? Woof. That's a can of worms.

I think it's reasonable to say two things here. 1) Jefferson's time was simpler, with tremendously fewer laws, and 2) disobedience that may involve the death of someone is of a different nature than that which may not. (see earlier comment)<p>MLK begins with this more complex world and addresses your question -- unjust laws. Key quote here: <i>One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty.</i><p>Both are great examples of great men thinking through difficult problems. I side with Jefferson a bit more than MLK, simply because I think you can moralize yourself into a snit over just about anything. But MLK is saying that even if you're right, there's no free pass: you still owe the larger society something.<p>As to your final point, I should have been clearer. I have no problem at all with war in all its messiness being displayed all over the place. This is the way it should be. What I object to is the selective use of images -- coffins coming off planes, no information for months and then a dump of collateral damage videos -- any one of a dozen ""dirty tricks"" that involve manipulating the viewer.<p>During the American Civil War, we had photography for the first time. There were some god-awful battlefield images shown to the public. But oddly enough, nothing much happened. People are very capable of understanding the brutality of war. I don't think it's much of a secret.<p>I'm very conflicted on Afghanistan. From the half-dozen COIN books I've read, we're going to have to make peace with the Taliban. But Karzai is something of a cross between a rabid badger and a skunk -- he's selling us out as we speak.<p>I don't have an opinion right now, frankly. I supported Iraq and Afghanistan because I honestly felt that in the 10-20 year time period, less lives would be lost by taking action.  I also felt from a personal perspective that it was better to give nation-building a shot rather than carpet-bombing from afar. I still feel that was a good call.<p>But I feel that strategically, in Afghanistan at least, the scales are tipping. The military we have -- few boots with lots of cool high tech and a tendency towards kinetic fighting -- simply doesn't match the terrain or battle in Afghanistan, no matter how hard we try to patch it up.<p>I think the average citizen, especially when it comes to fighting, should read. A lot. I understand what Karzai is doing and why. I understand what we're doing. I understand why civilians get killed. Wikileaks is just data. Data presented for the shock of impact.
