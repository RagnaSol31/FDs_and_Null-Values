You put the loan on auto-pay, you lose 1% per year to do this, but you get 12 of these kinds of transaction credits on your account which is good because they count differently than credit card.<p>I did it with $1100 and it cost me $10 or $15 or whatever, but I went from not eligible for a credit card with a limit over $250 to getting an uncapped charge card with good rewards in 12 months, which was very helpful in business.
