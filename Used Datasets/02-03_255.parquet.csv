Otherwise, it would be one of the significant known problems in realtime graphics.<p><i>Even if you are pre-computing it, wouldn't you like it to go faster, like encoding a video or rendering a ray-traced scene?</i><p>What I want is irrelevant.

Also, how long exactly have you been programming for? I have been programming for ten years. I'm trying to find one good reason to take any of your statements seriously.

It's rather strange that you'd interpret it that way, since that obviously doesn't make any sense. However, you do have a reputation for being uncharitable and holding irrational grudges against people, which also explains your weird ""whole company"" assumption.<p>Whatever the case, you are strangely attempting to justify carrier pricing schemas through customer costs alone, as if the carriers were driven by sheer necessity rather than the desire to exploit their leverage in a deficiently competitive market. Maybe that's not what you're suggesting. If it is, my breaking even point still stands. If it isn't, and you agree that the pricing schemas are driven by leverage exploitation, then my larger point that carriers will abuse their power to the detriment of the public still stands.<p>I'll grant you one thing, which is that your ""usage models"" argument is sufficient to explain why tethering restrictions exist at all. But it's neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the specific pricing schemes, which I chalk up to leverage exploitation.

It's got to cast a bit of a shadow over anything based on the VM.<p>This seems like a catastrophically stupid and short-sighted move on Oracle's part. The reason Java is as big as it is today is that it's been an open playing field for all comers. Start tossing the odd hand grenade into the party and the room is going to clear out fast.

And now I have my guess: A portable gaming system that can hook up to a TV and push 720p that is effectively indistinguishable from the current generation of console.<p>By ""portable gaming system"", I mean either a dedicated gaming console, or a cell phone. The interesting thing about the cell phone option is that while dedicated gaming systems come out rarely, cell phones are increasingly on the PC-style plan of coming out as rapidly as possible with as much hardware stuffed in them as possible. So while guessing when the dedicated portable gaming systems will pass the XBox 360 requires reading minds, guessing when cell phones will actually pass the XBox 360 is not so hard.<p>Using this logic, I think we can expect the PS4 and XBox 720 by 2013 at the latest, not because the cell phones will be <i>quite</i> there by then, but because the cell phones on the horizon in late 2012 to 2013 will be able to exceed them. And especially for the PS and Xbox line, that's an embarrassment I don't think they can put up with and still maintain their image, no matter how unhelpful the next generation of graphics will be to their market or how expensive it makes the games. Unless they just throw in the towel, which, honestly, isn't necessarily a bad bet for the PS5 or Xbox 1080, but I think we're going to have one more conventional generation of consoles whether or not it's a good idea, after which we may discover they don't have a niche anymore.",1281665350.0

My brother gave me an iPod Touch and I've just started using it.  There's no icon to download apps, and to re-sync it (or whatever the hell I need to do) I have to download iTunes + quicktime + The Entire Archived Internet and go through an agonizingly long and painful process of clicking ""no"" everytime it tries to do me the favor of downloading album art for thousands of albums so that when I browse by album <i>I will be able to see the ALBUM COVERS and it will look SO COOL</i>.
