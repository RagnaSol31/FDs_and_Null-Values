Put the idea out there and hope it gets picked up? Patent it and become a troll?<p>Also, do you have examples of things that you didn't know anything about but still pushed through to success?<p>Of course, one of the reasons I'm asking is that I've had a couple of ideas that I'd like to see come to life but don't quite have the means: one is a small hack for which the opportunity is likely to close before I could get to something by myself, and the other is a pretty big R&D thing that involves chemistry, optics and many other things that I know nothing about and can't just do from my couch. :)<p>So I'm curious about <i>you</i> do in these cases",1303786290

They basically provide answers to all of your questions. Christensen is the one who coined the term ""disruption"" as it applies to technology and innovation. The premise of the books are that large entrenched companies focus on larger profits and ignore off the shelf technologies that they already have in house because the potential profits seem too small. Other smaller companies start using off the shelf technologies to focus on niche customers and eventually overtake the larger companies. By the time the larger company realizes what's going on, they're playing catchup.<p>Nintendo used ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" and ""Blue Ocean Strategy"" (another book I highly recommend) as the basis for the development of the Wii.",1303786111
