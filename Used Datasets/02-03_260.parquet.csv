The counting itself steals cycles, and the effect of dropping a reference is unpredictable: whichever module happens to drop the last reference to an object which is the last gateway to a large graph of objects will suffer a storm of recursive reference count drops and deallocations.<p>If you have a limited number of file handles, you may want them closed ASAP, and not when some reference-counting mechanism or GC decides.  Reference counting is not ASAP. Typically, you have some smart pointers which will drop the reference in relation to some lexical scope. That could be too late: the file handle object could be in scope over some long running function, and so the file is held open. The fix is to call the close method on the object, and then let refcounting reap the object later.  (Woe to you if you decide to manually take over reference counting and start hand-coding acquire and release calls. Been there, debugged that.)<p>I implemented weak hash tables in a garbage collector; it&",
