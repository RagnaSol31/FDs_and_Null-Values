9,3113820,comment,3113263.0,3113613.0,10,0,erejacob,,,"I think you can make that argument for my country of origin. They can add negative for the brain drain as far as I'm concerned. I guess the same holds for a lot of Indian or Chinese students who came to the US. As for grad school and postdocing, the way it works is that this has very little to do with training or investing. I feel I earned every cent they paid me for doing research.<p>Grad school and the postdoc system pretty much a cheap way for universities to get labor at 50-70% of the private market rates. Universities call grad students ""students"" so they can get around various labor laws and not paying for things like health insurance. The use postdocs because it's easier to lay off people compared to staff scientists.<p>So they hire persons with masters degrees to do grunt work for 25k/year and call them grad students. Then they hire the smart ones with PhDs for 40k/year and call them postdocs.<p>Basically you're put in front of a computer or in a lab and told to work on this task much like private industry except maybe your work is a bit more interesting(?) You write reports about your work called ""papers"" and after 4 years you write a giant progress report and call it a ""PhD Dissertation"". There's very little actual training or education involved in this process. Or at least not more than you find in the private sector.<p>It's pretty much labor like it is in private industry. I guarantee you that without grad students and postdocs, very few scientific papers would be published, because grads and postdocs are the ones doing the actual research.<p>When you see news of some professor discovering something, you can pretty much be sure that it was discovered at 11 in the evening by some grad student or postdoc of his. He was just the manager and subsequently in charge of public relations. That's fine BTW ... it's not like Steve Jobs single handedly built the iphone, but he still gets all the credit for it.<p>I myself published over 30 papers in my career, many of them first authored putting in 100 hours week a lot of the time, so I think I earned the money I made.<p>You can argue whether those papers are the equivalent of an $800 toilet seat, but that's a different discussion altogether. I put in the sweat equity ""on the bench"". I earned that money.<p>Professors mostly spend their time teaching, managing their workers, excuse me, ""teaching"" their grad students and postdocs, and writing grant proposals. Academia has the same typical structure as anywhere else. The only time you spend any meaningful effort being ""educated"" without giving back is as an undergraduate.",1318647340.0

They divide up the work as follows: one Asian hunts, one Asian fishes, one Asian gathers vegetables, one Asian cooks, and one Asian tends the fire. The American has the job of eating.<p>Peter says that an economist would look at the situation and explain that the American is the key to the whole enterprise. Without the American, the Asians would not have jobs.<p>The truth is that supply is its own demand. Whatever you produce that is surplus, you can trade for another's surplus. The problem in economics is not how to increase demand, but how to increase supply: how can people produce more useful things so that they can trade their surplus for the surplus of others.",1318645401.0

Also, I'd recommend really delving into some projects on your own, if you are applying to programming jobs and haven't spend (at minimum) hundreds of hours programming on your own projects you can't expect to succeed in the interview. When I decided to pursue dev as a full-time career I spent about 3 months doing nothing but writing code all day, for my own projects, they were just stupid things I thought would be cool at the time but it taught me a lot and led to getting hired.<p>Also, in my work experience, the ability to just get things done (or elegantly explain why something is not possible given current constraints) is what matters. Get the basics down, get some self-projects under your belt and then go into a job with the mindset that you are going to get things done, even if you have to go home and spend extra time at first, its worth it as you will keep learning and progressing. Overall, its not about knowing every possible aspect of a language or having everything memorized, its being able to take resources you have available (which includes search engines) and finding a solution to a problem. Even experienced developers (people I work with who have 10, 15 years exp) still spend plenty of time doing research on given topics, in software development its expected that you can do research productively to learn to solve a particular problem, if you haven't already encountered it, no one would, or at least should, expect you to have every possible solution memorized.",1318644973.0
