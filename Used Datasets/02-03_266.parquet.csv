Google Analytics Custom Events are fairly robust, providing a 4 level data hierarchy. 'Pageviews' are a concept that can be applied in non-pageview scenarios, and they regularly are in apps. And being able to flag people as logged in vs. not logged in is a classic example of what you can use Custom Variables for. Mixpanel has some interesting offerings, particularly in the real-time space, but Google Analytics offers 99% of what most sites need, and without a price tag.<p>There are things Google Analytics does poorly, though, like Goals (which don't work for Events, aren't retroactive, and are limited to 20 per profile) and Funnels (which are even more rigid than Goals).<p>I wish MixPanel well, since a competitive analytics space is good for us all, but the developer they quoted could use some advice on how to maximize his/her Google Analytics experience.

Anyone who gives a couple moment's serious thought will realize that there is really no such thing as environmentalism in space; at best, there are aesthetic concerns.

Some of the things we do on Earth would be better done in space, where the byproducts hurt nobody.<p>Earth does not have enough of certain resources for a really green society, based on the fact that many green technologies require various rare earths.
