The same relatively simple tax filing was sent to something like two dozen IRS offices. Each one checked the filing and weighed in on the correctness of the form. Every office said that the filing was wrong but they all came up with different and widely varying figures for what the ""correct"" figure should be. I suspect a large part of the reason this guy uses a preparer (software in this case) is so that even if ""errors"" are discovered, he can plausibly claim that he did the best he could and can expect leniency.

This is the public-facing goal of the campaign. The cause.<p>* Make up for any negative press about privacy by reinforcing the idea that their users' accounts are meant to be completely private and secure.<p>* Align themselves with human-rights causes, garnering trust amid doubts about trustworthiness and projecting a policy on censorship.<p>Posturing for war will likely prove very good for Google, and may result in the Chinese government caving. But if they actually have to go to war, it will be painful.<p>In my mind, it would be ideal for Google to posture for as long as they can, and as loud as they can, and see if they can't get the Chinese government to back down at all. Any significant win, without going to war, could be cause to not go to war, for it could be wrapped up as the government ""cooperating"".<p>Never attribute to goodwill, that which can be more adequately explained by good marketing.",1263349380

Julius II's didn't even start commissioning Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling and Raphael's Vatican Stanze (School of Athens &c) didn't start until 1508. These works don't exactly represent a decline, except by Preraphealite standards which would judge them as over-sophisitcated and lacking in primitive simplicity.</i><p><i>(That's IT: your friend's a Preraphaelite! Well history is not on his or her side; such Victorian predilections are a mere blip in the history of Western aesthetics.)</i><p><i>The generation after the giant Raphael (and the giant Durer in the North) is a much better candidate for cultural and artistic decline--a story complicated by Michaelangelo's inconvenient longevity. Historians have often pointed to the 1527 Sack of Rome as a downturn in artistic ferment, or at least in the unparalleled ascendancy of Italy. I would add that Western painting of around 1500 can scarcely be separated from the other visual arts, including the still-young (to the West) technology of print, brought to incredible levels of sophistication by Durer and others in precisely the post-1500 decades. One wonders whether your friend meant ""1500"" or ""like, 1500.""""</i><p>I don't know who got the better half of the argument but I'm unprepared to respond to the curator of the National Gallery of Canada, enjoined to resolve an Internet message board argument, by suggesting that Maciej simply wrote copy that made sense to people who know nothing about art.<p>Again: I have no idea who's right or wrong in this ""debate"", but I find it fascinating, and I found Maciej's ""essay"" a <i>joy to read</i>.
