11,8411311,story,,,1,1,recodemybrain,Ask HN: Am I being underpaid and should I switch to consulting practice?,,"Hi HN ,<p>I enjoy discussion on this site and everyday I get to learn something new. I am on H1B in US and live in Boston area.  I am wondering if I am being underpaid ?\nI have near seven years of experience and earn close to ( but less than ) $80K / annum.\nI would describe myself as fairly good though not expert in software development. I actively code and lead team of two developers. I am heavily involved in data platform engineering applications and possess good knowledge of many technologies.<p>My company employs lots of people on H1B visa ( nearly ~30 % population ). I constantly see stories on how people starting their jobs are getting $90K and on. \nI understand SF, NY are highly expensive areas so adding more $20k make sense but still Boston itself is very expensive city to live.<p>I am a bit shy and probably worst negotiator. Last year when I changed job I even did not counter the offer ( I feel bad though ! )\nI read this post https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8409020 and see people are at least earning $50 to $60 per hour ( roughly $130K or more ) and now wondering should I change from direct employment to consulting gig ? \nOne of challenge I know as of now in going for consulting is , my network is very weak. I am less social person and know very limited number of people in US.<p>I am 29 years old and might soon start a family. So not sure if consulting is way to go if you have family. I would like to know from you if I am being underpaid being on H1B.<p>Any pointers to improve myself both in terms of earning and negotiation will also be helpful.\nSorry for throwaway account and Thank you for taking the time to read the post.<p>Cheers ,<p>Fellow HN reader",1412477435.0
