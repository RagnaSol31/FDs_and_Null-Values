Keynesians at the time were convinced the depression would resume once the war ended.<p>It is interesting to note that the modern Keynesians have turned on FDR. They always are unhappy with his trying to balance the budget after years of New Deal policy failed. They have turned on Hoover because he gave up as well after his version of the New Deal failed. They seem to forget that Keynes himself approved of what Hoover was doing. Their instance on the notion that a stimulus program is never large enough to explain their failures is a pretty old one.,1267325809.0

Functional programmers in general can't help but know about OO; most of them were OO programmers before they became functional programmers. Combined with the fact that being popular has advantages (more people working on core code, an increased ability to get a job in $YOUR_FAVORITE_LANGUAGE), which causes a desire to recruit more to their cause, you end up with a strong likelihood of seeing a recruitment pitch targeted at the largest recruitable demographic. In this case, this means promising fire and brimstone to the OO heretics unless you come to the light of FP. (The linked post is not that strong, but I've seen much stronger.) You generally don't see recruitment pitches for logic programmers or VDHL programmers.<p>You should listen to the functional programmer's complaints against OO, then make up your own mind. My programming has gotten a lot more functional lately, but there are certain domains where OO really, really shines and I still end up using it there (GUI widgets, etc).

However, when GDP growth is computed, changes in the value of money do not have an effect. E.g. GDP growth from year-1 to year-2 is:<p><pre><code>  (volume produced in year 2)*(prices in year 1)\n  /\n  (volume produced in year 1)*(prices in year 1)\n</code></pre>\nSo reducing the price of something does not in-of-itself have an effect on GDP growth (or GDP stated in nominal terms). However, it's often the case that reducing the price of something means that there is more demand for, so more is produced, so (volume produced in year n+1) goes up, so GDP grows.<p>Summary: if the price of energy is reduced it will most likely lead to GDP growth - whether we could all then live better lives, I don't know. I'd like to hear a good <i>holistic</i> explanation of why GDP growth is required for national happiness..<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdp</a> - see 'Adjustments to GDP'",1267323978.0

The unspoken assumption, of course, is that we can let the whole rest of the world languish in poverty so long as we're sure that every appliance in our electrified houses and every damned faucet for our hot and cold running water was made by American hands in an American factory.

This means analyzing just how much, for example, it costs to fund wars in order to satisfy our oil demands (ie, how much this country has spent in wars bribing people, funding our veteran's health care, etc for the sake of national security, while we indirectly fund these very terrorist organisations).<p>So it's okay to debt our way to fund such wars, but it's not okay to invest in the education and health of this country's biggest economic contributors--it's citizens?<p>The problem isn't deficit spending/debt. Many successful startups or companies go through such phase where it makes sense to borrow, to dig yourself out of a hole.  The problem is whether you reinvest this back into the country, its infrastructure, its education, its health, its green technologies, etc.<p>FDR didn't get us out of the Great Depression.
