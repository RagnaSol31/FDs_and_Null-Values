Big development system is 8 gigs  two core 400gig asus MB driving a samsung 204bw, running ubuntu next-to-latest, intel gig nic.  Second montior driven by a 900mhz amd with 200gig drive, running ubuntu latest on another 204bw.  The windows box is a 64bit gigabyte MB running 32 bit w2k with bunches of scsi drives and a scsi DAT tape drive.<p>In the basement are six $300 systems (asus mn2k or such) with dual or single core, 2 gigs (one with 4 gigs), dual intel gig nics, one inboard nic each, ubuntu latest or next to latest.  And there is a cluster driven by a caos 2gig 3-nic box, with 7 diskless work nodes with 2 gig ram, 2 nics each.  With something like $400, proximity to Tiger Direct, a monitor, keyboard and a mouse, you can build a very respectable development system the next day with one hour of assembly time.<p>Then there are the recycled bunch, two running openbsd for firewalls. These are two generations ago, castoff from friends who bought their kids new boxes.  One bsd box that used to run the church website, a FIT pc running latest ubuntu that I thought might be useful (might be using it for day job if it weren't for VM Fusion--load it up with backtrack 4).  Then there are two recycled ""media"" pcs, 32bits, one of which drives the TV, and the other that, well, i think it is running ntp, and maybe a website for some friends.<p>With all this, you would think I am a system administrator, but the closest to being an SA was when I wrote the first version of the Mark Williams Coherent Administrator's Guide.  If Erin were to check my homework, I would certainly flunk.<p>What is fun at parties is to fire up the 40 inch TV with the media PC behind it and ask your dinner guests' address, and show them the bird's-eye-view of their house.  Oh, and be cautious about pulling it up with zillow.  That could get to be a not-so-positive experience at dinner time.",1279076348.0

As she got out of the car and her foot came off the brake, the car started to roll backwards (automatic transmission).  She quickly sat back down and --- I knew what was going to happen but I could not go anywhere --- she stepped on the accelerator.
