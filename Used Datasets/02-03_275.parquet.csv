I've also tried to replicate the atmosphere. Unfortunately, it seems that key ingredient is people. Which means that it cannot be reproduced on a cd. I find that if I'm not around people for a long period of time it starts to become difficult for me to work. I don't need to talk to them. I just need to have their positive auras around me, and I think this is in abundance in places like a coffee shop, were people go to relax and have a good time. Also the type of people that go there is really important. I see many people reading or working on their computers, and that is motivating.",1281322793.0

For me, it has become as if my editor is directly connected to my brain. If i want to go to a function definition, it just happens. If I want to search, i find myself a the target without every thinking ""now i need to do a search"".  When refactoring I can move chunks of code around, and refit everything to the new pattern without any thought of the text level changes.  This is brought by knowing a good tool well combined with knowing the code base and language well.  However, without the tool I couldn't be nearly as effective.",1281322780.0

It's the work of ideation - a terrible biz-buzzword that means ""creating ideas"".<p>Not the type of namby-pamby aleatoric nonsense that people boozily tell you is a million-dollar idea that they thought of like ""I thought of eBay before it was around"" or the Hollywood pitch-type ideas like ""it's a cross between Facebook and tumblr... wait for it... for book lovers.""<p>I'm talking about, everyone basically becomes an entrepreneur, or at least is the equivalent of the starving artist, essentially singing for their meal.

There is a reason why China's middle class just recently eclipsed the US in size, and it's not only because they have 5x the people. They are starting to take care of their own, and realizing their own labor's affordability.

So on days when I feel cheap, I'll just go to the library. On days when I feel like spending money I'll go to a coffee shop and buy a few cups (or one cup and put some money in the tip jar).<p>Funnily enough, I also enjoy the atmosphere/noise of a coffeeshop.

I go to coffee shops or Barnes & Noble for the atmosphere. People humming around me, having their conversations, laughing with their friends, really helps me to concentrate on my work. Right now libraries are just plain depressing. They should probably stake out a section just for people to sit down to read their books along with their coffee and another section for those that want/need 100% quiet. Right now you would have to put a gun on my head for me to even come close to one. No offense to you or anybody who likes libraries but in my mind going to a library is equal to being old and decrepit and devoid of any passion.<p>It kind of makes me glad that libraries are dying.",1281321051.0

There are quick and dirty AS 3.0 libraries, but there is an abundance of frameworks that help you organize code like PureMVC and Robotlegs which add a healthy amount of complexity. JS world has a higher proportion of simple libraries like JQuery than big and heavy ones like Google's Closure, a visitor from Java land.<p>Flex framework is what Adobe thought would help developers. They spent some effort promoting it and integrating it into their IDE. This means they're not focused on graphics heavy projects that Flash is famous for, but are expanding into the big utilitarian app territory. Such moves attract verbose programmers, who write complex example code etc..<p>The standard API in AS 3.0 is also more verbose than the AS 1.0, 2.0 or canvas equivalents. This gives advanced programmers better control, while neglecting the needs of novice coders. Adobe is pretty worried about the situation actually, very few novice coders bother with AS 3.0 because they judge syntax visually and AS 3.0 looks longer.<p>""you can still compile it ""AS 1.0 style"", just use the compiler MXMLC -ES""<p>I mentioned that online examples and libraries would use types, which pushes everyone to use them. Using non-strict mode when everyone is using strict is less convenient than just using strict.<p>I don't know what VM non-strict mode in AS3.0 uses, I thought it uses AVM2, but I shouldn't need to know. I've tried 2D AS 3.0 physics simulations with types and without and the difference was difficult to measure. Most of the time was spent on rendering visuals, not on calculations, so there was no real world speed advantage in that situation. The cases where there would be, like encoding images, need threading anyway.<p>For a language that isn't a speed demon in the first place, it makes no sense to worry about silly optimizations that are noticeable only in unrealistic benchmarks. Knowing that you need to use int instead of uint to access indexed arrays slightly faster is distracting.<p>""it's not a problem of being a non-programmer vs being a programmer, it's a problem of a group of people learning a certain way to program with AS 2.0, and when an update occurs to the language are too lazy to change their habits""<p>I picked up programming a few years ago so I still remember how painful it was to switch languages when I was a novice. Now that I'm not a novice, switching to similar languages is barely noticeable because I understand the fundamentals. Keep in mind, lots of these novices code a simple thing here and there, they don't write large programs so they don't really learn programming. When things change drastically, it makes more sense for these people to stick to AS 2.0 if they can or let a developer handle it.<p>This is not so much a problem for novices, because they have options, this is a problem for Adobe since novices have options and are choosing Processing and HTML5.<p>""let be clear about something here, you seem to think that because JavaScript or AS 1.0 does not need to assign types to variables and because they are not statically type checked at compilation or interpretation, that there is no types, sorry they have types.""<p>Yes there are types, but I'm talking about perceived language complexity and boilerplate code psychology. There are few instances where you have to worry about types in JS, but it's a constant time drain in AS 3.0.",1281320247.0
