If prices are determined adversarially, then there is no room for manipulation or conflict of interest.  Why have these indexes at all?<p>Put another way, who is willing to buy or sell according to prices that are open to manipulation (by being pegged to something like LIBOR), and why are they willing to do this?

18,4213414,story,,,4,4,lukev,What is a good high level language that is also highly efficient?,,"My personal interests, as well as most of my career, have led me to very high-level languages such as Ruby and Clojure.<p>However, I've recently become interested in some problem domains that are usually best approached by more low-level languages, which provide the maximum level of memory efficiency and performance, as well as suitability for raw binary operations. Unfortunately, having been thoroughly spoiled by managed memory and strong typing, I break out in hives at the thought of undertaking an extensive project in C or C++.<p>So what are some good languages for this? D is interesting, but I'm a bit turned off by its lack of support for concurrency. Haskell can theoretically work in this domain, but it appears that it's quite difficult to reason about its performance without an inordinate level of understanding of its implementation details.

Admittedly that isn't indicative of the quality of the product but it's something best avoided.<p>I spend my summer teaching high school students to code, but I doubt this resource would help at all. To be honest, I'm not sure what the target audience is for this. The tutorial assumes knowledge of Unix (otherwise you're copying commands such as mv, cd, touch, ...) without explanation, meaning it's not necessarily about coding anymore. Yes, knowledge of the Unix command line is important, but that complexity should either be approached explicitly or hidden away, especially with a tag line ""the best way to learn coding"". Coding is quite independent of the OS you're using.<p>I'd also question using RoR as ""the best way to learn coding"". This is nothing against the framework, simply the complexity and the amount that's magically set up for you defeats or complicates the learning process.

Much worse would be the effects on businesses that could no longer secure debt funding.<p>It's got nothing to do with the fractional reserve system, by the way - a 100% reserve bank still borrows short and lends long and still is subject to bank runs.<p>Rather than a race-condition, a better way to look at it is as an unstable equilibrium.  The bank isn't assuming it can keep your deposit for any length of time; instead, it's assuming that in aggregate over all its depositors a certain amount of money will be left on deposit at any given time.  Obviously this assumption goes out the window if the depositors act together to remove their deposits - as long as they don't, the system is in equilibrium (it's not rational to withdraw your deposit and forego the interest).  As soon as the equilibrium is disturbed and a run starts though, the risk increases sharply and it becomes rational to withdraw your deposit.
