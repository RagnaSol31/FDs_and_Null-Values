I felt the first whiff of their professionalism when computer ate my online electronic visa application, and the consulate in D.C. gave me a hand-signed ""Pass"" into Australia few hours before my flight. Second time was when I was renewing my visa, the clerk found out I had 3 days left, of which 2 were weekend days; she escorted me out of the line into an express booth and everything was sorted out. Can't wait to return here in 2 months and for my immigration papers to get approved. I am eager to call it home, what not with an aussie mrs.<p>FWIW, fellow yanks should google Australian ""COPS"" type shows, where they show police arresting criminals, etc. It's a laughable joke! I have seen drunks and thieves abuse, spit and attack police officers.

It was impossible to keep doing it as an Indie, because you needed to test your app on hundreds of devices.<p>So I worry a lot about this aspect for Android, but I have some hopes that it won't become as much of an issue.<p>The main reason is that all Android phones still have the same software basis. They have the same virtual machine and so on (except for the OS versions, but there won't be hundreds that soon). So the issue of having different bugs on every phone should be greatly reduced.<p>Another thing I hope is that it will be easier to do refunds, so I would worry less about pissing off customers when my app doesn't work on their phone. (I don't actually know how refunds work for Androids, but there must be a way?).<p>With the most common payment channel for J2ME apps, premium SMS, it was very difficult to do refunds. Typically you would only learn what phone the customer has after he sent the SMS, by which point it would have been to late to tell him that the app won't actually work for him.<p>Anyway, I just decide to be optimistic about Android for now.",1274583235.0

What she didn't realize is that English has something similar but we don't recognize it for indicating formality -- often as a class or education signal, or to use differently depending on audience.<p>I was confused but she explained...<p>Most English words of German origin are vulgar or informal, while most of Latin, Greek or French origin are formal. Like ""shit"" vs. ""feces"", ""fight"" vs. ""quarrel"", ""drink"" vs. ""imbibe"", etc. In general, where we have synonyms, and those synonyms can be ranked on a scale of informal to formal, German words are towards the informal end, and romantic origin words are towards the formal end.<p>She said it's been one of the hardest things to learn when learning English (and she's quite fluent), is this concept of ""formal"" English vs. ""informal"" that is separate from ""colloquial"", mainly because nobody recognizes it and nobody teaches it.<p>So apparently this is also something one has to learn in English - word origin, in order to gauge proper usage.",1274582577.0

Overall, Linux Desktop experience has increased substantially since 2000, but it has never really caught up with Windows (now 7) and the Mac. (I actually think that the Mac has hurt Linux adoption on the Desktop more than Windows.<p>So, I too find it quite humorous that Linux is poised to be a, if not <i>the</i> major player in the next generation of computing - the portable/dedicated devices. But what I find more amusing is that it hasn't been the success of Linux on the desktop that has made this possible, it has been the decline in the importance of the desktop.<p>So, 2010 may finally be the year of Linux, but it still won't be the year of Linux on the desktop.  And that's not necessarily a bad thing.",1274581455.0

Suppose you want a priority queue, and you have a bunch of cores, and these cores want to insert into the queue and remove the minimum element concurrently. How do you implement this to allow fast concurrent access from a lot of threads?<p>First, there's the approach everybody remembers from Intro to Algorithms: use a binary min-heap. It's guaranteed to be balanced, so you get O(lg n) time insertions and delete-the-minimum operations, with low constant factors. Nice! But how do you make it concurrent? You can put a lock on the whole thing and only let one thread use it at once, but that's slow. You could use fancy fine-grained locking, but there will still be inter-thread memory conflicts arising from the heapify operations you need to maintain the heap invariant. There has been some work on this, and they've come up with some decent ideas, but it still has scaling problems.<p>Now look at skip lists. It's a randomized sorted list data structure, and it claims to be, as you put it, probably pretty balanced. Various threads can insert concurrently without breaking that ""probably pretty balanced"" property. The memory read- and write-sets are very local, and it's possible to do all this with lock-free synchronization. The end result is a priority queue data structure that scales to hundreds of cores. And the code doesn't fry your brain, which is a plus. There's a pretty neat paper about it here:<p><a href=""http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~itayl/ipdps.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~itayl/ipdps.pdf</a><p>By the way, if you happen to be using a processor with hardware transactional memory support (you aren't, yet), then this code becomes even easier to write, as you don't have to worry about how to do lock-free synchronization.

72,1371566,comment,1371171.0,1371488.0,0,0,VanL,,,"Hmm, I will have to go back and review what I said to see if I misspoke. The basic issue is that open source licenses are copyright licenses, and so their enforceability is tied to the scope of copyright. The scope of copyright as applied to software is not at all clear, despite what anyone will tell you. And, probably not surprisingly, a lot of the ambiguity around the scope of copyright comes from the use of interfaces, APIs, and methods of linking. Python, like any dynamic language, is fuzzy around the boundaries here.<p>There are so many square pegs and round holes that anytime someone says something is ""clearly"" a derivative work, that person is almost certainly incorrect. The concepts of copyright were never meant to apply directly to software, and the law doesn't work the way people frequently intuitively think it does.<p>The problem is that applying copyright (and patent, but thats another story) restrictions to software has broad implications for what you can do with the software. This isn't just a practical issue; it is a freedom issue in the Free Software sense. I see so many bogus claims each day about IP that I have become very wary of its scope.<p>For example, a couple years ago Blizzard was able to get an injunction against another company because the other company sold a program that scripted Blizzard's software. No modification, just GUI automation. I was horrified, and disagreed, but they were able to put together a winning argument.<p>I unabashedly advocate boundaries on copyright. I think authors should say where they consider their code to end, and other code to begin. I think those boundaries should be reasonable within the scope of the law. I think this principle applies even (or especially) when it is free or open source software.",1274580743.0
