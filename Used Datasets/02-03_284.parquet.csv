44,6227972,comment,6225479.0,6226749.0,5,0,JimmaDaRustla,,,"There are two types of discharge states - typically &quot;fully discharge&quot; implies within the application the battery was designed, not completely dead. For example, a car battery is fully charged at 12.6v, but discharged at 11.2 (or somewhere around there). There is still lots of capacity left, but dead for the use of cranking over an engine. NiMH typically has a very fast self discharge rate - letting these dip well below the operational capacity level will be much more detrimental than just letting your drill die after prolonged use.<p>NiMH has memory too, but not as bad as NiCd. We always suggested allowing NiMH to fully discharge time to time, but we never suggested keeping a phone on its base constantly.<p>Both these types of batteries need to be primed properly - full discharge/recharge the first few cycles.
