I am able to articulate to people that regardless of who proposed or supported the idea, it is not a good idea to keep information on my family and friends, such as where they move, who is in their social networks, what topics they search the web for in the privacy of their own home. I feel that it is empowering to explain why it is not a necessary or proportionate response to place the entire country under surveillance on the off chance one of us was to plan a terrorist related offence. I can also explain clearly why this is something which will result in all lay people being monitored, but none of the technical savvy people who actively try and circumvent the retention scheme using a mix of offshore VPS + VPN + tor + whatever other technology helps them.<p>As beefsac said, this is a policy which will likely have support from the two major parties.
