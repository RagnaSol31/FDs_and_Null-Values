Free market economies feature so much creative destruction that power has little chance of persisting across generations.  Only in a system lacking Darwinian market selection mechanisms do credentials become so critical.  Credentialism emerged in China because the Chinese state was always much more powerful than the European crowns.<p>Credentialism has declined in the US to the extent that certain segments of the economy have adapted and grown so fast as to escape the clutches of government control.  The segments still under firm influence of regulation are heavily Mandarin and Credentialist.  Think medicine or law.,1229481694.0

A few changes to how people can invest their 401k's so they need some reasonable P/E and diversification if they have less than say 200k and are over 55 might not be a bad idea.<p>I think most of what he is complaining would be addressed with those changes and something like them might even become law but we would still have capitalism.

You've received other replies mentioning various ways, with various degrees of formality, that admission offices can and do check their results. Now that many admission offices are making very fine distinctions among applicants as admission rates plummet below 10 percent, there will probably be growing interest in validating the criteria on which admission decisions are made.<p>MIT admission office McGreggor Crowley, in one of his admission travel sessions in the last year, said his office has done studies of which students perform best in upper division courses at MIT. Taking really hard classes in high school is a better predictor of upper-division success at MIT than having a spotless G.P.A., for example. He asked a large audience of high school students how many had done baby-sitting, and very few raised their hands.

Apple isn't going to introduce an revolutionary iPhone year after year, and year after year AAPL goes through massive trade activities with speculators. We started holding up a MacBook staring at the share price every year and watch it go freakin' crazy.<p>Secondly, old media is dead. Long live new media. New media that we have in place -- online news, pro and amateur blogs, twitter, rss, facebook, chat -- has easily outstripped the effectiveness of things like trade journals and trade shows.<p>Thirdly, MacWorld has always been an odd compromise internally. Preparation for it begins early but with that pesky Exodus (12/22 - 1/2) right in the middle, it puts a rush on the rest of the 5 days to polish all of the marcomm materials and presentations. Then you have the devs all stuck in SF for an entire week.<p>If MacWorld was held at a later date then the costs might be justifiable -- it's why Apple left MacWorld Boston. The catch though is that MacWorld can't be held at a later date lest it be trumped by CES. Either way, not showing up Macworld is going to decrease the enormous strains an arbitrary January date puts on the company. The Town Hall meetings are perfectly sufficient, a lot closer, a lot cheaper, and a lot more controllable.<p>Also, Steve Jobs not doing a keynote isn't a big deal. Schiller will not be his successor (I thought at one point it was going to be Forstall but that idea went out the door), but if there's no big products to push, Steve might as well just hand it off to his lieutenants.
