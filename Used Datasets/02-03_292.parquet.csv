7,1147127,comment,1146976.0,1146976.0,0,0,abalashov,,,"While certainly interesting, not all the things the author paints here as sordid, unethical business practices actually are, at least to the extent that's intersubjective.<p>If you're doing a startup, you may want to take some lessons from the eons of microeconomics and management wisdom condensed into some of these things instead of cheering at the burning effigy of the man with the briefcase.  It's a much more pithy, intuitive introduction to concepts like economies of scale and capital investment than a theoretical overview:<p>1. <i>Charging for modifications to document templates instead of original forms as though original</i> --<p>It is common to leverage technologies, procedures and and/or existing assets as part of a service offering.  Who does anything from scratch more than 5 times before they get tired of it?<p>This is no different than one of us building an API or a framework so that programming tasks that used to take 20 hours can now be done in 5 hours.<p>In our world, that does _not_ mean you should now be billing the customer 5 hours for the same task, at least, not if you have any business sense.  If you do that, you derive no economic advantage from the up-front work you put into building that framework, nor do you even make back the time (money) you spent building it.  There's no incentive to do that;  in that case, you're better off doing everything from scratch and billing for it.<p>The proper thing to do is to transmit <i>some</i> of the advantage of your lever into the price.  If the task used to take 20 hours, now takes 5, bill the customer 15.  It's cheaper for the customer and improves your competitive position while allowing you to earn a return on the up-front investment you made in developing your efficiency-enhancing technology, which can sometimes be hundreds or thousands of man-hours.<p>This is a form of amortisation;  a fraction of the cost of the capital outlay in producing the technology is distributed into the cost basis of every application, deployment or instance.  Big companies do this all the time;  it's one of the key points that guides their pricing decisions on services that capitalise on internal tool chains, utilities, etc.  For example, if the IT department at Nortel spent $1m building a new CRM and case management system for all the support people to use, you bet the cost of that $1m is going to be distributed into the cost of support contracts by people figuring out the bottom line.  This is not only normal, but <i>prudent</i>.<p>So, while it may be deceptive to _claim_ that a document was literally prepared from scratch and bill as if it were, charging money corresponding to the literal amount of time spent on something even with the efficiency advantage of a lever you had to build is dumb.  The lawyer did, at some point, have to actually build those documents;  they're entitled to recoup their investment and build fat margins into it on top.<p>How much is a question for price competition;  the market-affirming answer is, ""as high as they can get away with.""<p>2. <i>I hand off work to peons but charge you a lawyer’s rate</i> --<p>Mostly, clients do business with a law _firm_ and pay for the services of that firm as a whole, in the aggregate.  This includes a cost basis consisting of overhead.<p>Again, to bring this back to our industry, this is no different than charging the customer $100/hr as a web design/development company, despite the fact that parts of the project might pass through a range of people with widely varying skill, credential and compensation levels.  Some of these people may be internal, others outsourced, etc.  Hourly billing is not a continuously variable transmission;  it doesn't jump up and down depending on whose exact eyeballs are on your project at this exact moment.  Compensation is for the company as a whole.<p>Besides, it requires up-front and residual investment to find, qualify, hire, train, and continuously employ a paralegal, assistant, clerk, etc., and there is no reason why their work on your behalf as a lawyer can't fetch much higher hourly rates than what you pay them.  This is no different than the reason why project-based contractors earn more hourly than permanent employees.  You want to pay $50/hr for the services of a paralegal instead of $300?  Fine, then hire them on full-time at $60k (~$30/hr) + benefits yourself, and figure out how to direct their efforts and utilise their capabilities yourself.<p>It's $1 for the nail, $199 for knowing where to put it.<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with billing a composite rate in consideration of all the time, money and expertise put into creating a firm - together with the right people, management, process and assets - that produces useful results as a cohesive whole.<p>Why would we hold law firms to different standards than we hold technology consultancies and service firms?<p>3. <i>I hope you don’t look too closely at the expense report</i> --<p>Making margin on expenses is a normal and accepted practice in many other industries;  it offsets the overhead of procuring them and dealing with them, as well as a certain amount of small, but calculated risk that you won't be remunerated for expenses incurred on the client's behalf.<p>4. <i>You’re always on the clock</i> --<p>That's also normal across the board in professional services.<p>5. <i>Your bill is only a guesstimate</i> --<p>Also normal, within a reasonable margin of error.<p>6. <i>I’m training junior attorneys on your dime</i> --<p>How is this different from, ""I'm training junior software engineers on your dime?""  Normal.<p>...<p>I'm not saying lawyers don't do seedy stuff;  you'll find no disagreement from me.  But let's be realistic here;  law firms are businesses -- it's not fair to praise everyone else's fiduciary astuteness when they do these things and vilify lawyers for them just because we all love to hate lawyers.<p>The presence of the particular points I mentioned above in the article basically says to me, ""Law firms are so evil, look at all the business-savvy and commercially normative things they do!""  This is stupid.",1266980154.0

I think the watershed will be when most developers just stop caring. I think that this move is an indication that more of us should consider that option. Google is an incredibly smart company with a truly vast user base and this announcement shows that they just don't care about alienating IE6 users. Given their obsessive attitude to testing, I can only assume that they've worked out that pissing off the few remaining IE6 users with nag screens and bugs is cheaper than continuing to support them.<p>Of course Google have other interests in pushing modern browsers, but I would be flabbergasted if they haven't done a rigourous cost/benefit analysis on the decision. Given their economies of scale, I think this is an indication to those of us with more limited resources that we should just ignore IE6 users unless we have strong evidence that they matter. In the Pareto sense, it's just not a good use of developer time.<p>I have no evidence for it, but I have an intuitive expectation that IE6 users are generally bad customers - I would expect that they demand more customer support, are less likely to pay for online services, are more likely to contribute negatively to communities etc. Of course there are plenty of users who are stuck on IE6 because of bad corporate IT policy, but there are plenty who are too lazy or uninformed to upgrade their browser and frankly I don't want that kind of person as a customer.",1266979261.0

I have some random observations about German <i>Autobahnen</i> leading to no specific conclusion.<p>* Autobahns have narrower lanes, and fewer of them relative to US Interstates. The most I've seen is four per side near Berlin. Two is standard, even in fairly high-traffic areas. Three is becoming a little more common than it was a few years ago, but it's still quite rare.<p>* Lane discipline is usually quite good. Passing on the right is illegal except for in traffic jams, and it's fairly rare that anyone does. Failing to cede the left lane to passing traffic when the right lane in clear is also quite rare.<p>* Drivers wishing to pass often become impatient with anyone using the left lane to pass at a slightly lower speed than they would prefer.<p>* Traffic jams are exceedingly common, often due to construction zones, which have even narrower lanes and very low speed limits. During a traffic jam, traffic comes to a stop, and occasionally moves for short periods of time at low speeds. During an extended stop, it is common for drivers to get out of their cars and chat, referred to as an Autobahn party.<p>* Very slight imperfections in the pavement usually lead to a <i>Straßen shäden</i> (damaged street) sign and soon after, a complete rebuild of that section of highway. It's rare to drive for an hour without encountering a construction zone.<p>* Most cars drive at speeds between 80 and 90 mph when there is no speed limit. Truck and cars pulling trailers are limited by law to 60 mph. On occasion, a car, usually a high-end German make will drive by in the left lane at around 150 mph.<p>* I have never seen an accident on an unlimited-speed section of Autobahn.",1266978333.0

(A monad is like a burrito, a monad is like a space suit, a monad is like a nuclear waste container...)<p>The tutorials start with some analogy, and then inevitably explain how ""the list monad"" and ""the maybe monad"" work.  At the end you know that monads are like burritos, how to apply a function to every value in a list, and how to return failure from a function.  But you still don't know anything about monads, or more importantly <i>why</i> monads.<p>If I were to write a monad tutorial, it would include these key points:<p>1) A monad is not a thing, it's a property of other things.  Maybe is a thing.  A list is a thing.  Both are monads.  (My bike is a thing.  My wall is a thing.  Both are blue.)<p>2) The abstract concept of a monad lets you reuse code.  If you want to apply a function to every value of a list, you could do that without monads.  If you want functions to be able to fail, and you want the failures to be composable, you could do that without monads.  But what you can't do without monads is write a function like liftM2.  With monads, you can turn a normal function into one that works on lists.  Or that works on IO.  Or that works on computations that can fail.  You get to use the same function for all three types.  That's the point of monads.<p>(Then there will be a code example:<p><pre><code>    2 + 3 --> 5\n    liftM2 (+) (Just 2) (Just 3) --> Just 5\n    liftM2 (+) Nothing (Just 3) --> Nothing\n    liftM2 (+) (Just 2) Nothing --> Nothing\n    liftM2 (+) [1,2] [3,4] --> [4,5,5,6]\n    liftM2 (+) readLn readLn --> 1 <ENT> 2 <ENT> --> 3\n</code></pre>\nThen it all makes sense!)",1266977884.0

Mostly on paper and and Excel spreadsheets. Not some advanced scheduling software - BY HAND.<p>2) I've been told we have several Petabyte storage facilities that our parent company uses, but we get an email every two weeks or so asking people to delete their files off the server which houses our websites because the storage on these servers are full.<p>3) Our client database is around 18 years old and has never been upgraded. It's impossible to run queries on the database (impossible as in not able to. Not impossible as in difficult to do). We were told they were going to fix the problem, but all they did was upgrade the interface, then told everybody they fixed it. It's actually slower now then it was before they upgraded the interface.<p>4) We have several developers who have built applications that have greatly improved the way we build our sites. Unfortunately, they don't train anybody to actually support the application. This means when the developer (the sole supporter) quits or moves to another department, there's no support for these applications - which has happened twice in the last two years. With no active support, we've had to abondon these applications or try and build new ones.<p>There's more, but I think you get the idea.
