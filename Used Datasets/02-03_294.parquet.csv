I understand why you would need this in that case.<p>At that point you'd simply have to address pricing.  With some napkin math I just paid $15/TB/month (for duration of warranty) for near-line storage.  I'm taking liberties here with assumptions (no power or cooling but this offsets the cost of longer transfers to the cloud vs internal to your data center).  I'm also not factoring in personnel costs.<p>For consumers I have absolutely no idea what the pricing would be like.  $15/TB/month seems <i>cheap</i> and I would probably be expecting something between 25 and 100GB for that same price if you told me what your product does.,1315536751.0

An artist wouldn't be able to completely sell the 'rights' to his work but he could certainly work out an arrangement whereby some record label or studio or publisher, etc., agrees to distribute his work for him in exchange for a portion of the proceeds. The only difference is that after the deed is done, the artist still owns the work and can work out a similar arrangement with someone else, should he choose.<p>This isn't uncommon even now, actually, but especially with yet-unknown artists publishers will often push pretty hard against it, and usually get what they want.
