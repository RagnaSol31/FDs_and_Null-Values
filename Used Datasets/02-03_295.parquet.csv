2,3229694,comment,3229133.0,3229503.0,2,0,Jach,,,"Adding to the other comments, I find it easiest to think of Flex as a Flash-version of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and pick-your-favorite-JS-libraries such as jQuery and Sencha. Instead of HTML, Flex has MXML. Instead of JS, it has ActionScript. (Though both come from the same language standard.) CSS works, and they bundle a good set of default themes and widgets. I think it's a really nice piece of work, especially when they put out Flex 4, it's a joy to work in compared to raw HTML+JS. The only downsides are Adobe, the flash runtime, and the intellectual heritage of Java sometimes getting in the way.",1321153179.0

20,3229676,comment,3229360.0,3229360.0,6,0,michaelpinto,,,"I've read quite a few biographies and what i hate about Walter Isaacson is that everything becomes an oversimplified Time magazine article, which makes every character into a flat cartoon caricature. My guess is that Jobs could be a jerk, but then if you were a multimillionaire in your early 20s how could you not be a jerk? Also the tech industry is filled with tons of very bright people who are social cripples. The harsh reality is that to build something like a Macintosh you might have to be quite nasty to pull off the scale of cat herding that may be required.<p>I also hate to admit this: But I half suspect Jobs picked out Isaacson because he'd draw a cartoon sketch instead of doing a serious biography. I'm still not done reading the book yet, but I almost feel that I know less about Jobs than before I started reading the damn thing. And the other thing that drives up the wall is that you get the feeling that Isaacson doesn't have a clue about technology -- so you half wonder how much he missed. And I suspect Jobs wanted it that way -- instead of burning his papers he just picked a lightweight.<p>By the way if any of you want to read an amazing biographer look at the work of Robert Caro who is a real writer. His first book ""the Power Broker"" is an amazing study Robert Moses who is a very flawed hero who really made NYC what it was (for both better and worse). He's also written several books on LBJ who also starts out as a progressive and does both amazing and terrible things in his life. I wish someone like that had done this bio...",1321152792.0

It can determine a function is polymorphic but this has nothing to do with how the polymorphism is implemented.  AFAIK Ocaml (by that I mean the INRIA Ocaml implementation) doesn't specialize polymorphic functions at all.  Types are boxed and the boxes are all the same size so a single function definition is all that is needed for a polymorphic function or type.  .net does do these things but, again, that has nothing to do with type inference.

In Pixar's early days he invested an awful lot of his then-fortune into keeping it alive, and it was his cunning negotiation skills that kept Pixar from being swallowed by the then flailing Disney.<p>If you contrast his behaviour at Pixar and at Disney, I think it illustrates that he didn't consider the work at Pixar to be 'his art'. There were other people at Pixar who were leading the 'art' there and it was all in hand.<p>At Apple on the other hand, it's completely clear that Jobs' considered the products to be 'his art' and his conviction was such that he literally was going to drag everyone, kicking and screaming, to realise his vision. And that he did, in a world of horrible consumer electronics he would not abide, he set out and truly lead the creation of some very awesome and uncompromising products. It was his Art.<p>Imagine if Andy Warhol or Piccasso or any other famous artist relied on the expertise of many individuals to realise their creations. Do you think they'd be considering that all you want is your 9-5 job and your 401k and 4 weeks holiday a year. Nope, they'd be behaving in exactly the same way: aggressive and fervent conviction. Work ceases to become merely a job and you're no longer working, you're crusading.<p>In a world of unambitious and mediocre individuals, you have to move mountains to do great work that requires multi-disciplined collaboration.
