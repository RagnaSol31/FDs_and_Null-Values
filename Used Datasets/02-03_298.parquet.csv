The smallest capacity iPad has been a 16 GB since the first one in 2010.<p>Personally, I'm using practically all of the 8 GB SD card that's in my Nexus One at the moment. (Much of it is music - I listen to fairly obscure stuff not readily available on streaming services.) I'm about to move up to a 16 GB card. Most people probably won't have 8 GB of music but 8 GB of video is very possible. Then there's downloadable content for media apps for the tablet.<p>I'm not going to buy a non-upgradeable device with storage space that's limited since yesterday, and paying a premium for what should be baseline kinda stinks. More than $15 for the 8 to 16 GB upgrade is just bad, as is no 32 GB option.",1342407447.0

""the worst that could happen is that I'd have to\ngo back to working for someone else. There's no chance that I could die, so why the hell not give it a try?"".<p>When I mustered up the courage to tell my CIO (who I report to...) that I was leaving - he was sad to see me leave, but overjoyed that I'd be taking the risk and trying a new venture (he co-founded the company I currently work for and previously sold an earlier startup to Cisco).<p>So with the encouragement of others around me, I could only blame myself for not following through and giving the 'startup' thing a try.<p>... and thus, I would impart this advice to you.<p>Over the last few months, we've been brushing up our coding skills by building prototypes of ideas we like (and launching them - this is the hard part). One of them is a project we call Math Brain (<a href=""http://mathbrain.com.au/exam"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathbrain.com.au/exam</a>) which helps students in Grade 12 practise for their university entrance exams (or as we call them in Australia - High School Certificate).<p>The site is not supposed to be a billion dollar business - but it seems to have started getting some regular usage (we were plesantly surprised). Hopefully, we can continue building upon this and perhaps build a proper business out of it (we would never had known if we had never launched it).<p>At the same time, we're not putting all our eggs in one basket - like you, we've got a number of other app ideas we'd like to prototype and release - all built & following the lean startup methodology.<p>The difference though, is that we have external pressure to deliver - i.e. both my wife and parents are invested our venture succeeding and therefore we demo things to them regularly. They got sick of me telling them about the ideas I have and showing them mockups of products - now they tell me to shut up and build it.<p>The trick, I believe is to make sure that you have someone outside of you and your co-founders putting the pressure on to deliver the project. Once you've got this external pressure, your likelihood of success is already higher.<p>The fact that you have a wife that can support you financially is great - because now you are both invested in making sure you are successful - this is great motivation!!!<p>I hope this helps in getting the fire started... god speed!",1342407430.0

These OS X features save data in hidden locations, separate from the file.<p>This means that:<p>(a) it is very difficult to delete a file and be certain it's really gone,<p>(b) you can't have a public area, a private area, and a highly confidential area on the same system; it's all commingled to the same level of privacy,<p>(c) you can't make a backup of the non-confidential files without risk of getting the confidential files too,<p>(d) pieces of an encrypted file (if you use TrueCrypt for example) might get saved unencrypted in Spotlight's and Version's hidden locations,<p>I could go on, but you get the idea. It breaks down the notion of a file having a distinct level of security or privacy, and doesn't replace it with a better notion.<p>We <i>already</i> had the following problems:<p>(1) deleting a file doesn't really remove it on any major OS, including OS X, unless you use a special shredding program, and these days even shredding may be ineffective on solid-state drives because of wear-leveling and caching,<p>(2) the swap space can contain pieces of a file,<p>(3) temporary files created by editors, word processors, and other apps might retain parts of file.<p>Now Spotlight and Versions make the problem even worse for Mac users who care strongly about privacy and security.<p>We're getting to the point--or probably well past the point--where you have to maintain at least 2 or 3 separate systems: one for public work, another for personal or private work, and a third for highly confidential work.",1342407211.0
