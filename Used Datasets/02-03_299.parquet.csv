If you are someone who values doing things <i>outside</i> of work that might be very valuable to you, if you are someone who values what you do <i>at</i> work, it might be a negative.<p>2) location(s) -- This is where you will be spending your time while working. It could be the middle of a cubicle farm, far away from a window, and it could be in the back seat of new fighter jets working with avionics. Depending on how much energy you get from variety (or how drained you get from moving around) that might be a good thing or a bad thing.<p>3) environment -- Generally you spend a lot of time at work relative to say &quot;home&quot; so what is available there to make that more comfortable, whether it be nap chairs, a lounge with pinball machines and a pool table, a well stocked library, or a cafe, has an impact on how &quot;hard&quot; it is to work there. Where hard in this context is defined as pushing yourself to do something you would rather not be doing given any choice of your time.<p>4) and money -- which is, at least for me, somewhat secondary in terms of how much I &quot;like&quot; or &quot;dislike&quot; my job. It is very important to me that I can share economically in delivering something excellent, it is less important how much over my baseline minimum you pay. But there is a baseline.<p>There is a fifth consideration, which is my own personal path of learning. So for example when I was at Intel and interviewed at Sun Microsystems I had the choice of working in the kernel group (very technical) or being what was essentially a technical marketing engineer. I initially chose the latter because my goal was to be able to start and run companies in the future, and to do that I had to know what marketing really did, the best way to learn that was to embed myself in a group that was known to do good marketing. And about a year and a half later, after learning what I needed to know, I transferred over to the kernel group and worked there which was much more in my comfort zone.<p>So in any conversation I have about a half dozen variables I&",
