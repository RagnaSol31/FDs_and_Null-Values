There’s a reason they aren’t using their intelligence to trade financial instruments or writing programs to do it for them.<p>The most vulnerable to corruption are often those with middle-class lifestyles who are living above their means and stretched to make ends meet. They often value the appearance of a comfortable lifestyle, and once you start playing golf with Alice, drinking fine wines with Bob, and horseback riding with Carol, you are in a deep financial hole.<p>Worse, it’s really all about the social aspects for such people, so the idea of a tight fiscal diet to regain control of their finances is anathema to them. They can’t suffer the shame of having to admit to their social circle that they don’t belong.<p>It’s easy for authorities to target those running up debts.<p>The irony is, sometimes everyone in the same social circle are all in over their head. They’re all suffering from a kind of impostor syndrome, each of them thinks that everyone else can afford the Suburban in the driveway and the jet-ski in the garage, and that they’re the only one in trouble. In reality they’re all in a Red Queen’s Race.",1435025407.0
