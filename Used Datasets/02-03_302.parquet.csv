It quickly dawned on me RV parks have mostly remained mostly offline businesses, while customers are becoming vastly wifi-connected.  I've done user validation by talking to RV park owners and customers to establish bookings as a pain point. After doing market research and studying competitors' current offerings, I decided to go all-in.<p>I'm looking for a technical cofounder with the technical experience to release and scale up a robust, secure, and rapid-loading booking system. I am fully committed to taking this idea from prototype to revolutionizing RV booking, and want someone who's the same.  No freelancers or 10- hours-a-week people with day jobs.<p>Ready for review: UI mockups and a business plan with analysis of existing competitors and on what angles we'll compete, long-term roadmap broken down into MVP and milestones. 50% equity is starting point for discussion.<p>As for this biz cofounder, I have deep domain experience, marketing and customer development success for another startup (5000+ email signups), experience with technical teams (incl. manager of an outsourced team), competitive SEO/SEM campaigns, and fundraising interest from angels and VCs.  I'm an award-winning blogger marketing my startups, and I've run e-communities with 10k+ users. I trained coworkers and employees in native billing and invoice systems for a small business. These interpersonal skills will be paramount during the outreach rush after product release.<p>I hustle like there's always a fire in my rearview mirror. I will do whatever needs to get done, incl. driving across North America to drive our membership.  Re: ""sweat equity,"" I believe hard work for hard work's sake is fool's gold in a startup. I pride myself on hustling to learn quickly about our customer's needs and our product's fit with said needs.<p>Contact: joeychang1983@gmail.com",1349923343.0

Although you'd probably need to correct for industry area, since I'm guessing females choose a different set of markets to go after, in aggregate.<p>Crappy logic aside, I actually do think the original claim that women boost startup success is probably true.

63,4639084,comment,4638918.0,4638918.0,12,0,Jun8,,,"One thing that annoyed me (and it's typical of writing on gender and racial issues) is that he bends over backwards to state, effectively, ""not that having women execs don't drive success"". This hyper-careful threading brings to mind the famous Seinfeld ""not that there's anything wrong with that"" episode (""The Outing"").<p>My approach in these matters is Bayesian: Do having female, black, Asian, Indian, etc. executives drive start-up success? The a priori probability I assign to this statement is 0.5, i.e. may or may not. I also employ the My Human Law of Large Numbers, i.e. any ""large enough"" human population (i) has a Gaussian distribution of any cognitive skill and (ii) the parameters of this distribution is pretty much independent of the particular population sample. I don't have solid proof of this principle and in certain subdomains it may be wrong (e.g. the great cognitive differences between men and women debate, etc.) but I doubt that population differences would be significant.<p>Now, armed with the simple Bayesian approach and the MHLLN, we can see that most of these articles are BS. The evidence to move the a priori value of 0.5 up or down should be <i>substantial</i>, e.g ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof"". I would be <i>extremely</i> surprised if any gender, racial, etc. factor would derive success of any size company.<p>Since the above analysis is rather trivial, one then has to ask why these things continue to be written. I think the motivation is usually benign: One sees the dearth of women in startups and wants to show that ""it's a good thing"". This approach, however, is misguided in that, by making silly arguments or sub-par statistical analysis, it hurts the cause due to the ""the lady doth protest too much"" effect: many people politely nod, but see through your sloppiness and internally become convinced of just the opposite cause (especially if they are inclined to do so, i.e. if the prior was less than 0.5).<p>A quote I like a lot is ""To be ideological is to preconceive reality."" These authors, rather than being objective, have already decided what their results will be and are just filling up the blanks.",1349922173.0
