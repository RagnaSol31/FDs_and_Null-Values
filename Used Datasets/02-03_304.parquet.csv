Massive crowds cram around Cape Canaveral for hours before a launch. The shuttles are impressive: lifting several humans and massive cargo into orbit. Would smaller vessels, sized like Space Craft Two, have held us equally engaged? Conjecture, but I doubt it.<p>That the space shuttle fleet ""does nothing well"" is a harsh statement, and not true. The software that runs the shuttles, for example, was not just ""done well"", but is one of the most impressive pieces of software ever written. Millions of lines of code, very few bugs. The process to create the software is nearly as flawless as the software itself. Even if the fact that it had to be so complex misses the point (that a smaller system needn't be so complex), it is still an example of part of the shuttle design that was ""done well"".<p>Humans can adapt to scientific experiments faster and better than any machines could have, even by remote control, in the 1980s. You simply cannot build a general purpose scientific experiment machine, launch it into space, and get results back. You would have to build specialty systems (such as the rather successful Gravity Probe B).<p>Yes, each shuttle launch could have had its constituent  goals carved into a dozen smaller vehicles and missions... yet would the overall price tag for a dozen smaller missions be any lower than a single shuttle mission? Perhaps. (Not having a single point of failure would be the largest benefit.)<p>I think we're mostly on the same page. There are other ways to get space-bound. However, a sweeping statement that the creation and deployment of the shuttle fleet across 130 missions resulted in nothing of worth, nothing of value, or that the design does ""nothing well"" is a tad off the mark.<p>It inspired. It sent people and objects into space. I agree that there were other, less expensive ways, that could have been less prone to failure. Even more, projects run over-budget and can still be considered successful, valuable, and ""done well"". (The Mars rovers, for example, were 300 million over budget. A roaring success and that was done exceedingly well.)<p>Some design components of the shuttle were done well. Others, I wholly agree, were not.",1306810578.0

In the opening sentence of the second paragraph the author says...<p>""It's been over five years since the landmark study in Nature that showed ""few differences in accuracy"" between Wikipedia and the Encyclopedia Britannica.""<p>But if you follow the link provided you find the study "" examined a range of scientific entries on both works of reference and found few differences in accuracy.""  So the analysis wasn't of the encyclopedia as a whole but only scientific articles.<p>So the author chose to bend the truth to make the point he wanted.  This is the problem with Wikipedia.  Of course most scientific entries will be largely accurate because very rarely are empirically observed facts controversial.  But compare an entry on a political topic and you'll find a greater variance (or at least that's what I found when I just compared the Wikipedia entry of George W. Bush with the Britannica 2010 Deluxe)<p>The rest of the article is basically just a rehash of two widely discussed ideas: Social Learning and the Wisdom of Crowds.

It's simpler than that. Strategically and legally speaking, you never don't want rights, even if those are rights you shouldn't, by any reasonable moral judgment, have. Companies ask for aggressive terms not to be malevolent and devious but because the lawyer's job is to get the most aggressive terms (i.e. the most rights) possible. If it were legal for a company to assert rights over an employee's work for 2 years after employment, shareholders would expect executives, and executives would therefore expect lawyers, to push for those terms. The game, at least in theory, is about getting the most aggressive (and yes, often unfair) terms upfront and letting the courts sort it out.",1306810505.0

At least some of these could be concat'd together. HTTP request carry a lot of overhead, so fewer is better. I bet at least some could be moved to the bottom as well, with some CSS/JS to avoid the dreaded Flash Of UnBehavioured Content.<p>- In a similar vein, you're loading a lot of images, more overhead again. At least some of these (like the clouds) could probably be combined into one file and then separated out with CSS.<p>- You're not setting long expire headers on your resources, bad for caching.<p>- You don't seem to be serving up gzipped resources.<p>- Some of the scripts aren't even minified.<p>Take clouds.js for example, you use a whole HTTP request on this one file, and it's small.

That in and of itself should tell you that probably people who only serve the high-end clientele are going to do better on average (e.g. in reviews), yet the market is much larger if you can serve both mid-to-low and high-end, and as far as I can tell Airbnb is doing both.<p>Which is to say, Airbnb says you have to have do due diligence yourself (which some people won't do, and will have bad experiences), whereas VRBO filters for you, but you will end up paying more on average.<p>That's to say, if asking which business model is better, I think you have to go 100% with Airbnb. Giving users more power makes them like you better in the long run, and even if there are more flakes, there will also be 10x more enthusiasts (potentially even celebrities which become investors/advisers).

They're very likely to lose the offer.

How many 22-year-olds expect to write a $20,000/month iPhone app, some time in the future, and aren't already trying to do it? Also, if you do a side project on your own equipment and time, most of the time you can hide the fact that much of the work occurred while under a surrender-all; if nothing else, just rewrite the code outright after you leave, since the code will be better and take much less time to write on a second write. This means, from a practical standpoint, that most people don't worry about this situation until/unless they end up in the 0.1% it actually affects and it's too late.

I think he'd also agree that algorithmic improvements are also easier to make in higher-level languages than in assembly. I'd argue, then, that it's more worth your time to spend your time iterating and squeezing as much algorithmic optimization of the higher-level program, than squeezing as much assembly optimization out of x86 as you can.<p>There is the case that there is a solution is known to be algorithmically optimal, or there is only one leading contender for optimal and it's unlikely to be toppled and you have to have a PhD and a couple postdocs in theoretical CS to begin to approach a way to challenge it, in which case it would indeed be more worth your time to optimize the assembly code. I hear Adobe Photoshop uses an FFT written in optimized assembly because almost every CPU-intensive thing they do uses it. Has he taken a gander at that? Pretty sure the fastest known way to calculate prime numbers changes a couple times a year.<p>However, that is only the case with textbook CS problems, and I think most HN members would agree that in industry, software engineering is almost never actually about solving textbook problems, and tends to have quirks that lead to clever algorithmic optimizations that are continually being discovered.",1306809460.0

It isn't so much that the GNU GPL allows or disallows you to sell a commercial version without source but rather that the original copyright holder can release the software under as many different licenses as they want to, similar to the way that Nokia (ne Trolltech) used to release Qt as GPL but also sell commercial licenses that allowed you to not be beholden to the GPL.  The trick is that the person releasing under multiple licenses must own all the code (which is one of the reasons some projects require copyright assignment to contribute).<p>Of course all of this is likely irrelevant in this specific case, since I don't think this guy is telling the truth here, but you can absolutely sell GPL (or any other FOSS license) licensed code to other parties under a different license that doesn't require them to share code as long as you hold the copyright to that code.",1306809100.0

I believe that's one reason why plenty of OSS projects (GNU & Android both spring to mind although with opposite motives) require contributors to assign copyright as part of contributing.<p>Alternatively, it's also a problem if you (say) link a bunch of GPL-licensed libraries to your own OSS source code.

There are entire sections on modern processors dedicated to handling weird addressing modes and complex CISC instructions that are unnecessary now. I don't know the specific reason why 'scasd' isn't generated when he wants it, but I <i>do</i> know that a lot of these special purpose instructions are often superseded by more powerful instructions less than a decade after they are introduced.<p>In fact, due to the unique awesomeness of x86, sometimes instructions are superseded by <i>inferior</i> instructions. My favorite is 'loop.' Most x86 loops are executed with two instructions -- decrement a counter and jump if not zero (dec/jnz). x86 has a 'loop' instruction that does this operation in one step, yet on modern processors (Athlon and up) it is at least 8 times slower than dec/jnz (<a href=""http://crackthecode.us/amd64_opt/OptExperiment.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crackthecode.us/amd64_opt/OptExperiment.html</a>).<p>How could that be? Does 'loop' handle some edge case or trigger some crufty microcode that slows things down? Nope. Windows 98 relied on the 'loop' instruction for hard-coded timing loops in drivers. The k6-2 executed these very efficiently, and as the processor hit 350 mhz the speed of the processor triggered race conditions making Windows 98 crash. Consumers obviously found fault with AMD for making a chip that was too good, so loop was artificially slowed in the Athlon (and all processors afterward) forever crippling a perfectly good instruction. A wily assembly programmer optimizing for a k6-2 would have dramatically slower execution on tight loops for no good reason.<p>More info:\n<a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/192841"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/192841</a><p><a href=""http://devforums.amd.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=36&threadid=2494&highlight_key=y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devforums.amd.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=36&...</a>",1306807351.0
