I can't fault a science fiction story for showing the possible sociological consequences of scientific progress, no matter how much I don't ""like"" the direction science or society is taking—that's the whole point of science fiction, after all.<p>People like to have protagonists with ""human"" values to root for in stories—in fact, it can be said that consuming narrative is basically how humans indulge in pretending to believe their own far values (by identifying with characters that act on those far values as if they were near, and then ""liking"" the works of writers that cause those identifiable characters to ""win"" the story—or, alternatively, that cause characters without those values to ""lose"", as in tragedies.)
