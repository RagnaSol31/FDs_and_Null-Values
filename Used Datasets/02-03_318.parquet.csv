A court isn't a VM running the law as a bytecode. It's a bunch of humans, and they operate on common sense, too.<p>Often there are gray areas and it's possible to sidestep the law, but you need a minimum of plausibility... if you put a note on textbooks to say ""for use as fuel only"", then go and sell it to students, I doubt that'll fool anyone.<p>It's the same thing for selling burned CDs with a note to say ""for use as recycled plastic only"". There's a difference between selling them by the crate to a recycling center, and letting customers buy specific titles individually.

14,4707990,comment,4707771.0,4707771.0,5,0,AgentConundrum,,,"A couple minor nitpicks, in the interest of improving the site:<p>- On smaller screens/windows, the ""plugin examples"" slides overlap the text at the top, particularly the subheadline/description. Obscuring this text prevents visitors from immediately understanding what the site is about, which could cause them to bounce quickly.<p>- I'm not a fan of the missing vertical scrollbar, but that's just a personal opinion. It should be noted that it does appear if you use the arrow keys to scroll, but not if you use PgUp/PgDn or Home/End. If you page down and then start scrolling with the arrow keys, you get scrolled back to the top of the page to where you would have been had you used the arrows from the start. It's inconsistent, and potentially confusing.<p>- I'm not sure about the advice to non-Perl programmers that ""if you don't know Perl, you can just use this Rosetta Stone-like page to hack it together using your language of choice as a reference"".

There is so much space which can be utilised.\nEx: The left category bar can be pulled up so viewers at first glance can see the entire inventory and choose directly without having to scroll down. Give them the answer before they ask. \nb)Since albums/art work are the main part of your site I would suggest getting a slider/carousel style template so you can give more info in less space. Ex: TheFilmReview.com (see how they use the slider to their advantage, not perfectly done but you get the idea). \nc) Since this is a music oriented website, give it more life.\nHere are a few examples how a music/band websites should look: <a href=""http://www.mybandtheme.com/features/17-beautiful-layouts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mybandtheme.com/features/17-beautiful-layouts/</a>\nd)Single page websites, especially ones which do not have enough relevant content/information, and redirect users to other sites forcing them to purchase products are a hard sell. I would suggest once they click on one of the albums take them to a dedicated page where there is some info about the album (history/concept/production) and on that page populate your affiliate links or redirect people from there. Give users info they are seeking and that will lead to purchase.\nAll a quick redirect with no relevant info leads to is a high bounce rate.<p>Hope this helps.",1351392040.0

If you do email marketing, I think SendGrid might be a good option to measure email engagement metric, on top of not having to maintain an email service.<p>If ever you feel like doing more data crunching on your own, I recommend getting started with Splunk. The company i work for uses it extensively. Splunk is phenomenal but tricky to use properly (I'll explain). I think the reason it works so well for us is because every action taken by either the server or user-facing devices is carefully logged. As a result, we're able to pull insightful user metrics in highly customizable way that any other service out there just can't get you. Here's the downside of Splunk: since it's so hands-on, there's little initial guidance as to what you should be looking at, and thus the hardest part of Splunk is knowing how to ask the right question. Beyond that, it definitely has its quirks. For example, I wish it was easier to export data to do more in depth data analysis with matlab and the likes (they have a so-so api). I also question the accuracy of their indexing at times (rumors has it around the office that there are log lines that don't get properly fetched...). In any case, if you are serious about analytics (and can afford it in the long run), Splunk is a strong candidate. It will force you to think long and hard about what exactly you are trying to measure.<p>edit: grammar.",1351391507.0

It isn't subsistence farmers campaigning for nature reserves.  Even compare poor versus rich housing areas - you immediately know which one has more ""green"".<p>Prosperity is strongly correlated with (and some argue caused by) trade and specialisation.  Compare this with anti globalisation and ""local"" movements.  It is certain that the latter leads to subsistence if taken to its logical conclusion.

There is also the matter of influence.<p>In the mid 80's I took Dan Friedman's (author of <i>The Little Schemer</i>) Programming Languages course and simply had a ton of fun learning all about Scheme & the implementation of languages. I had no idea at the time it would be by far the most important class that I took as either an undergraduate or graduate student.<p>Turns out, one of the most important things programming languages do is influence the way we learn and think about computation. I've learned crucial lessons from Scheme and all the languages I've worked in over the years. To this day, I am perplexed by people so vested in one programming language that they fear instead of savor the chance to work in another.<p>As a math major, a key lesson demonstrated so vividly by Prof Friedman & by the philosophy of Scheme resonated with me personally: the importance of clearly understanding ""what depends on what?"" and of learning which things can and/or should be made fundamental and which derivative.<p>The Golang Team has looked at their problem domain and, through the creation of Go, has built a striking and innovative statement on what they've judged as fundamental. I welcome their emphasis on selectivity over accumulation and believe there is much to be learned from their choices.",1351391151.0

The simpler (and more efficient, as it doesn't have to build a list of results!) way to do that is using the built-in sum() with a generator expression:<p><pre><code>    sum(len(s) for s in ss)\n</code></pre>\nThe rest of the slides are full of similarly-complex idioms.
