SF still felt like a tech backwater then; now it doesn't so much. However, I believe the research. Likely the SF tech workers were just really poorly deployed in 2000.<p>I imagine fairly small in number of employees, but the nonprofit tech sector in SF has also become really important over the past half-decade, in particular Wikimedia Foundation and Public Library of Science. The Internet Archive is an old stalwart that has recently expanded. (I work for a smaller related nonprofit, Creative Commons, that moved from Stanford to SF in 2004, and (sadly) is moving from SF to Mountain View (where Mozilla is another significant tech nonprofit) next month.) I think there's an interesting cluster here.<p>Clearly Oakland/Berkeley/Emeryville is the future.

And furthermore, the author, like many others, misses completely that school isn't meant to be OTJ training.  If it were, more than half of your units wouldn't be 17th century female philosophers from Rwanda.  To the extent that you directly study programming in school, it is almost all hands-on.<p>I am in agreement with the general thrust that people learn from experience.  My point is that he opens this up with a somewhat false argument that in school you read things in a book and then you're done.  That's not the case even at the worst schools (well maybe the worst). And then goes on to suggest that programming, UI design, and product strategy (whatever that is) is some how different.  Here my point was that virtually every vocation in the world shares the trait that you need to practice the vocation.  That's why there's actual cars in autoshops.<p>What a structured vocational education tries to do is to move you from topic to topic so that you cover the ground of a professional.  This avoids the problem where as an apprentice you become really good at fixing this one particular bug, because that's the main job your mentor gets called out to do.  Of course, you can move to a system where there are required skills you must exibit over your apprenticeship, but now you're just moving to structured education in a new cloth.",1310007194.0

I lament the loss of that.<p>I've read about and experienced (as an investor) so many instances of other people lying/cheating/stealing in order to make extra money - it's amazing what CEOs get away with in public companies. And it's very sad to me that trustworthy/ethical CEOs are in the minority.<p>So now I tend to automatically think in terms of incentives and what the other side of a large money transaction will do, whether it involves buying/selling a house, inheritance issues, fund raising for a private school, etc. Sometimes, this thinking is not warranted - but it's automatic now.",1310007139.0

The GSM signaling infrastructure is not especially suited to reordering and queuing of signaling frames. The scarce resource here is time on PCH (MT case) or RACH (MO case, which is more significant as contention there can waste resources even more), actual data transfer transaction is relatively expensive (and not-so well designed), but comparable in resource consumption to initial allocation of used SDCCH.

I especially tend to imagine what will happen in ""bad"" situations, and what will cause failure scenarios.  What if the array is null?  What if it's just empty?  Etc.<p>Developing a habit of thinking like this is crucial for being a good programmer.  However, this manner of imagining failure situations is generally bad in the real world.  I notice myself doing it from time to time (more often I've been working a lot).  Today I caught myself in an empanada shop wondering where I was going to go to get change for my 100 peso note if the empanada man didn't happen to have change (Argentina has a significant change shortage).  I was worrying about this before it was even time to pay.  It ended up being no problem at all.

That's nice to see.<p>But it doesn't seem to me that we'd expect to see an immediate bump in iPhone's numbers from Verizon for at least three reasons unrelated to the platform's (potential) desirability:<p>1) The iPhone has a lot more competition among Verizon customers. For a while, if you wanted a good smartphone with AT&T, you were getting an iPhone. We wouldn't expect to see ""auto-flocking"" to the iPhone on Verizon like there was on AT&T for that reason.<p>2) Contract rollover inhibits fast reaction to new developments. I know a substantial number of people who went Android with the Motorola Droid release in November, 2009. For a 2 year contract, that means November, 2011 is when those customers will be reevaluating their smartphone brand.<p>3) For some people who  wanted an iPhone, they probably bought an iPhone regardless of the network. iPhone on Verizon was (or will be) a chance for some people to change carriers and keep the phone they love.<p>I think those three factors inhibit a massive switch to iPhone simply because of its availability on a new carrier. Other factors may play a role, too. For instance, AT&T put a lot of their own advertising weight behind the iPhone. Verizon hasn't platformed the iPhone in the same way.",1310005277.0

WebForms controls mess with the markup that is output, this used to be a real nightmare in v1 with tables being inserted everywhere. It's better now but you still don't _know_ what IDs you're going to get and there are still issues like the GridView doesn't output thead rows in the table unless you set certain properties explicitly. All this makes using ASP.NET with third party CSS and JavaScript tools hard because They often rely on markup being defined a particular way<p>2. ViewState is on by default and posted back to the server every time the page posts back. Most people have slower updoad speeds ti download speeds, so this causes real issues. The whole design of WebForms assumes that every control will be setup once on initial page load and then rebuilt from ViewState each time after that, whereas usually each postback only requires some of the page state to be posted back and a few controls to be rebuilt. Some sort of ViewState group would be useful to tell the page ""if the user clicks that button, then these fields are needed at the server end and these other controls will be rebuilt. This would be virtually impossible to retro-fit into WebForms though.<p>3. UpdatePanels are a performance nightmare and still post back the entire page, usually they are only needed to update 2 or 3 of the controls on the page and a page method would be far more efficient, but UpdatePanels are just so darn convenient (especially given point 1) that they get over used.<p>Some abstractions are really nice and I totally don't care what happens beneath them, but WebForms is not one of them. Markup matters, IDs matter, upload bandwith matters. WebForms abstracted the stuff I care about and made bad some bad assumptions too.",1310005212.0

The object of this ongoing four-year study is to attempt to determine just how consistent the results of scientific computation really are, and, from this, to estimate accuracy. The experiment is being carried out in a branch of the earth sciences known as seismic data processing, where 15 or so independently developed large commercial packages that implement mathematical algorithms from the same or similar published specifications in the same programming language (Fortran) have been developed over the last 20 years. The results of processing the same input dataset, using the same user-specified parameters, for nine of these packages is reported in this paper. Finally, feedback of obvious flaws was attempted to reduce the overall disagreement. The results are deeply disturbing. Whereas scientists like to think that their code is accurate to the precision of the arithmetic used, in this study, numerical disagreement grows at around the rate of 1% in average absolute difference per 4000 fines of implemented code, and, even worse, the nature of the disagreement is nonrandom. Furthermore, the seismic data processing industry has better than average quality standards for its software development with both identifiable quality assurance functions and substantial test datasets.",1310004251.0
