In other words, a 1lb ribeye in 1950 is the same as a 1lb ribeye today (in quantity, not price).  If it's included in the CPI then the price increase is reflected properly.<p>Using a geometric average implies that the basket of goods selected CHANGES depending on the change in prices.  So in 1950 when a ribeye was cheap, 1lb of it was included in the basket of goods.  Now that it's more expensive, only 0.5lbs of it are included in the basket.<p>This is a made up example.  Prices are not correct.  Just for illustration.\n1950:\nhamburger - $0.50/lb\nribeye - $2/lb\narithmetic mean: (2 + 0.5) / 2 = $1.25\ngeometric mean: sqrt(2<i>0.5) = $1.00<p>2012:\nhamburger: $3/lb\nribeye: $18/lb\narithmetic mean: (3 + 18)/2 = $10.50\ngeometric mean: sqrt(3</i>18) = $7.34<p>Arithmetic inflation: 10.50/1.25 = 8.4\nGeometric inflation: 7.34/1 = 7.3<p>The geometric mean has two wonderful properties:\n1.

It makes the inflation over time seem lower as well<p>I'm not saying that this is some giant conspiracy by ""the man"" to ""keep us down"" but I would argue that it's intellectually dishonest.<p>In order for the CPI to be useful to make comparisons from one year to another the quantities of goods in the basket have to remain constant.  Since the geometric mean effectively varies the quantity in the basket (relative to arithmetic) I would argue that it robs the CPI of any power to provide real comparisons.",1352861616.0

I fully disagree with his stance on not declaring vars at the top of the scope though. It's a good practice with any JIT compiled language as it's easy to declared the same variable twice if you're not paying attention but it's a very hard mistake to catch as it won't throw error. The reason for strict (read:Crockford) conventions is that Javascript is an incredibly loose language thus it is very easy make mistakes.,1352861403.0

As marketers got better and the algorithm improved, the ads gained relevance to the user and became more valuable.  In facebook's case, marketers will have to figure out how to create ads that are relevant to the News Feed context rather than the search context, but I don't think that the social context is inherently unusable for ads -- it just hasn't been figured out yet.",1352861221.0

The reason is that the very best advertising is content. Blurring the lines between advertising and content is one of the most ambitious goals a marketer could have.<p>Bringing earnings expectations into this, the key to Facebook 'fixing' their mobile advertising problem is not to create a new ad-unit that performs better on mobile. Rather, it is for them to sell the placement of stories in the omnipresent single column newsfeed. If they are able to nail end-to-end promoted stories system, then their current monetization issues on mobile disappear.<p><pre><code>    I still hope it's rather their users who will disappear.</code></pre>",1352861174.0

36,4781774,comment,4781482.0,4781482.0,3,0,gojomo,,,"Great analysis. 'Like-gate' is a narrow name for the controversy, though, with its political-scandal undertones and narrow focus on 'likes' and FB pages. This same battle is happening elsewhere, like in Twitter's 'omnipresent single column newsfeed' and Google's analogous prime mental real estate.<p>(I don't yet have a more broad and vivid name, but it should evoke the idea that this is a battle to enclose/own/monopolize parts of people's attention/mind/voice, subtly enough they don't recoil away.)<p>I think the 'single column newsfeed' will soon be recognized, despite its usefulness, as a somewhat abusive interface pattern. It artificially heightens the sense of novelty by mixing very unlike (and often repetitive) items. It artificially heightens the sense of urgency with the rapid decay of position down the page. Such 'cognitive sweeteners' bring more attention and excitement in the present but ultimately aren't good for the audience: they're noise rather than signal. Eventually countervailing habits will develop.<p>I wonder if that's what's in it for Caldwell's App.net. Facebook and Twitter <i>can't</i> let users break out of their false-prioritized presentation, without breaking their promotional business models. So anything which better ranks, summarizes, and filters items for a user's attention is a potential threat. Not so on App.net: there you might pay for a less-abusive interface (advanced, non-sugary reading software).",1352861049.0

If a user sees an ad on Google it is almost certainly comparable or better than organic results with respect to RELEVANCE TO THE USER, which is what matters.
