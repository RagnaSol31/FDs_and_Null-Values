7,3061886,comment,3061731.0,3061794.0,4,0,blendergasket,,,"I think of this like horsetails in my Mom's garden. My mom's garden is shot through with horsetails, but it's really all one horsetail connected by a single, massive rhizome. If you pull up one horsetail stem it won't do a thing to the horsetail as a whole. If you pull up 100 horsetail branches the horsetail might be slightly weakened, but it'll come back. These things've been around since the time of the dinosaurs. If she wants a garden without horsetails she'll have to get a backhoe and uproot the whole thing, then plant a new garden. The horsetails will come back eventually, then she'll have to do it again, but for a little while she'll have a nice clean garden.<p>There is a fundamental sickness in the system. A giant, rhizomic structure of venality and corruption that has undercut and basically replaced the system I, as an American, have been raised to believe is the proper form of government, with a government where all activity is dictated by power wielding corporate interests. Greed has become the dominant ideology; all branches of government and the media have become subsumed by it. A just and functional society is not and will never be an emergent property of a greed-based system.",1317524116.0

If we replace ""South American gold mine"" with ""the release of the iPhone"" or ""the creation of Google"" perhaps my point is clearer - i.e. the creation of value should have economic impacts.

The 2008 investigation concluded that ""there [were] no indications of oil & gas related impacts to [Markham's] water well."" It was also concluded that the water well of Weld County landowner Renee McClure, also featured in the film, contained naturally occurring biogenic methane not related to oil and gas activity in the area.[11] On the other hand, Dr. Anthony Ingraffea, the D. C. Baum Professor of Engineering at Cornell University, whose research has involved fracture mechanics for more than 30 years, has said that drilling and hydraulic fracturing can liberate biogenic natural gas into a fresh water aquifer. Thus, just because gas is biogenic does not necessarily indicate that it reached a well by natural means.
