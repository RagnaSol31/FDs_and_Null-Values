It seems like I constantly see Net Neutrality being debated all over the tech community but this bill seems much more insidious than any of the possible evils that Net Neutrality supporters suggest.<p>From my understanding, a simple decision by a judge can knock an entire website offline. The criteria to be blocked is that the sole purpose of the website is to infringe on copyright. If the domain is registered in the US, then the domain registrar is required to  remove access to the domain. If the domain is registered outside of the US, then ISPs and other businesses, including financial services and ad services are required to block/prevent the website from operating (I'm thinking this will greatly affect PayPal and Google Adsense).<p>In my opinion, this bill would set a dangerous precedent for the US government to be able to block any website. I could see cases where large entertainment companies would bring lawsuits against small web startups in places where the courts would favorably lean in their direction (think patent cases in East Texas).<p>This hits personally because I run a website that helps independent artists sell their music online. I can't really see any possibility of us being dragged into court on copyright infringement claims, but I do know we have to deal with scammers on the site frequently. It's disturbing that if this bill is passed a dispute over copyright infringement has the possibility of shutting down the entire site (which would have the ironic side effect of harming a lot of independent artists who then would have no way of contacting us online to figure out how to get paid).",1285900811.0

By the time a renter reaches eviction they have racked up so many lawyer fees that even if they can now pay rent they won't be out of the hole. Their credit is going to be ruined anyway so they skip out and don't bother paying what they owe to the landlord. So now the renter has screwed up credit and loses their home, and the landlord has an empty apt, loses out on rent and lawyer fees while the renter could have paid off the debt!<p>In other words, the lawyers charge so much they make the law irrelevant.
