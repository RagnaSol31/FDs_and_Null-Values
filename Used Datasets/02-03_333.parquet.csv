Some people think ""branding"" is only about logos and letterheads, but it can come down as far as a group of characters and a setting in a story, too. Having the same characters and setting as novels they've already enjoyed, Harry Potter fans would probably get more out of even badly written fan fiction than they would from an all-new environment.<p>(From the author's point of view, perhaps they just didn't get a break or didn't have the determination to make it. At least by hijacking the Potter brand, they might get read.)<p>When I was a kid in the early 80s, I had a racing game where you could set the names of the other drivers to anything you liked.. so I set them to names of my friends, family members, etc, and it made the game far more fun even though there was no logical reason for it. Instead of winning a race against generically named computer racers, instead I could be kicking my grandpa's ass until the last corner.. there's something fun about that.

23,1316841,comment,1316677.0,1316677.0,0,0,bryanjohnson,,,"Sachin - the online payments industry is indeed very complex. I'm impressed that you both took the time to write this up and did such a nice job. I would add a few things. (Disclosure: I'm with Braintree)<p>1) There is much more than meets the eye when choosing a merchant account provider, and not all are created equal (it's very true that few understand online payments). We will be first to say that providing merchant account services to online merchants is very challenging for a host of reasons. Because it's so complex and because there are so many moving parts, no one is immune to mistakes, misunderstandings, complex situations and difficult situations. With that said, the importance of choosing the right provider cannot be overstated. Merchants need to find a company they can trust because when stuff happens (i.e. account closure, reserves) you need someone in your corner that can help navigate. In our experience, merchants are most likely to make mistakes when solely focused on price.<p>2) I'm very pleased to see you call out data portability. We were the first in the industry to start raising the alarm bells about providers holding stored credit card data hostage.  It's a huge issue with very serious implications. To address this problem, we created the Credit Card Data Portability Standard and invited all providers to participate (<a href=""http://bit.ly/a0i86v"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/a0i86v</a>).<p>We've been blogging about the industry for years now trying to help educate merchants. Here is are two resources to contribute to yours:<p>a) New to Payments - <a href=""http://bit.ly/cIY58t"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/cIY58t</a> b) Don't get duped.

It has a 1x1 widget that you can put on your home screen which estimates battery time remaining, along with a more precise % figure. It learns based on previous discharge cycles.<p>Act 1 Video Player is IMO much better than the default video player - it has a nice touch-swipe skipping mechanism for locating in files.<p>ES File Explorer is a pretty good file manager, especially since it can browse remote file systems over FTP, SMB (i.e. Windows shares), Bluetooth, etc. This means you can copy over music, movies etc. from your network shares onto your phone without having to plug into USB or remove the SD card (usually requires removing battery, rebooting phone etc.)<p>Another file manager, ASTRO, is handy particularly for browsing photos. Android 2.1's Gallery app is fine for a handful of photos, but it slows to a crawl if you've built up a bunch. As a file manager, it understands nested directories, unlike Gallery. B&B Gallery is a useful counterpart to it; Gallery downsamples images before loading them, but B&B Gallery doesn't, meaning you can zoom in and see more details. ASTRO can also create zip files.<p>AutoRotate is another widget - it can sit on your home screen and toggle the auto-rotate system setting upon touch. Very useful for browsing the web in bed or similarly reclined.

I'm selling a physical product - my 'Get In Anyway' (GIA) guide. It's a step-by-step guide on how anyone can earn a Harvard degree, taking mostly online classes, and for about the same tuition as your state school.<p>Initially, I wanted to take advantage of this opportunity for myself. But after realizing how few people were aware of this degree-seeking program, I decided to take it upon myself to let would-be students know that they have a second shot at education from a prestigious institution.<p>I decided to go physical to circumvent any and all piracy issues. Currently, I have everything setup to print/bind at FedEx office and ship via USPS to every country that ClickBank (CB) supports. Oh yea, I was recently approved as a CB vendor. And, yes, they now accept physical products. I also have an Amazon payments button commented out on my pages. But I recently noticed it's still showing up on some browsers. Anyway, back to monetization & marketing...<p>One monetization option I'm considering in lieu of selling a physical book is lead generation. i.e., I'd make the contents of the guide available (section by section) online and generate leads for relevant offers.<p>This article made lead generation appear wonderfully lucrative: http://blog.mediadroit.com/2009/11/14/what-is-the-ideal-way-to-monetize-lead-generation/<p>And on marketing, I'm wide open to suggestions.
