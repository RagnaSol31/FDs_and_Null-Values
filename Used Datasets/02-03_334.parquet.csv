At my healthiest point, I was eating about 70% of my calories from carbohydrates, had a resting pulse of 48 and could run a 10k in under 35 minutes.  I did try experimenting with more meat and fewer complex carbohydrates.  The result was, my performance suffered greatly and my sweat started to stink.   I've also tried being entirely vegan, which also lead to worse results.  Once I went back to eating mostly grains, vegetables and fruit with a modest amount of animal products, I started feeling and doing better. Every single good runner, swimmer or cyclist I've known has eaten a relatively similar diet.  The only exception I can think of is some of the most extreme ultra guys, who seem to need the absolute most calorie dense junk food they can find.<p>Since then I've become more sedentary, but have still maintained lower cholesterol and blood pressure than the majority of people in their 20's.  I started eating richer foods several years ago in Taiwan and put on some weight, but found it disappears quickly after returning to a more normal (Chinese) rice and vegetable based diet.",1280285498.0

26,1553422,comment,1551121.0,1551121.0,0,0,russellsilva,,,"This sounds a LOT like me -- exactly the way I used to think (and still sometimes do).  What's really helped me turn around was a realization I got from a book, ""The Mindful Way through Depression.""  Tell me if the below description sounds familiar.<p>I treated my frustrations with my life just like I treated any other problem.  I put my life under the microscope and considered carefully which areas I found inadequate.  I'd look at each area and consider what was going wrong and what it would take to fix it.  Once I had a plan on how to fix it, I'd follow the plan.  I'd keep evaluating my progress, and try and improve where I was lacking.<p>This is a great way to solve problems, but somehow it never worked when I looked at my life this way.  Somehow it just seemed overwhelming and depressing.  And instead of taking some little step to better myself, I'd just waste the day away browsing the internet or watching Hulu.  I'd have a completely clear idea of what I needed to do to reach my goals, but I just couldn't bring myself to do them.<p>The realization the book gave me was that the impulse to scrutinize my life had, for me, become destructive.  Intellectually, setting goals and breaking them down into manageable steps is useful.  But the continuous evaluation I did on myself just drained me emotionally.<p>The way I think about it is that I do not have the same ability to emote abstractly as I have to think abstractly.  When I put a problem or deficiency in my life under the microscope, it allows me to focus on the problem intellectually.  But my emotions don't understand microscopes -- instead, they treat the problem as overwhelmingly huge.  Evaluating my progress over and over again didn't lead to improving my methods -- it just made me feel emotionally besieged.<p>The solution for me has been to break the cycle of scrutinizing my life.  It's an old habit, and it's been hard.  But when I get to thinking ""I'm wasting my talent"" or ""I regret wasting so much time"" I do my best to keep myself from obsessing over it.  And with that off my back I find it much easier to work towards my goals.",1280284853.0

It'll also beat ext2 and ext3 if you're creating and deleting lots of small files (like on an e-mail server) as the delete will take place in the background without impacting the front end systems.  It's nice and mature too (16 years old).  ext2 & 3 have slightly better error recovery though.  XFS is journalled so very little should go wrong that would impact it.<p>JFS has strengths when large files are moved around on it, extremely low sector overhead (less than 1%) and very low CPU usage, amongst the lowest of any of the main Linux ones.<p>NTFS has no knowledge of checksumming, something ZFS, ext4 and btrfs handle (the latter two I wouldn't trust yet in production environments), but it does have integrated snapshots, something you generally have to use LVM for under Linux, and native encryption, and from Vista/2003 onwards supports shrinking and expansion directly on the fly (again LVM is necessary to do this under linux, and is best done with filesystem offline).<p>You chose your operating system and file system to suit the task (for example I'd use OpenBSD on a gateway machine instead of Linux as it's more suited to the role).<p>It's such a simple concept, like how you wouldn't use a hammer to crack an egg.

So she bought into a business that provided chairs, chair covers, table centrepieces, etc.<p>But with weddings come huge expectations and issues of timing. You're usually working weekends and nights. You have to work in and around other providers, setting up at certain times and often dismantling well after midnight (because the venue has something else on the day after). Yet everyone grumbles about paying for crucial things like delivery and setup (sounds easy, but who in your wedding party needs to be setting things up amidst the dramas of the actual wedding?) and, as you suspected, tensions are high and customers are demanding (bridezilla-style).<p>Invitations are a tough space. Horrendously competitive and though everyone wants lovely invites, no one really wants to pay what they cost. It's rarely the design process that kills you. I bet there are loads of people who fall in love with letter press invites and then get a quote that knocks them over.
