You can tell just by looking at how the power companies charge industrial customers. On a residential scale, they bill you per hour. On an industrial scale there are contracts negotiated and a big component of that is what time of day the power is used. Ski resorts run thousands of HP in water pumps and air compressors to make snow, and they do it at night mostly because they all have power contracts with lower prices at night.<p>Efficiently moving power from one place to another is the big problem - the 'smart grid' is forever over the horizon -  but storage only becomes a big problem after we have switched a massive amount of our energy production to solar and we're a long way off from that. Until then we just need to build a better system to move power from constant output plants to areas served by transient power sources.",1315795897.0

Whine!""<p>The part of CoffeeScript hate I find most amusing is all the hate for the fact that it's a language that compiles to JavaScript.  ""The code it generates is bad!"" ""It's a leaky abstraction!""  Well guess what guys, the C compiler that pretty much every piece of code running on your system went through does exactly the same thing, only it generates assembly.  Since you don't know assembly (or anything other than how to animate ads with jQuery), you aren't complaining.  But it's the same principle and it works well enough.  C doesn't expose all of assembly's features.  C doesn't always generated optimal assembly code.  And yet, we use it anyway, because it's just so much nicer than the ""real"" underlying language.  (And of course, x86 assembly is not what x86 processors run anymore.  But that translation takes place in silicon, so you see even less complaining.)<p>Complain about actual problems, not about what you can see.

He-3 is seen as some kind of holy grail here. Unfortunately it's <i>incredibly</i> rare. The best source is probably the Moon (which, with no atmosphere, has had billions of years of solar winds to collect non-trivial amounts of He-3); and<p>2. To sustain a fission reaction any current research reactor I can recall reading about uses probably radioactive isotopes (most likely tritium ie H-3) or at least somewhat uncommon isotopes (ie deuterium, H-2).<p>Fun fact: per cubic foot compost generates more power than an equivalent volume of material from the Sun's core [1]. What makes stars such great energy producers isn't fusion per se, it's their sheer size and fuel supply.<p>Fusion goes hand-in-hand with the Utopian concept of ""free energy"" because obviously water (and thus hydrogen) is abundant. But no energy will truly be ""free"" although it may be cheap enough to have the almost the same impact as being free.<p>There are four component costs in energy:<p>1. The cost of building a device that produces energy;<p>2. The cost of maintaining that device;<p>3. The R&D required to bringing that device to market. Obviously, over time, this cost diminishes to zero; and<p>4. The cost of extracting, storing and transporting whatever fuel is required.<p>So for hydrogen, assuming a fusion reactor doesn't use sea water, you must first extract hydrogen. This is actually relatively expensive. Hydrogen extract is seen as a way of smoothing out power generation from renewable sources (most often wind power) [2].<p>Sure a fusion power installation could produce the energy for this but remember that any power system needs to produce more power than it uses or its largely worthless (barring corner cases like producing energy in portable form, which is the entire model for batteries). With hydrogen extraction, you've just raised the bar on how much power than reactor needs to produce.<p>Likewise, hydrogen storage is non-trivial. It's flammable and hard and expensive to store in liquid form (compared to, say, liquid nitrogen [3].<p>Energy needs to be produced in many forms. Fusion is on the scale required for power stations but that's only one of our needs. What about vehicles? It's really hard to beat the amount of energy stored in oil (by mass or by volume) and the ease with which it is extracted.<p>I see a long term solution to this in genetically engineering microbes to produce readily consumable compounds for abundant and sustainable inputs. Another fun fact: if you've read Neal Stephenson's <i>Anathem</i> you'll probably recall his mention of ""fuel trees"" that suggest this kind of approach.<p>In the far distant future I see the only viable power source that would allow us to live in space, let alone cross interstellar space, to be black holes [4].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_core"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_core</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_hybrid_power_systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_hybrid_power_systems</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2007/KarenFan.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2007/KarenFan.shtml</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://io9.com/5391989/a-black-hole-engine-that-could-power-spaceships"" rel=""nofollow"">http://io9.com/5391989/a-black-hole-engine-that-could-power-...</a>",1315792805.0
