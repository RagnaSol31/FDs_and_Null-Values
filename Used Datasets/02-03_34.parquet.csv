Most people I've known on medications for depression and anxiety are juggling prescriptions and dosages to retain the benefits of the drugs.  While SSRIs may not give you a ""bad trip"", they can have paradoxical effects as well as a host of terrible side effects, and withdrawal can be long and difficult. Benzodiazepenes are still widely prescribed and tolerance and addiction build rapidly in most people.  For many people these work great but for many they do not, or never completely.",1308452260

In the short term, I think it's unlikely that online personalization will be accurate enough to create the type of bubble Tim Berners-Lee is suggesting.  In the long term, however, I do see this as significant and dangerous.  Unlike the way current tribes work, in which a person needs to actively seek and follow their 'tribe', this is a passive action - over time web services get to know you and seemingly shield you from diversity.  The passive vs active nature required to keep up with one's tribe is the part of his prediction which worries me.",1308452142

It's very likely nobody at Google has the oversight to see the big picture user experience and more importantly the authority to make it a good one.

Google should take this same view because users don't care how much Google engineers enjoy their autonomy or how cool it is to work there.

Costs are frequently underestimated, especially if you're outside looking in and aren't the one paying them. Communication has the well-known problem of tending to scale like n^2 (though I'm inclined to think it's somewhat more like 1.6, it's still a polynomial growth), and synchronizing two teams often ends up building more than just a leader <-> leader link, let alone three or more teams. It's easy to say ""it should be done"", it's a lot harder to actually pay the costs. Benefits are often oversold, too; yes, perhaps in this case Google is missing out on some huge opportunity, but even if that is true (which I'm dubious about), it would be the exception, not the rule.<p>Sometimes the costs still outweigh the benefits, sure, but it's often a more subtle analysis than it first appears.
