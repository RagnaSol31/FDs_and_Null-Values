In general, I think that often the biggest mistake is variance annotation of types. Instead, <i>functions</i> should have (in)variance annotation on every parameter and on the return value. Then, a function that only reads from an array would be covariant in the type of array elements, a function that only writes would be contravariant, and a function that does both would be invariant. No need to artificially limit the usecases of arrays.",1319943443.0

People would look at Intellectual Ventures in a really positive light if it was actually doing lots of research, and sold access to its patents and charge for consulting.  This would be a really interesting way to do things, and would actually be outsourcing research and providing a convenient way for companies in different areas to share patents.  However, they are instead buying up patents and using shell companies to sue companies that have been operating for years and show no evidence of willful infringement.  Another strike against them is their patents, they seem to love method patents which are way too broad and taking advantage of an overly generous patent office.<p>The tragedy of the patent dilemma is that it could be solved by just reforming the patent office, and making some slight adjustments.",1319942980.0

The whole spirit of GNU/Linux is that anybody who wants to use it, can do so without restriction--power user, developer, third-world student, hacker, artist.  That ethos is primary to any claim that Linux has to follow Unix philosophies or any particular UI guidelines.  And it is exactly what has spawned and continues to nurture a healthy diversity of distros.  Just because Ubuntu has gone in one direction means very little for Linux as a whole; some would argue that their direction is an important one, and time will tell.  Certainly the work that Canonical does on usability and basics like driver support will be available for other distros to cherry pick as appropriate.  The blunt answer to the OP is ""if Canonical no longer serves your needs, just install one of the hundreds of other distros.""",1319942975.0
