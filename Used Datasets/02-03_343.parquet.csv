This text describes a libertarian socialist society which is presumably devoid of taxation: &quot;What is needed is Individualism. If the Socialism is Authoritarian; if there are Governments armed with economic power as they are now with political power; if, in a word, we are to have Industrial Tyrannies, then the last state of man will be worse than the first.&quot;.

It can be soul crushing and job destroying.<p>Socialism is like the diet version of communism.<p>Crony Capitalism or Corporatism is what we currently have in the USA. It uses Socialism to make organizations that lobby the government very rich at the expense of the people who are tax payers. Both Democrats and Republicans use that system to get rich. Both should be hanged for doing that at the expense of the tax payers.,1396666385.0
