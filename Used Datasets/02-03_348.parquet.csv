I'm sure Google has more janitors than that.

However, I think you conflate being cs illiterate (not knowing how to code) with not knowing how to use technology intelligently and being vaguely technophobic (e.g., saving all your files on the desktop).

She touched on a core issue that social networks will have a hard time addressing in the coming years. Perhaps it is because its they tried hard to mimic how relationships worked in the moment and people change, moment by moment. I think the problem that needs to be solved is that people change organically, moment by moment until they are a very different person because of the many small changes that occur through the years.<p>There are no tools that I know of to provide this context of individual change for those who read what we have written or recorded on video years after the fact. And speaking only for myself, I have changed a little since yesterday and a lot since my early twenties.<p>Does that make sense? If we think about leaving a legacy for people we can't know but will be able to speak to in ten or thirty years, how do we provide them the insight into the significant or cumulative changes that influenced changes our beliefs? It's not like we can sit down with them over a beer and say, ""That thing I wrote about social issue X, well I used to believe Y about it and then really significant things happend to me and I completely changed. I know it's weird.""<p>I believe these are very difficult tools to build because they have to capture some of the more ephemeral aspects of humanity in a way thats easy for the producer to manage and the consumer to quickly comprehend.",1334372049.0

Which is why they often say I don't care what you believe in just believe in something higher than yourself. You are just stating a belief system i.e. I am a secular humanist not where this belief derived from i.e from rationality we derive our universal moral standards of concern and consideration for other humans. Or some form of utilitarianism that suggests that concern and consideration are in our best interests as a whole society.<p>In reality cultural integration is a bit of an illusion as hegemony rules the law of the land in most cases. Travel to Syria or North Korea right now and you will find that power is the morality people usually follow.<p>To believe that we are all self-rational actors heading towards some grand path of enlightenment and cultural integration in some far off utopia wonderland of cooperation and mutual self-benefit is to ignore the more animalistic and competitive bit of our nature.",1334371335.0

So I outlined the steps it would take to translate a toy language into a toy computer's instruction set, and reviewed it with the young man one afternoon at my office - an abbreviated compiler theory class with an eager audience of one.  Tom took the big flowchart that we made home, studying and meticulously documenting it.  When he brought me the documented design a couple of days later I asked him to implement it.<p>Tom spent awhile doing this in Waterloo Fortran, and when he presented me with the working compiler I said ""Good job.  Now execute the code.""  He blinked his surprise - until then I don't think he'd considered that the toy machine could have been interpreted.  A revelation!  He went back home and wrote the VM for the toy machine without any assistance; it worked well and I was as proud of him as I could be.<p>A couple of years later I hired Tom and a couple of years after that he lapped me, going on to better things.  30 years later I still keep a copy of his compiler and interpreter, reminding me from time to time of the bright kid who grew up to become a fine programmer and family man.",1334370415.0
