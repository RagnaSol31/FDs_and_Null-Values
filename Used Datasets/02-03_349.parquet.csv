(The STATICFILES_STORAGE option in settings.) If youve used Django's staticfiles framework before, its pretty much plug-and-play.<p>For more dynamic file storage (say, using FileField or ImageField in a model), I believe django-storages would work, too. (Make sure you configure django-storages with the DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE option set to S3 also.)<p>Assuming youre managing your site via a local dev server (or a server that ""hosts"" the ""hot type"" version of the site), any time you ""upload"" a file to your local server, it'll actually upload to S3 (and any calls to ""field.url"" will actually map to the S3 URL). Not sure how well it'll work in all use cases: I haven't actually used FileField or ImageField myself in the django-medusa+django-storages usecase, but I <i>have</i> used both separately so Im fairly sure this is possible.<p>This is a pretty darn good question though, so Ill likely make a follow-up blogpost with a more comprehensive walkthrough regarding handling staticfiles and FileField/ImageField. Sometime in the near future.<p>Multiple sites/subdomains is a bit more complicated. Id say you should probably use separate Django instances for each and render them separately. (For S3, youd need to use separate buckets, anyway.) If they <i>need</i> to share data, you can configure multiple Django settings.py configurations for each site but still use the same source tree and local database.

The way to compete with old enterprise software is first by not doing it the way they're doing it. I would start with something that appeals to individual employees, make their work easier, even joyful, and eventually you'll work up to top level decision makers.<p>By then you'll have a fantastic user-centric product and a list of features an exec team would drool over.",1341111341

In all seriousness though, we should take startup advice with a grain of salt but at the same time realize that while most of it is contradictory that doesn't mean it's all worthless. The trick is to pick out what applies to your particular situation. If there are two conflicting pieces of advice that apply then you just go with your gut. Only you know what's best for your situation. It's always useful to learn what others think or have gone through. So yeah, it's all a bunch of feel-good contradictory stuff but it still has its worth.

Initially the practice was quite benign because many experiments indeed require expensive instruments and knowledge of some quite specialized skills, however, this practice was kept unchecked (there is no real penalty of any sort how many authors you add to the paper, except that some authors themselves may object to having to share credit), which allowed for cliques to become established where you basically have a few ""friends"", and you try to add those friends to every paper you publish for some very minor help/advice they offer, and your friends in turn try to add you to every paper they publish for very minor help/advice from you.

This is conceptually similar to a server-side CNAME. The reason these don't have TTL is because users don't see them.<p>The returned record, of course, has a TTL, and the ALIAS mechanism will not alter the TTL of the aliased data, so in the case of an ELB you are talking a TTL of one hour. There are no magic bullets to the distributed cache expiration problem.<p>(The other comments in this article about TTL seem quite confused, though, so this explanation might not actually have helped. Even if you have a 20-year TTL, you are going to see changes immediately from clients that do not have the data cached anywhere on their path to the origin.)<p>(In particular, there is no difference at all to switching the ALIAS record out for an A record with regards to your TTL: if the user has the target of the old mapping cached they will use it, otherwise they will get the new one.

Add in hotels, and there's a market.<p>Especially if you fly international a lot -- the foreign airlines are usually pretty bad at handling principals who make their own travel reservations, and most of the <40yo tech/law/etc. professionals who have to travel a lot prefer doing their own arrangements (with help) to blindly trusting someone else.<p>There's also a market for people who fly a huge amount but are cheap and micro-optimizers.  Not enough $ to get United Global Services, but 1K, and 1K doesn't actually help much except at the airport (and clearing waitlists).<p>The other market might be lazy/late optimization.  i.e. passively looking at your travel patterns, and if I see you fly in J/F SFO-IAD-KWI once a month for 6 months, proactively negotiating a rate with UA for you to do so at a discount in the future.  That's not something UA will offer, but something a company or group could push for based on observed travel, especially if they can present LH as a credible alternative.",1341108046
