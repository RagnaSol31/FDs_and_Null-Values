Further, tax rates of the top 10% account for the majority of revenue. So I not only deny your claim but put forth that your rhetoric is emotionally manipulative - pitting the rich (""them"") versus the rest (""us poor little everybody else"").<p>The ""rich"", the top 1%, are the prime drivers of wealth creation. They are the reason GDP grows faster than population growth. The incentives on the top 1% heavily influence GDP growth.<p>Also, the percentiles used are very misleading. The top and bottom quintiles today are not the same people in the top and bottom quintiles 20 years ago. So most stats we track about poverty and wealth are fairly useless because they follow that faulty assumption.<p>Just in case anyone isn't clear on this: if you're a founder of a tech company, you're in the top 1% - perhaps not in income today, but in wealth generators and life-time taxes paid and to-be-paid.",1211338757.0

It's a little cumbersome, but I (and my company) have purchased literally a couple of dozen domains via the email interface on adamsnames.tc.<p>One other cool thing about adamsnames.tc is that you don't pay for the domains for a little bit after you order them.

It will be more like, you notice some patterns of repetition in the code of your existing project(s), and then you devise a way to factor that into a library.

34,195594,comment,195423.0,195479.0,0,0,timr,,,"Here's my take, after working in Ruby/Rails for a year, and coming from a background in C++ and Perl (with a tiny bit of Lisp in my distant past):  Ruby is nothing like Lisp.  It has some metaprogramming features that make you think (vaguely) of Lisp, but fundamentally, it's more like the bastard child of a torrid, three-way affair between Lisp, Python and Perl -- the genetic heritage was passed on, but poor baby Ruby got little of the careful childhood upbringing.<p>The result?  Ruby has the syntactical consistency and beauty of Perl, and the blazing speed and low overhead of Lisp.  There are roughly six dozen different ways of doing <i>everything</i> (including really simple things, like delimiting blocks), and bizarre inconsistencies in basic use cases (e.g. <i>most</i> String functions return copies, whereas nearly everything else works by reference), and plenty of long-term code maintainability <i>nightmares</i> lurking in the corners.<p>It can be fun to code in Ruby, and it's certainly a language you should check out someday, but I'm still not sure it's the language you want to choose for a project involving a team of programmers or long-term project maintenance.  My advice, if you know neither Ruby nor Python, is to learn Python, unless you've got some particular reason (i.e. a job) to learn Ruby first.
