But you can get rid of problems in two ways:  by solving them, and by making it difficult or impossible for people to complain.<p>* You only hear about problems from the people who complain.  Remove their ability to complain (or make it hard for them to reach anyone) and you'll never know about the problems.  The tie-in with my first point should be obvious.<p>* A broken complaints system that allows few complaints will ""perform better"" than any other systems (in terms of having fewer trouble reports that get through) and will get selected for, unless you have people who know what the hell is going on.<p>* When you make people select their problems from a list, you won't get anything not on the list.  Sure, maybe you have an ""other"" field, but sometimes people will just select one of the options even if it's the wrong one.  In that vein, your <i>default</i> selection should be some kind of ""unknown/other"" because unless people make a choice, you can't assume that they intentionally selected anything.<p>I could go on and on, sadly, because I have a lot of experience seeing this sort of thing go on, even though I've done my best to prevent certain industrial QC processes from feeding total and utter garbage data to managers who see the production floor only when giving tours to prospective customers.",1296097107.0

Admittedly, we have become quite good at the scale of tens of thousands real-world data (see Labeled Face in Wild project), but how reliable it really is on large scale? My friend circle (everyone I have met in life for a small period of time) probably only consists of few thousands people, but I can remember many people who are distantly related have very similar faces. My main concern is, the facial variations between people may not be as large as we have imagined once we are on tens of millions scale.<p>Here is an idea to validate my concern:<p>1. Crawl over all photos on Facebook and run a frontal-face detector with it;<p>2. Use current state-of-art methods (attribute based method or hybrid methods) to get several pairs of similar faces (highest score ones) of different people;<p>3. Use the same method as in step 2 to get several pairs of similar faces of same person with roughly the same score as in the step 2;<p>4.

One thing that's become clear to me in the last few years since 2007 is that it's a hell of a lot easier to make an awesome programming language now than it was then.  LLVM, CLR, Mono, JVM (specifically how it's changed to allow for dynamics and now it's changing to allow for traits and so on): all of these things let mere mortals make potentially awesome programming languages and immediately workable for production environments.  All in a tiny fraction of the time that it would have taken a few years ago.  The explosion of seriously awesome languages onto the scene in the last few years is evidence.<p>Will there ever again be a single language that captures as much of the mindshare as any of the other big languages have in they heyday? C, C++, Java, even Visual Basic occupied a huge fraction of the developer community at their peak.  Some of those may be rising still in eyeball hours per month, but definitely not rising in terms of total fraction of all programmer hours being spent.<p>Perhaps the future is really more about consolidation for virtual machines and compiler middleware, and proliferation of end user languages? Different strokes for different folks?<p>Today it's not unusual at all for a larger system to use a a mixture of Scala, Java, and Python, plus some Erlang via RabbitMQ or eJabberd or CouchDB, not to mention pulling in data sources from REST or RPC type sources.

Also, with macros you can introduce you new ""implicit"" control and structure semantics; it's very common for forms to have an ""implicit progn"", or a block named NIL or similar.",1296093611.0

I'm mostly OK with them having little support for free products, but when there are thousands of dollars on the line with AdWords or AdSense I expect them to step up their game.<p>I'm convinced that offering prompt customer service for these two services alone would lead them to make far more money than they'd have invested in it.<p>Frustrated customers can become competitors at times. Google has been lucky thanks to its virtual monopoly on search (tough from a technical standpoint) and ads (tough from a business standpoint), but they need to be careful. Technology has a habit of changing things quickly.",1296093609.0
