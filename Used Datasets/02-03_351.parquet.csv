Before it was easy to transmit things electronically, we had to pass around physical media that held them if we wanted to share with others.<p>Excepting people trying to inch out that extra cent out of people, nobody thinks there is something wrong with this sharing.  You can borrow a car, borrow a book, borrow an NES cartridge, even borrow a whole computer, and this is seen as socially acceptable (we learned the value of sharing in Kindergarten).  Sometimes you determine that you want this item for yourself, so you buy it, and you might not have bought it at all had it not been for your exposure to and enjoyment of it.<p>The problem with PC software is that unlike these other works of art, it is trivial to copy.  That should be a warning flag that a business model around software needs to approach things a little differently.  Sure, a good percentage of people will look for something for nothing and feel no guilt over it, will not try to compensate for it; in this medium, they will often succeed, too.  This is a fact of the technology.<p><i>The creative work and thousands of man-hours</i><p>This is noble, but do you really expect customers to offer up money for software because of the actions of somebody behind the scenes of that software?  I know when I browse games on the shelves, I am not thinking about the programmers, the artists, the voice actors, the publishers, or anyone else involved.  I am thinking of how fun I expect that game to be and if I can afford it this month.  I am also thinking of the brand of that game; for example, Ubisoft has disappointed me enough times with their MMOs that I refuse to be fooled again, no matter how cool it looks.  On the other hand, I am a consistent sucker for games by Square and Bioware.  Your average consumer does not place the same value on the workers as the workers place on themselves.<p><i>Companies aren't going to change their business model  because they don't need to. The games are still just as  good, people are playing them, they just aren't paying  for them.</i><p>This is a contradiction.  Admittedly, DRM is one way to change the business model.  It is working for some companies in the way it is implemented.  As you mention later, competition can demonstrate this model's weaknesses, but that is also the nature of business: you must keep evolving to meet the challenges of the times.",1268103313.0

It may be more of Google's algorithms deciding you are best, no? I can't say for sure obviously, but you might have fared better if you hadn't done this at all.<p>Google keeps something called a 'quad' list if I'm not mistaken, which contains a series of word ids in sets of four for every page that exists in their index. If certain sets of 'quads' are unique to your page then those are used to judge your page as original for that bit of content. I gather that quite a few of the 'random keywords spam pages' are built on that predicate. I'm not sure if that is outdated or even plainly wrong but it would explain the pattern in clone sites sometimes ranking higher than the originals simply because they got crawled earlier.<p>> ""Even today that crawl isn't 100% complete yet""<p>* Part of the reason for this is because your pages have a low-priority to be crawled, because they are submitted via a site map.<p>That's quite possible, but I'm not in a hurry.
