Chemical preservation is one inexpensive option that has been around for centuries -- Ben Franklin mentioned the possibility, and some brains such as that of Charles Babbage are still preserved. Brains preserved this way and scanned at a later date would yield much better data than the best brain scans taken today.<p>However, even this is probably a lot less fidelity than cryonics at its best. The vitrification process actually preserves a significant degree of cellular viability. For example, a rabbit kidney has actually been successfully implanted after cryopreservation. So if we are trying to maximize the degree to which someone avoids death (acknowledging that some degree of death / memory loss is probably inevitable, for now at least), cryonics is likely to be the best available bet.",1306464672.0

38,2590260,comment,2590197.0,2590197.0,1,0,troymc,,,"Scenario 1:<p>The developers on your founding team could learn .NET over the summer (in your spare time), pay the licensing fees starting in September, and take over development then. Surely the licensing fees aren't that big, compared to developer salaries (are they)?<p>But you wrote ""we likely would not be able to handle <i>everything</i> [development-wise] between just the founders."" So you'd have to hire some more .NET developers. I'm sure there are lots of .NET developers out there, but they'll probably charge enterprise rates. Maybe you'll get lucky.<p>I also worry about the founders not being able to fully understand what the .NET programmers are doing. That could cause problems. For example, the founders, being unfamiliar with .NET, might not know how hard it <i>really</i> is to constitute the splitzerblivits with the kazmeltrix. Schedules could slip.<p>Scenario 2:<p>Start now with a framework your two developer co-founders know. Take the cash to get some more developers right away (who know that framework). It sounds like there are no licensing fees, so that's good. Also there would be no need for the founders to spend time learning a new framework. Too bad for the experienced .NET developers, but then it was only ever going to be a short-term gig for them anyhow.<p>Maybe make a list of the pros and cons for each scenario. I've probably missed some, because I don't know all the details. Then you can make a clear-eyed decision.",1306463978.0

It's true that consultants get paid more for hard-to-use software, and I get the impression even some open-source projects play this card... But, usually there's <i>some</i> progress in successive technologies - from your position, can you see any? I'm interested in understanding the real problems here.<p>For example (AFAIK) XML webservices tend to be less tightly coupled than CORBA's IDLs (though you can tight-couple in any language):<p>- XML using its own format specification language (DTD; XML Schema) helps keep the external data format independent from the application's internal data structures (until some bright spark realizes they can avoid duplication! by deriving one from the other... thus re-coupling them. Because of this, SOAP is CORBA all over again).<p>CORBA's IDL produced an interface for every object. This is fine for methods of the top-level object (that represents the main actions of the application/service), but when applied to objects that form the internal data structures (the nested object tree/graph that is received/sent as an argument/return value), it forces the external format to have the same structure as the internal data structure, thus tightly-coupling them.\n[And, CORBA tried to do ""distributed objects"", which just didn't work very well - though it sounds like a good idea.]<p>REST seems to be making a big difference. It explicitly uses ""representational state"", meaning that the external format is independent of the sender and receiver's internal representation. By defining the format independently of an end-point, it seems you escape tight-coupling. In practice, devs will often derive internal object definitions from the external format - but then they do the loose-coupling themselves, internally, and so tight-coupling is still avoid. [It's seeming to me that \nderiving internal-->external is bad; but external-->internal is OK.]<p>In a way, I think this progression can be seen as realizing the concept of <i>information hiding</i> in greater and greater depth as time goes on.<p>Does that seem right? What do you think? Can you point me to any references that address these issues (esp about tight-coupling between internal/external representations)?  Many thanks for any help!",1306461696.0

If the disk is too slow for it to relieve its pressure, it will block connections that have sent data in the past until it can free up enough memory to continue.<p>Last I checked, Rabbit does by default keep the associative map between queues and message in RAM, so its memory usage isn't technically bounded (it's a around a dozen bytes per message, IIRC).
