Its build quality is much better than other laptops.<p>- Good keyboard. Very important for me as it is my main machine for coding. I like the keyboard better than many full sized ones.<p>- 4:3 aspect ratio, 1400x1050 non-glare screen (can fit more vertical code).<p>- Trackpoint device (the ""nipple"" as some call it). I never liked trackpads (but it has that too, I just disabled it).<p>Recently my kid tore out some keys off of the keyboard, I started to ran out of disk space on its old 60GB hard drive, and my fan got kind of loud. I considered buying another machine. Looked around. But the more I looked, the more I realized that I just wanted this machine. So I got a 500GB hybrid Seagate Momentus drive, a new fan and a new keyboard. Spent an evening upgrading it and now I am hoping to get more years out of it.<p>Opening it, it just confirmed the build quality. The components inside, the materials used just seems better than in equivalent HP and Dell laptops I had to take apart.",1342666735.0

Americans are very fussy with their food so not knowing what it is until it arrives at your door may be going too far.  But from a UX perspective I think that is shirking your responsibility to make the meals interesting.<p>You can certainly gamify things, and also take inspiration from the humour of Woot.  For example bingo cards where you try to have meals covering the whole alphabet, or colours.  Or ""World Tours"" where there are sequences of recipes that trace a path geographically around the world.  Or voting certain ingredients off the ""island"".  Or pick a film/TV show and make what the characters eat (or inspired by what they eat, or their locations).  The Once Upon A Time In Mexico DVD has a 10 minute short on it showing how to make puerco pebil that I've done several times.<p>Here for example are the Indiana Jones locations:  <a href=""http://indianajones.wikia.com/wiki/Travel_with_Indy:_Locations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indianajones.wikia.com/wiki/Travel_with_Indy:_Locatio...</a><p>Out of that you'd get South America, France, Egypt, UK, India, Spain, Venice, Jordan and the US Southwest.

I recently experienced a huge change of environment (different country, different people I'm spending time with) and I can clearly see the impact it had on me.<p>Interesting thing, the effect is somewhat ""laggy"". I spent few months with a very hardworking person but I didn't really start following in his footsteps until after 3 months. When I stopped interacting with him, I kept my new-found diligence for 6 months before starting taking things easier again (though I can say I do work harder now than a year ago).<p>During my first few months here I also started paying more attention to punctuality. But when I started spending more time with my constantly-late friend I lost it somewhere along the way.<p>So yeah, people around you do affect you in many little ways.
