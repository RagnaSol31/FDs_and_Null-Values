What board representation does the VC have? Do you have the ability to call a shareholder meeting and get them voted off the board?<p>You need to work through with your lawyer and ask him or her in great detail what options you have in terms of forcing the VC to cooperate. Can you wind up the company without his/her agreement? What non-compete clauses apply? Can they be worked around?<p>Do you have the right to make a share issue in a way that would dilute the VC below a control threshold (while satisfying all legal and fiduciary obligations)?<p>Others in this thread have suggested you 'out' the VC - do not do this without legal advice, and I would recommend you not do it at all. You need to be 100% in compliance with the law of libel etc. Even if a staff member leaks information without your consent that places you in a weaker position not a stronger position.<p>If you have strong options, then pursue them. This may lead to the VC showing willingness to compromise. In which case, do genuinely consider compromise.",1298948389.0

Then you complain about minor semantics changes that forced you to do simple mechanical conversion.<p>Don't you think C extension authors would be equally or even more upset at having to rewrite their extensions from scratch?  Even with the minimal incompatibilities on the C API level, it took ~2 years to port numpy/scipy, do you believe it would have ever happened if the changes you advocate for were introduced?  Well, had the scope of Python 3 included removal of GIL and a JIT compiler, I doubt we had a single release yet while the usage of Python 2.x would be on decline (see the sad story of Perl 6).<p>Concerning your individual complaints.<p><i>It makes no effort to move towards the multicore era -- very minor changes would make the language potentially scale much better.</i><p>""Very minor changes""?

17,2274021,comment,2271421.0,2271421.0,0,0,dools,,,"37signals is a massive inspiration and I feel privileged (am I the only one that has to look up how to spell that word <i>every</i> single time?!) that I: a) work in an industry where so many fantastically successful individuals take time out to share this kind of wisdom and b) there is an online community where you can go and see the author themselves taking part in the discussions.<p>Here are the most important parts of this article that stuck with me:<p><i>""Understanding what people really want to know - and how that differs from what you want to tell them - is a fundamental tenet of sales. And you can't get good at making money unless you get good at selling.""</i><p>I know I harp on about this constantly but there's this fantastic interview on Mixergy with Tom Rossi (<a href=""http://mixergy.com/tom-rossi-molehill-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mixergy.com/tom-rossi-molehill-interview/</a>) where he talks about the early days of promoting his CMS and there's this part where he says that one of the first things he did was ""pick up the phone"" and just start calling people to sell it. Andrew Warner is kind of surprised - picking up the phone and <i>actually selling something</i> is so rarely discussed as a ""user acquisition strategy"". If you can cold call, if you can <i>sell</i>, then you can get money today.<p><i>""I thought about the problem and decided to try something new. Instead of doing long, expensive projects, we'd do short, affordable ones. Instead of billing $50,000 for a 15-page website redesign that would take three months, we'd charge $3,500 per page and offer to complete the page in a week. If you want another page, it's another $3,500 and another week. We called it 37express.""</i><p>Of course, this is one of the biggest lessons from ""agile"" and 37signals in particular. One way we've implemented this in our own projects is to give an idea of ""likely budget"" for a big project, then bill in very small increments with the smallest of the small at the beginning of the project.<p>Say there's a job, and you look at the basics of what should be achieved, and you say ""well, $25k will be a good amount for getting something like that done"", then the first bill should be for some prototypical product or even just <i>product research and documentation</i> delivered in about a week for something like 10% of the total budget.<p>Next invoice might be a slightly longer iteration for maybe double that, then by the third iteration everyone trusts each other, you have a good idea of the problem domain and you can really just do a 50% upfront 50% completion for the remainder of the budget.<p>The other really important part is that each of these early iterations should deliver <i>discrete</i> value - ie. that you could deliver it, the client would have gained some value, but could easily discontinue the project or use someone else to continue if they dislike working with you for some reason.<p>So you can still do these big jobs, but just treat them as several little tiny jobs, especially in the early stages. This also removes the need for that ""contract overhead"" - when you remove all the risk, you find that you can more often than not work on basic trust and human decency.<p><i>""But that's it. Everything else has been bootstrapped - even though dozens of venture capitalists and private equity firms have offered us lots of money. Instead, my customers have always been my investors. My goal has always been to be profitable on Day One.""</i><p>We're in the opposite boat ;) although we'd love to get funded for Decal, it turns out ""yet another CMS"" just isn't hot enough ... maybe we should make it social? In the absence of buckets of VC or angel funding it's been great to have role models in the industry telling us repeatedly that bootstrapping is not only doable, but preferable!<p>""On the other hand, from Day One, a funded business is all about spending money. There's a pile in the bank, and it's not there to collect interest. Your investors want you to hire, invest, and buy. There's less - and in some cases, no - pressure to make money. While that sounds comforting, I think it ultimately hurts. It replaces the hustle, the scrap, the fight, with a false comfort of ""we can worry about that later.""*<p>I've been in both situations - I've been in a company with heaps of funding and (right now) with barely adequate funding and I have to whole heartedly say I 100% agree with this.<p>Man did we waste money when we had it (office, sales staff etc.). And not only that, but we wasted effort building <i>heaps</i> of features that never made a dime and didn't make the product more saleable. If your product development process isn't commercially driven, I reckon you're heaps more likely to end up with a product you'll never be able to sell.<p>Thanks for an amazing read Jason, and not just here, but all the other talks, articles, books (Getting Real is great, still haven't made it to Rework yet ;), 37signals/svn, the products (I'm an avid Highrise user), the lot. You're an inspiration and a super hero. Keep bangin'.",1298947992.0

Don't go for a homerun, go for multiple singles. This is my strategy and has worked well so far:<p>1. Always release a free ad-supported version of the app. Advertising revenue has a much better ""long tail"" than paid apps. There is ~ 5% conversion rate, so your paid apps do better also.<p>2. Target a specific niche. There is far less competition and you can charge more money. My main apps go for $5 on iPhone and $8 on iPad. If you try to release a ""Angry Birds"" killer for 0.99c, you are seriously rolling the dice.<p>3. Re-use the same code base to make multiple apps. This should be done with caution, as there is a fine line between making the most from your work and spamming the app store (which can get you banned). Almost all of my apps share a common code base. This is a sure way to increase discoverability.<p>Anyway, that's been my experience.

As you know, Jambool was acquired by Google last August. This acquisition meant that some changes to our business were inevitable, and we'd like to share them with you today.<p>First, the existing Jambool Social Gold product will be discontinued in favor of a new Google in-app payment product in May 2011. Rest assured that you will be able to sign in to the Jambool merchant console through September 2011, and you will receive year-end financial statements in February 2012.<p>Second, we'd like to invite you to participate in the pre-release beta of the Google in-app payment system. This system will enable developers to accept payments within an app, but it will not have the full functionality of Social Gold at launch. We understand that this will not meet the needs of all developers currently using Social Gold, but we highly encourage interested developers to join the Google in-app payments beta by submitting your information at http://google.com/checkout/inapp<p>Again, we thank you for your flexibility during this transition period.
