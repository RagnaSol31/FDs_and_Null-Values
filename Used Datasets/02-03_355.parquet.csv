19,1960788,comment,1960714.0,1960714.0,0,0,kls,,,You are focusing on the wrong items. You keep on going back to your weakness in math which in reality only disqualifies you from a select handful of jobs in development. I don't know the specific segment that your are targeting but from your mentioning django I am going to assume web. While math skills are never a detriment that are really not that valuable in web. Understanding business logic and creativity trump math and raw CS a thousand fold. You need to accentuate the fact that you are creative (if you are) and that you can contribute real solutions to real problems or envision new markets that can be pursued via technology. These are the things that you need to highlight in an interview not that you can code or that you are poor in math. Coding is a small portion of a good developers toolkit.,1291258145

The landlord countered back and we agreed to sign a six month lease with the entire six months paid in advance. Once I made it through the first six months he was agreeable to let me extend for one year. But by this time I had a job so there was little to worry about. In talking with him though he would have let me extend either way since I had been up front with him and showed I was capable of making payments. I also had a good rental history and good credit so that helped significantly I believe. I have had friends though that had to get a cosigner (parent) to sign along with them.<p>Just be upfront with the landlord and explain the situation clearly. In my case I went in showing bank statements and my ability to pay for a year upfront if needed. It definitely helped his comfort level.

The typical specs were concrete walls 36"" thick, self contained turbine generators, water and air purification, plus rations to last up to 6 months. Some of those facilities are still around and operating (including one not far from me). I would expect that the switching gear of todays vintage takes up much less space and power than it did in 1971. Back then the interconnections were via long-distance coxial cable and microwave. Today there are fiber huts adjacent to the bunker.<p>I wonder what AT&T uses all that extra floor space for now.",1291257607

There were features everywhere... The Sony CLIE series of Palms had multi-tasking abilities, great MP3 players, better organizer features, and more powerful apps on average than it felt like my iPod Touch did. Maemo had features everywhere... I could video chat before Facetime was every dreamt up, I had full featured applications (Abiword with a foldable and pocketable keyboard is missed), and web browsers came out that were fantastic (I could use full Facebook, Google Reader, and such in the Tear browser just as well as on my desktop). And the cool interaction features existed too.. on Palm OS I had a universal remote control. On Maemo I could use a Bluetooth'd Wii Classic controller to play Mario in a NES emulator. Features were everywhere.<p>But why did I switch to iOS and later Android?<p>They just weren't fit for a touch interface. Using dedicated apps like the iOS model fits much better for ease of use with a touch interface. When I got the iPod, I switched from using full-featured versions of websites to settling for a reduced web experience that was more information-based.. and having to make notes of what to look at later on the computer. It separated bringing the computer experience with me to making a new mobile experience. When I have a computer nearby, it's not so bad. It does make for a nicer experience.<p>Android feels a lot like iOS... almost like a slightly more functional and open copy of it. It's no where near where Maemo was. Still, it's enjoyable as a mobile experience, instead of just transplanting everything I could do on a desktop to a mobile-sized device.<p>That said, I still miss Palm OS.

If I cube the largest number that's on the high side of your monthly page views, but I still want to work for you.  Sometimes during the interview it's hard to explain why, to put yourself fully out there.<p>In some words, I feel like an interview refugee.  The recruiters who are your friends until you are cut.  After that even a friendly e-mail won't receive a reply.  I have had interviews only to be told at the end that a paid internship is no longer being offered.  I'm not sure if that's a lie, half truth, or just poor planning.  I have had interviews that were interrupted by phone calls to the founders ""other"" business no less than five times.  I have spent time on an assigned functional product to get garbage feedback and an interviewer who when I followed up hadn't even read my documentation.   I had two interviews, sent in code samples, and completed a code test and asked if I was open to a trial period or apprenticeship of sorts.  A week later that opportunity was nixed because they thought about it and said I don't have enough experience.  False hope.<p>I had some great feedback from some companies.  One setup a chat on the phone and said I would need to live in California and then perhaps something could happen in the near future.  I had another company who wasn't looking for junior engineers but liked my style and the e-mail I wrote.  There are nice people out there.

I have an IT internship on my resume now so I thought that I could at least get another django internship.<p>I can code.<p>I'm not cynical, just feeling a bit worn from this experience.  Part of it is my fault, that much I would admit.  I decided to take a different path in college and graduated with an Anthropology degree.  I couldn't handle the math portion of a computer science degree and didn't want to go to a technical school.  So now I'm thinking about applying to a university for computer science.
