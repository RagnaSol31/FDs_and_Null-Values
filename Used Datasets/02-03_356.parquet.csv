I think the problem is that brainfucked corporate IT programmers (Java, .NET, whatever) have jumped on the bandwagon and driven it into the sea.<p>I was recently smacked around the head by this in a meeting about how a team was going to implement Jira ticketing to help improve their development process. I am not sure entirely what I was expecting, but I was totally, totally unprepared for the mind-stunning crap that I got - an endless series of slides of things called ""workflows"" which apparently document the life-cycle of a ticket and need to be mapped out in excruciating gory detail. I decided to raise my hand and ask a simple question ""how do I just raise a ticket and assign it to someone"" - the presenter gave me this kind of stunned ""why would you want to do that??"" look and explained that it doesn't work that way, first you need to assign everyone into teams and roles (like tester, developer etc), and then the workflow will decide where the ticket goes based on the kind of ticket and it's status. Mind blown. I could almost appreciate how such system might be of use on a really large project where you don't know and interact with most project members directly - <i>they had a team of 8 people including testers and analysts</i>. And in their minds they were doing Agile.<p>In another case I was arguing for the use of the Jira Fisheye plugin to enable meaningful access to VC to enable things like code review and release diffs and the like. The so called ""Agile practitioners"" had a different idea however - they were keen on a different plugin called  Greenhopper which apparently does Agile process management and the like. I knew something was wrong when it was mentioned that it does nice Gantt charts. I probed a little deeper into why they didn't see the value in Fisheye and found that their actual VC practices were a joke - ludicrously large commits with minimal comment just before a release, no consistent release tags, broken commit history (they seemed to be deleting and re-creating their trunk after every release...what I don't even...). Advanced process/project management techniques over getting the basics like VC right? That doesn't sound like Agile in any universe I am familiar with.<p>I really struggle to think of any other examples where a worthy movement has been so thoroughly corrupted and debased into something almost diametrically opposed to it's original vision. Fuck Agile programming and what it has become. I think I'll stick with being a Pragmatic programmer.",1332989610.0

This is a bad thing? Who loses here?<p>What if Yehuda's company gave him 25% of his time to work on open source - would that be different? He'd get that same $25k (or whatever), and the software would get built (and open sourced). Only difference I can see is the source of the money, so are you against the idea of companies letting their devs work on open source?<p>There's this attitude in the open source world that somehow developers getting directly paid for open source is evil. This is -- excuse me -- fucking bullshit. I can't think of anything better than the idea of developers getting paid to write open source software. We need to grow the hell up and understand that paying developers to write open sourced software is a <i>good thing</i> -- open source devs get money, and the community gets software.

18,3769417,comment,3768388.0,3768388.0,38,0,uvdiv,,,"When someone suggests energy, fuel, fresh water are in danger of ""running out"", you should ask them to sketch what they think the supply curve is for those resources. They have something in common: a horizontal asymptote. With energy, it's a virtually inifinite supply at a price somewhere between 1-2x coal (nuclear fission) to a conservative 4-8x (solar) -- this for existing technology, today. For water, such an asymptote is desalination cost somewhere around 1-2x treated tap water. Similar stories for fuel -- EVs are one asymptote. In the left corner there's a short slope with a cheap, very limited resource (coal, petroleum, groundwater); then at a slightly higher price you have an infinite supply. I interpret this as saying, in the <i>worst case</i>, developed countries' crisis amounts to trivial negative economic adjustements (""trivial"" compared to, e.g. everything else that happens through 2050...); and in the <i>expected case</i>, pretty unremarkable technology gains combine with massive economic growth give you far more, for far less. (The ""optimistic"" case is singularitarian...)",1332989244.0

Without some overarching system of coordination these people will just be flailing around, constantly treading on each other, breaking each others stuff.

You can do it any way you like, but what ever you come up with is still going to be that evil word ""process"".<p>The problem is that said ""process"" then gets deployed in a cargo cult manner to any project regardless of size, divisibility, who is managing it working on it, etc.",1332988776.0

No remote exploits were used against Akamai servers, every computer they had access to at Akamai was gained through a patch version of ssh which recorded all users password before encryption and placed it in a log file within a hidden directory on the system, this patch was installed on every box they exploited, they got lucky when a user from the uu.net box logged into an Akamai box using the compromised ssh client.<p>So they have Akamai, now what? The group further infiltrated their way into Akamai's intranet and gained access to other computers on their network through social engineering. Finally they located the development server that stored the source code that Akamai used to update some 12,000+ high bandwidth servers they used. The plan was to patch the update software they used to automate the patching process to also include a rootkit&DDoS client. With this they would be able to control a ridiculously large botnet, joined with their already amassed 4000+ DDoS net from other compromised computers this would have effectively timed out all 13 top level root name servers. More then likely you can tell what happens after that.<p>If you were interested to know, these guys were caught out out of the stupidity of this guy.\n<a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/22/local/me-24959"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/22/local/me-24959</a>\nWhom was drunk and instead of hanging up decided to curse out a field technician that came onto the centrex line(thanks AT&T) they used to communicate through.

Yes, you could look for those statistics. You'd almost certainly find them. But would it help?<p>That said, here are some questions that I feel like I might be asking myself, if I were you:<p>- Is your client asking you to open yourself up to a lawsuit? Is this a problem for you?<p>- Is your client asking you to help him damage your reputation?<p>- You seem to be interested in keeping a good long-term relationship with your client. However, you have seen that he is clueless about how to obtain new customers (= sources of revenue, which is where he gets the money to pay you). Does this affect the value you place on your relationship with him?",1332986493.0
