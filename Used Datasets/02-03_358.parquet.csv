Problem with the current video entertainment situation, I think, is the difficulty to bring about that first separation from the pact, much like Apple did with the phone companies. But remember that, Verizon laughed at the level control that Apple wanted with iPhone idea, so Apple went to AT&T. OTOH, Time&Warner and Comcast are pretty much monopolies in their areas, so there's no big competitor that a company like Google can turn to to force their hand.

22,1920223,comment,1919038.0,1919207.0,0,0,RK,,,"This part of their letter doesn't make sense:<p><i>Unlike other scanners, these new devices operate at relatively low beam energies (28keV). The majority of their energy is delivered to the skin and the underlying tissue. Thus, while the dose would be safe if it were distributed throughout the volume of the entire body, the dose to the skin may be dangerously high.</i><p>The main issue is that the limit for a smaller volume of the body is actually <i>greater</i> than the body as a whole. Radiation dose is somewhat similar to a density, in that it's measured in energy deposited per mass. Your body is better at dealing with a high dose in a small volume, than it is with a low dose in a large volume.<p><i>...these new airport scanners are largely depositing their energy into the skin and immediately adjacent tissue, and since this is such a small fraction of body weight/vol, possibly by one to two orders of magnitude, the real dose to the skin is now high.</i><p>This statement doesn't make sense either. Dose is J/kg, so the fact that the volume (read mass) is small is taken into account.<p>This part sounds the most interesting:<p><i>In addition, it appears that real independent safety data do not exist. A search, ultimately finding top FDA radiation physics staff, suggests that the relevant radiation quantity, the Flux [photons per unit area and time (because this is a scanning device)] has not been characterized. Instead an indirect test (Air Kerma) was made that emphasized the whole body exposure value, and thus it appears that the danger is low when compared to cosmic rays during airplane travel and a chest X-ray dose.</i><p>The problem with this statement is that Air Kerma <i>is</i> the quantity that you'd use to calculate the dose. It is only measured indirectly in the sense that you can set the detector to have the conversion coefficients built in (you actually measure the quantity Exposure).<p>It seems that the letter was probably written by people with concern, but not expertise.

I appreciate knowing your views on this matter.<p>America's copyright industry is one of our most important economic engines, and giving artists and inventors the incentive to produce cutting edge works is vital to the country.  The protection of intellectual property is particularly important to California, which is home to thriving film, music, and high-technology industries.  I am strongly opposed to theft of copyrighted works, and I believe copyright owners should be able to prevent their works from being illegally duplicated.<p>On September 20, 2010, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the ""Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act"" (S. 3804), of which I am an original cosponsor.  This legislation is carefully crafted to address the growing problem of online piracy and copyright infringement, and would allow the U.S. Department of Justice to shut down websites which are ""dedicated to infringing activities.""  These are sites that, in the bill's language, are ""primarily designed or have no demonstrable commercially significant purpose or use other than..."" selling infringing or counterfeit goods.<p>Please know that I have been working with California high-technology businesses and Senator Leahy to improve the bill's language and address the concerns of legitimate high-tech businesses, public interest groups, and others.  This legislation is currently awaiting action in the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which I am a member.<p>Again, thank you for taking the time to share your concerns with me.
