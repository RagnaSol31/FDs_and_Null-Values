21,750230,comment,749932.0,750001.0,0,0,Fixnum,,,"Agree completely.  To my knowledge, Apple hasn't supported SCO-like efforts to destroy Linux, funded studies claiming Linux was plagiarized, consistently shipped buggy and insecure code, and wielded the patent and lobbying swords against its enemies and tried to destroy other businesses and open source in general by illegal means and lobbying (slightly off topic, but see also <a href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2009/0907.longman.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2009/0907.longman....</a>).  Apple may be controlling, but they are just selling their products and not destroying others (although Jobs's wife is apparently a big political contributor, so who knows?).<p>As for the ""Jobs vs. Gates"" article, comparing the business practices of Microsoft and Apple by pointing out that Gates makes a lot of philanthropic contributions (and in fact also spends lots of money lobbying for the US government to spend more money on Gates Foundation-related projects) is just nonsense.  ""But great wealth does not make a great man.""  Neither does making lots of high-profile charitable donations.  Frankly, this whole thing of having to be seen doing charitable work is a bit disgusting.  Not that charity is bad, but shouldn't being a successful businessman involve shipping a great product rather than in cultivating an image to keep the antitrust crowd off your back?<p>This said, it's no better when the EU and DoJ go after Microsoft and Opera's CEO cheers them on.

34,750215,comment,749932.0,750001.0,0,0,stanleydrew,,,"This is kind of absurd in its lack of even-handedness. I'm no expert on the history of these two men and the histories of their companies, but to say that Gates and MS have actively tried to hurt others whereas Jobs and Apple haven't would appear to reveal a serious pro-Apple bias.<p>First, lack of a conviction for anti-competitive behavior doesn't imply that Apple's not actively trying to hurt competitors or consumers. It just means they haven't done anything bad enough to warrant the government getting involved yet. But more than that, I'm not sure we should even care about convictions. I think every major company tries to create an environment in which they have the best chance of success. A lot of times they do things that are anti-competitive and harm consumers in order to create that environment. And a lot of times those things slip under the radar. I think this article does a great job of describing some of what Apple has been doing in that regard with iTunes and the App Store. And to pretend that Apple's recent actions haven't actively hurt other companies and even its own customers is ridiculous.<p>Finally, the statement that ""Steve just makes his products and if someone wants to play in his sandbox they play by his rules"" could just as well be applied to Gates. But if I were to make such a statement most people Apple fans would flip out. So Steve ""just makes"" this personal music management software that everyone loves which is great, and then says oh wait, if you want to use it to sync with a portable music device you can only do it with our product. Way back Gates ""just made"" this operating system that everyone loved which was great, and then said oh wait, if you want to surf the web you'll have to do it with our product (that wasn't even the restriction, which is yet another absurdity of this comparison). Somehow otherwise intelligent people magically dismiss the former as Jobs just exerting his right to dictate the terms on which you can use his products, while considering the latter massively anti-competitive behavior.

I switched over to the Mac platform about 4 years ago but I knew what I was getting. I was buying a product from a company that for years shipped a one-button mouse, that killed off its clone line to control the hardware, and that deprecates its platforms so it could advance in the directions it wanted without the baggage of legacy support.<p>I knew iTunes would only synch with iPods, for me that was part of the cost of switching. Yes I think Apple should get on with it but I don't expect they will and I can see their point. Apple is fanatical about controlling the user experience, it knows how iTunes will work its hardware but cannot know about hundreds of Taiwanese models. Can the white box mp3 player phone play video? Yes? Great. Can it decode h.264? Pictures? Great. Does it understand ""Synch most recent (iPhoto) Events?"" What does it expect for Calendars? Contacts? Notes?<p>Jason is forgetting that the reason he moved to OS X is that he was sick of the ""incompatibilities and other assorted quirks of Microsoft‚Äôs wildly open ecosystem.""
