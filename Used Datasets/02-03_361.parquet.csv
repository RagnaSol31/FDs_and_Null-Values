So that's another bit of info that you're going to have to enter when you sign up for the first time. What's interesting is that your email address almost certainly identifies you already anyway.<p>So why not just use email addresses instead of the URL, and API calls instead of those hideous redirects to establish identity?

There's a circularity to your use of ""deleterious mutations"" and ""bad mutation.""<p>Is the mutation which causes sickle-cell anaemia a ""good mutation"" or a ""bad mutation""? It increases reproductive fitness in places where malaria is or was common, so it must be good, in an evolutionary sense.<p>How many deaths has it caused once the population of people carrying the haemoglobin gene mutation migrated to a location without malaria? Is that mutation now ""good"" or ""bad""? How do you incorporate those numbers into your statistics?<p>Is the loss of eyesight a deleterious mutation? Definitely for a bird of prey, but not so for cave-dwelling creatures living in absolute darkness. For that matter, some people are attracted to people who wear glasses (and wearing zero-prescription glasses is such a turn-off!), so it might increase reproductive fitness.<p>Evolution doesn't know the future. If a population loses genetic resistance to a disease that's seemingly extinct, is that a ""good"" or ""bad"" mutation? How long does it take to judge that? After 1,000 years, should some thawed carcass reintroduce it and the species become extinct, does that count finally as a bad mutation and a single death?<p>For a real world example, consider the birds of New Zealand. They filled ecological niches which elsewhere were filled by mammals. Were these good mutations or bad ones? And when rats and weasels and cats and more were introduced to New Zealand, helping make many of those species extinct, then did those mutations retrospectively become deleterious?<p>If a genetic madness affects the leader of the US Strategic Air Command to issue orders which end up nuking a dozen Soviet cities, then what are the other cases which make that average out to one? If the nuking didn't occur, then what would the average have been?<p>What of a mutation which causes a speciation event? Is that a good mutation or a bad one? It's better for one environment and worse for the other.<p>There's a 10^-9 chance (1-in-a-million) that a ""bad"" mutation will mutate again back to the ""good"" form. With nearly 7 billion people in the world, that almost certainly happens a few thousand times every generation. In a generation we may be able to cure some genetic diseases through genetic engineering, so a ""bad"" mutation can be fixed.<p>With all those in mind, I can't figure out a way to get the numbers to come out ""1"" unless the definition of deleterious is defined to make it come out that way.",1324088428.0
