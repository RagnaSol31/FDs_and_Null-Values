Allow me indulge in some over-generalization. (And for the record, I /have/ started a tech business in both the UK and USA.)<p>* A culture of over regulation. It's not just the UK govt that does this - you'll find most large businesses like the bank mentioned putting up roadblocks.\n* Concentration of talent in financial services. Investment banks pay alot of money for top talent. Heck, when I first moved there I was working for an investment bank and enjoy the cash and perks - I should have been doing my own startup but money in hand now is hard to turn down.\n* Expensive everything. I would say that you need at least 2X more cash to start a company in the UK than compared to 2nd-tier-startup-markets like Atlanta, where I currently live. Sure, you can economize in creative ways, but that takes you away from your core mission in a startup: to build awesome products/services.",1315191444.0

Paying a good accountant allows you to manage your business transparently enough that you can raise money on a stock market, thus getting 20 times the amount of cash you've made in profits.  A four-year university education can lift you from the lower class into the middle class, adding millions to your earnings and a decade to your lifespan.<p>It turns out that developing software quickly is a very valuable activity.  In a single day of work, a good programmer can write a piece of software that functions in production for years afterwards, serving dozens, hundreds, or millions of people.  Often, this is even the case if the software is buggy; the alternatives (repetitive manual labor, spreadsheets built by amateurs) are often even less reliable.<p>If you tried to outlaw the development of unreliable software, programmer salaries would go the same place that salaries for nuclear plant engineers and designers of small planes have gone over the last three decades: overseas or into oblivion.<p>Worse, it would likely be counterproductive.  What we need for more reliable software is not books of management rules but better abstractions, better theorem provers, better programming languages, better insights.  Those things are themselves software, but they are probably not software that we can develop faster, or at all, under an SEI CMM Level 5 process.",1315190050.0

They have helped, but even if I didn't take these classes that wouldn't be a roadblock.<p>How I envision a successful education:<p>1. Language is priority: Reading, writing and communicating. Dedicate long hours for reading and daily writing. This is better than science or math. I need to be able to read, and also communicate effectively with others (forums, chat...)<p>2. Math: Math is also important. Dedicate a good amount of hours for a solid math education.<p>3. Others: It includes science, geography, history... What does the average person need of information to be relatively literate? Give it that amount of information; only. The bare minimum so he can understand things like nuclear radiations, ADN, therapies...<p>And then? Let people decide. Science is not for everyone. There is a writer, designer, business analyst...

It is a discipline unto itself which deserves understanding, study, coding, and infrastructure. Here is my system:<p>First, here are the specific types of solutions, from best/most-difficult to least-efficient/most-achievable:<p>1. Automation, e.g. have the date automatically set by the deployment your deployment script. Make your scripts be smart, so they can set things correctly.<p>2. Poka-yoke (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poka-yoke"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poka-yoke</a>): e.g. have the deploy script refuse to push out code if a configuration variable is unchanged, unless there is a comment on that config line overriding the check.<p>3. Checklist: Write down a set of procedures/checks to do when deploying. Make a copy of this list on deploy, and check off each item as you do it. (See also: <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/10/071210fa_fact_gawande"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/10/071210fa_fact_...</a>)<p>You'll note that all of those are geared at reducing reliance on your memory, rather than improving your memory. Next, here is the overall process:<p>- (""5 whys"") When you have a problem in deployment, write down what went wrong. Find 5 ways that problem could have been prevented.<p>- Address at least two of those with solutions from the set above. For example, you might automate part of the problem and add a poka-yoke in another script. Or if you're ambitious, you may be able to have two fully automated solutions, an automated deployment script and an automated test which checks that that automation is working. Not as good (but sometimes easiest) is to add it two different checklists, filled out by different people or at different times.<p>- Implement solutions even when something <i>almost</i> went wrong but didn't.<p>- Periodically review the overall process; refactor and otherwise improve it. In particular, push solutions up the chain, e.g. replace a checklist item with a much better automated solution.<p>Additional things to consider, specific to deployment:<p>- Deployment frameworks (e.g. Chef) can assist with automation.<p>- Deploying to a staging environment first can flush out many issues.<p>- Deploy first to a small subset of servers/users, following with deployment to all users X hours later.<p>- Get the advice and support of an experienced NetOps or sysadmin person.<p>Edit: shouldn't be so negative about checklists; they're often useful.",1315189061.0

Unfortunately, there is a single person tied to that track. Should you flip the switch or do nothing?<p>Scenario 2:\nAs before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by dropping a heavy weight in front of it.

Should you proceed?<p>In short, more people will flip the switch in scenario 1, but will not push the man off the bridge in the second scenario. From this result, they (researchers) hypothesize that an entirely different part of the brain handles more abstract (i.e. non-physical) decisions; while the more basic, physical decisions may be made elsewhere.<p>Really cool thought experiment, and a good listen overall.

Back in the 90s I was just a kid, but I distinctly recall the major changes in the telecom landscape happening then: DSL/Cable internet access becoming ""a thing"" as well as huge changes in telephone rates & rate structures. It's always interesting to read articles describing the history of market changes in retrospect. Also, it's eye-opening to learn how we got to where we are now (arguably crappy telecom infrastructure) and about the regulatory changes that guided us.<p>This piece is from 2006. What I'd really like to see is a similar article written today about the wireless telecom industry. Certainly the wireless telecom has been a pretty exciting industry in this past decade - smartphones are very, very mainstream now (if I had a Palm VII when I was in school, I would have undoubtedly been denounced as more of a dork than I already was) and sms/wireless internet access has arguably supplanted actual voice communication, at least in the younger crowd. At the same time, costs for these services have increased substantially. Just five years ago, I remember paying $30 for basic cell phone service. With a smart phone, can you even get voice+data for less than $60 or so? The pattern for industry consolidation is following the wired telecom's footsteps. I guess we'll see in the next few years if the wireless telecom market becomes as consolidated as the wired market is today.",1315188118.0
