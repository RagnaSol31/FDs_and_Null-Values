We are all the massive beneficiaries of millennia of accumulated human scientific knowledge and cultural output, and not one of us did anything do deserve a jot of it. We’re all just extremely lucky not to have been born cavemen. The greatest creative genius alive would be hard pressed to create a smiley faced smeared in dung on a tree trunk without that huge and completely undeserved inheritance.<p>So banish the word “deserve” from your mind when you think about copyright. Nobody “deserves” a goddamn thing. (I say this, for what it’s worth, as someone who makes his living entirely through the production of “intellectual property.”) The only—the only—relevant question is whether a marginal restriction on the general ability to use information incentivizes enough additional information production over the long run to justify denying that marginal use to every other human being on the planet, whether for simple consumption or further creation.""<p><a href=""http://www.juliansanchez.com/2011/03/30/4457/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.juliansanchez.com/2011/03/30/4457/</a>",1326509928.0

That she was unhappy later when she couldn't find work does not make her a counter example to following one's passion. When your needs aren't met, you can get unhappy. In my experience, happiness comes from your relationship to the present. Follow your passion or work on a ""big problem"" or work everyday at a job. All can make you happy or unhappy. Being happy lies in how you live your experiences while following your passion or working on a big problem or doing whatever it is that you do. How do you react to trouble? How do you handle success and praise? How do you go about doing what you do? Do you help people? Do you compete? Are you satisfying your basic needs? From what I can tell, barring the effects of illnesses like depression, happiness lies in how you choose to go about your life and how you handle its ups and downs. Unfortunately, I haven't yet figured out the nuances of the above questions and others like them, so I don't know which answers result in happiness, but that's life, I guess.

However, the screen after setting my password is a lot of information with many different steps to move forward. At this point, you might either want to offer a split walkthrough... an option to introduce the new job listing area with a brief walkthrough on ways it can be personalized or an introduction to creating new job listings.<p>- Good job on the ""University"" aspect of the site. Education on proper use of the site will certainly help your improve engagement on your site.<p>- Creating job listings on the site could be improved. Currently you require all of the information the listing requires upfront without much thought put into the presentation. You may find it easier for your users if they have a step-by-step process which gradually requests the required information. Not only will your users be able to save their progress as they go, but they won't be overwhelmed with the large about of information they'll need to provide for a listing. This is called the progressive reveal...and can be useful anytime you have a lot of steps to cover or a lot of information which needs to be conveyed to the user at once.<p>- In customizing the look and feel of the listing page, consider a preview of each of the preset color schemes.<p>- Spend a little bit of time thinking about how you're laying out the elements in your website. At this point, it's just large blocks of text that the user has to swim through to find what they need. It's most noticeable in the welcome screen/dashboard where you suggest to the user some tasks they could take.<p>- I couldn't go through and post listings and apply to them and see how the rest of the workflow is, but think about the most important and most repeated tasks your users will take and put that front-and-center on the dashboard. It might not be clear to me right now, but when I'm welcomed, there is a lot of suggestions to customize my company page instead of posting listings (maybe more important?).<p>- You have some nav buttons on the top, a dashboard/create a job tab, and then each view sometimes has a few sub-views beneath that. Tighten up the navigation and layout of the pages. The Dashboard, Create a Listing buttons can be groups with the Saved Applications, Account Details and Logout. Consider which buttons you choose for actions, could these features be organized elsewhere in the site to improve how quickly users find what they're looking for? Maybe have just ""Dashboard"", ""Account Details"", and ""Logout"". Your dashboard can then hold your listings and saved applications. Account details will hold everything specific to the account. Might simplify things greatly.<p>Hope these thoughts are helpful for you. :)",1326508505.0

51,3463292,comment,3463064.0,3463064.0,28,0,nirvana,,,"Since this article talks about the constitution, I wanted to quote the preamble to the bill of rights. Since this set of amendments was enacted, as part of the deal to get the constitution passed, it is illustrative of the perspective of right at the time of adoption of the constitution.<p>""THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution""<p>In other words, the Bill of Rights was enacted ""in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers"".  This is referring to the limited powers granted to the government in the constitution.  Notice, the preamble doesn't say ""in order to grant rights..."".  The bill of rights contains ""further declaratory and restrictive clauses"".<p>Thus, these clauses are not designed to create or grant rights, but are of a ""declaratory and restrictive"" nature.<p>The constitution does not create any rights.  There is no such thing, in the american form of government, as ""constitutional rights"".  People often use this phrase when referring to the Bill of Rights, but it is imprecise, because the Bill of Rights doesn't grant rights.  IT doesn't say ""the people shall have the right of free speech"", instead it says ""Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press;""<p>The right of free speech, as recognized by the First Amendment, <i>precedes</i> and predates the constitution.<p>The constitution is a document constructed under a theory of natural rights, by a group of men, many of whom had just fought off a government they considered oppressive because it didn't recognize their natural rights.<p>Every right, IP, or not, precedes the constitution, they are not granted by the constitution.<p>Thus, where the constitution says:\n""The Congress shall have Power ... To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.""<p>The use of the word ""securing"" is deliberate.<p>I'm not going to debate whether intellectual property is a natural right or not. (But I wonder, if you come up with an invention but don't tell anybody, isn't that a natural property right? I mean, to say that you don't' have a right to it, would be to say that others have the right to forcibly take it from you, wouldn't it?)<p>My point is simply that the constitution doesn't grant any rights, rights precede it.  The constitution gives the federal government <i>limited</i> and <i>enumerated</i> powers.  And the federal government does not have the power to pass SOPA, both because there is no <i>enumerated</i> power to do what it does, and because the first amendment forbids it.<p>The question of whether IP is a natural right is a separate one, and opposition to soap on constitutional grounds does not imply conceding it, or not.",1326508033.0

Privacy was irrelevant because individualism was irrelevant.  Even extending into bathroom habits the communist goal was to make people cogs. I'm sure this seemed like ""scientific management"" to them, and I bet many of them have no idea why it failed.<p>At my last job, all the programmers worked at a central table.  I was criticized for working in my office (which I shared with one person) with my headphones on.  This was called ""siloing"".  They wanted people to work on code together.<p>I don't know about other programmers, but for me, when solving problems I find I often have many things in my head at once, many requirements to be met for the solution and sometimes a variety of variables whose meanings I have to keep straight.<p>I literally can't think when I'm constantly being interrupted. I can't think when I'm having to explain each symbol in a line of code to a co-worker.<p>Its impossible, until telepathy is perfected, for a co-worker to have the exact same understanding of what I'm doing and why.  Sure simple obvious things are easy, but when you're constructing something original, you can't communicate it to someone completely because there are always too many details, even things you haven't resolved yet yourself.<p>At this groupthink place, every other programmer was in their 20s.  They were all junior programmers (except for the founder of the company, who worked alone in his office.) They were not very productive. They adopted a whole lot of bad process, but they thought that by sitting around all at the same table they were more productive.<p>Maybe they were more productive than they would have been.  But there was a huge gulf between the kinds of problems I was capable of solving (architecting major components of the product) and the kinds of problems they were solving (each unit test written was a task, everything was broken into tiny little independant, simple tasks.)<p>After I left, I decided I was done working for other people.  I knew it was time to do a startup, because I'd reached my limit.<p>That company culture represents the view that people are cogs.

I wouldn't call myself a great programmer-- I'm competent, and I'm great at knowing my limitations.<p>But I make a really terrible cog.<p>That startup failed within a year after I left it.
