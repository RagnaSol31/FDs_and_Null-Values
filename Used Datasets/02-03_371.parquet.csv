So did median household income. The shift was primarily due to trade liberalization. The recent recession decimated jobs across many fields, as you'd expect from a drop of jobs due to flagging demand (driven by pressure towards deleveraging, not unexpected given high personal debt to GDP ratios).<p>So automation isn't displacing workers yet, other factors are.

What engineer could say no to that?<p>If those decisions were driven by engineers, they must come from a very different engineering culture than anything I'm familiar with.

It's much easier to keep an overview.  Emacs' gdb support is really great.  If you like a GUI then try KDbg (not to be confused with kgdb) or Nemiver.  For terminals there are curses base frontends such as gdb -tui and cgdb.,1352944934.0

Just because their coffee is not particularly good compared to Blue Bottle's, don't forget that SBUX is still charging $3-$4 for a typical cup.<p>SBUX can't scale Blue Bottle across their distribution channel, which is enormous. So anything they did to introduce the Blue Bottle brand would dilute their own brand.<p>Meanwhile, a cup of coffee at Blue Bottle might not even be perceptibly more expensive than a cup at SBUX.<p>Finally, Blue Bottle has minimal brand penetration across the US. You know about them if you live in Williamsburg in NYC, but lots of people in our Manhattan office had never been to Blue Bottle last time I was in town. They're obviously nowhere in Chicago. Are they even in Los Angeles? They're not in Seattle, or Austin, or Atlanta, or Mpls.<p>An SBUX acquisition of Blue Bottle seems like a mostly-downside, lose-lose proposition.<p>(I'm only arguing because it's an interesting question, not because I'm sure I'm right).<p>(Interestingly, Intelligentsia in Chicago has higher revenues and apparently higher year-over-year growth than Blue Bottle, the same number of locations, and no external funding. Maybe SBUX will buy them! Intelligentsia also ran Clover machines before Starbucks' ill-fated takeover).<p>(Finally: Ritual, in the Mission, is really good; I think better than Blue Bottle.)",1352944906.0
