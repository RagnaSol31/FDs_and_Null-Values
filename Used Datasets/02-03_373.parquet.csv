I cant imagine anyone seriously suggesting PCA on a half a million by half a million matrix, or evaluating this matrix in the first place.<p>This actually a fairly actively researched topic: whether edit distance can be embedded, even if approximately in a vector space. It has been surprisingly resistant to such efforts. Yes there are some results but nothing very satisfactory.<p>Edit distance is a metric, so it was believed it would easy to map individual strings to vectors, such that the distance between two vectors was same as, or close to the edit distance between the corresponding strings. What we want, then, is an (approximate) isomorphism between these two metric spaces. In addition, in the interest of size we would like these vectors to be of small dimension. If the required dimension is high it would defeat the purpose if the string to vector map needs to be stored. Unfortunately it seems edit distance is resistant to isomorphism to a low-dimensional vector space. There is also this question which metric do we use in the vector space, Euclidean, Manhattan...? there are some results on the L1, i.e. embedding on a vector space with Manhattan distances.<p>Fun story: was an intern in Google&",
