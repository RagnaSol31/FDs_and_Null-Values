For example, there would have been a time when making your own capacitor using glass jars and chemicals, or making your own light bulb using a vacuum pump, would have been the equivalent of making your own remote-controlled car today. Every generation builds on the advancements of the previous generations. Failing to do so may doom one to focus only on the advancements of generations past. At the same time, I definitely understand the nostalgia of imagining your modern child experiencing those same things you did when you were younger. The problem is that the world changes too fast for this approach to really be advisable.",1449453721.0
