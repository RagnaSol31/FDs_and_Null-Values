I chose a part of the country where land was relatively cheap (Oregon), and bought 5 acres for about $3000.<p>I built a small cabin at first -- 12x24 feet -- and this is where I wrote Apple Writer (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer</a>), while relying on a very long extension cord for power.<p>Later on I bought more land and built a larger house, but still with the idea of living cheaply firmly guiding my actions. Then my income went over a million dollars a year and I decided to do something completely different -- so I bought a sailboat and sailed solo around the world (<a href=""http://arachnoid.com/sailbook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/sailbook</a>).<p>> if you want water, electricity and sewage utilities ...<p>I chose Oregon because it rains a bit, and I had previously built a cabin in Colorado where it is very dry -- I decided that was a mistake. In Oregon, for water I walked up the hill behind my cabin and dropped a hose in a creek. If you choose the right altitude difference, you can duplicate normal household water pressure. For sewage, I built an outhouse.<p>It really was quite primitive. But it freed me from having to pay rent or needing much money, which meant I could think about anything I wanted. Then I acquired an Apple II, which ironically enough I probably wouldn't have done while working for NASA a few years before. I had this fantasy that I would write some cool programs and people would buy them, and I could just live in the country and people would mail me money.<p>The weird thing is that this is exactly what happened.",1284432364

Although I'm on my third 6 month internship through school, the managers basically lied about what the jobs would entail to get me to accept (i.e. saying it's a software developer position and I'm stuck doing performance testing all the time), so there's not much I'm even proud to put on my resume.  I've had to search far and wide for a reason to write some code, and that's what I always list on my resume.<p>Maybe one big problem with interviewing at a bunch of places is that I'm most proficient with Python and not Java.  I learned to use it as my primary language because a very intelligent friend of mine was using it all the time, and he worked at Google.  Although, the most technical interviews I've ever had were with Amazon where they let you use whatever language you want to come up with algorithms to answer their questions.  It seems there aren't many companies that use Python.<p>Anyhow, I'll definitely apply around to a bunch of places even if I don't find them entirely appealing.  They can't be much worse than what I've already endured through my internships, and I've learned to make the best of my time at my jobs by now anyway.  I was thinking of doing the Y Combinator Common App today, so maybe I'll do that.<p>And you're right, it was loads of fun having an actual reason to solve some problems in OCaml.  Actually, I'm not so passionate about the language, I just thought it was really cool that they were looking for sysadmins who also knew about functional programming.

There are four possibilities: {BB, BG, GB, GG}. This space fully describes a model whereupon there are two distinct, children with genders. Additionally, via assumption of independence and equal likelihood, you can assign probabilities to each observation, {BB:1/4, BG:1/4, GB:1/4, GG:1/4}.<p><i>""At least one of them is a boy.""</i><p>At this point, you update your realities by removing the one firmly contradicted by the new evidence.

So perhaps the likelihood of hearing ""At least one of them is a boy"" is reflected like this:<p>{BB:0.35, BG:0.32, GB:0.32, GG:0.01}<p>And your new belief in each of these realities reflects that like so (renormalized)<p>{BB: 0.35, BG:0.32, GB:0.32, 0.01}<p>So now I feel even more confident that he has two boys.",1284430747

Provided you have a product worth half a chance.<p>Then there's the network and so on. If you can get in do it, if not bootstrap but it would be very hard to find a 'negative'.<p>And if there are negative stories about being in YC I'd expect them to be vented elsewhere rather than here.",1284429737
