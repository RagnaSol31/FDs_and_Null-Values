What I mean is that ""beautiful"" in the common sense, the one that applies to clothes, girls, gadgets (including Apple's), commercial movies, 3D games, etc., this superficial aesthetic quality not important.<p>In this sense, Vim, with it's fixed width font, black background, pure-text help, etc. is certainly not beautiful, and therefore a bit of a stranger on a Mac where, apparently, so much money and neuronal activity has been spent to beautify its OS, its casing, its font aliasing, every single icon and even its boxing.<p>Gosh, look at the Vim logo and tell me by which miracle it can have so much sex-appeal in a Mac environment?

The compromise solution tends to be purchasing service-restricted credits in larger increments.<p>It's a great problem to solve, but people have been trying to make incremental improvements here for ages.

Occasionally I'll run across some code in an old program (eg: Emacs), and be utterly unable to read it, because it's an older dialect of C (that I'm surprised most compilers still accept). I'll have to dig out a copy of K&R first edition just to read the code.",1320286022.0

Their web app (both for Gmail and G+) are very good, so people expect that an iOS app for the same product will also be very good.<p>Then they went and released the iOS app for G+ and it was woeful (and continues to be woeful after a couple of updates). I didn't get the new gmail app before they pulled it so I can only speculate (and considering they pulled it rather than left it to iterate, I'll assume the bugginess was pretty bad).<p>Why is it they can get a mobile web version of an app so right and get the same native app so wrong?",1320285879.0

Some at PayPal thought bill-splitting would amount to something which was of course foolish.<p>The difficulty and hence lucrativeness of financial transactions depends on size, distance and familiarity. A large transaction across the world between two strangers is the riskiest/hardest/most expensive. A small transaction face-to-face amongst friends is the opposite.",1320285734.0
