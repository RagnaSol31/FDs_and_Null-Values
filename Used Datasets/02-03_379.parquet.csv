Being able to quickly adjust your itinerary of a multi-hop vacation while en route would be nice.<p>Related to this would be a nearest neighbor point of interest discovery tool. Often its easy to find what is interesting to do in a particular location, but its much more difficult to explore options that are a day trip to an overnight trip away from that anchor point. My experience has been that the day trips or overnight trips with a return to the origin point at the most memorable.<p>Some examples:<p>-- Vacationing in Praia do Forte in Bahia, but taking a day trip to Mangue Seco.<p>-- Passing through So Luis do Maranho and taking a three day trip to Barreirinhas, and from Barreirinhas, taking a day trip to Lenois Maranheses.<p>-- Day trip to Interloken from Zrich (I wish we had done an overnight trip, but we didn't plan on that and missed out)<p>-- Day trip from Amsterdam to a spa by the beach (unlike the other three, this one was not worth it and I wish I had known that before)<p>At the end of the day a great vacation often resembles a bunch of nodes in a graph, with edges being formed on the basis of financial cost, time cost and value of that destination/activity/hotel/restaurant to me. Find me the best route between node A and node B in the graph that maximizes happiness (According to my criteria) while minimizing cost and travel time.<p>Another reason it's valuable for this to be centralized is that it avoids the issue of being sent to some boring activity or place because you don't know that the local person may be recommending a venue on the basis that its his brother or cousins business. This happens surprisingly often.",1350009313.0

They may want to be able to reject anyone, however well-suited, based on real criteria they're unwilling to reveal, like gender, race or ethnicity. An obvious way to recruit based on secret criteria is to greatly overstate the requirements, then accept someone who doesn't meet them on the ground that they meet the secret requirements.<p>I'll bet you didn't think of that angle. :)",1350009186.0

This generally excludes shows that require lots of attention, but most prime-time shows are pretty digestible with only a modicum of attention required.<p>All too often, despite having all channels on FIOS, Netflix, Hulu Plus et al, I find that I can't watch the first season of a new show that looked interesting.<p>You should _always_ give away at least the first few episodes so that I can get hooked.
