He got this by comparing a -O0 run with a -02 run and then dividing, but the obvious problem with this is that even if a modern compiler is run with -O0 it's probably going to be in effect optimizing a lot just by all the architectural choices and default code generation.

So imagine you were buying key word ""y"" for ""$x""/click - Google comes along and competes, now their product is at the top of the organic results and you will need to pay (1000 x ""$X"") for the same advertising - oh by the way when they pays (1000 x ""$x"") for the same ad space that money just goes back to its own pocket.<p>So do not feel to bad - the FTC spent millions investigating Google to find said evidence and ultimately allowed Google to settle for $22.5 million, Google allowing others to use the Motorola patents is acquired, and changing their AdWords API. And keeping with their motto: ""Don't be evil"" it appears in the last 24 hours media has gone wild alleging Google spent $25,000 to honor the FTC Director during the investigation - I know when I am being investigated for federal anti-trust allegations I too like to honor the investigator, and like Google I do not give the investigator the money directly, I give it to a 3rd party who in turn gives it to the investigators office, this allows the investigator time to close the case before allegations are made and when allegations are eventually made it allows the investigator the opportunity to say at the time it was unknown who ""donated"" money for the honorarium.",1362191550.0

I wonder if its a tax convenience thing. It says he got $7186 in other comp and the footnote that includes the cost of parking, etc... But that's non-cash so if he only made $1, they wouldn't actually have enough in his paycheck each month to cover the taxes that need to be withheld (social security, etc...) so he's have to go to the trouble of writing a check each month. It's a good gesture as is; no reason to make it logistically inconvenient on him and the payroll staff. My guess is if you put this all in an accounting system, someone who makes $757 in cash and $7186 in non-cash income in Chicago IL has to withhold $756 in various taxes on their W-2.</i>",1362189735.0

The last line has to match two out of three (for example, city and ZIP), and then it can try to do some reverse analysis on what you've written for the address line. (Even that's an oversimplification; it's pretty darn impressive.)<p>The USPS also has the additional challenge of matching what you think is your address with what is actually your address. Very, very few people know their address.<p>If that's not bad enough, if you've ever had something arrive successfully, you expect the address that was used to work forever.",1362189674.0

Law is pointless and should be repealed.<p>1+2 do not imply 3.<p>I don't know much about the California MTA.  It may very well be a terrible piece of legislation that prevents desperately needed innovation.  But the argument presented here is laughable.,1362189603.0
