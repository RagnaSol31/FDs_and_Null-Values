I wouldn't also take Germany as particularly good example because, for example, free speech is not a right in Germany (they may claim they have very good reason for that, but don't they always do so?).<p>Rights are ""not absolute"" only is the sense that exercising your right does not absolve you from responsibility for violating other people's rights. So, if you exercise your right to freely use your property, say, a gun, and shoot somebody - you'll go to jail. But not for using your gun - but rather for violating other's right to live unshot by your gun. Your right to use your property didn't go anywhere, but it also didn't remove your responsibility for the consequences of such use. If there's no consequences, there's no place for government to intervene (I know most governments disagree, of course they do).",1341629963.0

27,4210546,comment,4209384.0,4209699.0,2,0,morsch,,,"I'm not sure most users <i>would</i> move to the new product. Most people stick to the software they use. That might be because they don't want to learn a different interface. But I think, fundamentally, many people don't even want to deal with the <i>existence</i> of alternatives, they're blissfully ignorant of choice and of weighing up- and downsides[1]). I'm the same way with laundry detergent. That's a fickle kind of loyalty, though.<p>So, if that's true and people stuck with Firefox, you'd have to maintain Firefox between the snapshot releases of Frequentfox. You'd have to push an update at least every time you fix a security issue, which can be pretty often. So you'd still need to figure out a good user experience for dealing with frequent updates. Fortunately, that's a solved problem, and the user doesn't even need to notice you've updated their software.<p>Of course as you add features and modify/improve the user interface in Frequentfox, your Firefox snapshots will be different enough that you'd still end up alienating users, so you can't go crazy developing Frequentfox, either.<p>I'm voting for frequent push updates, transparent if they don't change anything significant, and with a gentle introduction to the changes if they do. Big changes should be rare, maybe explain the motivation behind them to the user, and ideally make them option. Despite all the rage, I think the user interface changes from Firefox 3 to trunk weren't all that jarring; significant tweaks more than fundamental reworkings of the UI, the awesome bar is a great example.<p>[1] Edit: I think this is what you call a ""second-order decision"", a term I just learned, e.g. <a href=""http://thinking-marketing.blogspot.de/2009/11/second-order-decision-making.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinking-marketing.blogspot.de/2009/11/second-order-d...</a>",1341629260.0

First I know my first post there was kind of arrogant and comes off sounding like an armchair expert. But I have scaled similar code, by having extremely efficient barebones code.  And I stand 100% behind that approach as valid, and something many websites do.  Look at instagrams architecture for an example of simple infrastructure doing massive workloads.  I gave my thoughts as a way to get discussion over what the challenges of scaling a site like 4chan would be, not because I meant to be arrogant about it.<p>4chan sounds like its based off some php/perl scripts +databases, and I think that approach is fundamentally bad for high performance sites with very well defined usage patterns.  You wouldn't cut a steak with a plastic knife, therefore you shouldn't be writing a website that's meant to scale in php or perl.  Sure you can do it with a lot of effort, but it's ass backwards.<p>The advantage of databases and scripting languages is flexibility with how you can add features and do queries on the data.  Once you have a well-defined usage model and queries, it makes complete sense to change to the customized highly optimized approach with java servlets or something for the queries that need to be fast.<p>Also if you have a small enough data set that can live in memory like 4chan does (text), it makes complete sense to have it all in memory ready to serve up on demand super quickly.<p>I didn't mean to trivialize the efforts to scale such a website, but on a conceptual level, if you can fit all your data in memory, and you don't need to customize pages per user as 4chan doesn't, it really isn't that complex to scale.",1341629113.0

60,4210511,comment,4209384.0,4209384.0,6,0,cheeaun,,,"Here's what I think Mozilla/Firefox should have done before starting the rapid release cycle:<p>1. Migrate all extensions to restartless/JetPack. Extensions for Firefox are very powerful but may sometimes break when new versions are released, which then the compatibility check feature is introduced to ""solve"" this. Before the rapid release cycle, I've already seen some users reluctant to update and would wait for extensions to be updated first <i>before</i> updating to new version of Firefox. So now with this cycle, it just annoys them further. If all extensions were done in a more standard (and simpler) extension API first, this would have reduce the impact on the upgrading process. Users don't have to worry so much if the extensions that they depend on, would break.<p>2. Remove 3rd-party themes and embrace the 'Personas' (simpler themes/skins). Or at least improve theme development into something more standardized like JetPack. Since the Mozilla days, theme development hasn't change much. Extensions have JetPack, but themes have nothing (Personas is entirely a different thing). The case with themes is exactly the same as extensions. I know some users wouldn't upgrade to Firefox because the theme is not updated yet. I'm not sure if anyone still install custom Firefox themes, but themes played a decent role in attracting users (from IE?) in the early days.<p>3. Implement Electrolysis (<a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis</a>). From my observation, the <i>real</i> problem with Firefox is not the memory usage but its slowness. When users notice that the browser is getting slower (slow startup, slow tab-switching, slow UI response), they probably look at the number of tabs, try to find out the problem and saw that huge GBs of memory used. Firefox is now better at memory management, but the problem is still there. I'm not 100% sure about the implementation details; I'm thinking that if Firefox has Chrome-like multi-process architecture, the interface would be more responsive and memory management would be even better.<p>So, after this, implement rapid release cycle, enabled by default for new users/installs and prompt existing users to optionally opt in. Make the update process unobtrusive and it would be a win-win situation for everyone.<p>(I created one of the first 3rd-party themes for Firefox, since the Phoenix days.)",1341628139.0

91,4210479,comment,4209703.0,4210262.0,38,0,Chris_Newton,,,"The apparent lack of responsiveness we see with a lot of modern software is usually a product of three factors.<p>Firstly, architectures today tend to be multitasking and event-driven. A modern GUI application is usually built around an event loop that waits for various interesting things to happen, such as the user pushing a key or clicking a mouse, reaching a certain time, or receiving a signal from an external device. When an event of interest takes place, the relevant part of the loop will detect it next time around, and then run the relevant code to react.<p>However, if that code takes a significant amount of time to run, then the event loop wont have a chance to react to anything else that is going on until the last event is dealt with. The catch is that things like repainting your application window because the user happened to move another window over the top of it are also handled by the event loop, so if youve got an application that is trying to check for new mail every five minutes but your network connection has dropped and it takes 30 seconds to time out, the application might be completely unresponsive to any other kind of user interaction during that time, and might not even redraw properly if you move other windows over it.<p>The usual solution to this problem is to introduce a degree of concurrency, so that any event-handling code that isnt guaranteed to complete very quickly is executed in a new thread in parallel with the event loop. The loop itself is therefore immediately free to continue responding to other events, possibly kicking off still more new threads, as necessary. Unfortunately, there are significant overheads to coding this way, so a lot of simple applications dont bother and just accept that they might become unresponsive now and then. And of course its always possible to make a mistake in the design, responding to a certain type of event that is usually dealt with quickly in the main thread without realising that under some circumstances it will take much longer.<p>The second factor is abstraction. We used to program pretty close to the metal, because you couldnt get acceptable performance any other way. Today, we build on top of OS kernels, hardware abstraction layers, device drivers, virtual machines, run-time libraries, and who knows how many other tools, all stacked up and each composed of many layers themselves. The benefits of this approach are many: faster development time, more effective testing and more robust software, ease of porting software to run on different hardware or operating systems, and so on.<p>The downside is that every time you introduce another abstraction, you are potentially introducing an overhead, and those effects multiply. Even if your abstraction is say 90% efficient compared to programming directly to whatever lies beneath it, if youve got 10 layers of abstraction between the code youre writing in your end user application and the hardware youre ultimately talking to, the effect is to reduce performance by about 2/3. And there are a <i>lot</i> more than 10 layers between your average end user code and the hardware on most systems today, and some of them are far from 90% efficient.<p>The third and final factor is somewhat related: if development time (or, if you prefer, time to market) is more of a priority than raw performance, its easy to skip over the kind of optimization work that used to be essential to produce software that ran acceptably quickly and within the relatively limited RAM and permanent storage capacity available. Its one thing to skip the fine details and hand-tweaked assembly language, which was often a very expensive activity in terms of time spent vs. resulting speed-up. Its another thing to just throw in the first data structure or algorithm that comes to mind, often because whatever software development toolkit youre using has a limited set of options available and maybe its not worth the time to code up something more appropriate, or maybe because as the industry has grown a lot of developers arent either formally trained or keen hobbyist geeks any more and not everyone knows about all the options. This is how you wind up with abstractions that are a lot worse than 90%, or that dont scale well as the amount of data they have to deal with increases and assumptions that the hardware is fast enough to make up for it these days break down.<p>So, in summary, and in more of a cause-to-effect order:<p>1. The emphasis on reducing development time because of commercial pressures or other non-technical factors, combined with a certain complacency about the capabilities of modern hardware, means that not as much optimization tends to be done before code ships today. Sometimes this introduces a modest overhead, but it can be severe if a poor choice leads to scalability problems.<p>2. Even if the overheads of any one function are modest, we build modern systems from a stack of many abstraction layers, and their overheads multiply. The compound effect can easily be the equivalent of running on hardware from several years ago, even if no individual layer was grossly wasteful.<p>3. Because we tend to use event-driven architectures for a lot of modern software, including most GUIs, a single slow operation can block the whole event loop and effectively make the whole UI unresponsive indefinitely. More advanced architectures that would prevent this have significant development costs and arent always used for the same reasons as above.<p>[Edit: OK, this is getting a few upvotes and no-ones replied suggested cutting it down, so Ill leave the whole post as it is. Sorry if anyone does feel its too long.]",1341627096.0
