And a part of Google's playbook is that not every good developer wants to live and work in Silicon Valley, so you simply can't hire enough good developers if you only have one location. By the time a company has hired as many people as Facebook, they've failed to hire hundred of others who, for one reason or another, don't want to leave New York. Maybe their wife is in medical school or their husband is a quant on Wall Street. Maybe they like the arts, or nightlife, or walkability.

This means no WIFI, 3G, etc, to connect the data from one mobile smartphone phone to another. Instead of utilizing cell-towers to connect us, why not a direct transfer of data? Some examples of data exchanges can be phone calls, text messages, media sharing, etc (or simply the transaction of local data from the phone itself and not data from the web). If mobile phones are equipped to send and receive data, why do we need cell phone towers as the middle man? We tend to accept the current structures in place as permanent, when they are not. They currently exist as a gate-keeping mechanism to charge people for services that we already have the resources to bypass!<p>The conversation ensued regarding everything from rights to frequencies, to drivers and antenna design, to all the things that phone-makers do to make it purposely difficult for this to happen. For example, why can't you use your mobile phone to request data from your home computer (given you are within wireless range for your smartphone to transfer data), which then forwards the data to your phone? What if your mobile phone could connect to a private network with every other mobile phone which locally transfers data from phone to phone?<p>Some benefits include:\n1. cost reduction of bill for voice or data from wireless carriers.\n2. direct mobile-to-mobile data transfer instead of through a cell tower bottleneck.\n3. privacy.<p>So I ask, do any of you have insight into how this could possibly happen? Is something like this already in development/production? What changes in a smartphones hardware or software is needed to make this happen?

What if you're a writer or an independent software developer? What if you are a 40-year-old musician with a family, and cannot be on tour for the better part of the year? What if you are terrible live, but a great composer?<p>I think the best approach is to reward the actual creative activity, not ""added services"". It's a basic management principle: reward for what is actually valuable. For example, if you ask programmers to provide their software for free and charge for support services (which is often proposed as a substitute for per-copy charges), you are incentivizing them to design hard-to-use software. Similarly, if musicians are only able to make money on concerts, this will incentivize the creation of music that sounds good live (not all good music does) and caters to the concert-going demographic (usu. young people with no families).<p>Kickstarter is nice, but I don't see it as a real source of income. How many people are going to pay for the promise of a product vs. for the actual product? I don't know what Amanda Palmer is doing. From what I can tell from her site, it's the ""live shows + t-shirts"" model I've already discussed.<p>I don't know what abuse of copyright you have in mind, but I am the first to argue that copyright law should be reformed. I would shorten the copyright term, for example.<p>Finally, I would like to address something you've brought up repeatedly in this thread: the issue of zero marginal cost. There is no rule that says that the cost of something should be equal to its marginal cost. Do you believe the cost of a book should be the cost of the paper + distribution? Or that if there are free seats at a movie screening, I should be legally allowed to watch that movie for free (since the marginal cost of another viewer is zero)?<p>Time to wrap up.
