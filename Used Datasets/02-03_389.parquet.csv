Having worked on the first deployed DOCSIS 3 network in the US I know a few things about HFC networks.<p>First, any modem that is on the approved list of modems the ISP lists (either via public website or by calling) will be fully supported by latest and greatest firmware. The way it works is that there is generally a private overlay network that has access from the provisioning system to upload the firmware the ISP wants to have deployed. However this is often less likely than you think and any DOCSIS 3 capable modem you buy today will generally work out of the box. The difference between 2 and 3 is most generically up and down steam channel bonding. This is basically taking a QAM and running it over RF space on the cable. There is a finite about, just like over the air (although rather wide and compressed QAM, 64 QAM vs 256 QAM puts more data within the same time frame sent).<p>Back to provisioning... If you buy a Motorola Surfboard that is on the ISP approved list the provisioning system will send the same updates to your modem that would be to a leased modem.<p>I could go on, but TL;DR: this article is not a good reference to understand how HFC networks operate - or how to make your Internet faster.<p>That, and damn TWC is slow on D3.

72,7083139,comment,7081761.0,7082360.0,15,0,lliamander,,,"The problem is that the fields in which he is an expert have failed to provide sufficiently better predictive power over the judgement of a well-read or experienced layman[1].  I do not mean that as a criticism of the OP; this is merely a consequence of how young &quot;social science&quot; as a science is, and how difficult of a subject matter it attempts to study.  The fact that a &quot;2 sigma&quot; level of confidence is considered acceptable in social science, whereas particle physics has a stand of 5 sigma, should demonstrate that judgement of experts from different disciplines should be different depending upon their area of expertise (but this has been known since the time of Aristotle).<p>Now it is fair to point out that medicine(as an application of biology) and counseling (as an application of psychology) are held to the same statistical standard, yet the medical community has the advantage of being able to generalize about the responses of human physiology in a way that the social sciences cannot, and counselors at least have the option of leveraging their empathy when trying to understand their clients.  Public policy (as an application of sociology) has neither advantage.<p>But I also think he is painting a false dilemma, either that or he is being uncharitable to his opposition, which I would characterize as &quot;populist&quot;[2].  With regard to the governance of America, it is not simply a choice between experts and the unwashed masses.  We also have the option of decentralizing power and policy decisions and letting states, counties, and cities - as well as voluntaristic organizations like professional societies, religious communities, corporations, and charities - decide more of their own rules.  This does preclude a &quot;rule by experts&quot;, but does delay their ascension until their science has fully matured.<p>Now, to be fair, my own discipline of computer science/software engineering has yet to grow into maturity as well [3][4].  Yet for all the griping about &quot;techo-elitism&quot; there are quite a number of counter-indicators of this:\n- there are no legal barriers to entry in this discipline: while a degree is typically expected by employers it is not mandated by law and many enter this discipline without one.\n- there is a strong culture of having an &quot;open book&quot;, i.e. the open source community.\n- a portfolio of work is typically the central piece of one&",
