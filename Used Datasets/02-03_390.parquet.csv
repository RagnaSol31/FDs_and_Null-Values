But in my experience, intrade has a strong conservative bias. This is more likely a case of people betting on their (incorrect) political convictions as opposed to intentional manipulation.<p>I remember observing a similar thing around the betting on the supreme court healthcare decision. The odds were 3-4 points more against the legislation on intrade than they were on other sites. The comments were overwhelmingly partisan and conservative. ""The Supreme Court will find this unconstitutional because Obama is a socialist.""<p>The idea behind prediction markets is that people will only bet when they know something that the rest of us don't.

No shocker that the better-off pay more.<p>> Also, perhaps as a counter example: Artists, students, and other creative types are now perhaps more likely to use AirBNB than a Hotel, as a base of working in NYC or SF etc. History evidences (globally) creatives tend to inflate real-estate values far in excess of any economic income they themselves capture from employment (in any major urban center). Viz: Soho, Soma, Shoreditch, Berlin, Brooklyn, Paris pre-war, etc.<p>I can only speak for Soma, because I've lived there for 5 years.

Instead, those are the kids who either did not care enough to prepare for it, possibly have a class assignment that requires going or most often, just take themselves too seriously to be a viable candidate.<p>Also, to recommend that someone dresses down for the few positions that might be okay with that really limits who the student can meet with.

But I would hardly call this ""backward momentum."" It's not like there was a ton of incentive for Joe Pot to rally behind the move--cheap prescriptions, cheap dispensaries, and cheap penalties is keeping him plenty happy and stocked.<p>There was no such ""cracking down"" in Amsterdam. And I would hardly call what happened in the <i>Netherlands</i> ""cracking down."" Many cities were weary of tourists entering the country simply to get high. So those cities combatted the ""anti-social"" tourist by requiring marijuana IDs at their coffeeshops. Citizens are free to use, but unless other countries adopt legalization laws in the Euro Zone some Dutch cities feel they must enforce these policies.<p>Will be interesting to see how Colorado/Washington deal with this, as they will likely encounter the same issue. If I lived in a border city like Vancouver, I'd be prepping for an influx in 2014.",1352340281.0
