Even if a company has a policy of giving bare minimum information, find out a TELEPHONE NUMBER of someone in that company who knows your candidate and start a conversation. I was given a specific script of questions to ask back in the 1990s when I was a community volunteer for my local public school district, doing reference checks on superintendent candidates. A consultant advised the school district (and through the district, me) on how to do this. If you talk to someone directly by voice, and have a good list of specific questions to ask about the candidate, you will be AMAZED at what people say, policy or no policy. Company policies don't keep people from sharing stories with curious listeners. The key is to learn what questions are legal to ask and reveal the most interesting stories about the person you are thinking of hiring. There are consultants who can advise you about checking references, and, as several comments here say, they are a lot less expensive than making a wrong hiring decision, and once you've learned the questions, you know what to ask.<p>I've just asked my consultant Google, and he suggests several sets of useful questions to ask when checking references:<p><a href=""http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/recruiting-hiring-advice/job-screening-techniques/reference-checking-questions.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/recruiting-hi...</a><p><a href=""http://www.drgnyc.com/list_serve/Jan24_2005.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drgnyc.com/list_serve/Jan24_2005.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.acadweb.wwu.edu/hr/Employment/InfoForHiringOfficials/HiringPersonnel/Exempt/TelephoneReferenceChecks.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acadweb.wwu.edu/hr/Employment/InfoForHiringOffici...</a><p><a href=""http://www.best-job-interview.com/reference-check-questions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.best-job-interview.com/reference-check-questions....</a><p><a href=""http://www.k-state.edu/hr/employment/referencecheck.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.k-state.edu/hr/employment/referencecheck.htm</a><p><a href=""http://pbsbo.ucsc.edu/personnel_payroll/staff/recruit/ref_check.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pbsbo.ucsc.edu/personnel_payroll/staff/recruit/ref_ch...</a><p><a href=""http://www.bridgestar.org/Library/HiringToolkit/ReferenceCheck.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bridgestar.org/Library/HiringToolkit/ReferenceChe...</a><p><a href=""http://jobsearch.about.com/od/referencesrecommendations/a/refercheck.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobsearch.about.com/od/referencesrecommendations/a/re...</a>",1319424958.0

This generally is used to display speed/engine revs/temp etc, but can also be switched for infra-red imaging, reversing camera, navigation overlays and other things.  It also can be themed with the rest of the car, so you can choose a blue, red, yellow, etc theme for your interior.<p>BMW have had HUD for several years, which overlay speed and turn-by-tun navigation, which are very usable.<p>You can expect this type of thing in entry and mid level cars within the next 5-10 years, as the current model cycles pan out.\nTop Gear love to make fun of these features, and indeed some are silly.  But the vast majority work well and have a lot of thought behind them.  The version 1.0 of all this stuff is already 10 years old.<p>Early experiments into touch-screen everything have proven to not be popular with the car-buying public.  Through experimentation, designers have found that, for important functions (ventilation, radio, etc) a physical button in a known location outperforms a touch screen interface every time.  In my case, this is because you can memorize the location and feel of a button and can push it reliably without taking your eyes off the road.  You can push it in the dark at night time, and you get tactile feedback.<p>Touchscreen systems are already here, but will always bury less-used functions like options and navigation, which is designed to be used while stationary, while the more common functions will remain as dedicated push buttons.<p>Outside of the tech-geek world, function, function and function is prized much more than interesting neat features.  Take a test drive with the average car buyer and you'll find that a simple, familiar and well-designed user interface will trump a tech-fest every time.  While there is a lot of technical interest in 'carputers' the general public won't ever really warm to them.  The big sales winners are in things like self-parking and parking cameras/sensors, accident avoidance and other passive safety systems.",1319424351.0

Basic knowledge can go out the door because people can't even be arsed to stay alive unless things are love-able?

For this reason, you may not use a trademark to secure a utilitarian design - that would be circumventing patent law. Trademarks are intended as an insignia of origin, to distinguish your product from someone else's, and not to protect an invention. Because those different purposes have different needs, different laws cover them.<p>However, I would have thought there would be many different brick designs with similar utility to Lego: ovals, squares, triangles, different numbers of them, different arrangements etc. The only way I could see support for the judges' finding is if the Lego design was significantly better than the alternatives, in a functional sense.<p>Moving on to the tablet: A (US) <i>design</i> patent only lasts 14 years - it's not a trademark that lasts forever.

It turns out that improving society as a whole is a vaguely defined and difficult goal, while increasing profits is directly measurable. The market works by taking something vague and difficult for anyone to set out to do on their own (improve the well-being of society) and turning it into a direct, self-interested, measurable goal (increasing profit).<p>There are other systems that work a similar way. For instance, the adversarial system in criminal justice works by throwing together two opposing lawyers, each of whom wants only to win the case, and as a result does a pretty decent job of both enforcing the law and protecting civil rights.",1319423544.0
