I knew this was undefined in theory because C treats any kind of signed overflow as undefined behavior, but I'd never run into this specific issue. Trapping it is a denial-of-service risk but at least it won't subtly break downstream invariants like most 2's complement signed overflow bugs. Some architectures have signed add/sub instructions that will optionally trap on overflow. If you're going to trap, it seems like you should do it across the board, rather than reserve it for one arithmetic instruction as with IDIV. The x86 IDIV/IMUL and DIV/MUL instructions have a nice left-inverse pairing (the multiplies take two n-bit operands to a 2n-bit result, the divides take a 2n-bit operand and an n-bit operand to an n-bit result) but that symmetry breaks down when you work with fixed-size operands and results as is usually the case.",1315449004.0

In a more sarcastic way it would mean ""When unsure how to proceed, just keep churning large piles of code!""<p>Programming is not picking potatoes. You cannot substitute 1 good programmer with 10 average ones. It just doesn't work that way. When you pick potatoes, you can say, if I hire 10 pickers and they pick x potatoes per hour then I'll get these many potatoes -- awesome. Programming is like composing music -- a hundreds average composer monkeys won't be able to compose a piece that one good composer can. It just doesn't work that way. It is inherently a creative process.<p>> In fact we love America for the help they offer us.<p>Sorry to disappoint, I seriously doubt genuine altruistic motivations are the cause of this ""help"". India might perceive it as such, but I seriously doubt that's how American (or any) external policy works.",1315447446.0

The point is that AppEngine boosted their pricing from between 5x-25x depending on the project. People aren't mad that AppEngine is using instance-based pricing, they're mad that they bought into a proprietary system that has a lot of lock-in and then the system increased their pricing by a ludicrous amount.",1315447281.0

If 1 BTC goes from $10 USD to $20 USD, then 0.5 BTC goes from $5 USD to $10 USD. It doesn't change the money supply any more than slicing up a gold nugget creates more gold. Bitcoin is still inherently deflationary. All subdivision does is avoid imposing a minimum transaction size.<p>Bitcoin is also unique in that a substantial portion of the total BTC that will ever exist have already been destroyed, as many early adopters abandoned or lost their wallets.",1315447265.0

You register your domains with GoDaddy, use their DNS servers and host your shit on their servers. You also get your SSL certs from them. That's what the OP was doing.<p>Level 2: You're in up to the balls, but that's where it stops. You register with them, host your DNS with them but your website lives on another providers servers and you get your SSL elsewhere.<p>Level 3: You wearing a condom and don't give them their own key or underwear drawer. In other words, you register your domain with GoDaddy but you host the DNS somewhere else like DNSMadeEasy which costs, but is reliable. You also host your site somewhere else like Linode for example. And  your SSL cert is something that costs more but is reliable. I have an EV cert from Verisign which costs but you get better conversions.<p>Level 3 is the only place you want to be. Pay them the bare minimum, immediately delegate the DNS hosting to a reliable rock solid provider that doesn't black-list DNS servers and use that provider to point your A record to whatever web host you're using. You get cheap domains and the only time you have to wade through GD's cluster fuck interface is when you change DNS providers or want to register another domain.<p>My primary domain did over 27 million DNS requests last month via DNS Made Easy with a 12 hour TTL and it's been registered with godaddy for over 4 years now with no problems at all.",1315447250.0

I don't blame them for doing it.  The system is what it is. Google has to arm their client-states with weapons at this point. Until the laws change they would be stupid not to.,1315447228.0
