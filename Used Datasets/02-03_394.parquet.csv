(Dataflow algorithms are directed graphs, with data flowing along edges between vertices, each of which contains a single processing step.)   This is because dataflow captures all the parallelism inherent in the algorithm without the programmer having to assign tasks to processors explicitly.   While text-based dataflow languages exist, the directed graphs which comprise dataflow programs are more naturally represented graphically.<p>Having started down the dataflow route, further advantages then manifest themselves: most program development can be done by drag and drop, rather than typing; strong type checking can be done while edges are being drawn; the directed graphs used to draw code can double as completely general data structures; and the graphics libraries used to develop the language can be made available to the programmer.<p>The visual dataflow programming language I am developing is described here: <a href=""http://web.onetel.com/~hibou/fmj/FMJ.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.onetel.com/~hibou/fmj/FMJ.html</a><p>Some visual languages, such as DRAKON and GRAIL, are based on conventional flowcharts showing flow of control, rather than flow of data.   Flow of control, however, can be adequately represented as text.",1440210413.0
