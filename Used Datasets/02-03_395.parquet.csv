Whether ""linked list"" is taken as a generic term that describes a whole class of data structures or whether it's restricted to just the basic ""linked list"" types, the title is misleading.  The patent does not cover the basic linked list types nor does cover the entire the entire class.<p>This patent is ridiculous enough <i>without</i> exaggeration.  I believe that the patent system is broken, but making misleading claims about frivolous patents weakens the arguments.  The truth is already ridiculous enough.<p>As for your comment about ""excessive infighting over apparently trivial concerns"", I wish I could dispute that.  I feel that geeks as a group tend to be pedantic jackasses, and I'm often guilty of that myself.  It does hurt our credibility as a whole.<p>By the way, your interpretation of multiply-linked lists is correct.  You can look at it as multiple separate lists crammed together for minor space savings or as a directed graph with labeled edges (labels here represents which ""list"" an edge is for).  This is why I don't think it's an especially useful data structure; there are better alternatives for most cases.",1313116076.0

By i'm technically still fine with the current one. The claims (both in the application and in the granted patent) barely talk about traversing the ""primary"" or the ""auxiliary"" list which provide another sequence (well, providing the same would be... useless), not any kind of tricky algorithm like efficient multiple simultaneous sorting or i don't know what, not even a plain and boring insertion is covered!<p>This is a special case of traversing multiple linked lists, which is a basic technique. I actually even hesitate to say it is a technique, or at least to distinguish this technique from the very same technique of using a single linked list, because I don't think I could ever come up with a plausible justification for why anybody previously knowing how to use one would not be able to use two.\nThe restriction making this a special case is that all lists contain the same set of elements. Given the claims, that restriction is unnecessarily narrow and have no technical effect. So the only thing that distinguish this patent from a patent on a particular (but still 100% basic) use of single linked lists, is the phrasing, and the empty (still given the context) emphasis on the fact there are not one, but two, or even three lists.<p>So despite the fact that basic singly-linked lists + limited to one list by element would not be covered by this patent even in the parallel universe where it would be considered valid (and while we can note that on the contrary, prev/next linked list would), given that it only claims (with many more sentences) that if you have two lists, you can traverse one, or you can traverse the other, i will continue to argue that it covers linked lists, maybe under certain conditions, all right, but those conditions are insufficient to mandate the precision that this is a modification of linked lists, because it is not a modification, it is just about the basic traversal of multiple plain classical linked lists.<p>(Also, one a side note, I found it cute how the claims are structured, like if the author thought there was a possibility that prior art could be found for two pointers but not three.)<p>Edit: About the inflammatory part, it might as well have been even more inflammatory by being even more descriptive. Somebody has patented traversal of linked lists.",1313115766.0

There is also the issue of whether ""linked list"" has an informal, conversational meaning among a subset of programmers that differs from its formal definition (I believe this thread demonstrates that it does), and whether it <i>should</i> have such separate meanings.<p>It is my opinion that neither of these arguments is helpful to the anti-bad-patent/anti-software-patent cause, and it seems that excessive infighting over apparently trivial concerns is a credibility-destryoing hallmark of the stereotypical geek.  After all, if you were a politician, would you continue to listen to a presentation in which the presenters started arguing with each other over whether the background color of the slides was more appropriately described as purple or fuchsia (Is fuchsia a subset of purple, or are they separate entirely?  Sounds familiar...)?<p>As an aside, sometimes I wish I could draw a circle around an entire thread and say, ""I'm responding to this whole blob,"" with the page layout updated accordingly ;).",1313114681.0

Or am I remembering correctly where they used the broad, sweeping term ""social networks"", which would include Facebook, and I'm sure BBM chat.<p>Do you live in a fantastical world where governments pass very strictly limited, narrowly defined laws that precisely target one specific problem?

I've <i>used</i> that trick for passwords before, and it was a hassle. But that doesn't even matter— unless you're choosing the manipulations randomly (which is a contradiction in terms) you're falling right back into the exact damn trap the comic was about!<p>You've added ! at the end, replaced s with z, capitalized some words, and replaced vowels with numbers. These are already standard manipulations in a dictionary attack. And it's causing you to ignore the fact that you've chosen what is probably among the top <i>10</i> song lyrics used. ""p4ssw0rd!"" <i>is</i> ""password"" as far as a dictionary attacker is concerned. Calling this trivial to brute force is demeaning to the word ""trivial"". Your attacker wouldn't even laugh at you, because there'd be dozens of other hashes in the file just like yours.<p>It's been said over and over in these comments: the appearance of randomness is not randomness. Humans are <i>horrible</i> at making things random, as you've just demonstrated. Stop trying to make it <i>look weird</i>, and actually do the math.",1313114540.0
