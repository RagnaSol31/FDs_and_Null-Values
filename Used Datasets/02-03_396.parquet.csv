If you're using PKs just note where your dumped tables leave off.  When ready to roll to prod just put up your maintenance page, export from production your dbs into csv files again, but now from the PKs upward (this saves considerable time, you could always do the whole db again but wouldn't recommend it), import (add) the missing data and voila - a migrated DB.

To save some time we recreated the table structure we had (use something like Navicat to make life really easy and copy over the structure). We then exported our DBs into CSV files and used mysqlimport with --compress flag.  Took about 4 - 6 hours to get all the data up. Definitely a weekend or latenight job.  Of course with significantly less data this could take much less time.  Our smaller DBs took less than an hour and those we literally just used the copy functions within Navicat.,1302058210

And in last years election, they were pushing hard for a ballot initiative that would have slapped an additional tax on hotel rooms.<p>There is just too much bureaucracy in this city.

The appropriate fit might be sales, renting, monthly charge, pay-per-use, royalty, per-developer, per-other-metric. It's not necessarily about extracting more money from customers, but revenue that makes sense for customers - that they prefer, that makes sense in the competitive set, that motivates the business to improve along the right dimensions.",1302055500

Like it, have any suggestions, ideas or anything else in mind feel free to speak up.<p>I'm happily using it and if someone else find it useful too even better:)<p>http://twitter.com/YCnews",1302055405

I thought that they should pay and the fact that they have not brought it up would imply to me that they are not that interested and they are just fishing.<p>But may be I am reading too much into it and vc's don't pay. Which is why I want to know what is typical.<p>Thoughts folks?,1302055378
