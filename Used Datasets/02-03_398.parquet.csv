Like all companies, you should choose the one that most fits your ideals and career objectives, so I can only answer your question from my perspective.  For me, that is working for a large Web company, who values open-source and front-end engineering, and provides unique challenges and problems to solve at a massive scale.  All other issues or perks are secondary to me as long as I get to spend my workday doing what I'm passionate about, and my company supports my interests.  There are few, if any other companies I can work with that match what Yahoo can in that regard.  In fact, in 2008 there were only two companies on my list when I was looking to make the move from the startup-world, I interviewed at both, one was warm and welcoming (Y!), the other not as much.  Really happy with the way things worked out.<p>It's tough (impossible?) to get <i>everything</i> you want in a work environment. Remember, happiness is entirely relative [1].  You can find dozens of blog posts about people being unhappy at Google, Facebook, Yahoo, startups, etc. just as you can find people who are extremely happy.  Everyone values different things, but I think the interest most people share is that their company values them.  Oddly enough, last year I referenced a Marissa Mayer quote in a short blog post [2] about finding happiness in your career, and why I like Yahoo. Glad to see she also realized Yahoo is an awesome place to be.<p>You just have to prioritize which aspects are important to you, and ensure those are important to your employer as well.  If someone is choosing their employer based off reasons other than how they spend 95% of their workday, they should reevaluate their situation.  That's at least my philosophy.<p>Sorry that probably doesn't answer your product questions, but I felt your underlying question was ""Why Yahoo?"", so I tried to best answer that.<p>[1] Interesting study which you can find references to it all over the Web.

I bought a Nexus 7, which I actually like more than the current iPad, but that is mostly form-factor thing; a 7-inch iPad would relegate the Nexus 7 to the shelf.<p>So I can decide to use these slightly shittier devices and 'punish' Apple, but it doesn't feel worthwhile, because in doing so I also have to punish <i>myself</i>, and Apple isn't the actual underlying problem.<p>In this case, it is the dysfunctional patent system. In another recent case where Apple was the villian, the issue was the diminishment of the rights of individual citizens in favor of protecting the interests of multinational corporations: when Apple actively lobbied to make jailbreaking illegal.<p>That was a case where the actual underlying system was resolved in favor of the good guys (per my worldview, and that of most HN readers I presume). The law of the land was changed, and the problem was solved/averted.<p>Fixing the patent system seems like a herculean task, probably much harder than protecting our legal right to crack shitty DRM and usage restrictions on devices we own, but I think it is still the right place to focus. Apple may be the latest Oracle/SCO/AssholeCorp, but as long as the underlying legal system is completely fucked, even if Apple disappeared there would just be another corporation that came along and started doing the same shit.",1345861550.0

However, to use your analogy - if there is a bug in the code you fix it, and you correct any problems that the bug causes. That would be the ideal of modern science, but we aren't there yet.<p>To be able to implement your ideas of genetic purity (which is basically your argument!) we would need to either a. Stop those with genetic ""defects"" from breeding, or b. withdraw treatment from them and hope they die before they have offspring, or c. end the life of those people to take away strain from the medical system and prevent them from reproducing. Regardless, to know this there would need to be mandatory mass screening of the population to make these determinations. Go work out the moral objections and monetary costs that would result from THAT, if you will!<p>Furthermore, your original argument is that those with congenital defects cause excessive strain on health systems. Yet where do you get your figures from? I would be very interested.<p>Yet there is more that you haven't considered. Using your own argument - which I find to be so terribly wrong - you haven't considered that not assisting those with a genetic defect may remove positive genetic attributes from the gene pool. Now you have the problem of judging whether one aspect of their genetics should cause them to propagate their genes. But if you do let that propagate, then you are exhibiting anti-dysgenics, which you abhore.<p>What makes your argument particularly specious is that you never consider the intrinsic worth of the person receiving the treatment. On top of this, you think that it is moral to refuse treatment for those suffering from illnesses because they are defective. And yet they are not defective, they have a particular defect that is causing them medical problems.<p>In short, I consider your ideas cruel, inequitable, poorly reasoned and ill-considered.
