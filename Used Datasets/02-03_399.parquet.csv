21,2827460,comment,2826687.0,2827374.0,3,0,djcapelis,,,"> Seems empirically like you are the most knowledgeable on the thread on this topic<p>A disappointing conclusion.  Welcome to HN on a weekend I suppose.<p>> What is the definition of 'practicality' at this point (i.e. how efficient does this need to be)?<p>Hard to tell, but probably a good goal for practicality would be looking at the number of computations it takes to do an operation on ciphertext needs to be a reasonably low enough number that it actually makes sense to put it in the cloud.  If it takes 10,000 computers to do the work of one, then it doesn't make much sense to use the cloud instead of just buying a machine.  The only real answer to your question is to look at the relative costs of buying a machine vs. using the cloud and figure out how big of a factor difference that is, that's going to be slightly different for every org, but not likely to be larger than say... maybe 5-10x?<p>So if you accept that as being a reasonable benchmark, then you'd want to see a homomorphic scheme that allows 5-10 computers using homomorphic encryption operations to keep up with one doing operations on plaintext.<p>Maybe there's some absurd circumstances where 100x is still practical, but there's obviously a limit.<p>> What is the current efficiency (and how is it being measured, big O notation per key length?, something else) ?<p>Not entirely sure what the current state of the art is.  I haven't really checked on this since reading Gentry's thesis.  I understand there were some advanced and some simplifications since then, but I believe we started out in the realm of it being about 10^6x times more complex to do homomorphic operations than plaintext operations with Gentry's first scheme that showed it was even possible.<p>So even if this has gone down quite a bit, we've got a long way to go before we're talking only a 10x - 100x hit.<p>Here's what I found with a quick Google, but I didn't quite find the numbers I could translate into anything reasonable, so maybe you can make sense of it: <a href=""http://eurocrypt2010rump.cr.yp.to/9854ad3cab48983f7c2c5a2258e27717.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eurocrypt2010rump.cr.yp.to/9854ad3cab48983f7c2c5a2258...</a><p>Edit:  Looking through this one now: <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/520.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/520.pdf</a><p>Editx2: Oh, I suppose the real problem I should have mentioned is the more complex things you want to do, the worse it gets and ""complex"" here means ""how many multiplies"" which for a lot of things people want to do is ""a lot.""  So for each scheme, the overhead changes somewhat wildly based on how you encode what you want to do into adds and multiples, or whatever basic blocks it's using.",1312080282.0

The fact that it's the same was revealed by Wired, and users of KissMetrics appear to have not known.  It sounds like KissMetrics didn't do much more than could be gained from a referrer in their linking between sites, though clearly more could be done if they wanted to be bad.  (Yes, I understand the bad in placing an ""unkillable"" cookie even on folks who didn't want to be tracked; I'm referring to the specific concern you raised).<p>There is no evidence in the article that Kissmetrics stitched these together in any way other than what is available in standard referrers.  If you hand typed the info in, referrer is blank, and I don't think Kissmetrics imputed the referrer from their data.  I don't use the tool, however; can actual customers let HN know if it actually does what Zed thinks it does?

When the name is attached to a signature then it's just so that there's a legible version.<p>With the I-9 specifically section one is done by the employee, section two and three are done by the employer. All of the data in the form pertains to the employees work eligibility and there are rules about what the name in section one says when compared to the documents that are presented for section two or three. So the name in section one is data. The name in section two doesn't really matter as it's just a witness, the company is ultimately responsible for errors in the form, unless there's a criminal issue (document abuse, fraud, perjury, etc). So as with pretty much every form they ask for the printed name since there's a good chance the signature will be illegible. The new name in section three also isn't really important as it's rarely used. You only update the I-9 form and fill in section three on a name change if the persons work eligibility documents need to be updated. Since it's a small percentage of the cases that section three will be used for the government doesn't care too much.

""For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction""; if the plane is experiencing lift a.k.a. an upward force (in the fully Newtonian sense of the term) from the air, the plane must be imparting an equal and opposite force downward on something else, in this case the air, which will cause the air to be accelerated downward. A plane flying through the air does not merely cut through the air, it actually causes a downwards net acceleration. Nothing else is possible. (That's not to say it doesn't do so by some clever work in the details, including on the leading edge of the wing where some air is briefly pushed upwards, but I'm talking about the net force on the air considered as a whole.)<p>There's an amazing amount of misinformation in this area and a lot of people have managed to talk themselves into positions where somehow forces are distinguished from the masses and accelerations in question, or some other similarly gibberish splitting of unsplittable concepts. (""F = ma"" is a mathematical statement saying precisely that there <i>is</i> no difference between a force and an accelerating mass, there's nowhere to wedge the two apart, they are fundamentally, deeply, profoundly the same thing. The school system does an incredibly poor job of teaching what equality truly is and a surprising amount of subsequent failure to teach math stems directly from that simple oversight... but I digress.) A vehicle accelerating upward <i>must</i> be doing so by pushing something else downward, be that rocket exhaust, electromagnetic radiation (theoretically possible but impractical on Earth), or, yes, air. (Or more generally, any vehicle that is accelerating with less that the acceleration dictated by gravity towards Earth, but I think it's easier to see if we postulate an aircraft actually accelerating upwards.)",1312078925.0

When I write code, I don't want it to be Android code, or iOS code, or WebOS code, or Windows [Mobile] code, or Linux code.\n---<p>There are options out there. I'm one of those 3rd parties  soon releasing a comprehensive middleware solution for app dev including a lot of game dev oriented effort that provides a clean abstraction layer via a component architecture that uses a large majority of advanced Java language features under the hood without sacrificing performance.<p>Keep a watch out for TyphonRT; drop me an email via the contact address and I'll be glad to discuss more and make sure you get early access. I'm aiming to get it out ASAP and before I give an all day game dev workshop at AnDevCon II in November. I suppose one thing that makes TyphonRT unique is that it's a tool, framework, and future platform (PaaS). At the heart of things you can pick and choose individual blocks of functionality (tool), or utilize the runtime framework (framework), and soon there will be optional PaaS features aiding Android and cross-platform dev in the coming year after launch.<p>Another Java based cross-platform effort which is similar in purpose though significantly different at the architecture level is libgdx. For C/C++ check out Battery Tech and the Proton SDK for similar cross-platform efforts (both of these with even more device coverage).<p>TyphonRT provides that layer of sugar you seek without losing performance and creating full cross-platform execution for OpenGL apps without changing a line of code for J2SE -> Android. TyphonRT is not limited to OpenGL though and can utilize any graphics API potentially allowing a hybrid UI, but the rest of an app still being cross-platform.<p>Having worked intensely with Android since v1.0 and the G1 hit my hands in Oct '08 I have more than a few stories on the difficulty of low level development / games, etc. across different OS and major device hardware generations. I've experienced first hand a good deal of general engineering blunders and have found and reported a few major ones myself (you know when big G fixes a bug immediately upon being reported you found a good one; the 3.0 & 3.1 / NIO immutable endian swap issue comes to mind!).<p>Middleware will mature and soon provide a lot that the Android SDK lacks for certain app development areas. In many ways the Android SDK while novel in several areas is still being developed from an old engineering model, but that is seemingly unavoidable for a large organization such as Google. There are of course additional inherent problems with tying the SDK to firmware, but such is life.<p>I do agree with your last point though that generally the SDK in addition to the particular ecosystem quirks that have occurred over time isn't exactly indicative of satisfying developers.",1312077801.0
