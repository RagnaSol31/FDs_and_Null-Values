1,3512729,comment,3510109.0,3511356.0,2,0,lallysingh,,,"A query string, by itself, is just a few words in a specific order.  It doesn't say very much at all.  A machine has very little idea of what you're asking for.  The more context it has for what you're talking about, the better chance it has at guessing what you meant -- that's all it can do, it'll never actually know.<p>Google's often guessing wrong now -- how many times is the link you want not the top one?  How often do you have to change your query?  It's all a guessing game, because the situations where there's an obvious right answer (like exact phrases) doesn't give satisfactory results.  Moreover, interpreting queries for those situations can often (even usually) give sub-optimal results, as the computer's taking the query too literally.<p>As for programming queries, my email's actually pretty useful.  I'm subscribed to a few mailing lists, and it'd be nice to not get Perl or Win32 results when I'm mostly in C and Linux.  A trivial scan of my email headers would say as much.<p>For other interests, my youtube play list indicates a lot of what I mean.  I like cats, and I watch them on youtube.  When I type in jaguar, I'm actually probably asking about the cat, not the car.  Lots of other people are asking about the car.  It's particularly obvious if they were watching a review of a car recently, and not watching cat videos.<p>And as for your friends, how about the people you follow?  If I'm following really good programmers, and I type in a programming-related query, I'd rather get results biased toward what really good programmers like, versus the unbiased average.  Even for my friends, I actually respect some of their opinions (gasp!).  If they've +1'd something in the realm of what I'm looking for, it's probably worth considering.",1327546767.0

Organizations will sometimes use their B-corp or not-for-profit status as an excuse to provide poor value to their customers or for overall bad management.<p>Case-in-point: REI. Though they're a co-operative, they don't behave at all like one. They don't have a straightforward product pricing policy (co-operatives shouldn't have ""sales""). They don't hold free and fair elections to their board of directors (candidates for election must be approved by those currently in charge). They altogether fail to serve as an example of how a co-operative should behave (this is obvious when you compare them, and their prices, to their Canadian counterpart MEC).",1327546736.0

Ben and Jerry said that has this sort of corporation existed they would not have sold Ben and Jerry's. But, it does not mean that it's a fit for all companies. The start-up that I am working on now is not a benefit corporation and we probably will not become one. Not because we do not want to take into account the aspects of a triple bottom line, but rather because at this point it's not something at the core of what we are doing.<p>Overall, I think it's at least a good option for those that would like to focus on a triple bottom line.

Without knowing the OTP I use, you will not decipher the message.<p>And by using another portion of the OTP as a unique, one-time salt for a hashing function (I don't care which hashing function), I am preventing a man in the middle from twiddling bits undetected.<p>If you want to tell me that I'm wrong - that's great.  If you want to explain why I'm wrong, that would actually be useful.<p>...and Quantum Cryptography boils down to being a fancy way to generate a OTP.  Your argument then becomes, ""All of the researchers working on Quantum Cryptography are idiots, and they should know better.""  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.  If your claim is that they can't build a physically secure system, because you can't trust a quantum-entagled particle pair to really arrive at both ends uncorrupted, that's one thing.  No, your claim is that the underlying math behind OTP is inherently flawed.  Message XOR OTP is not secure, even if the man in the middle does not know the OTP.<p>From the definition on Wikipedia, ""A MAC algorithm, sometimes called a keyed (cryptographic) hash function, accepts as input a secret key and an arbitrary-length message to be authenticated, and outputs a MAC (sometimes known as a tag). The MAC value protects both a message's data integrity as well as its authenticity, by allowing verifiers (who also possess the secret key) to detect any changes to the message content.""<p>The secret key is a sequence of bytes from my OTP.  They have never been used before, and they will never be used again.<p>""While MAC functions are similar to cryptographic hash functions, they possess different security requirements. To be considered secure, a MAC function must resist existential forgery under chosen-plaintext attacks. This means that even if an attacker has access to an oracle which possesses the secret key and generates MACs for messages of the attacker's choosing, the attacker cannot guess the MAC for other messages without performing infeasible amounts of computation.""<p>They cannot guess the MAC for other messages, because they cannot guess the key for other messages, because they do not know the OTP for other messages, because I will never reuse any of my OTP, thus making it a ONE Time Pad.<p>""MACs differ from digital signatures as MAC values are both generated and verified using the same secret key. This implies that the sender and receiver of a message must agree on the same key before initiating communications, as is the case with symmetric encryption.""<p>No problem.  That's what my system does.  I tell you what portion of the OTP to use, and you use it.

The central tenet mentioned with concurrency is often that of ""race conditions"" where it cannot be predicted which thread or node will access a resource first. If a task isn't executed in parallel, such as it has to wait for the other to finish before it starts / proceeds, I don't see how it could cause a race condition. Admittedly though, I don't have deep knowledge of how high level code translates to actual CPU instructions so it could be possible, or even likely, that if the processor is switching between tasks in such a way that each line of code, so to speak, that is run is from a different method that concurrency issues would occur even on a single-core processor.

That there's obvious internal disquet about their new direction should be fairly disqueting to you.</i><p>Could you point me to the obvious internal disquiet? Is this in reference to Larry Page's supposed ""ultimatum""? Because I was under the impression that that was a simple expression of his commitment to his vision for the company, misrepresented by a hostile media entity.<p>It seems to me that the bulk of your objection boils down to Google's continued and expanding collection of personal data, and an impending but vaguely characterized misuse of that data.<p>> <i>That's part of the problem, I don't think anyone does really. We're in uncharted territory and part of the reason it's so tricky is so much can be inferred about you from seemingly innocuous data, or from analysing your social graph.</i><p>I generally find warnings about vague, ill-defined threats to be unconvincing.<p>> <i>Once they have the data and it's been mined for further meaning, it's inevitable they'll find new uses for it.</i><p>This does not seem at all self-evident to me.<p>In fact, it seems to me that Google's incentives are such that it's pretty much in their interest to use the data well. They have no incentive to sell it, since it allows them to target search results and ads better. And they have every incentive to keep their users' trust. And as far as I can tell, they've taken the issue pretty seriously. The Google Buzz disclosure incident is the only accidental exposure of information I can remember, and they handled it pretty well.",1327543248.0
