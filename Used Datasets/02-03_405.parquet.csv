First 8 bytes of said C++ object is a pointer to the vtable, which resides in __TEXT of some kernel extension. Since I can calculate the unslid address from userland without any issue, by subtracting what gets leaked with what gets calculated you get to know the kASLR slide.<p>Just to clarify: The code execution part has 100% reliability rate. The kASLR leaking part does have some chance in it, however empirical evidence indicates that the failure rate is extremely low.",1439691708.0
