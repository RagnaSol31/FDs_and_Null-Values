1,4742062,story,,,3,2,the_bear,Ask HN: Has anyone noticed a dramatic decrease in Amazon affiliate revenue?,,"I help my mom run a cooking blog, and most of our revenue comes from linking to products using the Amazon affiliate program. Over the last month, our revenue from Amazon has dropped significantly (almost an order of magnitude). Nothing else about the blog has changed, including our traffic.<p>Has anyone else noticed this? I supposed that it's possible that people don't buy very much this time of year in anticipation of the holidays. If it's happening to other people, then maybe it makes sense to wait until the real shopping season starts before reacting.<p>Any insight is appreciated.",1352084330.0

9,4742054,comment,4740540.0,4740540.0,69,0,ForrestN,,,"This, as any would be, is certainly a valid way to respond to a brush with death. But implying that this is somehow a lesson to be learned by everyone, suggesting that others should live their life this way, seems misguided to me in context.<p>Contemplating your mortality shouldn't necessarily convince you to double down on your current priorities (especially if those priorities are centered around banal platitudes like ""doing something remarkable with your life,"" which are probably masks to keep you from thinking about what really motivates you.) It should cause you to reevaluate them.<p>The fact that you will die, the fact that everyone you know will die, and the fact that eventually the universe might become a field of equidistant neutrinos means that it really, really doesn't matter what you accomplish. All roads, if you stay on them long enough, lead to the same place. There will be no progress. There will be no one remarking.<p>I would say that the lesson to be learned from thinking about death is just that there's no reason to adhere to anyone else's values, or to feel pressure to do anything in particular. You should do what you want, what makes you happy, even if it's humble.<p>Existential steps backward can be a tool to remove yourself from things that aren't really helpful, like for example a hyper-competitive capitalist rat-race justified by language like ""fight the status quo"" or ""great visions of the future"" that, instead of contributing to humanity, is mostly really about love, insecurity, and fear of death (like so many human pursuits).<p>""Fighting"" here, the battle between the heroic pursuit of accomplishment on the one hand and the ""insidious machine called quo"" on the other, is just the author reporting his own conflicts about what he wants to do. Part of him wants to expend massive amounts of energy attempting to out-compete the people he sees as his peers. But another part of him doesn't want to do that, which is why he loses motivation and doesn't always end up behaving the way a hero-CEO might. There is not some kind of evil, inherent inertia at work that all people must fight against. Instead, there is only ambivalence and subconscious motives.<p>In my opinion, if you really internalize death and it's implications, the notion that you can justify prescribing ways of thinking or behaving just starts to look absurd.",1352084024.0

17,4742046,comment,4740797.0,4741970.0,9,0,drumdance,,,"I think ""racism"" is a really toxic word. Just hearing the word, I think of Klan rallies, Bull Connor with firehoses, lynch mobs etc. So when somebody accuses some one else of racism, it seems ridiculous because no sane person alive supports those things. And if you are called a racist, it's natural to get defensive.<p>The words ""prejudice"" and ""bias,"" however, are not nearly as emotionally charged, and it's possible to interrogate the situation more rationally.<p>He gives the example of Arrington not knowing any black entrepreneurs. I highly doubt it's because he's a member of the KKK. However, it's extremely possible that he has unconscious biases that make it less likely he will meet or remember black entrepreneurs.<p>If you accept that hypothesis for a moment, you can start brainstorming solutions. But if you just say he's a racist, the only solution is to stop hating people of color. What?!",1352083765.0

There's no reason to claim he was obviously highly intelligent (and therefore IQ is meaningless). He had many gifts, a .1% intellect wasn't one of them. This doesn't take away from his accomplishments nor the impact he's had on society.

The Amiga computer ran a full-featured multi-task OS on 512kb of RAM in 1984, and my Windows 7 is still struggling with 4gb on RAM on the board as it constantly writes temporary files on the Disk. Technology is amazing but somehow, our OSes are not ""so"" amazing. And let's not forget Windows XP and its tendency to turn the MBR into crap over time, making it slower and slower as time goes. Linux is a better OS in all these aspects, but there's still room for improvement.<p>I would say we need a lot of power even for entry-level computers because our software is incredibly bloated in the first place, and not written towards efficiency.

I understand the inherent risks of storing anything you want to remain private on a smart phone but without a microSD card, it feels like the when I inevitably brick my phone somehow, there's no easy way to get the files I want to keep private off the phone. What would be the options to ensure that either 1) the shop/company that does a warranty repair doesn't just data mine the phone once they fix it or 2) that the memory is properly destroyed if the phone cannot be fixed? It also feels like if there was an issue, like an update of Android going awry somehow, that you would lose all your data if you just needed to do a factory reset. I understand that it's all about the cloud now but even then it seems like there would be some corner cases where it would be invaluable to have a removable piece of storage in there even without considering privacy an issue.",1352083684.0
