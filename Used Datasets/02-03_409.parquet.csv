How about you go first.<p>Since the tech industry understands copyright so much better than everyone else it might be good for them to set an example and show all the 'old' dodo-like industries how it's done.<p>After ten years all code should be made open-source. Google has made plenty of money - and I think it's time that they release their algorithm so other innovative and disruptive companies can make better use of it. I mean, how many Google bikes can one ride behind?<p>Fogcreek has had a nice run too - surely some open-sourced FogBugz would be of great value in second and third world countries that have emergent tech sectors but can't possibly afford the cost of the real service? Certainly, even 10-year-old Fogbugz is going to help society a lot more than license-free copies of My Big Fat Greek Wedding [2002] or Stuart Little 2 [2002].<p>Anyway, since many of these places exchange rates means they could never purchase software in the first place, it's not like there would be any lost sales, right?<p>Oh another thing: very important:: a short term of copyright like a few years would be the biggest boon to Hollywood ever as they could simply sit and wait for works to drop into the public domain before turning around and producing them without paying the creators a penny. There would be tons of creators strung along via a studio option - just long enough till the work dropped into the public domain. It would harder than ever for individuals to profit from their creative work and easier than ever for Hollywood to make money off of it.<p>So - sorry to say - I'm a bit disappointed! But that's just my fault - assuming that people who knew so well the cure for the ills of the content industry would actually have an idea about how that world works. My bad.",1327201137

I hope that the message I'm attempting to convey is meaningful to the ""Kill Hollywood"" crowd on HN as well...<p>There are a lot of comments on this post, but I'm going to attempt to chime in from the EVIL Hollywood perspective.<p>First, let me make it known that I am 100% anti-SOPA/PIPA (I called my representatives six times), but the armchair punditry and belligerent ""Kill Hollywood"" explosion I've witnessed over the last few days has infuriated me to no end. When I left Paramount to do a software startup, at least I knew what the hell I was taking about.<p>Regarding Nat Torkington's rant: It's true that the tech industry ""gave"" us many things, HOWEVER, MP3's are meaningless without audio content, MP4 is meaningless without video content, Netflix is meaningless without movie content, iTunes is meaningless without music content... you get the point. In fact, between bittorrent and Netflix, it appears that half of the Internet (if not more) is used to share CONTENT. So yes, thank you for the pipes, but for the love of all that's holy, try and keep in mind what people are ACTUALLY paying for here! Hint: it's not 3G, wifi, iPads, or iPhones, those are merely the vessels to what is actually valuable to the user: the content! What do you think is the driving force behind the evolution of technology? Sheesh! I'm asking that all of you engineers take a breather and try to gain some damn perspective.<p>Yes, the film industry's organizational structure appears to be outdated. Yes, the theatrical distribution model seems counterintuitive. Yes, yes, yes! But... Record revenues (or close to it) continue year after year. Revenue from theaters still represents $30 billion of the ~$90 billion dollars the industry rakes in each year. Growth in China is almost 40% annually. The film industry isn't exactly in a hurry to abandon the scarcity model.<p>Bottom line, there are a lot of elements at play here. Please, please, please get some perspective before you go off extolling the virtues of your newest ""platform."" There are ways to disrupt Hollywood, both in a Schumpeterian way, and in a collaborative way, but I have yet to see anything that truly encapsulates the content industry's needs in a meaningful way.<p>Thanks for listening to my rant!<p>P.S.Crowd funding is to killing Hollywood, as Kickstarter is to killing Apple.",1327200805

11,3495447,comment,3491542.0,3491542.0,1,0,sroussey,,,"Such BULLSHIT.<p>This is a meme that comes up every few years like clockwork. Unfortunately, this one, like others before it, just shows how little people know about Hollywood. I guess it doesn't matter, as it makes for great link-bait. So maybe they know more than they let on, but dumb it down to ""mean"" people and ""dying"" industry. Yet, if that were the case, no one would want to take it over. The industry is, however, closer to a zero sum game than not. Offers to be a ""partner"" are offers to ""take"" some of the revenue.<p>There are two ""modes"" of entertainment (I am not counting learning or socializing, which are separate): ""games"" and ""story-telling"". I've pitched ideas on a cross-over between the two (over ten years ago), but really the two are very different, right down to how the brain behaves in each mode. Music is interesting because it doesn't take our full attention -- it would interesting to see other entertainment that had that same quality.<p>But anyhow, that doesn't mean that there aren't opportunities in the space, or opportunities for other ways to spend our time.<p>Take music, for example. Drive a brand that curates indie music, and let people invest in the bands (real money), drive that band to their friends, and eventually take a token of their success some day (a 360 deal, not just records, but everything including merchandizing, live performances, etc -- that way each band can determine the best mix, which may be all album sales or free music distribution). Early fans have skin in the game, bands that pick up fans get money to accelerate their reach, and everyone can have fun in the process since they are all partners.<p>And as far as time, think of teenagers and college students (and 20 somethings), hormonally driven to socialize. It was a huge catalyst for AOL (chat rooms), Friendster/MySpace/HotOrNot/Facebook, etc. Later in life there are children, and the need for everything to be all about them, understand them, get away from them. But competition for time is such an open thing, that it seems out of scope unless it is a form of entertainment, even if it is entertaining, like sex.<p>It would be nice to get people to vote on movie selections so a theatre could get it and show it knowing that there is an audience. I'd love to see ""Go!"" again. There is a business idea for you.<p>So instead of ""killing Hollywood"", I'm going to see Rocky Horror Picture Show in PacHeights next weekend. It is not an iSomething, it is not virtual, it means real warm bodies and a preset schedule. See ya there!",1327200559

26,3495432,comment,3494224.0,3494224.0,11,0,wisty,,,"A similar thing has already been shown by Steve Keen. First, he shows that if firms optimize by attempting to set the <i>total</i> derivative of profits to zero, they behave like monopolies. Second, he uses a simple model in which firms randomly raise or lower prices, then revert if they lost money, and shows they converge to behaving like monopolies.<p>He also points out that many fundamental economic principles are flawed, and have been proven to be flawed for years, but economists lack rigor, and would rather live in their ""supply meets demand, actors are rational, and the market is in equilibrium"" fantasy-land.<p>Oh, and in about 2006, he warned that there'd be a recession caused by a debt-deflation, just like in 1929. He warned that the government would continually underestimate its impact. He also thinks that the best way to ""reset"" the system is with a ""modern jubilee"" - the government engage in massive quantitative easing (which they won't, because they don't realise what's causing the crisis, and how bad it is), and should hand out the free money to tax-payers rather than giving it to banks, as the banks have lost their appetite for risk and won't create new money even if you feed them.<p>But mainstream economists only study basic calculus, linear algebra, and statistics, not ODEs, and don't believe anything they don't understand. A 50 year old professor (or central banker) isn't going to go back to school and sit in a class with sophomore engineers, just to be able to understand what ""complexity theorists"" and ""econophysists"" are talking about, so they just pretend that it doesn't exist. There's no conspiracy, they just don't read or teach anything more mathematically advanced than IS-LM (which is stone age). Their journals don't accept non-mainstream papers for ""methodological reasons"" (they don't understand basic differential equations), or because it ""doesn't sit well with the current theory"" (it proves them wrong) and since there's tens of thousands of them they tend to dominate the field.",1327199901

50,3495408,comment,3491227.0,3493802.0,2,0,6ren,,,"You may be right about queries.<p>Though, queries are distinct from relations. They are a database concept, existing before Codd's relations and also present in NoSQL etc.<p>I was thinking of the relational concepts that SQL builds on.  A way to separate these concepts is to do the query in two stages: (1) a relational transformation over the  database that denormalises it (joining lists) into a list containing your answer; (2) a query to extract that answer. (These two stages are usually redundant; it's just a way to think about it, not how to write the query, nor for a DB to implement it.)<p>In a sense, the nesting of REST APIs means they are heavily <i>de</i>-normalised: to access some data, you have to start at the top and work your way down that ""path"".  They sometimes have multiple paths to the same data, each one representing a different denormalisation.  The reason this is not ""relational"" is because you can only use pre-existing paths; you can't make up your own as needed.<p>It's only in a narrow sense that REST APIs are normalised, in that you can only return one list, with no joins in it.<p>Looking at WCF Data Services <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCF_Data_Services"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCF_Data_Services</a>, those examples aren't (necessarily) relational, just queries, in that there is no transformation, just selection of a sublist. It's not fair to judge it on one example though. I found another eg <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd728279.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd728279.aspx</a> it's analogous. Maybe I'll read the specs in detail later. :-)<p>BTW: A query returns a subset of the database. It seems sensible to return only the subset needed. But there's an odd trade-off in REST: caching more than a specific query needs is more likely to be useful for the next query (in effect, it distributes the database over network caches). Bandwidth is plentiful, so let's return 10KB instead of 10 bytes. But latency is a problem (IMHO); presently, we need several requests to get the data we want.<p>I just had an idea: a rich REST API query language (as you say), and <i>also</i> have a client-side query language, and a client-side optimisation engine that transforms each query into a form that maximises cache hits. e.g. get much more information than needed, if it happens to be cached nearby. It is like the query optimisations that databases presently use, but on the client, on the other side of the expensive network.<p>You could also over-request, to populate the cache for future queries (your own and from other users). This might need a lot of tuning, based on actual usage patterns between users. Existing web-caching experience might guide this.<p>Finally: at the moment, I think it's clearly true that different ways of accessing the same data are not that important. Perhaps they'll never be, for web-data that is always used in the same way. The ""enterprise"" needed relations because they have heaps of apps using centralised data in different ways (manufacturing, inventory, sales, analysis, etc). However, as the enterprise moves into the cloud, and as developers start to construct services out of services (with much deeper integration than a simple mash-up; more like using remote libraries), this will become extremely important to <i>some</i> users.<p>whoa, long post.  just trying to get my thoughts in order. hope it's of some use.",1327199095
