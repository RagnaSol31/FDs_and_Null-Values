31,4420644,comment,4417125.0,4418096.0,1,0,super_mario,,,"Occam's razor was never meant to prove anything. It is a principle of economy of assumptions or hypothesis. In essence it says don't assume more than you have to explain certain phenomena. This is what I mean. We now have a good idea how universe itself can come from nothing, we don't need the god hypothesis to explain that one last ultimate question (why is there something rather than nothing. There is something because something is more stable than nothing). Our ancestors certainly didn't have that knowledge and for them god seemed necessary to ""explain"" this. Even though such god did not really explain anything, it just shifted the question further to where did god come from. Did he spontaneously come from nothing? Did he always exist? And why can't we just forgo such hypothesis (this is where Occam's economy principle comes in) and just assume universe itself either always existed or come into being from nothing (which is what current physical theory suggests). Why posit an intelligent being capable of creating universes, which raises more questions about where did this intelligence itself come from, rather than assume the same thing about the dumb matter (i.e. universe) itself.<p>I hope this clarifies what I meant above.<p>This whole argument is shortened into ""deistic god can neither be proved nor disproved, but we no longer need him to kick off the universe for us. We now know how that too can happen without god"".<p>However, I have nothing against deistic god. People who want to believe in deistic god will not receive any objection from me. I'm primarily gnostic (I know there is no theistic god) anti-theist (I don't think religion is a force for good in the world). Religion is not about deistic god. Religion is about people who not only know there is a god, with certainty, but they know his mind, what he wants us to do. It is this argument from certainty (which all arguments from faith are), that can easily be disproved. Note that I have not actually offered proof in my posts, the time and space and the forum itself are not the right places to do this. But I can recommend a lot of literature on this subject that go into great depth if you care to look at the evidence we do have.",1345689904.0

I understand that seeing a graph up and to the right on every single slide, 74 times in a row, might get a little repetitive. That said, you're also getting pitched by 74 companies who actually have graphs that are up and to the right. You're being pitched by companies who have been focusing on nothing but acquiring users, talking to users, learning from users, and building in parallel. Many of us took money from those users. By making sure we realized graphs that go up and to the right would be a standard on which we were judged, we were all essentially ""tricked"" into doing something that SHOULD be obvious for any entrepreneur, which is doing nothing but talking to users, building a product users like, signing users up, and ultimately charging users (this isn't always something to focus on from day one depending on the product). Everyone else is going to have a graph that goes up and to the right? Shit, I better as well! What I'm trying to say is, being pitched by companies who are already doing this well in such a short amount of time should be a good thing.<p>While 2:15 is most definitely short, it also gets you thinking about the 2 - 3 things that you want potential investors to remember about you. How can we be most effective in the least amount of time? It's an amazing exercise and it's very helpful for pitching in the future.<p>After pitching, the investors who really love your vision or idea let you know they are interested, and you have plenty of time to tell them more, show them your product, etc.",1345689547.0

When I'm programming, I don't start with the import statements (except for maybe some common ones that I have to deal with).

Imports usually come organically, if I'm having to deal with them at all (IDE's usually take care of them).<p>I think a great place for this to go would be if the code bounced around a bit more. Perhaps, start with what seems like the most commonly used function and write that function header and whole function; then, start writing all of the different subordinate methods you called in this primary method, and so on until the whole class is created.

It's much easier to start charging a customer once they are locked in and familiar with the software. Maybe a ""first year is on us then it's paid"" model is a good compromise between freemium and paid software, with the option to upgrade sooner if you want support and/or some advanced features.",1345687439.0

So okay, port to Metro, you think! Well, you can't use the Win32 API <i>at all</i> in Metro apps. It's simply not available. Instead, you have to use the Win32 replacement, WinRT, which is a somewhat-crippled version of Win32 (want to load a dynamic library at runtime? too bad! static libraries or bust!) which is very different from Win32 in terms of API design.<p>I can't see Win8 being a serious contender in the tablet space anytime soon. I get the impression that Metro and ARM are being used as an excuse to push WinRT because various groups at Microsoft don't like Win32, but the sudden total lack of applications or backwards compatibility is going to hurt them a <i>lot</i>.",1345687273.0

Add your own authorization rules (Alice is a close friend).<p>It might be a benefit to set it up as follows: everyone has a personal cert. They generate and sign a proxy cert for their tent server.
