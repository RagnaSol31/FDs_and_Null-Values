I learned more in each of those 4 month co-op terms than each of my school terms.  Additionally, from all my interviewing experience (i.e. interviewing for full time hire's), those that come from a co-op program (any co-op program, even UofT's) are way better prepared and have much more practical knowledge.<p>This is a core reason why we still recruit heavily in Waterloo, for both co-op's and full-times.

Additionally (and I could be wrong here as I don't know where to find the data), I suspect that that affirmative action is never responsible for a white/asian guy with a 3.5 GPA getting passed over for a black/hispanic guy with a 2.6 (all else equal). A more fair question would be:<p>""Why does a white/asian guy with a 1250 SAT have a lower future potential than a black/hispanic guy with a 1225 SAT (all else held equal)?""<p>...which is easier to answer. There is a marked difference in SAT scores among races, and a lot of debate about the cause amongst people who know a lot more about this stuff then myself (and given the wording of your comment, I expect yourself as well). At the very least, it's reasonable to suspect that there may be some racial bias in the wording of SAT questions.<p>Obviously, the issue of unequal opportunity amongst races is huge and complex, and I don't pretend to know how affective affirmative action is at addressing it. What I do know, though, is that it's not as cut-and-dry as you seem to be implying.",1326077809.0

You go through the same interview process and you can get fired just like any other employee. This is no different than hiring any other employee.<p>> Long terms lead to more conservative hiring, leading to less placements overall.<p>I would argue that less higher-quality placement is a Good Thing.<p>> From the student side, ...<p>As a student, your goal is to start building your value and getting proportionally compensated as quickly as possible. Since most value as an engineer is gained well after the first few months of ramp-up you experience at every new job, you end up getting very minimal value out of a bunch of 4 month terms. Not to mention you won't be getting paid nearly as well as someone who is not labelled as a ""student"".<p>18 months is marginally better because you're actually growing your skillset, integrate as an important and dependable part of the team, and gain valuable engineering experience. On the other hand, you're still under-compensated and it's trickier to switch jobs half way through if you realize that you've made a mistake.<p>Finally, my argument is that the most optimal path is skip coop/PEY and find a relevant job right out of school. Even if it's not the best job in the world. You'll be far better off sticking around for 12-18 months, quitting, and getting a second real job, than to do 18 months of PEY and getting your first real job. Both in terms of real valuable experience and compensation.<p>When big companies look at your ""industry experience"", the counter doesn't start until you're no longer a student. I've been building and selling software since I was 14, but none of that went into account with HR of big companies when they were deriving the offer for my salary or position. Negotiation and positioning, on the other hand, did make a big difference. But that's another story.<p>The best value for coop/PEY/internships is to students who lack confidence or experience in finding a job right out of school, or they simply have no idea what they want to do when they grow up or want to drag out their student status for as long as they can. These are all very valid reasons.",1326076901.0

""don_chow"" talks about how oppressive the Chinese government. The comments then go into how Congress is attempting to restrict the American people, when it is the opposite. We are restricting ourselves.<p>I cannot speak on a case by case, but it's hard to argue against the idea that most Americans do not vote. We turn on the TV to CNN, Fox, MSNBC, or whatever you chose. We hear people debate on an issue with the majority in the small debate arguing in your viewpoint. All people do after that is yell at the TV saying ""YHA!"" then go to bed. We do not take action.<p>We let the law makers do their job, but when they don't do something we agree with we talk about how bad they are. Then the next big story comes the following week and we are then talking about that. We don't take a stand and speak with what law makers truly care about, our vote.<p>Law makers create these laws to get lobbiest dollars so that they can run for reelection. However, they wouldn't do these kinds of things if they knew that they won't get that end result, the vote which in turn gives a reelection. If they knew that the electorate within their district or state would put in the effort to research representative/senators then Congress wouldn't try to pass something like this.<p>The unfortunate truth is that our representative/senators are right. They know that we take little to know action. SOPA is an extremely rare case where the American people actually get up and get involved in government. I agree that SOPA must be stopped, but I also believe that SOPA would not even be here if the American people did their job in the first place and got involved. We can send our men and women around the world to let other nations have the right to vote, yet we can't walk across the street to do it ourselves.<p>The ironic thing is, the majority of people who do agree with what I say will say ""YHA!"" and continue surfing the web.

Where in the country can also have an effect, with Guangdong/Shenzhen/Shanghai (and sometimes Beijing) being the most open. In rural areas and 'political sensitive' there is significant disruption to non-officially sanctioned sites. Which local access provider has an impact too, along with what part of the national intranet you are using (this also links to location, but literally your results may vary depending on provider). The computer you are using, if local, may have software (pre- or unknowingly installed) which blocks or hinders sites or searches, and if you bring a laptop with you, these level can be overcome. Political issues and party campaigns can have significant short-term impacts on particular sites and their availability, this includes locally sanctioned or owned sites.<p>Most importantly, when in China you may only check a few times on gmail, fb, whatever sites and they may work from those locations or at those times you try.

One area not given much voice is China's desire to handle legal issues in its domain.  If you want a web site in China, you have to have a person (usually through a company) that is the agent responsible for the site.  This person must be a Chinese national.  That person is the one that has to show up in court if the site/company gets sued.  If China is serious about nurturing its legal system, its a perfectly valid approach that parties conducting business in China be required to answer to the legal system when required.  This means that if Facebook wants to serve up to Chinese people, they need a Chinese company and agree to be subject to Chinese law for what they serve up in China.  Many may not agree with the restrictions on what you can serve up, but this is a different aspect of the GWF.",1326074502.0

They're just not very good. Also, none of them will have brand names you'll have ever heard of, or they'll have the logo of some telco on them.<p>The cheapest phones by LG and Samsung cost $120, the LG Optimus P350 and the Samsung Galaxy I5500 (both SIM lock free, unsubsidized).",1326074489.0

I know of one large Japanese bank that completed all transactions on paper (they would process it electronically then print it out and hand verify the details) until a few years ago. Think of a vast network of vacuum tubes launching paper around a building storing billions of records. That was their head office.,1326074471.0
