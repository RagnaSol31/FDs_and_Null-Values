From a marketing or political (business, no government politics), Apple could blame Microsoft for iCloud failing, regardless of the truth, to a point.<p>To put it another way, I frequently tell people ""Businesses choose Java because if it fails, it isn't because they choose Java."" This means that if the Director of IT says to build with the industry standard of Java (or .Net), it is not the Directors fault if/when the project fails. The project manager, the developers, QA, middle management, etc failed to do it correctly. It is a safe choice since it is industry standard and thus well proven. If it takes longer and costs more, it means it was a much more difficult problem then they expected, but since they used Java they got it working.<p>If on the other hand, they went with Rails/Django/Node.js/Erlang/NoSQL/etc, and it fails, the Director chose to use ""new and untested"" technologies, he/she is the root cause. Regardless of the fact that it could just be that realistic goals/management were never used.<p>I am not trying to say Azure is industry standard or the safe choice, but the way to shift blame is the same.",1308106689.0

I believe it was on Atom ""Films"", and I seem to recall it being sponsored by Absolut Vodka. Had a quirky, upbeat instrumental theme. Storyline was that a guy saw a coin, went to pick it up, and died. He gets to the office where they process people to determine where they are going to go, and is told he is a bit short of points. We then see a calamity happen that upsets things in the office, and our protagonist gets back to Earth where he tries to make up the missing number of points. This includes saying good bye to his girlfriend in her sleep, getting a smoothie, doing some dancing, and just as he is about to be dragged off again, flipping the coin he picked up to land in a beggar's cup. We then see he has earned enough points, and as the doors open to put him in to be processed again, they close, and he is whisked off to his reward.<p>With all that information, WHY can't I find the title of this video? Of course the answer is that the key words for this search are too common. Still, if I can give the synopsis, why can't Google (or someone else), compare that to storylines of videos that were published originally on the web, and give me a short list for me to wade through and/or watch?<p>If such a thing exists, feel free to point it out to me!",1308105518.0

The key problem is that we're not prepared to preserve biological diversity.<p>We're placing our ecosystems under extreme pressure, severely compromising them, sometimes depleting their resources so they will take hundreds or even thousands of years to recover. This results in mass extinctions and near-extinctions (which can be very damaging through genetic bottlenecks, aka inbreeding). For most species, we currently have no adequate technology to preserve single individuals, let alone entire populations, outside their original habitat.<p>Why does this matter? Because biological diversity is critical to our long-term success in bioengieering, and mind-bogglingly hard to replenish in an accelerated way. We will be able to preserve and resurrect species much sooner than we will be able to mutate them in a natural way to preserve their intraspecies diversity. But so far we can't even do that, so we're losing entire genotypes forever - genotypes that we have no idea how to reconstruct, or what hidden treasures lay in their genomes.<p>And this is just the biggest problem, not taking into account the philosophical preservationist argument, or the smaller problems like increased risk of global conflicts due to mass displacements, ocean acidification, etc.",1308104672.0

I'm sure PR people have tons of nice ways of framing what it is that Exxon is doing (I mean, why shouldn't ExxonMobil have the right to advocate for its own interests, right?) FUD is less effective if it's obvious, and it's in every anti-CO2-regulation think-tank's interest to appear as objective as possible, and make it look they're reasonable people who just might have come down on the other side, but, goshdarnit, they just came to a different conclusion because that was the best one any objective rational observer could come to.

119,2655667,story,,,7,4,mattpardee,How do you cope with the effects of working remotely?,,"I work as a programmer on a team of about 15 people, most of them based in Amsterdam. I'm the only US-based developer, living in southern CA, which means to be on their schedule I start work at midnight and stop at 9 AM. While there are other members of the team not in Amsterdam, they are only one or two hours ahead of Central European Time.<p>I have only worked there for 6 months, so being on their schedule is very important. We have daily standups, communicate via Skype throughout the workday, and will be pair programming more often. Ideally I would be working in their office, but since this isn't a possibility for me personally, I try to work in lockstep with the rest of the team. Originally I thought a night schedule would work out brilliantly, since I am a natural night owl. I was wrong. It's one thing to be in the zone, working on a project until 6 AM and then crashing. Trying to consistently fall asleep during the afternoon, stay asleep until midnight, and then work 9 hours, is a very difficult thing to do.<p>My sleep schedule has become increasingly erratic; every week I experience at least one or two days where I stay up for an exceptionally long period of time - sometimes 28 hours. This is not by choice but because I simply cannot fall asleep during the day. Other days I will take a 3 hour nap and then be wide awake. I at least appreciate the times I can sleep, so I take advantage of them. I've tried numerous times to stay awake longer so I can get back on track. This doesn't work; often, I will sleep for only 3-4 hours after these 28-hour periods and my mind will be racing. Once I'm awake it's nearly impossible to get back to sleep. My job is not stressful, so the mind racing is less of an inherent problem, but something I view as part of my personality. I don't grit my teeth and I'm not an explosive person, I'm very laid-back.<p>About a month ago I quit smoking and drinking coffee, something I'm proud of and has resulted in a more even-keeled energy level (e.g. no crashing), and my increased exercise - about 5 days a week now - has boosted my energy level. My girlfriend works as a night nurse, and tries to stay quiet when she gets up at 4 PM to get ready for work from 7PM - 7AM. Our dog usually sabotages her efforts by barking at loud children playing in the street and neighbors walking their dogs after work. Sometimes this is the reason I wake up, other times I just have to go to the bathroom and then I can't fall back asleep. Getting the dog better trained is an obvious course of action, something I'm planning on looking into seriously in the coming weeks.<p>Our bedroom has blackout curtains, I use ear plugs, and recently I've been doing breathing exercises and some meditation to calm my mind. The lack of a consistent sleep schedule makes all of these efforts feel like I'm trying to put out a forest fire with a garden hose. I have taken Tylenol PMs before, which did nothing for me, but I did recently get prescribed Ambien which may help to reset me every once in a while. I don't want to get addicted.<p>In short: I love the craft of programming and this is a dream job, I wouldn't trade it for any other job in the world. But the effects of working remotely, on a different time schedule, is eating away at my ability to perform at my peak on a daily basis. It's frustrating at best, and at worse results in mental breakdowns.<p>So I ask, what are your best strategies for being effective at your job while working remotely? How do you cope with a backwards sleep schedule? Do you have any resources I can digest that will inform me on either of these fronts? In addition to attacking this problem on a personal level, I'm very open to learning about general remote-working strategies at the company level. Thank you for any help you can provide!",1308103242.0

This means that redeeming 10 Groupons or redeeming 1000 Groupons makes no difference to us. We upload the codes from the CSV Groupon sends us and that's it, from there on, our only interaction with customers is through our site.<p>Our breakage is about 30% and this seems to be the number no matter which daily deal site we've been with. Even when giving up 50% of the coupon price, we still profit. That's the nature of our business - most aren't like us.<p>So with those facts out of the way, here's what we've learned:<p>1) Coupon customers are generally ""meaner"" and feel they're entitled to more than others\n2) You can (and should) negotiate hard with the deal sites. We started out doing the 50/50 share, but learned quickly and now get as much as 82% of the sale.\n3) Up-sell hard to these customers, if you can. Again, our business is all online so we offer e-books add-ons, we offer different books to add, we offer a better product (hard cover) that customers can ""upgrade"" to.\n4) We have about 10% repeat customers and about 30% buy something more than what their coupon entitled them to.<p>Businesses who view Groupon et. al as profit drivers are misguided. Is that Groupon's fault and should they do more to educate customers? That's another thread of discussion. If businesses view daily deal sites as simply another marketing expense and have the capacity to track customers and upsell accordingly, then maybe the cost of acquisition is worth it. For us it is, for some companies by the sounds of it, it isn't.<p>tldr; For some companies, Groupon is good and their model drives value for the merchant. For other (most?) companies, it isn't.",1308103238.0

Same with sleep. Are you getting any better at breathing (actually, you would if you exercised).<p>I'm not suggesting that you should get back on your bike, maybe biking isn't for you. But I strongly believe that you should find a physical activity that you do enjoy. Too many people slog out in a gym as punishment for no reason, don't be one of those. There is enjoyment in physical activity.<p>The worst part of working out is when you feel like you have to do it.<p>A bicycle commute isn't fun, it isn't a game (well, I used to be a bike courier, and I'd play with traffic, so I do enjoy it at times).<p>Hopefully one day you'll find a sport that you enjoy and can't wait to get out and do. Your body and mind will thank you.<p>I'd recommend group activities. I run only occasionally, but joined a group run last week and really enjoyed it, so today I'm looking forward to running with the group.<p>Run, bike, soccer, ultimate frisbee, tai chi, yoga, rock climbing, tennis, squash, handball, etc.etc. keep trying until you find the one that's for you. I suspect if you do, you'll get introduced to many sports that you like.",1308103235.0

For the hardware company, that's easy.  For the service company, that's monetizing your data.  Apple cares more about how you access data, but less about the data itself.  For Google, they don't care how you access your data so long as their algorithms also have access.<p>The Kindle example veers off slightly from Google because people pay for their ebooks.",1308103210.0
