I read it for a Technology Entrepreneurship class and we discussed how Atari's ""Unauthorized Games"" were detrimental to their long term success.<p>Here is a pertinent quote from the paper, as I am unable to find a free version online:<p>""In the mid-1980s, profits for video game makers began to decline; many feared that video games had reached market saturation. Compounding this, the rapid proliferation of unauthorized games (games produced for a console with- out authorization of that console’s producer) lead to a market glut of games of dubious quality, and many unhappy retailers with video game inventories they were unable to move. By 1985, many industry observers were declaring the video game industry dead. Much to everyone’s surprise, however, two new entrants from Japan entered the U.S. video game market: Nintendo, with its 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) introduced in 1985, and Sega, which launched its 8-bit Master System in the U.S. in 1986 (Sega had previously introduced an 8-bit system dubbed SG-1000 in Japan in 1983). Though Sega’s Master System appeared to be technologically superior, Nintendo spent much more on advertising and development of quality games and characters, and had more game titles available than Sega. The Master System went on to sell two million units and at times held an 11% market share. The NES sold over one million units in the first year, sold 19 million units by 1990, and could be found in more than a third of the households in America and Japan. Nintendo’s “Super Mario Brothers 3” grossed over $500 million in America in 1989, selling seven million copies in the U.S. and four million in Japan.""",1269572273.0

This practice was struck down by the courts and made impracticable by the 1995 law.<p>The other use of the term is to refer to unknown patent infringement.  This comes about because software patents are such a joke that nobody knows who exactly owns the patent to what.

I keep explaining this.<p>>Are tomorrow's older folks going to be able to do the same?<p>Sure, if the young keep paying. But as I explained, there is no fact of the matter about <i>which</i> young people are subsidizing <i>which</i> old people. One way of looking at it is that young people are subsidizing their older selves, while the current generation of older people are being subsidized by their earlier payments when they were young. There's money going in and money going out, but when it comes to the question of ""who's subsidizing whom"", it largely depends on how you look at it. It's not as if John Smith's dollar bills are marked so you can see exactly who he's subsidizing.",1269569118.0

Those seriously hurt Nintendo's brand.<p>The worst part of Apple's approval process is that it does very little to improve the quality of the apps.  The crap still gets approved if it satisfies Apple's limited criteria.  It's pretty clear the benefit for the approval is for Apple and not the consumer.,1269569024.0

The significance of this comes into play in a potential lawsuit, because patent enforcement is simultaneously a burden on the patent-holder: if they are aware of a violation, it is their legal duty to enforce the patent, and if they fail in that duty then eventually they lose the right to claim damages from infringement (big oversimplification here).<p>The point being, even if MPEG-LA does have infringing patents, the patent holders can reasonably be expected to have known about it for years, and so if they decided to sue they would have to explain why they didn't enforce their patent in the years that Xiph has been asking them to enforce the patent.<p>Conclusion: all this talk about Theora potentially being in patent-jeopardy is FUD and BS.",1269568982.0
