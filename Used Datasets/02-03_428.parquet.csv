It's just a speaker and a microphone'. Of course, there had already been inroads into making your phone much more than a phone, just as set-top boxes and other connected devices have added capabilities to your television.<p>I don't think we'll see a 'rebirth' of television so much as we'll see television joining mobile, tablets and computers in the middle.<p>Really, the revolution of the phone was making it more like a computer, but more portable. The revolution of the television I suspect will be the same, but less portable.

They have complete power over whether or not your products are approved, and criticizing them will piss them off and ensure that they sit on your application (at a minimum) or start finding various kinds of violations that they can cite you for.<p>That is, unless Mr. Appelsmith feels that the public and/or the press can (a) identify him by name and (b) do not support his actions. This is one of the vanishingly few scenarios in which a civil servant can actually lose their job, so they really hop to it[1].<p>During the whole process while you are waiting for approval you have zero revenue, and so it looks to all the world like you are just a loser and a whiner. In the biotech space this is why a lot of companies nowadays debut in Europe, so that they can say with some justification ""well, we have a legit product but the FDA is holding it up"". And because the threat of zero revenue for an arbitrarily long period of time means you might not make payroll, it's very unusual for someone to fight the power like Mr. Greenspan is doing. And he really could only do it as a one man software company without any employees that he needs to feed.<p>In a less sympathetic sector like oil or pharmaceuticals, or even just a slightly larger company of 100 employees, he loses the sympathy associated with a one man operation. At that point the regulators just go to the press and get them to write a story on what a terrible company this is for practicing without a license. Thereby justifying further regulation.<p>Basically, someone needs to stand up for what is right rather than just retreating. Mr. Greenspan is a pain in the ass in the same way the Don't Touch My Junk guy was. Everyone else tolerates these sorts of step by step encroachments on liberty till there is none left.<p>[1] Though afterwards they will hate FaceCash for all eternity and look to trip it up whenever possible, but Mr. Greenspan has no other cards to play at this point.",1319338034.0

Ratherand this used to sound absurd to me as wellit improved my ability to teach myself.<p>I'm speaking from personal experience here, but I do think college has the same effect on my peers as well. I was a fairly proficient autodidact, teaching myself how to program in everything from C to Clojure, as well as a sizable array of other skills (double-entry accounting, for one).<p>But now I am able to pick up a book on the subject of abstract algebra and really learn the material. I know how to handle tricky political situations, where not all information is present and one party wants to get more out of the other. I have been exposed to people, cultures, and ideas that I would have been unlikely to come across had I dropped out to hack together a startup. I know how to talk to people with power. I am better able to see things from another perspective. I am a better person now, all around. (This paragraph is uncomfortably self-congratulatory, but I'll leave it in for what it's trying to convey.)<p>Sure, college is not for everyone. Some college are better than others, and some are better for specific purposes. But I have improved myself and my skills here, and I don't think I could have done the same had I not gone through college. I'm looking forward to changing the world in a big way.",1319336691.0

It is a minority tradition - like a dissenting opinion in a court case - and has been pretty well drowned out by now. A notable figure in this tradition is the French thinker Simone Weil, who combined intellectual rigor and spiritual depth in a particularly compelling way.<p>It's probably apropos that you posted this in an article about George Dyson, since Dyson's theme is uncovering the origins and recesses of that technical progress, but very much from within the modern view.<p>I love Eliot. His English is exquisite, especially his diction, which is incomparable. Everything he wrote seems to be in a state of timeless balance. This quote turns out to be from a play called The Rock (1934):<p><pre><code>  O perpetual revolution of configured stars,\n  O perpetual recurrence of determined seasons,\n  O world of spring and autumn, birth and dying!\n  The endless cycle of idea and action,\n  Endless invention, endless experiment,\n  Brings knowledge of motion, but not of stillness;\n  Knowledge of speech, but not of silence;\n  Knowledge of words, and ignorance of The Word.\n  All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance,\n  All our ignorance brings us nearer to death,\n  But nearness to death no nearer to God.\n  Where is the Life we have lost in living?\n  Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?\n  Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?\n  The cycles of Heaven in twenty centuries\n  Bring us farther from God and nearer to the Dust. \n</code></pre>\nThat's really something. He's talking about modernity, but in a way that reads like a translation from Sanskrit, with something of the Greek chorus about it as well. Here's someone trying to get perspective on the present through the language of the past. I never thought of that before.",1319336264.0

This applies not only to government officials but to the criminal element as well, from hoodlums to ponzi schemers and everything in between.<p>People like Milner and others associated with Russian oligarchs spend lavishly because the money they have came with no sacrifice on their part. The sacrifice came from all those miners working in subzero temperatures in the Kazakh steppe for kopeks a day, their bodies broken down prematurely, with the share of wealth that was promised to them stolen away.

In your typical ServiceLayer style app, most of the calls are just direct passthroughs to the domain model.<p>Frankly, the controller layer is a sufficient service layer for many complex applications, as it handles different clients and request types. There is often foolishness in putting too much of that logic in a single controller method, but it is wrong to suggest that adding the overhead of the service layer pattern in place of referencing the domain model from the controller fixes this (putting it in lib certainly makes a bit more sense).<p>The example given in the article is a bit of a horror show.  It's probably not a service layer. I am sure a bit is left out, but it's going to convoluted lengths to avoid putting anything in the domain model.  Dynamically extending individual instances of employee to add a pay_date method? Creating a new instance of the service on each request- when it could be done with static methods?<p>Sadly, it doesn't make sense to model your whole domain twice. Let's see what the employee service used to list, add, update, and remove employees is like. Any real system is going to end up with a domain model object to represent a payroll, which is where this logic could go.<p>The root problem is Uncle Bob just doesn't like the ActiveRecord pattern- in which case just use a different ORM.",1319336238.0

I learned the difference between they're/there/their sometime before grade 8, and I generally expect people I converse with to recognize that distinction.<p>As for possessive forms - that's even easier. In most cases, if something belongs to someone, use an apostrophe. If it doesn't, then don't. Okay, it can get confusing, but in most cases, it's not.",1319335248.0

You also assume that these regulators are lax in their enforcement. Make no mistake, the current administration wants to regulate the heck out of everything and everyone...especially in the financial sector.<p>The will to enforce is most certainly there today, and the moment you get a little bit of press (not even necessarily bad press) everyone, including your competitors, will check to see if you have the necessary certificates on file. If not, they will just narc on you to the regulatory authorities...who they are on a first name basis with, as they have known them for years. And if you get bad press, you can't just ride it out. Reporters will strip away all context and ask: ""why is an unlicensed payment processor allowed to do business in the State of California""?<p>Especially when prompted by the press or their friends, regulators can spring into action out of nowhere and levy a host of civil and criminal penalties, up to but not limited to pulling your product from the market and freezing your assets so you can't meet payroll.<p>So, in short, you don't want to screw around with regulators under this administration. They treat businesses a LOT more harshly than college students. Indeed, no less an authority than Peter Thiel himself has commented that it might be impossible to clone Paypal today as the bridge seems to have been pulled up behind them:<p><a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20114584-281/talking-tech-with-peter-thiel-investor-and-philanthropist-q-a/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20114584-281/talking-tech-...</a><p><pre><code>  CNET: I wrote a retrospective piece for CNET recently \n  about how significant the post-9/11 regulatory shift was, \n  especially when it comes to privacy. \n\n  Thiel: It's not exactly clear to me whether Paypal could \n  be built as a business today. That may be too strong.... \n  As a startup, these kinds of regulations are much more \n  onerous. Paypal was able to be built at a time that was \n  pre-9/11 on a regulatory basis. Post-9/11 it would be much \n  more difficult to build. It makes the franchise more \n  valuable. I think no competitors will ever be built.</code></pre>",1319335232.0
