Plus it was hard to organize waves. After it went pseudo-public nothing really new happened to it and old weird problems like the funky scrollbar were never addressed.<p>That being said, I've used it on a number of projects, a couple quite big six-month ordeals, and found it an amazing collaborative environment if you disciplined your team a bit and organized things well at the start of the project.<p>The concept, combining several, different, modes of communication in one environment is pretty sound actually, I just think that the modes were combined a little too singularly. Certain things like real-time chat and document collaboration are fundamentally different things that should have been relegated to different parts of the interface rather than jammed into one place.<p>""But despite these wins, and numerous loyal fans, Wave has not seen the user adoption we would have liked."" Duh, the rollout was rather botched and given what I think I've detailed it's no wonder.<p>""What is Wave"" should have been ""a document collaboration tool with real-time side-channel chat and group email"" would have been better for the use-cases my group fell into.<p>What I was really excited about, and what never seemed to materialize in terms of a release from Google, was that ability to run my own Wave server and federate with other Wave servers. <i>That's</i> what I wanted, and what never happened.",1280977175

Broadcast TV is 'free', after all.<p>And even if such agreements caused higher charges in the short term, if that prompted new entrants and the deployment of new technologies -- mesh networks again, anyone? -- then the medium-to-longer term trend could again be lower charges.<p>I could easily imagine a starter broadband service that is totally 'free' -- with bandwidth to participating sites as fast as those sites want to pay, and bandwidth to all other sites under some smallish rate cap (no good for video/p2p). The same arrangement could also work well for areas of 'free' wifi -- subsidized sites are fast at bulk, other sites work but subject to some per-person (or per all-users) caps.<p>That's different than what we're used to, but not necessarily worse. It could provide incentives for creating new avenues to the end-user and new service opportunities. (Consider: a VPN account that pays the preference fee, so that again 'all sites' are top-speed.)",1280977162

We can't expect the congress, bought and paid for by telecom dollars, to do it. The courts won't allow the FCC to do it. This was Google's moment to change the world. What bothers me is not only did they shrug off that responsibility we projected on them as being a smart company standing up for users but they didn't even put up a fight. They seem to be the first US company to happily surrender to the telecoms. I hate to say it because it comes off like a conspiracy theory but you can't convince me that Android and Google TV aren't the main factors behind this. Google doesn't want to pick a fight with wireless providers, telco-video providers, cable TV/broadband providers. They need them to push their products. I can't believe they're doing this.

17,1577002,comment,1574379.0,1575238.0,0,0,ellyagg,,,"> The dominant opinion was absolutely that Android wouldn't crack the iPhone's dominance. Of course it's all clear now though, and everyone has carefully adopted new positions.<p>This is simply wrong. I don't know how you could have developed such a misreading of popular analysis, but the idea that 6 months ago most people didn't know Android would overtake iPhone is laughably false. Six months ago several of my coworkers already had Android powered phones and there were numerous reports of many more Android phones from multiple vendors on the way.<p>> Wow, I care so incredibly little whether Motorola or HTC or Samsung makes boatloads of profit. In fact... [snip]<p>> I care about the platform that I develop for, that I use, that empowers or limits us... [snip]<p>Well, then why are you so excited that Android has greater market share than iPhone? That's not relevant to how you're scoring. Lots of developers vastly prefer programming Linux or Macs over Windows, and it is often for intangible reasons as you suggest.<p>> Now that's the weakness?<p>No, that continues to be the strength insofar as it empowers entrepreneurial software developers. This is along the lines of your last point. Developers will choose the OS that helps them reach their goals, which in many cases is money.<p>It is a weakness with regards to market share since it is one phone on one carrier.

They gain the possibility of creating/cornering a niche, they get a bunch of advocates that help them spread their brand (see swombat's comment), they get an army of unpaid beta-testers, they can sell market dominance to their advertisers, etc etc.<p>But, if they keep releasing and dropping products, they will lose those things. That is their call, and they are free to make it - I just wanted to point out one consequence.<p>The plus side for the HN populace is that people like me are more than happy to pay a specialist shop for the chance that it will stick around and develop its product.

This will have good and bad consequences, but I think it's safe to say that strict control of information (secrecy + focused propaganda) is a tool that despots rely upon heavily.  That open democracies rely upon it can be viewed (as you seem to view it) as a necessity, or (as I view it) as an excess.<p>Assange is risking his own skin by doing this. Surely one or more of the governments could/would arrange for his assassination.  Which is why this essay puzzles me.  This sort of right wing critique will fuel the fire that has helped Assange publicize his mission, and will have the effect of making wikileaks <i>just go away</i> much harder.<p>Keep in mind that so far the secrets being leaked are not particularly revealing in terms of their information content.  The harsh words by government officials are because the leaked information might cause the public to question its propaganda message about the war.<p>What I have come to realize from all of this is just how tightly intertwined a war effort is with propaganda, and to a lesser extent secrecy.  Assange just may put a huge hole in the ability of modern governments to do easily achieve the level of secrecy/propaganda necessary to get a comfortable, complacent yet principled people to approve of mass slaughter.",1280976332

I guess the reason that we haven't necessarily defined that we're a social network on the homepage itself, is because since we've launched, most of people heading to the homepage already know what we're about, as most of the referrals either come from articles written about us or friends telling each other about the site. But I completely agree, we do need to figure out a way to address this.<p>To answer your question, our target market is anybody who loves being social, but feels limited because of the restrictions and issues imposed on them by other sites. Buddify is for anybody who just wants something different than what they already have, and from what we've found, there are a lot of people in this position, and so far, a lot of people who come from that audience love the site.<p>Regarding applications, I personally feel that applications do not internally belong on a communication platform, and that they take away from the social experience. A lot of people would argue that applications on Facebook such as Farmville bring people closer through ""Social responsibility"". I disagree, I find that in a lot of cases they do exactly the opposite (there are exceptions though). Buddify is all about pure, unhampered conversation, and I think if people just want to tend their virtual crops all day then facebook serves that purpose well, and if people don't like how they're handling that, then I'm sure another site will come along to fix that issue too. You make the point that a lot of people love applications, but at the same time, there are also a lot of people that hate applications with a passion. We're really not into the idea of applications, that's why we're staying away from them.<p>Badges are a very interesting topic. At first sight, they just seem like just another gimmick that nobody needs, but in hindsight, they're a lot more than that. Badges say a lot about what that person is like. For instance, if someone who requested your friendship has a badge for posting over 10K comments and also has a badge to indicate that they've been blocked by 20 different people, it says that the person is potentially just an annoying spammer that you'll want to stay away from.<p>However, another example would be where a user has also requested your friendship and also has a badge that says the user has made over 10K comments, but they have another that says they're a member of over 100 groups, and have over 100 friends, and that their friends primarily consist of geeks and nerds. You then look over to their comment box and see that there's a lot of interesting conversations going on about stuff you're interested in. This could potentially be somebody that you'd actually like to add as a friend. It's something that you have to learn to interpret on your own, based on your own instincts.<p>The badges also encourage people to participate in other areas of the site that they might not normally use.<p>As for differentiation, what can I say other than we're starting off by taking a bunch of old ideas and doing them the way we think they should have been done in the first place. We have some cool ideas floating around in our heads right now that will hopefully soon start crystallizing when the time is right, and hopefully there are still many more ideas yet to come. By all means, if you have any cool ideas for the site, please let me know.<p>-Steve",1280975431

I wouldn't really know, but isn't that something like half of all the significant events in the war so far? Doesn't that make this whole operation kind of veiled from the public eye? THIS is what Wikileaks is exposing; the fact that routine events in this war are being kept secret for no apparent reason, not just a few justified occurrences where secrecy is necessary. It should be the burdon of the governing bodies to justify making something a secret, but from these documents it looks like they're slapping a ""confidential"" sticker on every other file just for the heck of it.",1280973630
