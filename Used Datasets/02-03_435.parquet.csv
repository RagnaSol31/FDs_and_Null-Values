These things lead to much gnashing of teeth in the scientific programming community already.<p>I have a numerical code that I cross-compile with gcc -O0, gcc -O3, clang, icc, and MS Visual C, all on the same machine.

I'm glad Oracle didn't 404 it.<p>The title isn't accurate though. The article is mostly about using IEEE 754 to manage computational error, which is a pretty esoteric subject.<p>Most programmers spend precious little time using floating point and don't need to worry about computational error. Even among those who use it a great deal -- those doing numerical analysis -- computational error doesn't seem to be something they concern themselves with. My guess is that in most instances it's swamped by experimental error.<p>My thoughts on this article are:<p>1: It's certainly good that it's available online. It'd be better with a different title.<p>2: It's good that modern CPUs support IEEE 754 for the rare instance that people use it.<p>3: It's worth reading the first third or so of it, just to get an idea of what computational error is<p>4: The most important thing the ""typical"" programmer needs to know is that dollar values shouldn't be represented in floating point.

This ensure that I get at least 90% of the contract.<p>Also, have complete Terms and conditions. \nOne important point is all the intellectual property that goes with your work => until complete payment, the work is yours, and usage of it is illegal. With final payment, I usually issue a letter transferring the intellectual property to the client.<p>An other important point is all the payment and refund policy. My policy is simple : no refund, projects started are to be paid in full. If the clients needs an explanation for that, explain that while you dedicate yourself to his project, you have to say no to other projects.<p>Make it easy to get paid. Set up an online payment system or anything that makes the relation frictionless. Even if it cost you a bit, it makes payment way faster to arrive (no need to go to the bank or post office, find the checkbook...).<p>One saying I like : Until you sign the contract, you have to be the mum of your clients, reassuring him, explaining things, understanding him. Once signed, you are his father : you are here to reminds him the terms of the contract.

Usually, in my experience, clients who are hard to get payments from are the one hard to handle from the start. Usually individuals pr small companies, who try to get more for less.

As someone who's been involved in ""user generated digital content"" since before the web, I've had a front row seat for the evolutionary process that, to me, is logical but to others feels accelerated if not sudden.<p>I see it as our brains adapting to the information overburden that we feel is being imposed on us. As a result, those learning to adapt are creating four categories of information:\n(1) Stuff I need to know\n(2) Stuff I should know\n(3) Stuff I'd like to know\n(4) Stuff I don't care about<p>Content shortening/summarization helps augment our ability to quantify what fits into 2, 3, and 4. If I read the first paragraph of a traditionally written journalistic piece, I know where it fits before the second paragraph. But a precious small percentage of online content is written in that manner -- first paragraph giving the reader enough information to know what to do next. (There's a whole rant on our lost ability to write, but that's for later.) So since a smaller and smaller percentage of potentially viable information is written traditionally, automated summaries (should) help us decide sooner where something fits.<p>Does that make sense or am I just spewing madness?",1353551197.0

That doesn't necessarily mean he was looking for literal parallels.  And if he were, I don't see why ""pneumatic tube that sucks a single person up"" would turn into just ""tube"" to a layman, either.  He's also mentioned the Concorde and a railgun.  How do those fit into your vision?  Will a layperson see those in your car/tunnel system?<p>I'm not just saying ""pointless complexity"".  I'm telling you why it's pointless.  Your system is certainly more complex than an evacuated tube, and without a compelling reason to embrace such complexity, then it is indeed pointless.<p>Let's step back a bit, though.  You're saying that your system is easier to implement than an evacuated tube.  Let's assume that's true (though I don't think it is).  Is it also easier to implement than a partially evacuated tube?  Those are expected to travel at or past Mach I, and <i>don't need the car to move nearly 100% of the air in the tunnel</i>.  How is your proposal superior?  You talk about using the plungers to evacuate air, but the energy cost to remove the air must still be paid.  Your 70 ton slugs might carry more momentum, but a car in a partially evacuated tube wouldn't need to displace all the air it encounters, and so wouldn't need as much momentum.  You're constantly paying the cost to push around a bunch of air.  That cost is largely avoided with a more traditional design.<p>I'm not certain about your idea that you don't need a tight seal.  Yes, at Mach I a gust would blow pretty hard.  But in a near-vacuum you'll not be blowing much air.  Remember that you're going to have to blow with >1 atmosphere of pressure to push anything out and past the flaps.  Also remember that this ""gust"" is the result of resistance caused by the giant plug you're pushing down the tube, resistance that another design might just avoid or at least minimize.  And any air not evacuated by the ""gust"" will contribute to further drag as the plunger pushes past it.",1353549840.0

But the reason I choose black is simple:<p>Often, the LCD projector is not pointed straight at the backdrop or maximized correctly. If your slide background is not black, there is a perceptible margin, and your slide area is shaped like a trapezoid, not a rectangle. Using a black slide background minimizes this margin, and makes it look like your slides correctly fill the backdrop.<p>Just my two cents. I'm curious if people feel strongly against this approach.",1353549693.0
