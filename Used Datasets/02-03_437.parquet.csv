People who say they dont care about the costs\n   often cave sooner, because they are showing that theyre weak.\n   Theyre showing that they really dont have much solid to\n   fight you with except their loudly stated tolerance for pain.\n   That tolerance is easy to test. And its usually very low when\n   theres not much else but puffery to back it up. Any modestly\n   wise person cares about the financial effects of litigation.\n   Dont try to pretend youre stupid, or else youre going to\n   look stupid.""\n</code></pre>\n[0] <a href=""http://hustlebear.com/2010/12/14/how-to-handle-lawyers-threatening-you/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hustlebear.com/2010/12/14/how-to-handle-lawyers-threa...</a>",1338604291.0

For more information, read this entire thread.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4037065"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4037065</a><p>As for how you do it, in practice 99% of licensing schemes are based either on ""serial number"", ""mac address"", ""license key given to user and typed into app"", or a combination of such. While some people then can't import still, almost everyone can, and that is enough to be game-changing.<p>Note: you don't even need to allow this list to e changed after you import the product if you are still concerned about a ""30% cut"". (Though, Cydia does allow this, and even fully automates it by way of a backend licensing API vendors can implement to take control of the purchasing process, and in practice vendors that start using this mostly use it as a temporary measure and eventually just switch over entirely).",1338602852.0

129,4056722,comment,4052719.0,4054398.0,2,0,einhverfr,,,"""Are you implying that we shouldn't react disproportionately?""<p>I would say that even when you factor in malicious intent we <i>still</i> react disproportionally, and that this is an inherent problem.<p>Any individual involved in <i>any</i> security-related field will have to work with the concept of acceptable risk at some point.  The damage that terrorists <i>can</i> cause us is not that high compared to the way we victimize ourselves to try to prevent very modest harm.<p>Our reaction has become comparable to a cytokine storm in reaction to a flu virus, really.  That can't be good.<p>Edit:  As a side note, our reaction is such that it allows for what I call ""grey-terrorism"" vulnerabilities.  If we define terrorism to only include acts which are violent or directly dangerous to human life, then leaving cardboard boxes marked ""do not touch"" in airport restrooms around the nation is not ""terrorism.""  The act is not dangerous to human life.  The act is not violent.  The act however may be very disruptive to our airports, and it may be very good at inspiring terror.",1338602716.0

The first 10 stories that I see through the graph api correspond to about the first 100 stories I see through my facebook newsfeed (this same limitation also applies to using facebook's own ""download your data"" app, as it is implemented through the graph api without any special access).   This also means that if you post a comment to friend's story (and see on your page/timeline ""commented on X..."", if that friend restricted api access to their data, you will not only not be able to access the comment (that you wrote), you won't even see it in json dump of the page via the graph api.<p>In all honesty, the only way to do it ""right"" (in quotes for a reason, as not really right(tm), and with facebook's current limitations) is to basically parse their dom and rewrite it.
