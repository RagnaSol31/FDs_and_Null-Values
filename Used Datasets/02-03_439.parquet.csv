You have to cut through so much b.s. to just get anything done.   I remember at some point the documentation of some features were taking more than the implementation and testing itself, just to satisfy some guidelines.<p>Aslo, unless you are starting your own company, a lot of smaller companies are a crapshoot.<p>I really think that mid-sized nimble companies are the best (between 50 and 180 people).  If they are doing well, and are growing, there is a lot more opportunity in such companies career wise, and friendship/social wise than in a large corp.  You just create better bonds with your mates, working towards a common goal, without political bs., and you have the chance to see all parts of the business closer (in large corps, you are just in some part of engineering, with no visibility to the business decisions).<p>This month I just moved to Yammer, and so far it has been awesome experience.  (btw, if any of you guys are looking for something new in SF let me know ardit33@gmail.com.

Right now they don't offer a website-only plan.<p><pre><code>  All Digital Access (Website + Tablet app + Phone app) = $35/month or $420 / year\n  Website + Tablet app = $20/month or $240 / year\n  Website + Phone apps = $15/month or $180 / year\n</code></pre>\nThere is no discount for All Digital Access when compared to either of the application plans. Once you are on one of the plans, the upgrade path is unconscionable..  $240/year or $180/year for use of an additional native mobile app?   It seems they either value website access at $0 or subscribers are paying for website access twice.<p>It's more interesting when you compare home delivery options.  Home delivery includes All Digital Access as a bonus.  The cheapest home delivery (Monday to Friday) is $6.20 per week without any introductory rate or special offer.  This works out to $322.40 per year (52 weeks) or $26.87/month (4.33 weeks per month).<p>This suggests that if you want access to the website plus both the phone app and the tablet app, you'd be better off buying home delivery and throwing out the paper.",1301193911.0

The former was rated 18, the latter was rated 15 in the UK. The former involved killing Zombies and destroying cars. The latter involved human-on-human violence, people being ripped limb from limb, aliens being mutilated and tortured, a cow getting ripped to pieces, and multiple scenes with full-frontal nudity. Also released that year was Titanic, which again had a nude scene and a sex scene, it had a suicide attempt, a suicide on screen, it had someone killed with blood while trying to escape a sinking ship, it also dropped the F-bomb and a dozen shits amongst other swear words; it was rated 12 in the UK.<p>I'm sorry, but the themes in video games (at least when I was growing up) tended to be more child-friendly than most of the movies children were permitted to see or we allowed to see by their parents.<p>If you don't want your kids playing violent video games, then don't let your kid play violent video games. You have zero justification to impose your rules and values on anyone else.<p>I also find it very foolish that you cannot see that video games are rated insanely over the top with almost no common sense applied ""because they're interactive"".<p>Honestly, I think your 12 year old likely has received more life-time emotional and mental damage by being in school surrounded by other children than they ever would being exposed to violent video games.

48,2373964,comment,2349587.0,2350174.0,1,0,joeyespo,,,"Perhaps these can be handled by approaching the problem similarly to the way Rent the Runway does. In the Mixergy interview with the founders (<a href=""http://mixergy.com/hyman-fleiss-rent-the-runway-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mixergy.com/hyman-fleiss-rent-the-runway-interview/</a>), they discuss their realization that it's all about the experience. Of wearing something new. Of having it fit just right. And most importantly, the experience of the occasion they wear it to.<p>They were able to base their successful decisions on that assumption. Like using same-day shipping. Sending multiple clothes for the price of one to allow them to use the one that fits both them and the occasion. And more recently, including any accessories that can go with their choices.<p>I think some of these ideas can be generalized. As a shopping service, you can overcome all three barriers by sending multiple clothes based on the ""this or that"" questions. Or current trends. Or a both. This allows the buyer to make their final decisions within the comfort of their own homes. They can then send back all but the clothes they keep, if any.<p>I'm pretty certain men won't use this service for renting (though what do I know, I haven't tested this assumption), but treating it as such, you anticipate returns to be normal. The service can possibly learn what works for recurring customers (what fits, what general style they keep, etc), and lower the return rate. Furthermore, it can find trends in the ""this or that"" questions vs return rate to better predict as to what will be kept. It can even make fashion suggestions and educate on the subject via email/blog. I think us geeks would be more open to fashion advice if there were theory and stats to back it up (well, I would anyway; there's mountains of theory behind design, why not fashion?). Translate the emotional into the technical. Base suggestions on what both visually pleases the crowd and feels good to the indifferent individual.<p>Does this sound any more feasible?",1301193430.0

This pricing differential was essential to Goldman getting out of CDOs and into CDSs against CDOs after they figured out what John Paulson and others were up to.<p>The price increase in CDSs against CDOs in retail mortgages alerted Goldman to the fact that people were very interested in a CDS against what they thought was a very solid asset (CDO consisting of residential mortgages).<p>This is also why AIG got bailed out, GS had enough CDSs with AIG that if AIG went so would GS. I definitely agree with you that in the long run bailouts create an atmosphere of moral hazard and irrational exuberance.<p>The problem also largely stems from political economics, as a representative you want to remain elected, therefore if you can kick the economic collapse can down the road a few years or spread its impact over many years you can stay in office. Therefore the rational economic choice for politicians is to favor bailouts. Very few people will not vote for you because 5 years later their taxes are 10% higher, but most will not vote for you if they lose their job. By the same token most people would rather take a 10% pay cut for 10 years than have no income for 1.",1301192804.0

I’m not saying women are similar to either group. I’m saying that a man’s best strategy for dealing with each group is disturbingly similar. If he’s smart, he takes the path of least resistance most of the time, which involves considering the emotional realities of other people.  A man only digs in for a good fight on the few issues that matter to him, and for which he has some chance of winning. This is a strategy that men are uniquely suited for because, on average, we genuinely don’t care about 90% of what is happening around us"".<p>Looking at it rationally, there's two counter arguments he makes that can be considered. Women's rights activists arguing women earn 80 cents to the dollar and fewer women in top management.<p>I personally think the second argument is valid while the first argument isn't unless I see some objective evidence.<p>He could've refrained from the comparison with Children / mentally handicapped as it can lead you to wrong conclusions even on a forum like HN, but the rest of the argument isn't something that you get upset about.",1301191484.0

I know a man who did so (though I don't know all the details).  As I understand it, he had a brief fling with a woman who was separated from her husband.  The marriage was falling apart in part due to the fact that it had not resulted in a child.  The couple got back together and she found out she was pregnant.  But the baby didn't belong to hubby.  It belonged to the man she had a fling with while separated.  She and hubby opted to stay together and wanted to raise the child as their own.  They wanted to get rid of Mr. Fling.  As I understand it, he was happy to sign away his parental rights as a means to avoid ever having to pay child support.",1301191201.0
