There is nothing in law today that would prevent anyone from building a more effective business model that doesn't depend on copyright, if they can find one. If it's as easy as the copyright opponents make out to produce works without relying on the copyright protections afforded by the law today, <i>why is hardly anyone doing so</i>?<p>Right now, the only people who are making serious money from creative content using alternative business models tend to be keeping that content locked up via technical means so consumers can't just copy it, as with software-as-a-service, pay-per-view TV, and the like. Advertising also works, up to a point, but the serious money there isn't going to the content generators in most cases, it's going to the middlemen like Google and Facebook, and obviously ad-ridden content gives an inferior experience for consumers.<p>> And I'm of the opinion that most politicians are looking more for an excuse than for a real argument too.<p>Perhaps, but they're not all completely clueless, as the hesitation over PIPA/SOPA and ACTA in the face of widespread popular dissent has shown.<p>My concern is that if we don't achieve a fundamental shift in perceptions and attitudes to content production/consumption among the political classes, building on those recent successes, then that will be game over because sooner or later the lobbying will result in the kind of crackdown Big Media wants.<p>This issue needs to become politically toxic, so no-one who needs to be re-elected wants to touch anything associated with Big Media lobbying.

I recently ported over a networking library I wrote in python to ruby, and the requests per second (CPU limited in this case, since it was talking over a loopback socket -- this was just a test of how fast data could be serialized/deserialized) dropped from 7000 requests/sec in python to 120 in ruby. And that was just with standard CPython. Under PyPy, I was able to process about 20,000 requests/sec after letting the JIT warm up.<p>I realize it's sort of silly to choose a dynamically typed interpreted language on the grounds of performance when you're already giving up so much performance regardless, but in my mind python hits the sweet spot of ""just fast enough for most things I need to do"", and with all other things being roughly equal (which, in my opinion, they roughly are), being an order of a magnitude factor faster wins out.",1329012605.0

Millions of people who aren't from the U.S. use those platforms, so clearly most Internet users don't find that using sites aimed at multiple nationalities is in any way troublesome.<p>I'm not saying it won't work, I'm just wondering why you're planning on targeting one specific demographic in particular? I remember when nation-specific sites were much more common, now that's increasingly not the case. If you think your architecture / notification system etc. is going to be better you'd be doing yourself a disservice by making it overly narrow.<p>Anyway. I don't mean to be dismissive of your idea. But to me it sounds a lot like ""I want to set up a discussion forum for my country"". Without any of the details about why your countrymen would sign up, what they're using <i>now</i> to communicate and why they'd be motivated to switch to your platform.",1329012153.0

This whole thing sounds like a classic CARtel. Pun intended.<p>Are there really laws in place that block the process of open market pricing competition for cars?  If so, that is crap and you should be focused on fixing that.  I believe that a race to bottom on car pricing would actually give dealers an incentive and opportunity to better market and highlight their ability to consult and service consumers vs. haggling for a widget.<p>Dealers better start understanding that the race to the bottom is <i>already in progress</i> and it is only a matter of time when the well established model will have to adapt.",1329012047.0
