While it is true that an infinite number of strings correspond with each md5 hash, the question was about trying to <i>actually find</i> a match.  With a suitably large hash, say 256 bits, it becomes physically impossible to even <i>count</i> that high, let alone compute that many test hashes.  A problem that is too large to evaluate is effectively infinite.<p>(Yes, md5 is 128 bits and might be possible if an entire country dedicated itself to the effort.  Or an attack on its flaws could be used.  But both these points are tangential to themouth's use of infinite.)",1320720839.0

For example, try drawing a capital sigma (  ); if you don't get your top and bottom bars perfectly parallel there's a strong chance you'll get gibberish back. Or try pi (  or  ); a 1 change in the angle of your bars might make the difference between a handful of relevant results and a full page of nonsensical Devanagari and Gurmukhi characters. Or do a double dagger (  ); if your middle bar isn't perfectly straight up and down it might think you're doing cent (  ) or integral (  ). It seems like it's extremely difficult to get the same results for the same 'search'  every time you get wildly different answers because the slightest little difference in how you draw it changes how it reads it.<p>So i think the recognition algorithm needs a little work. I know you mentioned font limitations, so i suspect adding more of those would be a good start.<p>Also, i don't see Japanese support, which is unfortunate. If you could get that working i would be an instant fan. (I deal with transcription of Japanese a lot, and although i'm proficient in kana, my kanji skills are pretty poor and probably always will be. What i've always wanted is a tool that can return kanji characters based on a drawing WITHOUT requiring strict adherence to stroke order.

In a less extreme circumstance, they could have just exhaled instead of hiccuping, in which case no one would have noticed and the error could be incorrectly attributed to the camera.<p>A great photograph with a camera phone requires a certain set of parameters that can almost entirely be individually measured outside of human interaction (and randomness).  If you want good handheld performance, you need a fast exposure time, which can be measured from the EXIF data of each photo.  If you want high dynamic range, measure the ratio of pure white and black pixels to the rest of the image (white and black is basically over/underexposed).  The only thing that would be effected by motion that I can't think of how else to measure beyond being handheld is time to good focus (outside of crazy contraptions that result in more repeatable motion, like sticking your phone in a centrifuge), but there probably exists a way to do so while avoiding the inherent non-repeatability of humans behavior.",1320719692.0

I wasn't comparing degrees from different countries, I was only comparing degrees acquired in the U.S. by U.S. citizens.<p>Your original point was that there shouldn't be a shortage of talent in the U.S.: that companies should be able to find enough U.S. workers for things like engineering jobs.  And I'm saying that there may not actually be enough local talent; it depends on how many U.S. citizens choose the ""hard"" degree programs that companies want.<p>There's lots of money to be made by U.S. citizens in certain sectors such as finance.  It's conceivable that some U.S. students would opt for an ""easier"" degree if that still leads to a high-paying job; they may see no point in the extra work of a ""hard"" program like science or engineering.<p>Clearly not all U.S. citizens do that, and those that do choose engineering are just as employable, or more so, than immigrant engineers; I never said they weren't.",1320719442.0
