I made my comment to make two assertions: First, that the desktop is irrelevant today because more people use phones and tablets, and the spread will continue to grow. Second, that the forkability of Linux made it possible for Android to exist...and, to practically destroy every other competitor for the phone and tablet (except Apple, but Android has a very comfortable, and growing, lead over Apple).<p>And, when Google started down the Android path, they weren&",

Its responsibilities grossly exceed that of an init system, as it goes on to handle power management, device management, mount points, cron, disk encryption, socket API/inetd, syslog, network configuration, login/session management, readahead, GPT partition discovery, container registration, hostname/locale/time management, mDNS/DNS-SD, the Linux console and other things all wrapped into one.<p>...<p>3. Since systemd is very tightly welded with the Linux kernel API, different systemd versions are incompatible with different kernel versions and portability is unnecessarily hampered in many components. This is an isolationist policy that essentially binds the Linux ecosystem into its own cage, serving as an obstacle to developing software portable with both Linux variations and other Unix-like systems. It also raises some issues backporting patches and maintaining long-term stable systems.<p>...<p>7. systemd is viral by its very nature, due to its auxiliaries exposing APIs, while being bound to systemd&",

How do you send the email without learning who the recipient is? Are you saving it on the server, thus not using SMTP, and then requiring both the sender and recipient to be users of Scryptmail?",1417226625.0

I assume places like HomeJoy and Handy have greater than 20% margins on the services they sell. So if all the service providers start using this instead of Handy they would see an effective increase in their income.,1417226612.0

Size and functionality (and availability) of that mode depend on the skin selected, but in general there are buttons for prev,pause,next track, volume control, current trackname, length and current position. It does not have a separate playlist though, but double clicking it brings you back to the itunes-like &quot;main player&quot; mode.<p>The mini player is still somewhat bulky, for my taste. I remember Songbird had some skins, that made it even slimmer. I fixed this for me with a small AutoIT script, that fades the player to 10% transparancy when the mouse is not hovering on top of it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://getnightingale.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getnightingale.com/</a>",1417226568.0
