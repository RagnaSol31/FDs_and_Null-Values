Only drugs that have evidence of working at stage I and II progress to stage III.<p>What happens is the drug companies decide at stage III what patients to let into the trial. What they are trying to avoid is anything that will limit the market size once approved. This means they try to skate as close as they can to the effectiveness limit and still get the drug approved.<p>For example, if they have a new cancer drug that they know only works on cancers with certain mutations, what they will try to do is to test the drug in a broad population of patients including those without the mutation. Since for the approval process it does not really matter how effective the drug is (as long as overall it is statically significant) and that you can only market to the population you tested in, you will want to shove in as many “filler patients&quot; as you think the drug can support. Due to the difficulty of designing large trials they often get the filler number wrong. I don’t condone this activity, but this is the commercial reality.<p>More fundamentally the pharmaceutical industry is being crushed between two very powerful forces - the cost of developing new drugs continues to get more expensive every year (mostly thanks to regulations), while the real market for each drug shrinks as sub-populations are identified for each disease. Combine this with a refusal of society and insurance companies to pay ever increasing drug prices and the outlook for the industry is not great.",1439953198.0

A set of vectors is said to be independent if the only linear combination of them that is zero is the trivial linear combination. Otherwise, they are dependent.<p>Or do you have a definition of independence for dimensions? That would first require a different definition of dimension. Ordinarily, dimension is just the cardinality of an independent, spanning set (we call this a basis). It is a single number. A linear space does not have a plurality of dimensions, nor do matrices have an associated plurality of dimensions.<p>Please don&",
