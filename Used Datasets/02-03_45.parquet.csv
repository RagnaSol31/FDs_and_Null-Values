This would allow the publisher to use any combination of factors, such as ad format and perceived relevance -- not just eCPM.

When I go to my parents' house and watch TV ads there, I find them ridiculous and wonder how anyone could take them seriously.  Then I realize that most people watching them don't even notice, so their brains must be somehow conditioned by watching them.  That's the part that disturbs me the most.<p>I don't agree with everything in your blog post, though it was an interesting read, thank you.  Specifically, I don't run an adblocker, but for most sites I don't seem to even notice the ads.  I'm not sure if that's because I'm conditioned to see them as normal, or because I'm just not seeing them.  I would hazard a guess that their impact is much less than TV ads though.<p>Regardless, I do sympathize with people who run websites that offer useful information or services, but don't have a viable revenue model that doesn't involve ads.  I get a lot of value from these sorts of sites (for instance, the sites of open source software projects), but there are too many of them for me to want to pay a subscription to all of them.  (Perhaps there's an opportunity there?)  However, most of these sites that I get the most value out of are not about screwing money out of people, just paying for their hosting costs.<p>To compare this with TV, I generally don't want what's on TV, even if I can download it for free, but I do want the content on many of the sites supported by advertising.  For the moment, I see it as a fair trade.<p>EDIT: Clarify last sentence of third paragraph.",1267927898.0

The lack of sign in button is confusing (this can be solved by simply renaming 'Go' to 'Login')<p>2. I've been waiting for etacts to finish importing whatever it is importing for almost 6 hours, and with no ETA / status bar / email update I'm inclined to feel that it's either not working, is heavily bottle necked, or something went wrong<p>3. Assuming the system is actually just busy doing all the processing on my emails, as an end user I would prefer it to do all this in the background, in a manner that is oblivious to me.<p>4. This means you could/should display 'incomplete' information, as long as it comes with the warning of 'We've still got XXXXXX emails to process' or something similar :)<p>I really just wanted to see what the interface/experience is like, regardless of exactly how much information you've processed (i.e. I'm ok with seeing a 'last contacted 3 years ago' message, even though I contacted them yesterday, because I realize you're still processing the information, but I want to see it now, not five hours from now :)<p>You do a great job at a very simple one-click login/signup, but having to wait forever to use this will (imo) lose a lot of people down the road who just ""want to try it"" (one of the best quotable comments I've heard a few weeks ago was from one of the founders of BackType -- ""Your biggest enemy is the back button"")<p>Anyway, I do look forward to using it asap :D",1267927851.0
