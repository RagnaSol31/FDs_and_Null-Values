I was working on our company website and came up with something remarkably similar to Amazon's One-Click Ordering System. Having ordered a max of 3 things off Amazon in the past 10 years; I had absolutely no idea they had any such feature. Continuing my work lead out to the architecture and rough code-outline of this (I was unusually excited so I did a bit of pre-coding). Then deciding to 'do my homework' I went off to find prior implementations; low and behold I came across Amazon's One-Click Ordering Process. (And also the information covering the two-click ordering process lawsuit that still went in Amazon's favor).<p>So my question is if I had implemented such a system would I have been liable? The sad thing is, looking at the way the patent system is now, I WANT to say yes. Even with it being my own code just the process being patented would have prevented me from using it; despite the fact that I came up with a similar process completely on my own.<p>It just seems to me that in a way the patent system stifles...innovation.

I'm one of your aforementioned ""College kids [with a] part-time project"" to do an MMO, now graduated and working a day-job while trying to finish a game <i>any</i> game.<p>Let me give you some insight into why we decided and why we thought we could do an MMO.  First of all, a subscription model is very attractive, because it's clear how the venture is supposed to make money.  We thought, or at least I thought, that we could make an MMO more simply by making a game that's just the ""multiplayer online part"" plus a smaller ""rest of the game"".  I got started immediately working on the network sync code.<p>I got as far as moving boxes that did in fact sync their positions on multiple computers.  But going from that to a real game is about as big a gulf as going from nailing boards to building a house.  It turns out, code to network sync a game is not going to go anywhere without a game to sync.<p>So now I'm working on a simpler single player game, built with the scripting language bindings that was one of the best pieces left over from the earlier endeavor.  I think even experienced programmers from other fields cannot understand the soul-crushing amount of work it is to get even simple things working in a 3D game when you're doing it all by your self.  Yesterday I got a green line to move on a black screen, and I was happy.<p>(The game engine, which can do more than that, had been not working for 6 months following a rewrite, so I was happy to see anything.  And yes I know about the Joel Spolsky article about the folly of complete rewrites.  I'll see your Joel Spolsky and raise you one Richard Brooks:  ""plan to throw one away.

If they took no action, there would be no scarcity. Therefore it is artificial.<p>Contrast this with, say, physical goods: even if the manufacturer does nothing about limiting the distribution of whatever you purchased, it would still be scarce because making copies requires significant resources.<p>Fundamentally, economics is about managing scarcity. The main reason you pay for some resource is because it is scarce. So their ""crazy idea"" is exactly that: creating scarcity.",1337911339.0

Housing, healthcare, and education costs are utterly teabagged, but gas is cheap, even now at $4. People who whine about gas prices are either (a) typical Boomer Republicans throwing their sense of entitlement around-- you know, the assholes who thought it was okay to go to war over ""price gouging"" in oil but clapped their fat hands together when their house prices octupled in one generation and young families got robbed (by them)-- or (b) people who live too ungodly far from where they work and are paying far more in lost time than in gas. Commuting (although less so by subway and not at all by bike) is corrosive and it has nothing to do with fuel costs.<p>Because gas is so cheap, people don't usually think in terms of, ""how much gas will I use to get there?"" Instead, it's ""How far can I drive until I have to fill up?"" That's a question that's easier to answer with a miles-per-gallon number.<p>Still, I agree that it would be better to see the inverse posted. Maybe people would think twice about driving those enormities. Probably not, but one can hope.",1337911253.0
