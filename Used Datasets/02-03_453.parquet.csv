2,4738768,story,,,1,2,BjoernKW,Ask HN: Would you pay for this freelancer tool?,,"Lately, I've been thinking about the freelance software developer market and the mess it is in. In my opinion, it boils down to:<p>- Freelancers mostly find jobs through recruiters. It's hard to find clients willing to deal with developers directly, especially in the enterprise market, which accounts for most of the job openings for freelancers.<p>- Freelancers are unhappy with how recruiters treat them.<p>- Some recruiters use shady methods and most of them act in an intransparent manner.<p>- For clients it seems to be very hard to find the right freelancers for a job.<p>While I applaud Geekli.st, Matchist, Hackerlist and the likes for trying to solve this problem I think they can't really scale to the freelancer market at large. They also seem to only appeal to a subset of developers and clients that doesn't necessarily intersect with where the biggest demand is. Most enterprise clients mostly will not even have heard about those services.<p>So, while I think there at least for now is no general solution to this problem I've been thinking about a product that might at least mitigate it from a freelancer's point of view. This product would be a web application roughly outlined as follows:<p>A freelancer clips job openings via a web clipper.\nThe application does named entity recognition and reduplication on those clips and displays related entities for a job posting (like recruiting company, client, contact data, required skills) in a Rapportive-like manner.\nThe skills for a job would be matched against the freelancer's skills, thereby ranking the openings.\nAnother interesting aspect could be that given enough users this product could be used to build a relevant database of job openings.<p>Basically, it would be CRM tuned to the needs of freelance software developers with the additional benefit of a potentially huge lead database.<p>Question is: Am I on the right track with this one? Would you or anyone else pay for this?",1351997926

He prefers Nexus because of the stock Android UI (nothing to do with iOS UI here!), but even more he prefers nexus phones because Google is fighting the proprietary locked down carrier approach -- the one that makes us slaves to our carriers in order to get a good phone at a decent price. I may get a Nexus 4, and in that situation I can purchase my freedom from my current slavery to Verizon for a paltry $100. I can actually evaluate all the carrier options and determine which phone is the best. If this kind of freedom takes hold, it is likely that carriers will actually have to compete at some point, instead of customers being forced into one carrier their whole life (basically). Then other aspects of carriers will probably improve because they have to compete.<p>In other words: It's not a preference for one design over another, it's a preference for freedom. You may disagree with the freedom argument, but this is certainly what it's about. This is why Linus is coming out to bat for Android -- not because he likes Google or Google's style, it's a pragmatic decision because he thinks Google is his friend as far in trying to reintroduce competition into the market.",1351997392

It's Capitalism 101. Uprooting an entrenched market leader isn't done by being as-good-as, it'd done by offering something so compelling over the market leader (in this case, price) that people are willing to give you a shot. Apple managed to survive the computer price wars with its ridiculous margins intact, by positioning themselves as a luxury brand with an image that justifies the price premium. Why would the smartphone/tablet market be any different? We know from decades of technology sales that hardware trends towards being easier and less expensive to produce, and thus, more affordable. Economies of scale naturally dictate that Apple is going to have to lower prices to compete; if their prices remain the same, their margins go up because the component hardware becomes less expensive to produce.<p>Google is gunning for people who are price-sensitive because they can afford to have next-to-zero margins on their hardware. I don't think it's to poison the perception of mobile hardware pricing as much as it is an attempt to be as competitive as possible.<p>The iPad Mini costs about $195 to build, according to analysis I've read. Apple could had made the choice to position it at $299, still made a ~30% profit margin (rather than 40%, which is about Apple's margin on everything), gotten under the psychological $300 barrier, and been much more price-competitive with the Nexus 7 (""It's a premium brand! You pay a little extra, but it's worth it!"") - the fact that they chose not to isn't because they had to make a choice between a profit margin and being competitive. It's because they make a 40% margin on everything they sell, and the iPad Mini wasn't going to be any different. They may pay for that choice in loss of marketshare, but that's economics, not a poisoned perception.<p>OTOH, attacking Google on ""privacy"" <i>is</i> poisonous, IMO, because it's hypocritical; both Apple and Microsoft have long histories of doing things that are questionable on that front. Attacking your competitor and attempting to ruin their image or public perception as a tactic to dissuade people from buying their products, rather than competing with them on features or price is absolutely ugly, and should be called out and discouraged. Apple seems to be really hot on this strategy lately (privacy with Google, ""cheap knockoff"" with Samsung, ""patent thieves"" with basically everyone else), and it's discouraging, because consumers benefit much more when companies put their money and effort into building products that outclass their competitors rather than simply trying to discredit them out of business.",1351996689

I've never looked but I would imagine the motor driver circuit and the electronics have fairly large capacitors on the input power rails.  This should be relatively short lived but higher Rds from a crappy MOSFET would increase the charging time.  The second is everything powering on, there are likely secondary regulators for the electronics (probably needs 1.8 or something not 5 or 3.3) and they could be regulating the 12V rail to something more controlled for the spindle motor as well.  Those switchers coming online and charging capacitors on the output side will cause a bit of a spike also.  Then there is the spike from firing up the spindle motor and the head servo, likely not insignificant.  I have no idea if there is an inrush current / duration limit in the SATA/SAS spec or not, I would think so but I've never seen a drive manufacturer quote these numbers.",1351995757

There are times when companies or countries are willing to dump goods at cost or even below cost for a certain period of time in order to gain market power.  That's a bad thing for consumers.<p>What we want is vibrant competition with many players offering low prices.  However, if companies dump their products at or below cost, we may find we're left with fewer players as some companies exit the industry.  Apple and Samsung are both doing wonderfully, but others including HTC, LG, and Motorola Mobility aren't in such a sunny position.<p>Amazon hasn't said this, but some have justified Amazon's high P/E ratio by saying that Amazon is going to be the future of retail and once they've killed off some of their competition, they'll be able to raise their margins.  That may or may not be true, but such a situation would be bad for consumers.  We want low prices (that's a great thing), but we also don't want to lose options and competition in the future (that's a bad thing).  Amazon is running razor thin on its profits to be popular.  I'm not suggesting that Amazon is evil.  Rather, it seems to just be Jeff Bezos' attitude towards margins: they should be low so that people can buy more stuff.  However, that attitude may not always prevail, especially if competition dies out.<p>It's good to make things cheaper and more accessible (as Linus has said).  However, sometimes you can make something too cheap to be really sustainable.  Often times large players will sacrifice profits to gain marketshare and that can sometimes be justified.  Still, it's important to recognize as the play for market power that it may be and the temporary situation that it may be.  A company does not intend to lose money forever.  If they're able to eliminate competition in their industry, that gives them power in the future to raise margins.<p>It can be hard to judge an industry sometimes.  Apple and Samsung are clearly going to be sticking around: they're making products people want and raking in money.  However, other players just haven't been so profitable.  Having to compete with a device like the Kindle Fire being sold at cost is hard to do and may drive them out of the industry.  You can say, ""well, they weren't able to compete"" and that's somewhat true.<p>However, it hides the fact that Amazon may not be playing ""fair"" (for some definition of fair that I'll explain).  Let's say (hypothetically) that Amazon is actually Evil, Inc.  They have a war chest of money and are willing to lose money over the short term to become monopolistic.  So, they price the Kindle Fire even below cost - $50 maybe.  Some competitors will just fold.  Others might try to continue competing for a short time, but their war chests are empty before Evil, Inc.'s.  So, we end up with only Evil, Inc. selling us tablets.  Nice for Evil, Inc.  They can now charge a healthy $300 as well as up the margins on content purchases - charging higher prices to consumers as well as negotiating harder against content providers.  ""Ah, but if they did that, someone else would come in with a $250 tablet to compete!""  Probably not without government intervention.  Why?  Because they know Evil, Inc. will temporarily drop the price on their Kindle Fires until the new company goes bust.<p>That's an exaggeration, but dumping products like this isn't unheard of.  The more people that get Kindles, the better Amazon's market power is over content providers and consumers.  Similarly, if the margins become so low that many companies can't create devices, we end up with them exiting the market and competition is reduced.  The fewer competitors in the tablet market, the better it is for Amazon long term.<p>Basically, we want competition today <i>AND</i> competition tomorrow - sustainable competition rather than one or a few companies winning.  We want prices at a point where they're low, consumer friendly, and encourage wide adoption while making sure that 5 years from now, we're benefitting from similar low, consumer friendly prices.  If we're left with only Apple, Samsung, and Amazon, we'll be worse off.<p>It can be hard to think about.  In some ways, we might see a company like Amazon as winning by providing things cheaper in a way that's good for consumers.  However, we don't want Amazon to win - we want others to be able to match Amazon so that Amazon will have to keep innovating and competing in the future.  At the same time, we want the lowest price.  It's a balance similar to investing in the future (or taking on debt).  We don't want to starve ourselves now (we want to enjoy our lives).  At the same time, we know that we shouldn't just rack up debt in the present having fun because we want a strong future.  We don't want to pay high prices for devices now, but at the same time we don't want one or two companies to come out as the survivors of the ""tablet price wars"" who can then charge us more money now that the competition has been vanquished.<p>* I know I picked on Amazon a bit here and that's just because the Kindle Fire is being sold at cost below the competition.  I'm not saying that Amazon is evil, but even in the absence of evil, we wouldn't want Amazon to win because competition brings innovation and discourages slacking off.  Even if you're a good company trying to do positive things, seeing what others are doing makes you better.  As such, even a purely altruistic company is bad as a monopoly.",1351994563

The other important thing when you are at your very early stage of product development is not to be distracted by other stuff like how you are going to do marketing, scale, etc. etc.",1351994450
