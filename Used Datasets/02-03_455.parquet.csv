I agree that historically this has happened but I see no reason that it should be a necessary consequence. We have to consider the possibility that a segment of the population will have no realistic options for producing marginal value.,1356231568.0

It will just take a little while longer for those jobs to be replaced by artificial intelligence.<p>The concept of superstars v. the rest is mainly just a weak argument attempting to cover for the tendency of monopolies to form in any economy.

And to push your apple vs IBM analogy farther, it seems that they could potentially still win, by building a product that is far and away better for a certain segment of the market (i.e. as apple did).<p>To address the deeper philosophical claim -- are big companies morally obligated in some sense, to not encroach on ideas currently dominated by some startup, I think not. The whole crux of your argument is that there's some well ordering on the timestamp of ideas, and whoever is earlier in the well ordering has some moral claim to executing the idea. As far as I can see, there's no a priori reason why this should be so, and there are lots of utilitarian reasons why this ought not be so. Just because someone came up with the idea does not mean they are the best agent to execute the idea. I might be a brilliant military tactician, but I might lack the charisma or fortitude to lead an army. In the same way, I might be a brilliant social based startup, but my same product under the influence of the most complete social graph might be tons better.<p>I am not saying facebook poke is better than snapchat. I don't use either, but I do think competition is healthy. Now what would be problematic is if startups did -- as your article asserts -- stop having original ideas just because they were afraid big companies would clone them. In that case, the government should probably seriously consider penalizing companies like facebook for scooping up the idea, if not by making them disable the app completely, but by making them retroactively purchase or pay a large sum to snapchat. I don't have any data to discern whether a ""chill"" effect is happening, but I would guess an answer in the negative.",1356230359.0

In order to encourage sharing ideas, societies have been allowing the encroachment of imaginary property rights (a euphemism for the independent traditions of copyright, patents, and trademaks) on tangible and even inalienable property rights (making it uncomfortable to say the least). The Internet, however, has shaken even that basic premise: the Internet is full of creativity (not just copyright infringement). Only a fool would ""buy"" water in the rain.<p>We should not be allowing, condoning, or financially supporting, any unneeded encroachment on tangible rights, so IMHO we should dismantle copyright as we know it. What's more: copying itself has social value that should not simply be dismissed.<p>This whole conflict is about preserving the front-loaded pricing (CDs and DVDs that can sit on a store shelf) that the biggest music and movie publishers only became accustomed to this century, after the phonograph. (OK, the printing press was  around a little longer before that, but scribes couldn't help read the book they were copying...) As awkward as it is for these biggest ""creators"" (distributors) to return to a gratuity system (beg? never!), this change only affects the biggest publishers and employers, not creators generally.<p>The moral argument for copyright is an illusion: it's a confusion of the right to privacy with the right to have monopoly control over distribution. I support the former but not the latter.<p>For independant artists and creators, the Internet is the best opportunity ever to realize their vision, to distribute it directly, and to capitalize on it directly... But the tip only comes after the meal.<p>I believe the long-term implications of this conflict were explored further by Cory Doctorow in the following:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbYXBJOFgeI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbYXBJOFgeI</a><p>Do you also disagree with him?",1356229436.0

First, an entirely only service driven site.  Second, something that involves a product or inventory.<p>It seems that a startup that has something to sell feels a little easier on the surface.  But with that comes what seems to me a ton more logistical problems.  Warehouse space, shipping, receiving, inventory.  Just the programming alone to support those additional aspects kicks up the daunting aspect a bit.<p>Then there are the completely online startups.  Sites like reddit, kickstarter, etc, where there is no inventory, nothing to ship.  A service is provided, and you make money off the service, advertising, or selling something the service has gained.<p>I have actively avoided any ideas that end up having inventory and real product.  Should I throw this out the window and consider it not that big a deal?<p>In my earlier years I have started a few businesses, all of which had product that needed to be shipped.  I remember those days, deadlines, UPS, FedEx, everything was dictated by 4PM, which was when the UPS guy came.  6PM of we were really pushing it and wanted to take the stuff to the main hub, which wasn't always feasible if it was a large order of 2000 boxes.<p>Any comments?",1356229327.0

If you were the one in charge of guaranteeing the safety of that person, its a failure much deeper and more profound than the worst startup company failure. Most people will be willing to do <i>anything</i> to prevent the loss of another life on their watch. The monitoring of communications seems almost small in comparison to the lengths that many would go to.<p>There are practical reasons for government monitoring of communications. Bad people have existed long enough that it's safe to assume the trend will continue. [1] Listening to their communications is the best way to stop them, or at least to ensure that they can't act openly. Very few innocent people will ever know that they're being monitored, and the risks to those people are very small.<p>Privacy could easily considered to be a basic right of all people. But it lives in a continuum like everything else that we value. Some times it's better if the government errs on the side of caution. And most of the time, people have nothing to hide.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents</a>",1356229301.0

There was a thread about Github latency a few months ago, and they use AJAX heavily in the source browser to hide latency, but it just seems janky to me.<p>I would be interested to hear if anybody is using AJAX to make very light sites that are accessible in Siberia and the places mentioned in this article.  I can't really think of one.  I'm sure it's possible though.<p>FWIW this is why craigslist is universally popular.  Because you can use their site from the public library with IE5 from a dialup connection!  When you're trying to overcome the chicken and egg problem of community sites, that extra population is probably pretty important.",1356228145.0

I know that Python focuses on ""only one way to do it"", but Clojure's focus is on simplicity, as defined by Rich Hickey in Simple Made Easy [1], and that is a much better focus. I find that, as Rich says (and I'm paraphrasing), simplicity is by far the most important concern when programming. It dominates all other concerns in terms of importance and payoff. I believe I have become a much better programmer since I learned Clojure and listened to Rich's talks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a>",1356228014.0
