The issue is technology.  Some people undertand it, some don't.  Dotcom says as a youth he took the time to undersatnd X.25 and PBX's.  Yet the companies using these systems did not.  Regardless of his character, it's everyone else's failure to take the same sort of interest in understanding technology, yet at the same time using it _and_ placing an enormous amount of trust in it, that leads to problems.<p>Hollywood wouldn't be in quite the same mess they're in if they aggressively pursued understanding competitive technology down to the last detail.  And why couldn't they?  It's going to eat them alive and they know it.  By becoming the ""experts"", they could stay one step ahead of competitors.  They might end up competing with themselves (the old technology), but that's inevitable anyway.  Technoloy is going to transition.  No one can stop this.  If the entertainment industry made the effort to know internet technology the best, no one could out maneuver them.<p>All Dotcom's riches are riches that would normally belong to Hollywood execs.  Why are the riches moving to nerds (many of dubious character)?  Because they are moving to the new technology.  In a sense, money doesn't care who the recipient is.  It generally moves to the technology, not the person.  Whoever understands the tech the best has the best shot at getting the money.<p>The issue here really isn't some nerd like Dotcom, or his life story, it's the transition of technology and the refusal of some who have deeply vested interests in what this technology can do (distribute entertainment), to make the effort to understand it.<p>The spy agency in NZ dismissed the gentleman who was in charge of tapping Dotcom's communications.  The news tried interviewing him and he refused to talk to them.  I'm guessing here bu I doubt he ever wanted to get involved in this mess.  Do we need covert intelliegnce to discover copyright infringement?  People are downloading free movies!  Red alert!  His dismissal seems totally unnecessary.  This whole incident should never have happened.<p>Forget about Dotcom.  It's time for the entertainment industry to come to terms with the internet.  It's early yet.  They have as good a shot as anyone to profit.  Maybe this case will finally get the message to Hollywood execs that their defensive strategies are not working.  They are not fighting people (like Dotcom) they are fighting technology.  They need to start thinking like entrepreneurs.",1350787410.0

130,4678659,comment,4677049.0,4678007.0,4,0,harshreality,,,"The arguments you've presented so far in favor of multiple keypairs on one computer (different keypairs for different remote services) make no sense.<p>Typical ssh usage is one keypair per account per machine (or one keypair per type, e.g. I have an rsa keypair and ecdsa keypaor).  It doesn't matter if you use the same keypair for github and ec2 instances [1].  The only way for the key to be compromised is if your local machine is compromised.  If the local machine is compromised, you can't trust any keys stored on it unless you know when it was compromised and you know you haven't entered the passphrase for some of the private keys since the compromise.  More than likely, you won't know that, so you will have to treat all keys on the compromised machine as compromised.  You'll have to regenerate and redistribute N keys instead of 1.<p>In your parent post, you identified physical theft as your main concern.  Assuming you have a good passphrase, physical theft is a non-issue.  Border crossing seizures and court proceedings are different; in some cases they can demand that you enter your passphrase(s), but multiple keypairs will not help you there.<p>[1] caveat: of course if you use unprompted authentication forwarding, this becomes an issue... a compromise at github for instance could allow the github hacker to ssh into your EC2 instances using forwarded credentials, but that's a time-limited attack and only works while you're connected to github.  Private keys never leave the machine(s) they're hosted on.",1350785165.0

133,4678656,comment,4678106.0,4678641.0,1,0,forensic,,,"All modern corporations do this. It's called planned obsolescence and it is NOT a conspiracy theory. It's a well established standard operating practice for the majority of companies with manufactured, mass marketed goods.<p>Planned obsolescence occurs when barriers to entry are so high that the remaining players in the market, with a wink and a nod, form a subtle cartel. These cloak and dagger cartels of course raise prices, but they also increase failure rates to extract rent.<p>This is the dark side of capitalism and what happens when capital concentrates in the hands of a small plutocracy. The health of capitalism is completely dependent on decentralized wealth. As soon as wealth starts to concentrate, oligopolies and cartels form and they put a brake on innovation in favor of rent seeking.<p>There's a documentary on this called ""The Lightbulb Conspiracy"" which is worth watching.",1350785111.0
