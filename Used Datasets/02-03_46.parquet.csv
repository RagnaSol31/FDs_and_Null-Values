If you don't take the plunge now you'll end up leaving a perfectly good career at 31 to do it anyway (most likely after reading a pg essay like myself).<p>1. Hackers learn by doing. If you enjoy tackling problems you're 3/4 of the way there. If you have ideas, you're 3/4 of the way there. Combining those two will fill in the other blanks for you. What language you use would depend on the problem space. When you pick a problem, you could always poll here for suggestions.<p>2. Don't worry if they're better or worse than you, just seek out people who love doing it. They'll eclipse everyone else in short order anyway.<p>My only add on advice is I would assume you have more college options than what you've stated. If you do like programming, you really can't go wrong at this point in history with a degree in it. I would look for less time consuming options.<p>Seriously, start your new life today. Pick a problem and start hacking away at it. Start hacking away at college options and start seeking out hacker meetups (you'll have plenty of options in NY).<p>Above all, enjoy it. Good luck.",1276657152.0

6,1434549,comment,1399956.0,1399956.0,0,0,lukelockhart,,,"This is (IMHO) how you should go about doing it yourself:<p>1)  First of all find out who your looking to speak to.  Airlines are huge.  Who in the airlines owns the process/es that your solution addresses?  Who in the organization would benefit on a day to day level from your solution?  \n- If you can't find this info from secondary research your going to have to try to speak to someone in the industry who can help you figure this out.<p>2)  Contacting People \n- Try your best to get an introduction from someone (Anyone - friend of a friend, in-law's cousin, alumni, whatever) in your network to someone in the airline.  They don't have to be the right contact to begin with.  Sometimes they're just contacts to get more contacts.  \n- I agree with what others have said about big companies being harder to break into.  People at smaller companies often know counterparts in larger companies.  So this can be a good first step.\n- Cold calling probably has the lowest success rate (you will have to make a ton of calls to even speak to someone useful)\n- Random LinkedIn messages are better, but will go mostly unanswered.  \n- Join their forums, groups, sign up for their blogs.<p>I could go on, but I have an incubator interview myself tomorrow I have to prep for.",1276656993.0

Mentally it's a really shitty experience and I'm not in a position where I have to settle for that. If I needed to do it to put food on the table, obviously I would.<p>You're also creating this false dichotomy between getting stuff done and documenting your code. I've never been in a position to have to choose between the two. If you have time to write a good program but not enough time to document it, I would question whether the program you wrote is actually good. If I'm writing a paper, sure I can spew shit out on a page for a couple hours and produce a ""paper"". But realistically if I'm actually going to produce a paper I need time for outlining and proofreading.<p>(Note that ""documentation"" isn't really what matters, it's that the code is understandable. If the code is self-documenting or the program is small enough, I consider that documented code.)",1276654250.0
