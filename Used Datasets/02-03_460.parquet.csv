The programmer needs to take care to not let this happen.<p>Not entirely true[1]:<p>> CPython currently uses a reference-counting scheme with (optional) delayed detection of cyclically linked garbage, which collects most objects as soon as they become unreachable, but is not guaranteed to collect garbage containing circular references.<p>The &quot;most object&quot; and &quot;not guaranteed&quot; refer to[2]:<p>> Objects that have __del__() methods and are part of a reference cycle cause the entire reference cycle to be uncollectable, including objects not necessarily in the cycle but reachable only from it. Python doesn’t collect such cycles automatically because, in general, it isn’t possible for Python to guess a safe order in which to run the __del__() methods. If you know a safe order, you can force the issue by examining the garbage list, and explicitly breaking cycles due to your objects within the list.<p>Note that this is Python 2 thing; in Python 3, the behavior has changed, and cycles with __del__ methods get collected. I include it because many people still use Python 2. As for Python 2, however, I believe this case is rare, and requires both an object to be involved in a cycle (a bit rare) and have a __del__ method (I&",

Few lament that nearly all of us, at some point in our lives, seek care from a physician and take all manner of medications, most without need of a prescription, for one physical ailment or another. If we can accept that it is completely normal to be medically sick, not only with transient conditions such as coughs and colds, but also chronic disorders such as farsightedness, lower back pain, high blood pressure or diabetes, why can’t we accept that it might also be normal to be psychiatrically ill at various points in our lives? The answer seems to be that psychiatric disorders carry a much greater degree of stigma compared with medical conditions. People worry that psychiatrists think everyone is crazy because they make the mistake of equating any form of psychiatric illness with being crazy. But that’s like equating a cough with tuberculosis or lung cancer.</i><p><a href=""http://aeon.co/magazine/being-human/have-psychiatrists-lost-perspective-on-mental-illness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aeon.co/magazine/being-human/have-psychiatrists-lost-...</a>",1396059798.0
