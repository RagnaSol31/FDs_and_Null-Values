In my experience taking over Python code written by Java developers, I can usually shrink their OO code and make it more reliable by refactoring it into conceptually equivalent functional code wherever it makes sense and falling back on procedural style where appropriate.",1342321124.0

It's an indication they have no clue what they are talking about and also don't consider carbon emissions a serious problem.<p>Many studies have been done on fracking, and there is every indication that with sound regulation and proper practices it is a perfectly safe technique for extracting natural gas. More so, using natural gas for energy instead of oil or especially coal is an enormous carbon emissions win. Far greater than any hybrid or even all electric vehicle technology can achieve. To write it off as an evil because you heard some anecdotal evidence somewhere just proves you don't take the fundamental problems of energy production and the environment seriously.",1342321050.0

But that's not how the source code usually looks, and there are Lisp compilers which optimize it so it's not done as a conditional.<p>In CLOS, it will look as a separate DEFMETHOD for each type you want to define the function on, and these can be in separate modules.  DEFMETHOD will just extend the generic function.  And the function itself can be optimized to use the normal tricks -- things kind of like vtables -- to optimize performance.<p>The S3 example is a bit facile since (1) S3 objects are like mud, they're all the same and (2) they map cleanly to the OO paradigm since they encapsulate discrete chunks of external state.  At the other end we can throw around examples like BLAS and LAPACK, whose functions are much closer to the ""functional ideal"" (ignoring mutability, here).  For example, if I want to solve a linear equation, how do I express that as a single dispatch method?  Does it go on the matrix, or on the vector?  Or do I have to create a new object from the two called LinearSystem, just so I can invoke a single method?<p>We think about things in terms of coupled data, as pure functions, and as dirty generic functions (like the Lisp example).

A better approach I think is for state to be approached declaratively and with constraints.  This is why things like foreign keys, check constraints, etc. in the RDBMS world are so nice. In fact good db design usually has a lot to do with eliminating possible state errors.  Wouldn't it be great if OOP environments gave that possibility!

The counterargument to the OP is that surely a function that manipulates ""data"" is less powerful and abstract than one that manipulates objects.<p>For example, take an ""interface"" or abstract data type like Array, consisting of a length() and a get(i) method.  (This is really called List in Java and Seq in Scala.)  There may even be an associated type, A, such that all items are of type A.  This is very powerful because functions written against the Array interface don't depend on the implementation; we can store the data different ways, calculated it on demand, etc.<p>The ""binding together"" Joe is complaining about is binding the implementation of length() and get(i) to the implementation of the data structure, which is surely understandable.  The alternative, seen in Lisps and other ""verb-oriented"" languages, is that there is a global function called ""length"" which takes an object... er, a value... and desperately tries to figure out how to measure its length properly, perhaps with a giant conditional.<p>The original OO (SmallTalk) was about message passing rather than abstract data types; just the idea that an object was responsible for responding to certain messages, and that these communication patterns completely characterized the object.  This is how we think about modern cloud services, too; it's kind of inevitable.  Who would complain that S3's ""functions"" and ""data"" are too coupled?  Who would ask for a description of S3 in terms of what sequence of calls to car and cdr it makes internally?  OO concepts allow a functional description of a system that starts at the top and can stop at any point.<p>The ""everything is an object"" philosophy gets a bad rap.  It's a big pain in Java, especially, because of how the type system works.  Ideally I'd be able to define a type of ints between 1 and 3, an obvious subclass of ints in general, whereas in Java I find myself declaring ""class [or enum] IntBetweenOneAndThree"" or some nonsense.",1342317920.0
