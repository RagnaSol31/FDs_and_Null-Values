Outlook (even though I hate other things about it) allows me to deal with meetings in UK and many places in US without even knowing what timezones people are in.

I'll usually say something like ""Does eleven work for you?"", meaning 11am.

6,3201683,comment,3200828.0,3201083.0,6,0,clumsysmurf,,,"As an android developer, this has me very concerned. I am worried that the subset of Java that Android comes with diverges more and more over time from the official implementation, and Android's subset becomes the new IE6.<p>Over time, i expect more and more libraries that I use which were not designed specifically for Android, but work fine nonetheless - to begin having issues with the java subset provided by Android unless Google works hard to keep their subset up to par.<p>Already, Android seems like its own little island without much of an ecosystem.<p>It seems both Mac and Windows' respective platforms are converging; this will make it easy to share code between respective variants of those operating systems, although there will be unique considerations to be made in terms of the UI for each form factor.<p>Google does not communicate future plans about these things, and I'm not convinced they have the resources and wherewithal to keep Android's Java subset on par with official Java. Especially without the java compatibility test tools. I feel as if Google has been limping along just barely enough with Android to keep up with iOS and and soon, WP7/8.<p>Part of me wishes Google would just work something out with Oracle so that we can use an official implementation of Java on Android  or just get rid of Java altogether and use another language.",1320548198.0

It just happens that the implementation of slices in the python interpreter creates a new list for a slice. You may say it is 'obvious' that it works like that, in python, I will agree with you. You might not be able to say the same thing for other languages, especially if you haven't used them before.<p>The problem is, even with a simple knowledge of slices, someone reading your code may not realise that list1 is actually a new list; you are depending upon a side-effect of the language. If you used the Copy module, or even the list constructor, it would have been much clearer that list1 is a new list. This increases readability, which is very important if other people, or even yourself in the future re-read the code.

A company doesn't start with 0 servers and buy 200. They start with 5, then add 15, then 30, then 50. After three years they get to 200. Then they start replacing them in waves. New generations of hardware become more efficient, you can actually save money by replacing old hardware.<p>The ""platform spread"" is inevitable. Besides that it is impossible to physically replace all your servers at once, the bean counters also prefer it to be spread out. They don't want to replace $1,000,000 worth of servers every four years, they would rather replace $250,000 every year.<p>Sysadmins and devs shouldn't really care if they have five generations of hardware. There are a few things that matter so new hardware fits into the infrastructure, like having IPMI, serial ports for console redirection, enough RAM to run the apps. Try to keep as much as possible the same, like it is way better to only have 3 models of spare power supply to keep in stock vs keeping 20 models. Beyond that I don't think it matters.

What's your argument for this?<p>There are two basic components in house prices: the cost of land and the cost of construction.<p>Land is essentially scarce. Sure there is lots more land that we haven't built on than we have (particularly in Australia) but desirability comes into play here as do infrastructure costs. There is only so far you can effectively live from work centres. The further you have to build out the more roads, public transport (if you even have it), water, electricity, etc cost.<p>Land has certainly increased in value in Australia but a huge component of the increases is in the cost of construction. Nowadays it's hard to build a house for less than about $200,000. That is (IMHO) a huge problem. Building apartments now is in most capital cities prohibitively expensive for the middle class.<p>To give you an example, I pay less for my one bedroom in downtown Manhattan than the apartment I used to live in in West Perth now costs. <i>Manhattan</i>.<p>Conventional wisdom is that property is a good hedge against inflation. The massive inflation in construction costs should tell you something about inflation. Despite what the ABS may say about the CPI, the standard of living in Australia has dropped massively in the last decade, particularly in Perth.<p>This probably mirrors the massive housing inflation and the after-effects you saw in Sydney in the 70s and 80s, which results in those with homes being cash-poor and asset-rich and those left standing when the music stopped just being poor.<p>You just can't compare what's happening in the US and Australia. In the US in many large cities you can still buy a house for <$100,000. Where can you say that in Australia?",1320546248.0

93,3201595,comment,3200852.0,3201576.0,17,0,umarmung,,,"There is really only ONE possible and proven sustainable solution to this mess. It was realised in the aftermath of worst financial crisis ever seen, the Great Depression. It worked so well to create such stability, or at least certainly did not cause any harm to the real economy for so long, that the world saw the longest sustained period of growth it has ever seen and is also considered by all economists to be the ""golden age"" of capitalism from 1945 to 1971 (they only differ on precisely how the combination of all factors came together).<p>The solution in the aftermath of the Great Depression was Glass-Steagal and capital controls globally. This meant,<p>1. The money supply effectively only circulated <i>within</i> each country and transfers between countries were always linked to trade. Since jobs follow business investment, this meant very high employment per nation.<p>2. Financial instability had minimal to zero systemic impact in advanced countries because banks were only permitted to engage in funding and financing directly related to the real economy.<p>3. In addition, a side effect due to the partitioning and lack of artificial wealth interconnectedness, TBTF was not possible.<p>4. All manner of speculators were able to exist even then, but they knew they only had one chance with the capital they had since completely different types of financial activity were not allowed to co-mingle under the same organisation or group.<p>5. Finally, money was linked to the gold standard and debt creation (including printing) that did not relate to trade was very difficult - though not impossible, especially for governments which wanted to run or extend huge war machines for their empires.<p>Having to pay for the Vietnam War and coinciding with domestic inflation, caused Nixon to move the dollar off the gold standard in 1971, a fitting end to the Golden Age on 15 August 1971. Almost exactly 40 years later, here we are - in real (inflation-adjusted) economic terms per capita for median person effectively back to square zero with the worst in the real economy still to come as the ripples of the crises continue on through entire sovereigns.<p>An alternative way to look at it, is that the combination of financial deregulation and financial ""innovation"" since 1980 caused capital to move well-ahead of the globalisation of the real economy. Like a very strong wave, it caused ripples and bubbles in the assets available to it before real growth and high quality assets (including highly educated workers) backing it caught up. In a sense, the financial industry became too efficient at shifting liquidity and wealth transfer relative to the underlying economy. Combine this with the enormous increase in money supply generated by the political masters of the new fiat currencies, this meant the mother of all deleveraging and financial crisis was being deferred into the future. Well, the future is here now.<p>In short, there is a reason why in every country above subsistence level in the world, the financial industry is almost as heavily regulated as the nuclear industry. Like writing a good, large and complex computer program, having a few huge procedures with many side effects is far worse along every dimension than having many much smaller and well-organised functions with minimal to no side-effects.<p>The solution is ""Compartmentalization"" aka. Glass-Steagall on steroids for the financial industry. It is even advocated by high profile economists and others who publicly foresaw the 2007 crisis.",1320546208.0

Out of curiosity, though, does anyone have numbers on the ""spread the word"" free model? I'd love to see some hard evidence (it that's even possible to collect) that it works.<p>A lot of people are essentially saying ""focusing on album sales to the exclusion of free streaming is shortsighted"" -- but how do we know that's true, aside from an intuitive gut reaction? Are tour revenues for Spotify artists increasing? Are more people going to gigs? There must be numbers somewhere.<p>I should also note that a large percentage of tour revenues are from album sales; I don't know to what extent Spotify is cannibalizing those. So it's true that tour revenue is probably the number one income source, but don't forget how important physical merch sales are on those tours.",1320545429.0

Or put more bluntly five years from now, will I even need Dropbox? asks Schonfeld.<p>I'm not sure it's fair to compare Dropbox to something like Twitter or Instagram. I think they only store photos, while Dropbox can store whatever files you need it to. I'd say the majority of people would probably store photos and videos, but there are some who like to back up important documents, books, and other work.",1320545371.0
