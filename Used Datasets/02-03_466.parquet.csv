You can steam events directly into a table or proxy then through your server to add more metadata.  You can even use mixpanels great open source client libraries and point them at your servers.<p>Initially I was worried that we would miss mixpanels built in analysis and tools but we honestly preferred querying a database with SQL better. The tricky queries are the funnels but once you wrote the query once you can just save the template. The only thing we had to build was a chrome extension that could graph the results of an arbitrary query.,1411958033.0

The tech community, developers and data folks need to understand that all A/B is not equal.

It has also been pointed out elsewhere that this particular study was/is illegal, violating certain state laws on Common Rule practice regardless of funding source. I hope that board members and the C-suite take a new leadership role to educate their teams as to what acceptable and legal A/B should look like.",1411956010.0
