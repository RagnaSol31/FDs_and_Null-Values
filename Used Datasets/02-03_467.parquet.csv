Growth drives everything in this world. Growth is why startups usually work on technologybecause ideas for fast growing companies are so rare that the best way to find new ones is to discover those recently made viable by change, and technology is the best source of rapid change. Growth is why it's a rational choice economically for so many founders to try starting a startup: growth makes the successful companies so valuable that the expected value is high even though the risk is too. Growth is why VCs want to invest in startups: not just because the returns are high but also because generating returns from capital gains is easier to manage than generating returns from dividends. Growth explains why the most successful startups take VC money even if they don't need to: it lets them choose their growth rate. And growth explains why successful startups almost invariably get acquisition offers. To acquirers a fast-growing company is not merely valuable but dangerous too.""",1348281936.0

For example, you say ""reality is what it is and all the words in the world won't change it"" but when the reality in question is the words, actions, and beliefs of people we all know that that statement is categorically false.  The wrong words, the wrong discussions, the legitimisation of wrong arguments can all have a disproportionate effect and impede or even reverse some of the progress we've made.  For example, it may or may not be the case that the average XY male has an inherently slightly higher propensity for physical strength as compared to the average XX female but any time a study suggests ""yes"" or ""no"" the discussions surrounding it greatly exaggerate the potential difference discussed.  Especially with the way science is reported today, proof positive of a real difference that is still dwarfed by training would enter the public consciousness as an insurmountable gap that some would take to justify various forms of oppressing women.<p>Of course, we are talking about science and some people hold the ridiculous belief that the human element doesn't matter and we should just discuss the truth and thus everything above is irrelevant.  Except, even if we legitimize that point of view, the truth is: we don't know.  The state of the research on real, meaningful, inherent differences is largely inconclusive except for some highly specialized and specific results.  For example, it's common knowledge that the best distance runners are disproportionately often Kenyan but this doesn't take into account the relative effect from genetics, environment, and training and it also doesn't imply that being Kenyan makes you better at running.  When we look at it we can't say there's a difference between races or nationalities because we don't know that; we just know that some combination of factors has balanced the scales in an interesting fashion.  With the exception of certain disease/condition frequencies, this is some of the <i>best</i> data we have for real differences between races or sexes.  Generally speaking, even if we could do a study to compare everybody alive now from group A with everybody alive now from group B (say all XY-males with all XX-females) and properly accounted for other variables and measured a real difference we still have no way of knowing where the differences come from as far as ""nature"" or ""nurture"" goes.<p>Furthermore, there are adequate studies suggesting that, regardless of natural tendencies, the environmental/training effect can be greatly affected just by the simple act of telling someone they can or cannot do something or fit some role.  That is, it might be the case that American XY-males today are better (by whatever quantitative measure) at math and science than American XX-females today strictly by environmental factors and that by repeating ""men are better at math than women"" we are exacerbating and continuing this problem.<p>Now, all this said, it shouldn't be the case that all differences are strictly off-limits since, for example, there is a high incidence of lactose intolerance among south Asians and an incredibly low incidence among northern Europeans so menus for both groups absent other information would likely have necessary differences.  And, given an equal society with a different mind towards things data on other differences might be interesting.  But, widely speaking, discussions on potential differences is necessarily an area of little to no information and has high potential to be actively harmful to society.",1348280119.0

I like this because I can take something like 'Samsung TV Remote' which looks like 'Sams...ote' on my phone and change it to ""TV Remote""<p>3) BrowserChanger: This allows me to install Google Chrome as my browser, and open all URLs by default in Chrome instead of safari (So I get all my synced bookmarks, etc. Opening a link from another app like Alien Blue, will use chrome instead of safari, as well as 'home screen' shortcuts)<p>4) ColoredKnob: Allows you to change the 'scroll to unlock' icon colour and size.<p>5) MissionBoard: Triple-Home-Click will open a MissionControl style background-app selector which shows screenshots of the apps in their current state on a nice background.<p>6) Torch: Adds a nice little icon next to the clock on the lock screen to enable flashlight torch.<p>7) Weather Icon: Causes the 'Weather' app to display the actual weather with icon and temperature. Runs based on the first weather screen, which can be set to 'local weather'.<p>8) Zeppelin: Customise the carrier logo. You can choose from things like the apple icon and countless others, which I like instead of having a giant ""YES OPTUS"" on my screen.<p>9) Adblock: Blocks ads.<p>10) SBSettings: Allows me to swipe my status bar to quickly toggle options like 3G / Wifi / Brightness. etc. You can also download themes to make this look more like a iOS native application.<p>11) NoNewsIsGoodNews: Disables the Newsstand icon which I have NEVER used in iOS.<p>12) Springflash: Enables me to double-tap the power button for a torch.. Not really necessary but I like it.<p>13) YTOpener: Automatically opens any youtube links in the new Google YouTube app. Works awesomely well.<p>14) LSMusicGestures: Adds swipe gestures for music controls to my lock screen. I love this as I dont have ipod controls on my car stereo. It allows me to do things like swipe to skip song, or double-tap to pause/resume a song. This is awesome as it means I no longer have to look at the phone, or try hitting the tiny buttons on the screen while driving.<p>Doing all of this took about 30 minutes, doesn't do anything to make my phone look 'tacky', and had no issues at all.<p>Can't believe I havn't been doing this since the day I got my 4S.

Apple gets a lot of ""free help"" from the media, not to mention Hollywood, that other companies normally have to pay for.<p>I don't think he's suggesting that Apple has full control over what is said about them.<p>But that's sort of the point, they don't have to worry about that as much as other companies.  They do not have to spend as much time and money trying to control the negative portrayals and carefully releasing positive ones.   The media is flooded with positives about Apple.  And Apple gets them for free.",1348279281.0

He's entertaining and probably smarter and more focused than 99% of people but his poor arguments make me think he's not a precise thinker and isn't mentally flexible. I wonder if he'd be able to answer this question: What would he have to be persuaded of to change his mind on this topic? (I wonder what everyone including myself would answer to this question.)<p>I wonder what his motivation is. Is he upset by poor performance in his personal account and wants to blame someone? Does he buy the shockingly confused media hype? Is he threatened by something he incompletely understands? Is he  doing it to get even more attention? Is he trying to seem intelligent or gain even more status by jumping on a bandwagon to criticize a popular scapegoat?,1348279271.0

Now HFT is at a disadvantage as they have less scope to make their spread (essentially the other side must already be in the Market) but that's where if all other Market makers disappeared (and the stock slowed down) HFTs must become LFTs and hey presto are indistinguishable from the old style Market maker<p>yes there is a price point issue but most buyers really have a range they will buy at so more precisely I am conjecturing that there are minimal benefits to an exchange to having more than one Market maker at a given stock within a given price range.<p>How to provethat - not sure",1348279264.0

Decentralization will benefit other <i>organizations</i>, such government agencies, companies, non-profits, NGOs, etc. These organizations most likely have other services running on either their own infrastructure or they have some one else paid to host it.
