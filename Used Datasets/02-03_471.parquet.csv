This is not runtime configurable/negotiatable.<p>Traditionally USB transceivers were designed as either master or slave (host/peripheral), though with the rise of smart peripherals (embedded/mobile devices) came need for both in one device. Manufacturers could design product with 2 different USB transceivers or use one that is configurable to either master or slave.<p>If you examine any mini/micro USB port/plug you will find 5 pins, and 4 pins on a large (both A and B). That extra pin is actually a toggle for OTG transceiver mode. Of course manufacturers can decide to internally wire transceiver to any mode and expose only data/power pins, but that does not stop transceiver from being OTG. Exactly this is done in top Android tables from mentioned site - they have nVidia Tegra SoC which actually uses OTG transceivers.<p>I am not intimate with PC hardware (would expect master-only transceivers), but, as I have said before, all embedded SoCs I have laid my hands on (not too many) used either slave-only or OTG transceivers.",1434681247.0

Unless you replace the water very, very frequently (like every day or so), the recommended amount of water is 10 gallons (~40 liters) <i>per fish</i>!  Most people put gold fish in ridiculously inappropriate bowls/tanks and think that they live for only a few months or a year.<p>As someone else pointed out, the reason your fish lived longer when you fed them less is because you were reducing the amount of ammonia (from rotting food, or from fish waste) in the water.",1434679750.0

Interrupt happened between the two writes, so the task scheduler wrote the wrong value to the register and stopped. Finding the problem: Two weeks. Fixing the problem: Swapped two instructions and rebuilt. Write-only registers are evil badness.<p>- USB controller with a temperature problem: It would also work first thing in the morning, and after lunch. After maybe four days of correlating this the &quot;Aha!&quot; was visible on my face at lunch and I left the table rather abruptly. The initial fix was a bag of ice on the chip. Real fix took several weeks of increasingly loud conversations with the chip vendor.<p>- Cache on a disk drive had a bad bit, occasionally corrupting file contents or (even more fun) directory structures.
