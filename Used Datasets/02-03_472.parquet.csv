Every single Palestinian is treated like a terrorist--children, old people, families. When the soldiers decide to close the gates, no one gets in or out.<p>I was there for three weeks. It's the world's largest prison. And it's funded by U.S. tax dollars and people who invest in the ""Jewish"" state. The expansion of Israeli settlements continue as more and more Palestinian land is confiscated for this technical reason or that.<p>Israel should be treated as a pariah until they end the occupation and give one person one vote instead of treating an entire population like prisoners.",1340161155.0
1,4135417,comment,4135354.0,4135354.0,1,0,pbsd,,,"Impressive computation, but not much new here. The problem solved was a discrete logarithm over the finite field GF(3^(97*6)), which is known to be ""easy"" due to the low complexity of the function field sieve, asymptotically similar to the special number field sieve used to break 1039-bit integers a few years back (eprint.iacr.org/2007/205).<p>This is relevant because pairing-based cryptosystems require that logarithms be difficult to solve both in the elliptic curve groups (in this case E(GF(3^97))), and in the finite field groups that result from pairing evaluations. What failed here was the latter, due to the function field sieve.<p>There aren't many details on this computation, but you can get a good hint of how this was done by the previous paper of the same group (676 bits last time): <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/090"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/090</a><p>TL;DR Don't use low embedding degrees for pairing-based crypto, and you'll be fine.",1340161090.0

It's not as if the Chinese (or the US or whomever) were not spearfishing each other or using other methods to extricate sensitive information.<p>One other difference is that this is equivalent to low-grade but effective sabotage.  I guess we can expect more of this kind of sabotage, yet, it's not as though there aren't state actors and non-state actors attempting this kind of sabotage for either economic, political, military or other reasons on a routine basis.<p>I also imagine there are tacit rules by which they 'play'.  That is, some is expected, some frowned upon, but seen as par for the cyber course, but other things might be seen as totally off-limits (like remotely sabotaging a reservoir's gates sitting atop a city).

Supposedly this is because the fewer calories you consume the less exposure your body has to free radicals that are important in aging.

You specifically mention using subdomains as user pages, but that's not necessarily how I'd do an SaaS app (or how too many others do).  How do you bundle pricing and billing into an SaaS app beyond providing making certain libraries available?  What payment provider are you using?  Paypal?  Braintree?  Stripe?  That depends on the subscription model you want to implement.  Is your app a 30 day bill cycle?  Paid yearly?  Billed on the first of every month?  Does it offer a 12-month prepay discount? What happens if account isn't paid up immediately?  Is there a 30 day grace period?  Is the account disabled immediately?<p>These are all decisions that each app has to make for themselves, and while sure, some of it could perhaps be rolled into a 'framework' that sits on Django or RoR, it's going to be difficult to get anywhere close to something most people wouldn't have to change.<p>As the target market for this would almost certainly be developers who can take a few libraries off of GitHub, tailor them to themselves, and have all the above functionality implemented within a day, I'd be surprised to find if something existed in the way you want.",1340159452.0

However, they shared a lot of underlying conventions, and they were honest about bumping the major version number.<p>If anything, the fact that jwz is happy he proved--that you can build an OpenGL 1.3 emulation library over OpenGL ES--would argue to me to /not/ include the 1.x features as part of the standard, but to instead encourage third parties to distribute such libraries.
