Astronomical objects have an extremely large dynamic range in terms of brightness. If you've ever looked at a galaxy through a telescope, you'll see what I mean. You just see a blob that's the bright central bulge. The brightness distribution in a galaxy falls off <i>exponentially</i> with radius. If you amplify the signal to see the faint outer parts, the central part would hurt your eyes (or, practically speaking, saturate).<p>We made a movie of a simulated galaxy merger for a competition last year: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agqLEbOFT2A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agqLEbOFT2A</a>  In this rendering, the colors are approximately realistic, but the brightness is not. For my own education, I made an alternative rendering with just a fixed linear stretch that should more realistically (barring monitor gamma) mimic what the eye would see. In that movie (I've been meaning to upload it), you basically only see the centers of the two galaxies, nothing else.<p>So the bottom line is, to see any detail you <i>must</i> ""manipulate"" these images. It's reminiscent of High-Dynamic Range photography [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging</a>], where you compress the range of brightnesses to be able to convey a scene in one image.",1252551455.0

Site X with text links on it is not (necessarily) less useful then a site with declared ads on it. The quality assurance issue is the effect these have on Google's ability to analyse the web. Google's way of preventing site X from doing this is by intimidating. They are <i>not</i> removing the site because it is so spamy that they don't want it on their search results (a case that is equivalent to HN deciding to ban a site). They are doing it because they want these sites to comply with some sort of practice. It is the publicity and threat of these penalties which are their 'raison d'etre.'<p>I have no problem at all with Google using whatever policies they want to make up the search results. Including kicking sites off. I do have a problem with Google threatening to do so in order to achieve some other goal.<p>> Which hurts Google's users as well, spam hurts us all, spam sucks. Google is correct here in removing sites which partake in such practices.<p>Perhaps. But it is doing so by exercising its power to shut down the internet (for that site) to enforce a standard. Google decided at some point that all paid links need to be marked in a special way. This is the standard for disclosure. They then use their power to enforce it.",1252548440.0
