1,2278280,comment,2277213.0,2277213.0,0,0,latj,,,The problem is that the different dimensions to the products dont actually exist. Getting those measurements would come at a great cost. The question is would it be cheaper than shipping returns?\nAnother question- China has industrialized- the next step is dealing in information. When will the suppliers realize they are losing out on a lot of money by not doing the photography and measurement at the factory?,1299034706.0

This may be true in code or maths, where less verbosity makes the point better, but I am somewhat convinced the point of most discourse is to disseminate understanding.<p>Since it is people who do the understanding, some repetition, while wasting bytes or words[1], certainly helps maximize reader comprehension. Even math and CS journal papers quote things, not just put pointers. That is wasteful repetition don't you think?<p>I look at it as an optimization problem. There are at least two variables -- number of words and reader comprehension[2]. The goal is information transfer between people. To minimize or maximize any one of those variables may result in non-optimal information transfer. Instead there may need to be some repetition rather than pointers for some things.<p>[1] There are serious questions at this point whether at the scale of HN discussions there is such a thing as limited resources for data storage, bandwidth, etc (and given the level of intellect here, even reading time is almost trivial for a lot of posts).<p>[2] There are lots of confounding variables, such as the intelligence and prior knowledge of any given reader, the eloquence of the writer, the complexity of the point being made etc.",1299031825.0
