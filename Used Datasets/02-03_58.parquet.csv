If a worker goes down because of a system crash or network failure, then that job wouldn't get processed again for 5 minutes. That's (for us) an acceptable overhead. There's a chance the job gets processed twice, if it gets locked, work gets done, but releasing the lock fails. That's a trade-off we're willing to make as we can't really think of any better solution.<p>I believe, since redis has built-in support for expiring records, this maybe even easier.\nTo process job 332, you would try to check the existence of 'lock:332' and then set it if it didn't exist, and give it an expiry time.<p>Would be interested in hearing how other people solve these types of issues.",1309747629.0

Nobody suggested you take out a warranty on things you can probably live without, like a toaster, iPod or TiVo.<p>Other things like a washing machine, you might do, because losing access to it incurs extra costs: taking things to the laundrette, travel to friends, etc. (if you're in a rural area I hope you know people there). This is especially the case if it's work-related equipment.<p>In the case of something that is too expensive to replace without insurance, you just decided that the cost of insurance is greater than the opportunity cost of using a cheaper/inferior good <i>over the time period covered by the insurance</i>. Do you really think that's true in all circumstances?<p>What you should not do is look at insurance narrow-mindedly and declare it a great big scam because the mathematics works in their favour. Well, no shit. They are paid to remove risk, they can't do that if it's an unsustainable business.

At a previous job our entire API used UTC. It was clean and worked at every layer of the app, from django to our client-side javascript. When we needed to display a human readable version, we did the translation at render time. All interactions with time as data was done with the UTC timestamp and saved much headache.<p>A couple months before I left, one of the engineers proposed switching everything over to a textual representation according to ISO_8601. I forget the nature of the argument, but it was inane(to me). This actually led an extensive back/forth email exchange between various members of engineering, me as one of the frontend engineers, and even the engineering manager who seemed to favor the idea.<p>I argued, ""why change the entire stack which works just fine, etc etc"".

The only measure of demand you site is Manufacturer's New Orders, which does show an increase.

Classes and prototypes are both way to make objects. With a prototype, you start with an actual object as an example, and make more objects just like it. With a class, you start with the abstract set of properties that describe a type of object, and make more objects from that blueprint.<p>Think of it as the Platonic ideal of a thing (the class), versus the canonical example of a thing (the prototype).<p>To get specific: The idea of Bicycle, versus my blue bike with red streamers.
