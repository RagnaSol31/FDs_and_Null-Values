His 'Logic' deals with correct arguments.<p>However, I do think that there are cases where an ad hominem is correct however. If someone's argument is based on his own authority, and his authority is widely acknowledged, then the only way to attack the argument is to attack the arguer. One example is the repeated misuse of Einstein as an authority om things like economics or theology.",1206845197.0

I agree with the application however, for one to brook disagreement with another, one should usually understand the subject better than that person. This implies understanding your opponent's arguments better than your opponent. If don't understand your opponents arguments better than he, who are you to say that he is wrong in making them?<p>(trivia about Aquinas: his handwriting was so bad, that there are only about 10 people or so in the world today that can read it.)",1206844167.0
9,149822,comment,149482.0,149677.0,0,0,ericb,,,"Some tips:<p>To see how something works, break it and unbreak it in many different ways. Sometimes the part you <i>think</i> does something isn't it. You don't know code well until you know how it acts when broken. Seeing what error messages mean will help you recognize them in your own code. Hotkeys are good. Ctrl-Z (undo) and Ctrl-Y (redo) are great for breaking/unbreaking code. Version control will be useful at some point.<p>Change one thing at a time when fixing bugs, or you'll never know what fixed it. Afterwards, explain what happened.<p>Do not make changes without a reason--that's a short path to cargo-culting. Read the doc, then use the scientific method--hypothesize something, then test. Rinse, lather, repeat. Otherwise, you're just guessing and will waste infinite time, like a Shakespeare-typing monkey.<p>When borrowing code, understand it, or it will cost you in the long run. Stripping code to the bare minimum or adapting it is a good way to know what parts do what, even if you just use the original.<p>Remove lines you ""think"" you need in your solutions and see if they still work. If a line of code isn't necessary, but is not hurting anything, remove it anyway.<p>I have no idea how people coded before Google, and it scares the crap out of me. Paste in your errors with variable names removed. Invest time to become a Google search pro.<p>If you haven't tested it, it's best to consider it broken.",1206844045.0

Winning arguments change no perspectives (unless you are arguing with saints).<p>The reason they don't is that ideas are not trees. There is no root node. We are not deductive thinkers. We do not trace out the implications of ideas to their ends because they have no ends.<p>More often, we learn ideas that ripple a little in the neighborhood while the rest of our knowledge remains unchanged. Further, in some cases, the evidence may be mixed, and our idea graph won't change at all.<p>Kuhn would probably say that there is no way for a scientific revolutionary to argue with a conventional scientist because the purpose of a revolution is to change the context to a different set of concerns, a different language, a different problem.<p>Einstein couldn't argue with Newtonian physics in Newtonian terms. The point of general relativity isn't to refute the central point of Newtonian physics (whether you think that's the inverse square law or gravitation or the laws of motion, etc.). You might say Einstein was ""refuting"" some naive conceptions of space and energy, but no one had proven they were naive before he exposed them.<p>Einstein provided a fertile perspective that allowed others to see the old science and data in a new way. But this has nothing to do with winning arguments. It's DH{NaN}.<p>Acting like Einstein's work is a rung up the ladder to Final Physical Knowledge is a positivist view akin to the belief that evolution is creating the ubermensch (in some objective sense). There are lots of local minima out there. There is always another perspective to take on the same data.<p>Refutation should be reserved for stuff that's obvious to clear-thinking people.<p>Of course, that begs the question...",1206843295.0

Allocation of investment is the heart of a capitalist economy. In a socialist economy, investment is dispensed from a central location. In a capitalist economy such as ours, where there are many competition-driven individual firms, we benefit from each of them making wise investment decisions.<p>Investment firms literally decide how we spend our accrued wealth. I can't think of a better place to send our best and brightest.",1206842899.0
21,149810,comment,149708.0,149797.0,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"I don't think you can argue that excessive leverage is the result of low interest rates.  LTCM, which was levered around 30 to 1, operated in an environment where the Fed funds rate was around 6%, not 1%.  Likewise, Japan has had extremely low (even 0%) overnight interest rates since the 90s, but there hasn't been an explosion of Japanese hedge funds to the extent that there's been an explosion of American ones.<p>People have found ways to lever themselves rather through derivatives, rather than simple borrowing of cash... e.g. if you want levered exposure to a portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds, you don't borrow money and invest in cash bonds.  You get an investment bank to structure a bespoke synthetic CDO tranche which, according to your single-factor Gaussian copula model, gives you exactly the risk and return that you want.  If you want levered exposure to interest rates, you don't borrow money and speculate on Treasury notes; you pay (or receive) on an interest rate swap whose notional amount is far greater than the amount of cash you have.  With the current state of derivatives regulation, people will be playing these games whether Fed funds is at 0% or 10%.<p>I will grant you that giving fund managers a call option on their returns isn't a great idea.  It has the advantage of being cheap, since the value of a call option is less than the underlying.  But at the same time, the value of a call option increases in value as the volatility of the underlying increases.  So not only do hedge fund managers have incentive to get good returns, they have an incentive to get volatile returns as well -- this leads to perhaps more risk-taking than is necessary.<p>Edit: and the funny thing is that JWM Partners, Meriwether's post-LTCM fund, is supposedly down 20% this year.  To be fair, they apparently did a pretty good job from 2000-2008 or so.",1206842859.0

Most of the people I work with  are pretty smart, but I haven't come across too many geniuses (I am certainly not one).  Wall Street draws different types of people: the type of ""talent"" attracted to a corporate finance/investment job is very different from the type of ""talent"" attracted to trading.  Different kind of intelligence, different tolerance for risk, different personality.<p>One thing is for certain: investment banks and hedge funds aren't going to be hiring as many people in the next year or two.",1206842420.0
