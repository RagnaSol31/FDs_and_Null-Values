2,695130,comment,695040.0,695040.0,0,0,mdasen,,,"I'd have the opposite take on the title ""lifestyle business"".  The opposite is really the ""get rich or die trying"" business.  The opposite are the businesses that can only survive as long as they keep coming out with some new novelty until they're bought without necessarily creating a sound business.<p>Lifestyle business means that you have your priorities right.  The purpose of business and money is making life easier and nicer.  Life's purpose isn't business and money.  The problem is that we put people like Mark Cuban on a pedestal for creating something that couldn't make money and didn't create much value simply because someone else was stupid enough to pay billions for it in a frenzy.  At the same time, we don't have a lot of respect for people like the restaurant owner who does a consistent good job because what he does can never have the ""infini-scale"" of large web projects and get bought for billions.<p>Of course, as we've seen, the ""infini-scale"" almost never happens.  Really, what company that was purchased in all the .com land rushes has made the owner much money?  Not broadcast.com, not YouTube, not Geocities, not AOL, not FeedBurner, not Jaiku, not Dodgeball. . .  But all of them were acquired for tons of money.  They played ""get rich or die trying"" and got rich while making nothing that lasts up to that measure.<p>Lifestyle businesses aren't about who works harder.  It's about creating known value rather than the latest fad.  It's about giving customers something good at a fair price rather than trying to corner the market, exercise the synergies, actualize the growth potential, or whatever other marketing speak one would use to get a large, scared player to buy you when you have no profit potential.  Lifestyle businesses are about humbly giving people something good and knowing that you're making a positive impact on their lives.  Maybe you aren't ""game changing"", but people appreciate a good business.",1247108292.0

I ride about 200 miles per month on the seg, and use it for all of my workaday transportation.  Gave my Volvo to my Mom in fact -- I just don't use it anymore.<p>Too true, when I first bought the Segway I was afraid that I might play with it for a couple of weeks and then stow it in the garage.  But instead it became really useful to me, and a lot of fun to boot.  I never get tired of it.<p>Everything works in my favor: my office is less than two miles away from my front door.  I live in Central Florida, where I can use the seg year 'round -- no pesky snow and ice to have to deal with.  The sidewalks go everywhere I want to go, they are smooth and well maintained, and the curbs all have wide cutouts.  Relatively few people ride bicycles or walk (suburban Florida sprawl encourages long distance commutes) so the sidewalks are my private highway.<p>The drive to work used to take me seven minutes in my Volvo, and takes twelve on the Segway.  Not having to face the morons on the road first thing in the morning is worth the price of admission all by itself.<p>Cost?  About US$5000, give or take.  20 miles costs about 1KWH of electricity, so figure that at about $0.13 where I live.  Add in a set of tires at $80 after 3,000 miles.<p>I commute to work, come home for lunch, run small errands, sometimes riding 15-20 miles r/t.  A perfect fit for my lifestyle and locale, and I'm not a sweaty mess when I get where I'm going.<p>What I don't do is take it into stores and malls.  I mean, that's just stupid if you're not handicapped.  Park it outside, like I would a bicycle.<p>I'm obsessively polite -- my seg is the first one that most people have seen in the wild, and I don't want people's first exposure to a Segway be some jerk.  I yield to everybody on the sidewalk, slow down as I approach, call out before I pass someone on the trails.<p>Yeah, I've heard ""mall cop!"" about a thousand times.  Most of that sort of thing I hear from high school boys, who also like to howl ""awoooooooo"" as they roar by.  (And what's up with THAT?)  I remember turning into the university one day when a couple of college-age boys were leaving in their red muscle car.  ""Why don't you WALK, you lazy bastard!"" one of them yelled out the passenger window, as the driver tromped the accelerator.  I contemplated the irony as I watched them tear up the road to a nearby apartment complex.<p>Pretty much every right-hand-turn auto driver in the country is actively trying to kill me.  That Slate article is right about one thing; if you're approaching an intersection at 12mph you'd better be damn sure to establish eye contact with the driver making a right turn in front of you.  She's not looking your way, she's looking left to check for oncoming traffic, and she's certainly not expecting traffic from the right at my speed.  I almost was clipped several times before I learned that green lights and ""walk"" indicators should be taken as suggestions only.  (Relying solely on your right-of-way mostly means your estate will win in court.)<p>Segways do have their place.  They won't change the world like Dean wanted, but if you live a sane distance from your place of business it's the cat's meow.",1247107450.0

It's a core that's well tested and does everything they need it to do.

They're just using Linux as a stable infrastructure to build their OS on top of.  So it's not a Linux distribution in the traditional sense.

Most people can't seem to understand that entrepreneurship is not about money, fame or power. Those are all secondary things. <i>Entrepreneurship is about an idea and its development</i>. It's about developing a thought, a concept only you and maybe the 2 other people starting the venture with you understand. It takes balls and passion. It takes courage. But more importantly, it takes unrelenting love. Love for the idea behind the venture, love for the concept of creating something valuable out of just abstractions, and, ultimately, love for the better world you're helping shape with the economic impact of your plan.<p>I'm not downplaying the importance of following sound economic principles (e.g. do NOT put your house as a collateral for a loan).

I've helped several friends with less than US$1000 in startup funds open restaurants/bakeries...within 2 years of when they started out to do so.<p>Ego, lack of creativity, and laziness are among the only impediments to starting most businesses.  You just have to want the end result bad enough that you are willing to work hard on a smaller scale until you can fund your dream.  (You can work as a caterer, personal chef, food delivery service, and/or sell your food on consignment at other locations to raise the funds for your own place.  MANY restaurants will let you borrow their kitchens for 'free' in exchange for cleaning up or for doing prep work or cooking specialty items.  Some may want you to cover the increased insurance risk, but you can still get started in a licensed facility for a small cash outlay.  Most independent restauranteurs understand what it is like to start a new food-related business, and many are likely to help you out unless you're an ass or a direct competitor.  Then, you can just build up a base of customers and cash until you can buy or lease your own place.  If you have good products, and are smart with your cash, it doesn't actually take too long to get enough of a bankroll to go out on your own.  It took one of my friends only 11 months as a 'virtual cupcake consignment company' to MAKE the funds she needed to open her own bakery, and she even bought her real estate outright.)<p>Side note:  One of the ladies I assisted in starting her own bakery ended up closing it and going back to bakery consignment and catering because it was less stressful and more lucrative for her than retail.  Some of these ""ramp up"" businesses may be better in the long run than actually owning your own retail/restaurant space.",1247105026.0

In this case, that's a virtue; you learn the language's syntax, and then you know how to recognize summation within any program in that language regardless of who wrote it, but in cases where the problem is more complicated and the native syntax for what you need to do more awkward, you really do want to create your own syntax.<p>Arguably that's a danger inherent in Lisp: it gives more opportunities to create needless new syntax, not just the kind of syntax that makes a program clearer and simpler.<p>If you wanted to extend destructuring in Python (that is, (a, b) = (1, 2)) to cover dictionaries, how would you do it?  In a Lisp, it's done with macros.  The core language usually doesn't start out with any destructuring at all.

I opt for virtualenv.<p>Add pip and you get a reproducible build process: create a virtualenv, and install whatever's needed to turn it into a working environment for your application.
