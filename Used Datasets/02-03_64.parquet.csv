Moreover, even if they choose to continue to do business with Netflix, any businessperson would see the potential for raising prices, and Netflix may make a big bruhaha now, but in the end, they'll pay it because they'll still make money.<p>Netflix' ridiculous profits and growth rate represents a demand unanticipated by the content providers that serve it. The only reason they didn't capitalize on this potential and raise prices is because of the length of the contract. As soon as it lapses, expect Netflix' profit margins to get a whole lot skinnier, and their growth to slow down. This looks like a classic case of a binding contract slowing down delaying the market response to unanticipated innovation. It's not the conglomerates shutting Netflix down with extreme malice and prejudice; it's the market adjusting and redistributing the newfound pie.",1292295497

I think the ideal ""teacher"" for a completionist education system would simply be someone who could juggle the roles of motivational speaker, hard-ass, and Socratic. In other words, although they would have their own particular skillset, they <i>wouldn't need to know the material at all</i>.<p><i>Lecturing</i> would be left to professional speakers backed by a writing team and subject-matter experts, filmed remotely and either sold to schools as materials on the free market, or produced for the public by government media arms such as the BBC. If anyone had a question about the material that couldn't be answered by the lecture, the books, the rest of the class, by the ""teacher""'s Socratic deduction, etc., the school would have tutors on-call as well (by remote from a tutoring group, or locally as a service of alumni.) There would be no segregated ""classes"" or ""classrooms"", but rather an integrated environment more akin to a combination library/study-hall, with gatherings for people working on the same class of problem at the same time, etc.<p>In fact, there wouldn't really be a need to ""graduate"" at all, or to ""register"" for specific semesters. As long as you could get a print-out at any time proving you had 100%-ed the problems relevant to the job you're applying for, that would be all you would need. You would be able to show up one day, leave for years, then come back and resume your studies as if you had never left. In fact, done this way, people would probably stop considering themselves to be ""in school"", but rather just say that they ""go learning"" in the same way one would ""go hiking"" or ""go to yoga.""

90,2002832,comment,2002211.0,2002211.0,0,0,Samuel_Michon,,,"After reading the article, I found the predictions quite curious, so I decided to run some numbers. Especially since it's about the global PC market, and the figures seem to include enterprise sales. Apple's computer sales have always been strong in North America, but its market share is negligible in large parts of the rest of the world. Apple also has little market share in the enterprise market.<p>The article states that, at this moment, global market share for Apple desktops and notebooks is 4.4 percent. It predicts that Apple's desktop and notebook market share won't change much in 2011. About 300 million desktops and notebooks are sold annually.<p>Apple's computer sales have outgrown the market by 25-35% for the last couple of years, but ofcourse, such continued growth would translate to only 1.5 percent point next year (so that doesn't contribute much towards the predicted tripling of Apple's market share). Apple sold 13.66 million Macs in the last four financial quarters -- at this rate it will sell ~20 million Macs next year.<p>The analyst predicts sales of 37.2 million iPads in 2011. Combined with the 20 million Macs, that would make for 57.2 million Apple computer sales. If that makes up for 12% of the global market of desktops, laptops and tablets, then that market consists of 475 million units in 2011.<p>I think the total market for desktops, notebooks and tablets will be smaller, closer to 330 million units (that's still a 10% increase!). That would mean that Apple's market share will be even larger than the analyst is predicting: a whopping 17.3%<p>It's obvious that iOS is working out quite well for Apple, but with iOS devices outselling Macs 6 to 1 in 2011, I hope it continues to love Mac OS X and iOS equally.",1292292494
