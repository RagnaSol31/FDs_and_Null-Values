28,3569553,comment,3568183.0,3568813.0,6,0,csallen,,,"The fact is, there are innumerable factors that affect people's decision-making in situations like this. The ability to decide whether or not a course of action is ethical is greatly affected by what your competitors are doing, groupthink, incentives, time pressures, etc. I could keep going. And yes, your ability to ""get away with it"" is also a factor.<p>Now you may say, ""Who cares what the factors are? A wrong decision is a wrong decision."" And you're right. However, as a practical person who wants to see <i>real</i> change come about, I cannot be satisfied with the run-of-the-mill, ""They did it because they're evil and untrustworthy"" response.<p>People are <i>rarely</i> inherently evil. I find it hard to believe that this group of engineers is really so different from you and I. It's likely that all of us grew up in similar environments, have gone through similar experiences, and possess similar moral beliefs. So aren't you the <i>least</i> bit curious why they're capable of making a decision you could never imagine yourself making? I think simply dismissing them as untrustworthy people is an irresponsible and short-sighted reaction. Human beings are more complex than that.<p>A lot of teachers believed that the only students who cheat are the dishonest ones. Well, some clever psychologists came along and -- lo and behold -- they showed that under the right circumstances, you can convince <i>almost any</i> student to cheat. That's the nature of humans.<p>Like it or not, we react to situations much more than to our personal moral codes. No amount of shaming greedy bankers, book-padding executives, dishonest politicians, privacy-invading programmers, etc is going to work. If we want to effect real change, <i>we need to change the systems that allow for and incentivize this type of behavior.</i><p>I highly recommend reading up on basic human psychology. Influence (by Robert Cialdini) is a good place to start. Charlie Munger's writings, although unorthodox, are also great.",1328755263.0

But, like all good rebels, I do believe that the cooler heads will prevail and that we will not have to surrender.<p>For the past year, I have been touting that the future of business is benevolence.

It is, however, infectious.  Facebook is following suit and (I hope) it won't be long before we all realize that the doze of benevolence will get you far.  And by that I don't mean philantropy.<p>1) Don't charge people more than you have to. Make money, by all means, even get rich, but don't overcharge just bacause you don't have a lot of competition.<p>2) Pay your employees well and create positive work environments.  Happy people remain working hard and make you more money at a nice and organic rate.<p>3) Loyalty is no longer a virtue of an employee.  It is a privilege earned by an employer.  Don't be a DB and expect people to stick around and work hard for your just cause you are putting bread on their families tables.  That worked in the 50's.  Get on with the program.<p>4) Share the profits with your employees, share the innovation with your customers and don't be afraid to try new things even if they appear to hurt your bottom line.  You will never know until you try it.<p>5) Vote for a party that will better the world, not the one that will serve your selfish desires (I intentionally did not use a word <i>needs</i> here.

76,3569502,comment,3564365.0,3564992.0,1,0,tnicola,,,"Thanks.  That's very interesting.  I guess it's the same as something that we call 'stock options'.  You are granted a right to buy stock for the price it would be when one starts working, but you can't really sell them or cash them until the IPO.  For example, if I started working for a company that would have stock price of $2.00 if IPO happened today, they would grant me the right to buy the stock at that price at IPO no matter what the stock price would be at the time.  It's called 'exercising' your option. So, if stocks were worth $10.00 at IPO, I would have gained $8.00 on day 1.<p>However, even if you 'exercise' your stock options at IPO (buy stocks for the price of the valuation when they were granted to you), you don't have to cash in your stocks, which means that the gains would not be realized (and thus not taxable) until you do.<p>The tax, however, would be the same as any other capital gains, which is 25%. We do not care how long the gain took to realize, just the fact that the net gain was positive.  (You can carry capital losses from the previous years and offset your positive capital gains when you have them.)",1328753636.0
