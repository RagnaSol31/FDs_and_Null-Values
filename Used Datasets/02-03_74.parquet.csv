Of course, you must attack me personally, because at the end of the day, I'm arguing for fiscal responsibility, and your position is that you and people like you better know how to run our lives, and so you feel the right to take, at gunpoint, money to spend on initiatives you personally approve of, and it really shouldn't matter what us peons with a ""loose understanding"" think, right?<p>Which is, of course, why you hate the initiative process.

In these terms, perhaps the keynote was in fact good. An interesting thought experiment, no?<p>Of course, it's hard to measure whether this sales-pitching, partner-insulting keynote will result in greater profits, until those profits appear (and even then, hard to judge its causative role - if any.) I certainly don't approve or agree with it - I'm just saying that that is a fruitful (in a scientific sense) way to think about it. Whether it was enjoyable and/or ethical for a particular person is also important, but it's unlikely to aid understanding or prediction of Oracle, and very unlikely to make any difference.<p>We can however look at how Oracle has behaved in the past, and how that worked out for them. I've observed them be quite unkind and changeable, though pragmatic in providing working products etc - and to be profitable.",1285037859

Moreover, they also renamed and broke most of common idioms, using words that could be better as a variable names instead of keywords.<p>So, it is not a Lisp dialect, even not so-called Lisp-1.

Using j/k to move more than one or two lines is the wrong way to do things.<p>I know, I know, we extoll the virtues of hjkl constantly, but really they're <i>barely</i> more effective than the arrow keys.<p>There are better ways to move around in Vim, such as [f]orward, '[t]il and searching. In your case (changing word XYZ to something else) I would search for the word with /XYâ€¦ and press return to get there, then edit as you described.<p>""Triple-clicking in Gedit highlights a line. Triple-clicking and dragging highlights a contiguous group of lines. In Vim, I'd need to move to the line I want to begin my selection on ([number]G or jjj), then press V, then press jjj until everything is selected.""<p>See my previous comment about movement.  You'd move to the line you want by using a search (or '{', which moves to empty lines), start your selection with V, and move to the end with another search (or some kind of movement command that gets you where you want to go quickly).<p>We Vim users need to stop touting our Nethack-honed hjkl skills and start talking about Vim's better movement commands.<p>""And I don't have to deal with the fact that the default way of deleting things overwrites the default clipboard either.""<p>Yeah, this is dumb. YankRing helps a lot by letting you 'Ctrl+P' to the right text, but I really think Vim should have a ""clipboard register"" that only gets overwritten when you mean it (and have other registers for the last yanked elements).<p>""when I paste code in to a Vim document, the indentation gets all screwed up.""<p>If you're using a graphical Vim like gvim or MacVim this simply shouldn't happen. It's a bug and you could report it.<p>If you're using the command line Vim you might need to do a bit more work to launch Vim and tell it to talk to X.

With Vim, I press j until I'm on the line where the word is, then I press w until I'm at the beginning of the word, then I press cw to change the word, retype it the right way, and press escape to go back to command mode.<p>Triple-clicking in Gedit highlights a line.  Triple-clicking and dragging highlights a contiguous group of lines.  In Vim, I'd need to move to the line I want to begin my selection on ([number]G or jjj), then press V, then press jjj until everything is selected.  And I don't have to deal with the fact that the default way of deleting things overwrites the default clipboard either.<p>I do use Vim when I need to process lines in a text document (with macros), when I'm editing files on a server, or when I'm writing a git commit message.  I suppose I could use Vim in much the same way as Gedit through its mouse capability, but I dislike the lack of interface between my system clipboard and Vim's, and the fact that when I paste code in to a Vim document, the indentation gets all screwed up.",1285035957

My parents, on the other hand, have made more money since retiring 5 years ago than they made in the 30 years prior (mainly through real estate investments).
