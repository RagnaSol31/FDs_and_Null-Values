10,4415833,comment,4415832.0,4415832.0,2,0,Jonovono,,,"Hey HN!<p>So this is something I have been working a bit on in my spare time (err, I mean, I just wrote it in 3 seconds :p).<p>I have been using Github since I got into coding a little while ago and I love it. It makes it super easy to store files, find projects that are helpful, and just encourages the idea of open source by making it easy and fun. I feel like I have learnt a great deal just downloading peoples code and making changes to it and seeing the process they went through. I have been wondering what a similar site like this would look like if it was made for people unfamiliar to Git and would never take the time to learn a new language or whatever do collaborate or use version control.<p>Right now it works very simply. It is like Google docs but everything is public (I will be introducing private projects). You can upload changes by dragging a new document onto the page and it will be stored. You can annotate files, highlight text, etc. Right now it supports images, text docs (code), pdf, doc(x), and excel. I think it would be exciting to have a system where people could come and collaborate on things such as books, textbooks, etc.<p>I have seen a few cases here on HN where such a system is discussed but I have not seen any solutions.<p>One of those was how Wired used Github to publish an article (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3631618"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3631618</a>). They were not happy with this solution however and are looking for another system that is more user friendly. But the demand is there. I think it would be awesome to be able to easily suggest mistakes on articles and allow an easier way for the author to accept those.<p>Another was about a git powered Project Gutenberg (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3638917"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3638917</a>). Gutenberg is a mess (no nice way to view, no consensus on what the base text format should be) and git would be an interesting solution but again it is not that user friendly. As an example I put a couple PG documents on Rubberdocky (<a href=""http://rubberdocky.com/ProjectGutenbergFiles/Siddhartha"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubberdocky.com/ProjectGutenbergFiles/Siddhartha</a>).<p>I am hoping to make use of a cool project I just ran into called substance.io to make it easy for people to collaborate on documents.<p>Rubberdocky is not the solution yet, but I am hoping to steer it that way by getting some feedback from interested user. If you are interested in the idea email me contact@rubberdocky.com and we could discuss this in more detail! Im looking for some web designers/UI to maybe join forces (I know supposed to find someone you know, but desperate times). If you get some errors email me or Tweet me <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/rubberdocky"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twitter.com/rubberdocky</a>.",1345604059.0

Old-style marketing is dead. I say this as an old-style marketer.""<p>I'm pretty sure you're describing sales rather than marketing. And growth hacking, while a cool approach, hasn't replaced anything in traditional, old-style marketing - as a recent meeting at P&G has shown me.<p>To me, the growth hacking idea is simply another way of saying ""how do we make our product viral"", which was the question everyone asked me after Hotmail blew up.  The difference, and I think there is one, is that you think of putting someone in a marketing role in charge of this, instead of product, with the assumption that the marketer actually has some clue as how to create growth.<p>That all being said, as a marketer, I'm intensely data focused!",1345603922.0

Better university textbooks are not readily accessible without an instructor. Running commentary from several authors giveing additional motivation, examples, clarifications or alternative derivations can be of great help to students and wikipedia style platform can be great for organising such a project.<p>Sites like wikipedia and mathoverflow / stackexchange are great for specific questions but lack structure - centering the efforts around certain ""canonical"" texts can help to organise the material which otherwise would be overwhelming.",1345603479.0

The arrangement is determined by the structure of the atom - specifically the electron orbital. I'm assuming you didn't know this? It's not arbitrary at all, elements in the same column are very similar chemically, and can take each others place in many chemical reactions.<p>> Ah, the meat of the problem. You're prejudiced against disciplines outside of physics.<p>Prejudiced? Really? If you are going to practice science you have to do it properly, physics does, so do many other disciplines. Some don't. It's not because they are evil - they have no other choice, they do as good a job as possible with the limitations they have. I don't hold it against them, but at the same time they don't have the same status as those that do, the results from those disciplines can never be considered definitive. And for many of them, it's not science, it's history.<p>And you appear not to even know any physics, and so you think everything is like what you know, and have no idea how it can be when done properly. It's a form of the DunningKruger effect - you don't even realize what you don't know, so you think everyone doesn't know.",1345602620.0

Nobody would deny that the Windows 8/""Metro"" UI and UX is different.  Every window system is different, some more than others, and each has it's own pros and cons.  Some people might like the Finder in Mac OSX, and some might hate it.  It doesn't matter whether the hate is legitimate or defensible or not, what matters is whether your UI/UX and overall OS is compelling enough to convince users that it's worth switching from what they know, or simply worth putting up with in the bigger picture.  I would also argue that it doesn't matter whether a user unfair-ably hates it after barely/ignorantly using it, or comes to the conclusion that they hate it after using it thoroughly for 8 months.  First impressions are so important - not many people have the time or interest to really dig into a new UI/UX paradigm to find out what's it all about and whether it can improve their workflow.  If you fail the first impression by not driving your users in the right direction or giving them some sense of excitement, most times you don't get another chance.<p>I think where Windows 8 fails is that it doesn't provide me with any compelling reasons why I would want to upgrade from Windows 7, or migrate from Mac OSX or Linux.  It doesn't give me any sense of excitement - the paradigm shift from Windows 7 to 8 is not at all like the experience of shifting from something like a Blackberry to an iPhone.  I agree with the author - I don't like the Metro start menu, I prefer the old start menu.  Maybe that's just me clinging to an old beat-in paradigm, but I don't really see any benefits in the new paradigm.  I don't like the full-screen metro apps with limited window management capability and hidden OS ""chrome"" (clock).  I don't like having to use touch-like gestures or memorize new keyboard shortcuts for using all the wonky new features in the OS that don't seem to provide me with any real compelling value.  The Windows 8 ""optimists"" that try to defend the OS by listing out keyboard shortcuts or alternate ways to navigate to different areas, or ways to ""hide"" Metro UX are kind of missing the point.  Most people that provide a laundry list of what they hate are not looking for suggestions or tutorials - the OS has already failed to direct them, and they've simply come to the conclusion that they don't like it.",1345602062.0
