Similarly the plumbing is so unbalanced that the shower can essentially be turned off by a good configuration of tap turns and toilet flushes.<p>Architecture is a joke, and the 'engineers' who design them should really consider building a house themselves, because I've seen every crazy design from doors being hinged to trap people in the corner of a hallway (literally you'd have to step into the far corner to squeeze around the door to exit the bedroom), to lighting layouts that didn't illuminate the room, or switches completely impracticably placed.<p>You're entirely right, people overlook 'bugs' in architecture, although in my experience it's largely because of ignorance of what it being right is.

But because I'm a normal person for a HN reader, I've kept up with the news, and in learning so many other languages at one time or another have a pretty decent idea what's going on. Recently we started hiring for a C++ position, and I was asked to sit in on the interviews. I said that I didn't really know C++, but I do know enough other stuff to keep up.<p>Or so I thought. Our interviewer handed out a bit of code something like this<p><pre><code>  int some_func(int, SomeComplexObject&);\n\n\n  .. some code context...\n  {\n     {\n         int a = 1;\n         SomeComplexObject b = new SomeComplexObject()\n         some_func(a, &b);\n     }\n     if (b = 0) {\n         cout >> ""Error"" >> endl;\n     }\n   }\n</code></pre>\nor whatever, something like that, and asked what was wrong. People with ""years of experience"" in C++ would strain and strain to find ""the"" error. This is of course a steaming pile of errors, the only legal code line is ""int a = 1;"" and that's redundant (just stick the 1 in the function call).<p>I don't have C++ on my resume, but after that experience I'm pretty sure I could put it back on without experiencing too much flak.<p>On that note, if you're into languages I really recommend the C++ FAQ Lite: <a href=""http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/</a> Anybody who can follow that should probably just leave C++ on the resume.

But this definition is too vague to lead to any widely shared ideas on how to measure it or pursue it.  It does suggest to me that the measuring and optimizing needs to be done by the person experiencing the wants and the satisfying.  But I already know not everyone agrees with this.   :)<p><i></i>*<p>I watched the Harris lecture.  A few thoughts:<p>He really didn't make his claim that science answers moral questions.  If we <i>assume</i> the moral premise that humans should not suffer, then some other things logically follow, and perhaps science will later tell us some useful conclusions there that we don't know now.  I agree that there is enough hard-wired similarity in human nature that some premises like ""people should not suffer"" can be widely accepted and used as a starting point.  Nevertheless, widely shared assumptions is not the same thing as science having ""proved"" those assumptions.<p>I don't think we have a lot of problem even today with the widely shared assumptions.  It's the ones that aren't shared that lead to the conflict.  My feeling is Harris wants to be the guy that gets to tell everyone else what science has told us about morality, and then also get to declare the argument over because it isn't his opinion, instead it is ""science"".<p>It is manipulative, and dishonest, to claim that science will be able to answer moral questions objectively, and then proceed to ""prove"" this by using examples of behavior that you know in advance your audience will find offensive and outraging.  Any preacher or imam can ""prove"" the will of God using similar tactics.<p>He hints that brain state will eventually provide the new knowledge that we need to answer questions of right and wrong.

I'm not forced to buy and use teflon-coated bullets either.  That doesn't change the fact that these two items which currently are legal have properties that I believe are immoral and illegal.  Current law (specifically Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the US Constitution [1] and the Federal ban against armor piercing ammunition [2]) suggests that certain properties of these items are legal only because of technicalities.

You seem to claim that book burning is a <i>goal</i> of the kindle, but I don't think you can really substantiate the claim. As far as I can tell the <i>goal</i> of publishers is simply to have control over the digital content. Remote deletions are a <i>side effect</i>. I also don't agree with you that capability is the only thing that matters.<p>By analogy: a knife can be used to make a sandwich, and it can be used to to repeatedly stab people in the face. The knife affords stabbing (which is arguably far worse than remote ebook deletion or modification), but I think knives are still generally a positive thing in society. Most things in life aren't forces for pure good or pure evil, so for me (and for most people) it's a matter of finding the right balance.<p>Right now, every inalienable, natural, human right you have can be violated by random strangers, the government and yes, even by companies. This is pretty much a fact of life, and I think that taking an absolutist position about this isn't helpful.<p>If DRM is a net benefit to you, then yay DRM. If not, then use alternatives. In the grand scheme of things, I think it's a bit of a non-issue. Yes, I admit universal DRM (for the broadest sense of universal) would be pretty awful.

I guess what I objected to was <i>“would you like jesus in your life? no? what about now?”</i> which is not how any of the missionaries I know interact with people.<p>-------<p>In response to this second comment:<p>In the places I have any experience with full of desperately poor people, the outsiders who decide to settle down, whatever their official institutional ideology, mostly care about helping people, at an individual level.<p>> <i>this is a slippery slope to cultural imperialism.</i><p>I’m somewhat skeptical about this. In the places with the most severe cultural imperialism – for instance, Latin America – said imperialism was done in the name of god and the king, but was at root much more about material advantage and personal self-interest (read: theft) than salvation, the latter being mostly a convenient rationalization.<p>Today, pretty much everywhere in the world has been under the “cultural imperialist” influence of the west, linked by a globalized economic system.<p>Moreover, I think you oversimplify in suggesting that Christianization is just a mechanism for hegemony. I don’t know much about Korean culture or religious diversity, but from your description it sounds to me like Korean elites seized on Christianity and bent it to their own ends, quite independently of the missionaries who had brought it there. At the same time, Korea was industrializing and urbanizing full speed, building an export-led factory economy. We could speculate about what the power structure would be like in Korea if the population had remained entirely Buddhist, but it’s not as if feudalism would have survived, and I don’t think the outcome can be blamed on Christian missionaries without likewise indicting centuries of Western technological advances, foreign bankers, American consumers, and the rest of the prevailing world economic system. (And Koreans of all stripes, too.) In short, it’s complicated.<p>-----<p>For what it’s worth, I also find packaging aid to desperately poor people with religious ideology to be distasteful/awkward and agree that it is potentially abusive.",1269915158.0
