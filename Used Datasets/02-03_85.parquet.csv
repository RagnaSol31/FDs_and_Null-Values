Its author assumes (but never explores or explains the assumption) that there's some unidirectional arrow of improved understanding and pedagogy through time (‚Äúprogress‚Äù) and that therefore modern explanations are inherently more sophisticated/subtle/polished than the original grapplings with a subject.<p>What he misses is that the seminal papers in any field are forced to really grapple with a subject for its own sake, while later works fetishize dogma and ceaselessly pander to the interests of whoever is paying for the work to be done, simplifying concepts to be understood by those of uncertain prior experience, and packing in features (ooh, glossy pictures! companion website!) that will sell copies.<p>There are some areas where studying the originals is not especially helpful, because subjects weren‚Äôt yet understood.  For instance, the founders of quantum mechanics really had no clue what was going on at the beginning, and their early papers are mishmashes of math pulled from other sources which sometimes fortuitously explained their experimental results. So by all means, go grab Townsend‚Äôs <i>Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics</i> (2002) as a more practical and informative work.<p>In other areas, the famous ‚Äúoriginals‚Äù (which is to say, those works which were good enough to last centuries while their contemporaries faded into oblivion) are wonderful. There‚Äôs much more insight packed into Machiavelli, Tocqueville, or James Madison‚Äôs writing than any modern political science textbooks.<p>And yes, economics as a field would be way better off if its practitioners had any idea what its foundational assumptions were about, or tried really deeply considering (e.g.) Smith, Veblen, Marx, or Keynes (or even, say, Von Neumann and Morgenstern), who had a real world to answer to, not just other economists.",1267583788.0

Surely our writing systems are just as text-based and yet, I don't see anyone proposing we supplant them with pictograms.<p>Aside from that, many problems are simply not suited to an event-based model, just as many problems are not suited to functional models and others are not suited to imperative models. There is not, and will never be, a one size fits all approach to development.<p>The reason software is so susceptible to errors is nothing to do with the model of its development, but rather that bugs can be ""hidden"" until the program is running, and commonly much longer after that. This is why you rarely get bugs in CSS, HTML or PNGs - the full results of modifications can be seen in near real time. When you <i>do</i> get bugs in HTML or CSS, they are browser issues or issues with resizing - things that are not immediately apparent.<p>Importantly, any programming environment sufficiently well equipped to be useful, will always have places to hide bugs.

Namely, that large, nominally non-relational datasets that can afford to lose a little data here and there, or at the very least just take awhile to save it, are really what you need for serving up a big, fresh pile o' Social Networking.<p>So, bringing up Twitter or Facebook really doesn't make a good case against RDBMSes as a good tool in the toolbox -- they've got a very unique set of needs that don't apply to a lot of rest of the world.  So, of course, SQL isn't the best solution when you're dealing with trillions of rows of data, and don't really want to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the infrastructure required to guarantee that you never go down, and never lose a tweet.<p>And keep in mind, RDMBS helped them get to point where they could enjoy these problems; Twitter probably wouldn't exist in all its current glory if they spent a year building it to be 'scalable' before launching.<p>I think the reason that a lot of people end up hating RDBMS and SQL is because of one-or-more of (a) their only experience is with MySQL, which really isn't that awesome; (b) they've been burned by bad schema design; or, (c) they don't really get relational algebra or set theory.<p>For an example of 'bad schema design', I once worked at a company that had indices on nearly every column of their DB, even though almost none of these ever got queried.  There was one database table with <i>five</i> indices on three columns, and of course this was the table that logged <i>every single HTTP request</i> processed by the front end.  Including API calls.  Did I mention that this table was never queried by any part of the application?<p>It was a poor design decision, and sure enough, it completely torpedoed performance.  But the problem wasn't the RDBMS, because it did exactly what it was told to do, no matter how asinine.<p>So, in short, RDBMS aren't the solution to all problems, but they do solve a lot of problems adequately.  NoSQL databases also serve an important role in the toolbox, but are much more narrowly-focused.",1267583478.0

62,1163173,comment,1163018.0,1163018.0,0,0,startingup,,,"My suspicion is that Facebook revenues could be much higher than they are letting on. I say that as a non-Facebook user and a fairly neutral outside observer. If they were being coy because revenues were actually too good, it wouldn't be the first company to do so. Google was coy about its revenue in the 2002-3 timeframe, and it surprised a lot of people when it was later revealed just how much they were making.<p>Here is my theory: Facebook's traffic, measured in terms of users or page views is about even with Yahoo. Facebook has the added advantage that every single page view is a from a logged in user, who has provided Facebook with a fair amount of personal information, far, far more than what Yahoo has. Facebook has considerable information from the users' profiles as well as their various activity streams that Facebook tracks. This should enable Facebook to target its ads more precisely than Yahoo can, and therefore achieve at least as much revenue as Yahoo. From an advertiser perspective, it would seem like Facebook, with its vastly superior knowledge of user behavior, should be a better bet than old-school  Yahoo. Of course, Facebook probably hasn't pushed its sales efforts as hard as mature Yahoo; still, I would expect Facebook to be doing a goodly fraction of Yahoo's revenue, which is running north of $6 billion per year.<p>If you buy my theory, long term, Facebook should overtake Yahoo in revenue; in fact a lot of Facebook revenue will likely come by stealing advertisers from Yahoo. So the company with the most to fear from Facebook is not Google but Yahoo.",1267582983.0

It has to do with the definitions of space and time and the equation of velocity v = dx/dt. What the equation is saying is that, if an object moves over any distance d x, there is an elapsed time d t. Since time is defined in physics as a parameter for denoting change (evolution), the equation for velocity along the time axis must be given as v = dt/dt which is self-referential. The self-reference comes from having to divide dt by itself. dt/dt always equals 1 because the units cancel out. This is of course meaningless as far as velocity is concerned.""",1267582496.0
