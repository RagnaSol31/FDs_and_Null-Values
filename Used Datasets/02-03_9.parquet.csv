(I like that term for it)<p>What really bothers me is that, on the whole, it feels like the designer put more effort into the flourish than into creating a design that would support and enhance the communication of the content.<p>It's the (wrong) idea that you can appropriate these stylistic elements that will make a design appear current, cool, or 'with it' - and that somehow adding in what all the old-timers would call ""bells and whistles"" is a worthy trade-off for the practice of good design.",1261191323

It has never bothered me, and there is some truth to it.  \nWith the skills I have today, I like to think I could accomplish something ambitious.  However, the skill acquisition has been path dependent.  Four years ago I did not even know what svn was, had never written a line of sql, had no particular marketing expertise, etc etc.  I was totally unprepared to be a businessman and started only when I saw an opportunity even I could bring in.  All the skills I have now are because I have been compounding marginal improvements since then.<p>I do not regret any of it.  I do not even regret two years of salarymanning when I could have recontracted at the tech incubator. (Plusses, leaving at four thirty, no commute.  Plusses for salarymanhood, much more professional growth, and everything I ship makes real people happier and real lives better.  That is enough to tolerate low pay, no work life balance, and two hour commute,  But not for forever.)<p>Not sure about next program, but I will have plenty of time to think.  I secured a twenty thousand angel investment and ongoing cash injections from this crazy white guy who lives in a rice field, after all.  Terms were pretty good.<p>Apologies for language, posting from cell．",1261189906

Competitors will cheer, of course, because they get to see the big guy hammered in a way that might benefit them competitively and that costs them nothing.<p>In the microprocessor field, during the years between 2000 and 2006 (when Intel's alleged monopolistic practices supposedly hurt consumers), the quality and performance of microprocessors improved significantly while prices fell at an annual rate of 48.9%. So we have anti-competitive behavior that, far from raising costs, has lowered them in a huge way - yet, and this is key for antitrust purposes, at no time has Intel sold below cost (which places it squarely within two decades of Supreme Court precedent consistently rejecting antitrust challenges to above-cost price cuts).<p>In this context, the FTC seeks a remedy ""[r]equiring Intel to make available technology . . . to others, via licensing or other means, upon terms and conditions as the Commission may order.""<p>Now <i>that</i> will certainly spur companies to spend hundreds of millions in fields such as this to innovate.<p>Will this hurt Silicon Valley? Draw your own conclusions. The cheering competitors will say no. My guess is that just about everyone else (at least those who are informed about the issues) will seriously question whether having regulators throwing their weight around helps innovation or the consumers that benefit from such innovation. But at least we can all feel satisfied that the bully is getting its comeuppance.",1261189187

It's not DRM that normal consumers ever interact with though (except second hand by seeing the movie, or not seeing the movie as the case may be) but it's rights management none the less. From the failure modes it doesn't sound like there was any security above and beyond the standard DCinema encryption.",1261189017

Most of the continental US can use solar hot water heating systems with a fairly fast payback for lower cost than Iceland's geothermal systems.<p>I am just pointing out that ""green"" tech is already competing with fossil fuels and winning in many areas.  It's not a question of turning off coal and other fossil fuels today, but rather limiting their use to the most useful systems such as cars and airplanes.<p>PS: Many homes in the US would reduce their CO2 emissions more by adding insulation than they would by doubling the fuel economy of their cars.",1261188842

You can't just expect to push your application code to ""the cloud"" and have somebody else make it scalable and fault tolerant.<p>It's fine to use a managed hosting service provider if you're <i>just getting started</i> and paying month-to-month based on credit cards and can't afford networking gear (hardware itself can be leased). However, it shocks me to see venture funded, post-series A start-ups <i>exclusively</i> relying on others to do their operations (including systems administration).<p>Problem with outsourcing your operations to somebody else is that you're outsourcing it to somebody who has <i>zero</i> knowledge of your application and is also responsible for at the very least <i>dozens</i> of other customers. Essentially, rather than developing <i>your own</i> vertical technology team, you're relying on a on horizontal technology team whose resources multiple other companies (including your competitors) are fighting for.<p>That's <i>exactly</i> how poorly run big companies function (multiple engineering teams competing for attention of monothlic operations, SCM, release, QA etc... teams). Well run Internet giants, however, function much differently. If you look at Google's job openings, you can note that they don't hire IT/Systems Administrators (aside from data-center technicians and corporate IT). Instead, they have Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) assigned to specific properties. The SREs are actually engineers who are able to write and debug code and deeply understand the application-specific stack they operate rather than treat it as a black box.<p>Sure, there are great business and technical reasons (edit: it said financial, which I felt was an unfair strawman) reasons to use a managed/""cloud"" provider (EC2 and Rackspace cloud are very attractive due to the ability to add/remove nodes as traffic goes up and down, as well as provision machines  ad-hoc for analytics tasks/MapReduce) -- but even then, you're not off the hook for operations. It's still <i>your</i> responsibility to ensure that at the very least, there's a ""hot standby"" disaster recovery site. Yes, it's not easy - but running a successful business isn't supposed to be.",1261188033
