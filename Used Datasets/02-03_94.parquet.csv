Other web dev shops are in a different market and seeing different numbers.  There are plenty of cases where a CMS (or even many frameworks) is such a bad fit that it wouldn't make sense to even try.  If you spend your days building sites which aren't far evolved from brochure sites, then sure, a CMS makes great sense.",1285815597.0

Maybe it is just me, but $250 to $1.5M doesn't help me visualize a 6000x return at all.

So you can have great novels that languish, and massive movies that are rubbish.<p>The idea of ""what can be easily changed"" is significant, and is the basis of Parnas' influential paper on <i>information hiding</i>: you hide the decisions that are likely to change, so when they are changed, their impact is isolated from the rest of the system. Decisions that are expected to change together are grouped together in <i>modules</i>: <a href=""http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Design/criteria.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Design/crite...</a>\nThis is perhaps <i>the</i> most influential comp sci paper, and it's an interesting read; no maths IIRC, and pretty straightforward.<p>I think ""raw materials vs. tools"" is not as helpful as ""what can be easily changed"", because the materials/tools distinction can always be made arbitrary. eg: compiler vs. interpreter for the same language. One is a ""tool"", the other ""raw material"". A difference in performance (usually); but equal difficulty in changing them (you have to rewrite your code.)<p>A related question is: once you have modules, with fixed interfaces between them, what if you got it wrong (different decisions need to change) and you have to change the interfaces and modules? Because ""what you think will change"" is a prediction. It's a hunch, or if you like,  <i>guessing</i>. Your hunches improve with experience, both in a specific domain, and in general; but you will always be guessing. Or you <i>should</i> be; because if you know the answer, you should have automated it, bought/reused a tool that automates it, or made a tool that automates it and started selling it/giving it away.<p>As I said: great questions.

I was surprised by this, because Taylor originally stated he wanted FF to grow into a self-sustaining company. If FB didn't have the pockets to do this, FB wouldn't be nearly as successful as it is today. Today FB is impressively fast, were Tornado + HipHop the keys for this to happen?<p>If Twitter fixed its UI and fail whales a few years ago, it'd be much bigger today. PG a year or two ago spoke of Twitter as a protocol: yet still I think this hasn't manifested as it's still only  used at the presentation layer. It should have or should still look into this path.<p>Increasingly I'm seeing outcomes determined by the smarts of the CEO who end up having to think for themselves, because eventually they get surrounded by Yes-people. I see a deficit at Google with Eric Schmidt, although I can't say I've met him, Google needs a Jobs at this point. FB just need to put in a search engine (Bing?,) to stop losing users to Google.<p>If I may continue, the FF acquisition basically allowed FB to compete with Twitter (and not lose users to it.) It was Twitter that undermined Digg, because sharing with people you know is more fun than with sharing people you don't know.<p>The lessons in strategy here with Digg, Facebook, (and also Yahoo's non-acquisition by MS) is that if a potential acquirer comes to you having in mind that your business be acquired to spearhead or enable massive growth of their own, you say no. Or rather, if they're more (or even less) excited about your business than you are, sell unless you can obtain that excitement somehow, perhaps by acquiring yourself.",1285813330.0
