The only challenge in that kind of work where you already know how to do every piece is overcoming the sheer boredom from going through the motions.<p>So what I think is the solution is to go meta.  Step back and ask why you're having to write the same code to pump out the same kinds of apps.  What is the commonality between all the various apps you're writing?  Now solve <i>that</i> problem.  The ultimate iteration of this, if done successfully, is a system that takes a design plus a formal specification of an app's functionality and automagically makes it work.

What do I mean?<p>Look at the board of trustees of any public college or university.  Now remember these trustees are suppose to\nbe acting in a financial responsibility to two parties or \nparticipants in buying and consuming public college education, the State and the State's citizens.<p>Right now its skewed towards acting for the benefit of lobbyists those lobbyists being the College or University Administration. Remember folks that public college/university budgets a formed by state money and what fees can be raised by to support Administrator's contention that what the State proposed as budget is too low for the college/university due to wanting to cover costs of sports, unfunded liabilities added as a perk to keep professors,etc.<p>On top of that decoupling we have our own Congress deciding that Banks or the government should loan money to students.<p>What should be done is put the coupling back into the system:<p>1. No more independence state runs the college or university and accepts all liabilities. This forces for the first time colleges and universities accepting the level of state funding as there budget to follow rather than always raising tuition. Yes, things will get cut. Hopefully, its unfunded retirement perks and under-funded sports programs.<p>2. US Congress grants a grant program called lifetime college fund.  You get a tax break for attending public college or university and the company that hires you after graduation gets a tax grant.  Now here is the kicker. We fund it by buying a life-insurance on the student when they are born.  State kicks in half and the Federal government kicks in half. It is far cheaper to pay for $40,000 in future dollars value by investing at year 1 to year 18 in life insurance policy value of $40,0000.. we are talking of paying only a $1000 to $1200 per year per student..<p>For example, there are 20 million k12 aged children in the US.. $20 million times $1200 a year is..<p>$2 billion.. compared to $1 trillion outstanding college debt.. you hedge rising college costs by starting a life insurance policy investment at birth..that is the only way to handle it.<p>Cost wise per child the government would spend $1200 times 18 years or $21600 to get the future value of $45000 n college or university tuition paid for.<p>That is cost savings of 50%..<p>Beat me folks can you come up with a plan to save 80%? I do not think so.<p>Best part of plan if we only enact the life insurance policy to pay for college costs we save $1 trillion-$22billion or 90% or more per year when its fully enacted as far as having program fully in force for 20 years ..ie at year 20 we will be paying $22 billlion instead of interest in $1trillion in college debt as the government is now paying that interest directly while students are in school and indirectly in collections costs.<p>That is at year 20 savings of 90%..<p>Come up with a better plan folks..",1320028400.0

78,3176110,comment,3173993.0,3174225.0,3,0,vilya,,,"About the performance issues?<p>Well I work on software that does image processing at the moment & we've chosen to represent images as separate channels (i.e, all the red values, then all the green values, then all the blue values, etc). If we had interleaved the channels instead, many common operations that only need to look at one channel - or just one at a time - would be a lot slower.<p>When data is loaded into the cache, it's loaded in chunks called cache lines. These are usually 64 or 128 bytes long, depending on your CPU. So assuming a 64 byte cache line, if you ask for the value at address 4 then it'll load in all the values in addresses 0-63. If you then ask for the value at address 8, it'll already be cached & therefore quick to access; but if you ask for the value at address 64, it'll have to fill another cache line first - a cache miss.<p>So back to the images, say we're just looking at the alpha channel of an RGBA image. With separate channels we get 16 alpha values in each cache line (each channel is a float, so 4 bytes). If the channels were interleaved then we'd only get 4 alpha values in each cache line, so the CPU will have to fill 4 times as many cache lines.<p>Because so much of our code deals with images (and not just ours - our clients too), if we'd chosen an interleaved channel representation and were now finding that too slow, we'd be pretty stuck. So it's really important to consider these issues up front, but of course you can't if you don't know at least a little bit about how the hardware works.<p>Hopefully that explains it a bit better?",1320027791.0
