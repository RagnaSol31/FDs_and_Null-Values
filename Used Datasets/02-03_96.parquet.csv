(2) Teachers in grade school had been so critical of me, essentially because I wasn't a student like the girls in the classes!, that I'd largely given up on academics and wasn't trying very hard.  (3) I'd never heard about any SAT test prep!<p>I did try hard in high school math, because I very much liked the subject, but I still thought that pleasing the teachers was hopeless and, thus, didn't try.  Maybe that math I studied was responsible for my SAT scores, but I doubt it.  Besides the CEEB or whatever wanted to claim that the test measured just 'aptitude'.<p>Uh, just because someone took some SAT prep material doesn't mean that the prep material was really responsible for their good scores!  I'd side with the students who got good scores, however they did it:  If they did so well on the SATs, however they did it, then they should be able to ""make it"" in ugrad school.<p>Uh, unless they were competing with my wife!  She wanted to take a course in history but didn't need the credit so just audited.  The lecture hall had 300 students.  The prof insisted that even auditing students also take the tests.  At the end, the prof told her that she should have taken the course for credit since she had the highest grade in the class!  Before I met her socially, I taught her frosh trig.  On my tests, some of the questions were difficult for a lot of points.  At the end, she had twice as many points as the next best student; she could have walked out after the midterm and still made an A!  I tried to compete with her in Scrabble.  She was ahead, but as we played I got better.  Alas she got better even faster so that her margin grew so much she refused to play with me again!",1294714642.0

PHPFog's value proposition would seem to be ""We've figured out EC2 for you, and have default VMs setup for Drupal and Wordpress and a way to deal with those system's need for permanent disk space. If you can get your code in a git repository we'll handle the rest.""  Just getting Drupal and Wordpress out of a shared hosting environment is a huge win security/stability wise, and if their VMs have a configuration that deals with a lot of the well known attack vectors that aren't shared host related all the better.<p>I'm not sure that I'd use it myself, because I'd like to spend to time to get familiar with EC2, but with shared hosting becoming a less reliable solution as internet traffic patterns change (and shared hosts increasingly go he commodity route) there's going to be a lot of PHP professionals (and PHP hacks, and non-programmer hacks using PHP systems) looking for a turn-key cloud solution, so I can see the interest in PHPFog.<p>TL;DR: There's large swaths of the PHP community that doesn't know how to make EC2 work, PHPFog is aiming to be their middleman.",1294714283.0

I was using PuTTY config settings for color on my company-mandated Windows machine and soon found the limitations of this when I logged in to machine A (green), then from there to machine B (red).

Google also doesn't provide aggressive indexing - even their new indexing service can take up to 24 hours to index new content. Other services like websolr and indextank have some nice options, but they don't let you go from 0-60 very quickly - you need to code up solutions using client libraries before you can get started, and there is no advanced crawling capabilities.
