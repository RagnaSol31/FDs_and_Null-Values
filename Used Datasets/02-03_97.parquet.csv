Driving through and working around the 100,000's containers at the harbor never gets old even after working there for 7 years.<p>There are some interesting things I can say about containers after working with them up close:<p> Half of the containers we export are empties. The way the process works is we get a majority of full containers from the East (China, Japan, etc.), unload them, and send them empty boxes. Quartz covered this recently: <a href=""http://qz.com/64779/america-exports-a-lot-of-air/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qz.com/64779/america-exports-a-lot-of-air/</a><p> A refrigerated container is called a ""reefer"". We call the mechanics that work on these reefer mechanics. A 40 foot chasis is called a 40. So yeah, chatter on the radio channels talks about reefers, 40's, and (work) gangs.<p> Here is a pic I took one night of the cranes before they started to ""pump"" (work). <a href=""http://imgur.com/oxGNz9b"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/oxGNz9b</a><p> I have a draft of a post almost done about what it is that Longshoremen do now a days. It's obviously changed a lot from unloading shit by hand. I met an old timer that would use a hook to stab a giant ice block to pick out the fish. This was before reefers. (I actually just published the post. It's not complete, but it has more general info about longshoremen and containers: <a href=""http://raymondduke.com/who-are-longshoremen-what-do-they-do-your-questions-answered/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raymondduke.com/who-are-longshoremen-what-do-they-do-...</a>)<p> I can't find the link, but the process that bananas go through as they get shipped here is very interesting. There is a special and very intricate cooling and ripening process with an exact temperature change at the right moment in order to make sure the bananas are the right ripeness when they arrive here.<p> The worst thing I've encountered is cowhides. Cowhides are a common export from the USA to China (I imagine there is not a lot of room for cattle there). The reason why they are bad is because of the smell. They are coated with some sort of chemical so they don't get dry, but instead of keeping them in a bag, they just toss them in a container and drench them with this foul liquid that drips out of the box as it gets moved around the yard. Luckily, I've only encountered this a few times.<p>I'll be happy to answer any questions. I might not like a lot of things about my job (the politics and the schedule), but I am in love with the culture of the port.",1368845977.0

I guess this is one of those ""live and learn"" things, though.<p>Also, it boggles my mind that a company would spend 2 full days interviewing someone for an entry level person, and then on top of that it boggles a bit more because if they spent 2 days you'd think it is because they are being super safe and trying to find a great fit, and if they did find a great fit, finally, after all that work, why they wouldn't consider going up at all.<p>Sounds like a real clusterfuck all around.",1368845867.0

I totally agree that how I've been selling the product up to this point is weak and (admittedly) I haven't pushed it as hard I should because I feel like I need to develop more of the product before I can show the real features and benefits.<p>But to address your first point, what you are basically saying is that when a person walks into a restaurant they are ready to buy - its just a matter of what to buy. That may be true for some (or most) cases. But suppose someone walks into a restaurant on a busy strip for the first time, looks at the menu, reads only descriptions (because that is the only information available) and they do not like what they see so they move on. Who has not had that experience at least once? Or what if the dish they ordered looked worse than what they had in mind and made them regret their order and that bad experience causes them never to return to that restaurant?<p>I guess the value proposition I am making is that with more information, consumers are able to make better informed decisions and that results in lower uncertainty and remorse of the decision. How that affects the restaurants bottom line would be very difficult to measure. But if any business thinks that depriving their customers of information is more beneficial then there is a fundamental problem. I hope that is not the case.",1368845102.0
