1,9055,comment,8863.0,8863.0,0,0,chandrab,,,"Nice Application...the question I have is on the marketing side- how are you going to attract users? and how are you going to differentiate yourself from the hordes of other online storage vendors, esp. to the newbie users who can't tell them apart easy? (so you have to have a simple, compelling story for them)\n",1175745339
2,9054,comment,8971.0,8971.0,0,0,dfranke,,,"Two reservations come to mind:<p>1. How many people would want this?  It seems like the number of people who take their blogs seriously enough to be willing to pay for this is maybe a thousand.<p>2. I don't see how this can scale.  Unless you're thinking of AI, or some sort of peer-to-peer network, then you're selling a skilled-labor-intensive service, not a product.  You might be able to form a profitable small business, but I wouldn't call it a startup.",1175744699

5,9051,comment,8848.0,9017.0,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"Although blogs are a good way to see if someone is a good fit, you're probably excluding a lot of sharp people if you use that as your first filter.  <p>I'd also argue that how people fit in is important.  If you don't care about fit when you hire, you end up with a company of individuals instead of a team.  <p>I do agree that the best interview is one where the candidate actually does the type of work that is to be expected of him/her.

10,9045,comment,8891.0,8891.0,0,0,gojomo,,,"Clever.<p>A logo could also be made the basis for a fun color-picker: display the logo as a palette on which to click an eye-dropper to select each of the theme colors. Hell, animate the page look in real time as the user hovers (psychedelic!), lock-in their choice on click. <p>It might also be helpful to provide a version of the logo with pixels regrouped to make all like-pixels contiguous -- easier targetting of disperse colors. Order groups by brightness, saturation, frequency (a congruent histogram?), whatever's most pretty in practice.<p>(If you use this idea in your startup, invite me over for lunch someday.)",1175743362
