1,287748,comment,287508.0,287735.0,0,0,tesseract,,,"""Big, established, but failing company hires outsider CEO to turn company around"" seems to be a different pattern (and one with a better track record - Lou Gerstner at IBM also comes to mind) compared to ""young company takes large investment, has outsider CEO installed as adult supervision by investors"", which pattern seems to often lead to trouble.<p>Google comes to mind as a company that's well known for beating the curse of the investor-installed CEO; they did so by having the founders carefully vet the potential outsiders. Unfortunately this takes time so if you are running out of runway and need that investment in order to reach V2_min, you perhaps don't have that luxury.",1219809545
