Secondly, Google already shows users the data about how often they read articles from each feed. If it turns out that ordering feeds by priority is a good interface idea (which I think it is if you have search as well), then all Google has to do is write a few lines of code and the feeds will be ordered automatically using the read frequency data.<p>The way you explain the idea makes it sound novel, but to users, all they'll see is that you'll be able to reorder the feeds instead of putting it in alphabetical order. The data would be useful for bloggers, but it has to be appealing enough for end users to use as well, or there won't be any data in the first place.",1179978470

Who leads a team of smart hackers who first work out <i>the what</i>, <i>""make things people want""</i> then ruthlessly executes the <i>how</i>. All the time,  incremently adjusting the <i>what</i>. The focus, just work on making <i>""black box""</i> the best in the world and getting as many customers as possible.  At the same time, outsmarting those who seek to take a shortcuts in hard road to startup success.<p>BISHOP: ""Well here we have it gang. We know the deal, build the 'black box', release it early, incremental improvements and build up the customers.""<p>MOTHER: ""Come on <i>'Bishop'</i> that theory has been well and truly debunked. Just last week in my latest edition of <i>Conspiracy Theory</i>, you know the <i>Marketing</i> edition. It says in <i>black and white</i>, <i>'the only way to get recognised'</i> is a quick word to Crunch and your gold!.""<p>WHISTLER: ""Did you mean 'Capitan Crunch'? Did you know Crunch did prototype work for Apple ][ telephony hardware, but Jobs got it canned.""<p>BISHOP:  ""No he means the 'Silicon Alley' of the Noughties. TechCrunch is a waste of time. Look these guys can't even scale their website, they don't listen to their customers. When the advertising falls they are history."" <p>MOTHER: ""You mean I've been reading this Marketing edition and it's not true? But they have influence right? Just one email to the editor, then BAMMM. Instant recognition. I simply don't believe you.""<p>CREASE; ""It wasn't Jobs, 'Whistler'. It was Gates. Don't worry we settled that one siphoning off his fortune to charity and planting logic bombs in Windows Vista. You don't think he's quiting Microsoft for the love of giving money away do you?""<p>BISHOP:  ""Crease enough pranks. Carl hows the new features going? Whistler whats the growth rate this week?

It makes it a lot harder for someone to create a spoof domain like https://www.paypa1.com and for Paypal's real address to be displayed in the certificate when you click on it. Basically Verisign and co stake their reputation on checking the details of the certificate applicant.<p>I don't see what's terrible about browser makers trusting certain authorities. It's useful to the user, and there's more than one authority so less chance of abuse. The only alternative is no authorities, or a government bureaucracy issuing them. I don't see how either of those 2 options is superior to the current situation.<p>There's nothing stopping you creating a free Certification Authority, it's just that you'd have to persuade the browser makers to trust you.",1179977808

What if you are running an entertainment site with lots of subdomains and for every single subdomain the user gets harassed with this question?<p>These certificates have nothing at all to do with ""authority."" Just think about it, what exactly do they prove?<p>Why should you only be allowed to speak in confidence with well identified parties (not that verisign remotely attempts to identify anyone)? Think carefully.<p>Related: <a href=""http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/12/new_phishing_tr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/12/new_phishing_tr.html</a>",1179976528
