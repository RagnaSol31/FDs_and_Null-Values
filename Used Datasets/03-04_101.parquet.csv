Or a re-convert: I started with Apple II+, then got into IBM/Microsoft PC's, then came back to Apple a few years ago.<p>This is why I'm frustrated by the UX of iOS 4.0 running on my iPhone 3G. It is plagued with these unpredictable freezes, especially in Safari, which makes it unusable sometimes. We're talking total UI non-responsiveness for anywhere from 15-120 seconds, right smack in the middle of you're doing something. Very let down by them in this area. I've already learned of an unofficial way to downgrade back to 3.x, however, I've been reluctant to do it because I have some legacy contract projects who want me to support 4.0, so I need to keep something running it.<p>Other than this issue, though, Apple provides an awesome UX and has been a no-brainer choice over Microsoft -- a company I had also noticed many times in the past was copying the surface aspect of what a competitor did, often Apple, but not getting the fundamentals right, and making themselves look like idiots.",1282794854.0

And, his stories of being dejected for being not rich was kinda cloying, especially for someone who has done as his dad has and clawed his way out from a lower-middle working class background in a school where most people didn't mow their lawns because they didn't _have_ lawns.<p>That said, he did do forest fireman work. And, he was a Paramedic. That's pretty cool. In other words, it's the choices he's made that's semi-interesting, not that he was forced down those paths he chose. He has a rebellious streak, and it's discordant with his abilities and drive for achievement in school and entrepreneurship.

Meaning that more than 1 time in 4 you'd have a difference that big or bigger by chance.<p>In other words the entire basis of this post could be a chance statistical fluctuation that should be ignored.<p>It is true that there can be effects where pushing less qualified leads through the top stage of the funnel doesn't get them to the end.  However my experience with A/B testing is that it is more common for the extra people put in the system by an A/B test at the top to convert the rest of the way relatively similarly.<p>But not always!  Which is why if you have sufficient volume you should always measure to actual sales.  There is no other way to be absolutely sure that you are improving end sales.<p>However in this example that would mean running the test for something like 20x as long.  In that case it makes sense to be pragmatic, test from one step of the funnel to the next, and then pivot on the answers you get.  Furthermore to start you should focus on the top of the funnel for the simple reason that higher volumes will get you answers faster there - you can easily try a dozen ideas before you could test one idea deeper in the funnel.<p>Once you've improved your site enough to get a better percentage of actual sales, you'll be able to purchase more traffic.  Doing both of those things will put you in a position to conduct more rigorous A/B tests to eke out more subtle differences.  But that is down the road.  Focus on testing what is easiest in the quickest possible way first.",1282794063.0

OK, ""Parisian Love"" is redeemed by the sappy love story, but out of all three videos the only thing I saw or heard of an actual human being was a disembodied voice giving the phone voice commands.

Tell the VC that when you're starting your fundraising process you'll naturally get in touch with them.<p>Third, who's actually calling?  Is this a partner or is this an associate?  Associates are often just gathering information about areas they think might be interesting - they're just looking to get educated / educate their firm, and they figure you'll be willing to help them out for free.  Sometimes associates are doing due diligence on a potential investment by calling up competitors and seeing if they say the same things about the market.<p>In general, the conversation won't be that technical.  They'll want to understand what you do at a high level, get your opinion on the size of the market you're in, figure out if you're going to need to raise, figure out how you're making money / plan to make money, etc.  Don't feel compelled to tell them anything you wouldn't be comfortable telling everybody.<p>Also, it's a two-way street!  Ask them a ton of questions about what they're doing, which companies they've been looking at, what they think of your market, who they think your competitors are, what challenges they think you'll face - take everything said with a grain of salt, since you know your business better than they do, but sometimes you can glean interesting bits of information that way.",1282793765.0
