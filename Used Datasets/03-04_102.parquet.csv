You express a bunch of constraints then let a physics engine solve them on each time step (and sometimes across multiple time steps).<p>Custom (non-physics) solutions involve declarative sets of constraints being solved by some sort of engine; such solutions often start to resemble physics engines even if the physical rules even if the constraints are not exactly physical.<p>Learning how to use a physics engine, first, then how those physics engines work, is a good start to understanding these kinds of problems.<p>Edit: I'm really surprised the stackexchange answers don't mention this.",1347854392.0

18,4531263,comment,4489383.0,4492354.0,1,0,mbenjaminsmith,,,"Missed this comment.<p>I still don't agree. I think it's important to realize people can't always separate their work and personal lives -- especially things like taking a call from a mechanic at 11:00am. I wouldn't expect people to make all of their personal calls at 6:01 every day since it's generally not practical. I say this from a management perspective where I used to be pretty demanding about attention. After a while I realized that sometimes your team <i>has to take that call from their vet</i>. I think letting your team make that decision for themselves goes a long way in building a relationship.<p>I kind of see it like this:<p>You're either in an ""all hands"" type meeting or a small group or two-person meeting. If it's the former then I think participation is completely optional as you're likely to get a recap from a colleague afterwards or via email. If it's the latter then you're likely to be a relatively important part of that meeting and the others can wait for you if you need to interrupt. Of couse that doesn't mean that you should take every call whether business or personal but I don't think it's a case of either/or. There are plenty of company-related calls that could be temporarily ignored and vice-versa.",1347854043.0

I grew up in Maine which doesn't have an official language but has a de-facto standard of English and French.

22,4531259,comment,4530382.0,4530639.0,5,0,mhartl,,,"There is a natural monopoly in a <i>lingua franca</i>, or common tongue. The original <i>lingua franca</i> was a Mediterranean trading language that drew principally on Italian [1]; with modern communications and media linking the world, this monopoly is now global, and the monopolist is English. This became particularly clear to me last year as I traveled the world on a circumnavigation. In Thailand, the signs are in Thai and English. In Singapore, they are in Chinese and English. In the United Arab Emirates, they are in Arabic and English. In Ireland, they are in Irish and English.<p>English owes its status principally to the political dominance of English-speaking nationsroughly speaking, Britain ruled the world in the 19th century, and America ruled it in the 20thbut it's not a bad choice as languages go. It has a rich technical vocabulary, relatively simple grammar and syntax, and an alphabetic writing system based on the widely supported Roman alphabet. Its only plausible competition is Chinese, due mainly to the massive number of native Chinese speakers, but Chinese writing is so difficult [2] that it's hard to imagine it ever competing successfully with English: although the latter's idiosyncratic spelling is legendary [3], even a mediocre alphabetic system is still much easier than Chinese.<p>Some people worry that advocating the use of English is an act of cultural imperialism [4], but this issue arises only because for English speakers the native tongue and the <i>lingua franca</i> happen to coincide [5]. It's easy to see the fallacy if you consider the possibility of a different <i>lingua franca</i>; for example, if Swahili were the <i>lingua franca</i>, I would advocate its use, and would strive to master it myself. As luck would have it, I get to be lazy and coast on my native tongue, but if you haven't yet mastered English, it would be much to your benefit to do so.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Lingua_Franca"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Lingua_Franca</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/moser.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/moser.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoti"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoti</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html</a><p>[5] In physics, we would call this a <i>degeneracy</i>.",1347853959.0

Asking the user to install a plugin defeats the purpose here.<p>The keynote and Johnny Ive video are a little different because it's targeted towards people who are already Apple enthusiasts. They're much more likely to already have Safari or QuickTime installed (or at east be willing to install it).<p>Still, it does strike me as kind of odd that Apple is working so hard to make one video accessible while being pretty lazy with another one (they don't even bother to make it accessible to Chrome on Windows, which does have h.264 support, unless QuickTime is installed). Maybe those two parts of the site were prepared by different teams.<p>[EDIT]: Actually, I just tried again in Chome and IE 9 on Windows 7, and it works fine (without QuickTime installed).

Does the model involve interactions with other cows where the actions of one cow cause actions of others?  If so, one must have an event queue to handle chain reactions.  How discrete are the events?  Is there a ""temp is 89F"" event where, for every N minutes the cow is in that temperature in direct exposure, it becomes more likely to seek shade?  If so, the ""it is 89F"" event must be triggered multiple times.  And, such a rule requires that the past states of the cow be retained.
