3,4965024,comment,4964629.0,4964940.0,1,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> My understanding of why we didn't evolve to have better gene repair and longer lives is that the ideal death and mutation rates in terms of species survival is some finite number greater than zero. Near-immortality, eternal youth and perfect genome repair would be great from an <i>individual</i> perspective, but from a <i>species</i> perspective, those things reduce the ability for genetic innovation.<p>If this is the dominant effect in how organisms deal with aging, it can explain why we observe aging all around us in the world, but it predicts that, if you track a population over time, you will see lifespans creeping steadily upward.  I don't believe this is actually observed.<p>The phenomenon you describe is generally invoked to explain sexual reproduction.  But it is not unheard of for a particular ecological niche to be dominated by a clonal organism; it's just that those clonal organisms sometimes (inevitably?) ""fail"" very suddenly in the face of new competition.  So both ends of the tension between individual good / species-level good can be observed in the world, and it seems that in the case of sexual reproduction species-level good mostly dominates.<p>I'm not aware (disclaimer: I am an uninformed layperson) of similar conflicts between immortal species and aging ones for an ecological niche.  The picture I have of the world is that certain niches are filled by immortal organisms, and other, more macroscopic niches are filled by mortal ones.  Though typing this out makes me wonder about things like jellyfish.<p>To sum up, without seeing much evidence of strong selection for increasing lifespans, or increasing reproductive spans (the individual perspective counts!), and with the general bias not to invoke group selection where individual selection will do, the mortgaging-the-future approach to aging seems like a better explanation to me.",1356407880.0

But on this point, I can't blame them much.<p>The Servlet spec was finalized more than 15 years ago, when CGI scripts were the mainstream server-side tech and browsers were circa version 3. The domain ""google.com"" wasn't registered until 3 months later. I think Servlets were reasonably well done for the time. The web was obviously dominant, but FTP was still widely used, and it certainly wasn't clear that newer protocols wouldn't be important as well. Rails didn't turn up until 8 years later.<p>One could certainly blame the java folks for <i>stopping</i> there, but there wasn't a lot of advantage to be gained from redoing the foundations in a way that forced everybody to rework all of their existing servlet code.

The argument as I understand it is that all C89 standard-compliant compilers work with ""int main"" (and work correctly), regardless of whether or not the target OS has exit statuses. Not all compilers work with ""void main"", and those that do will yield executables that always produce an exit status of zero. While there are times you might write C code that doesn't need to be portable (in which case ""int main"" and ""void main"" are effectively the same if your system doesn't use exit statuses), there is no good reason for a C textbook to teach the non-standard approach that only works in certain non-portable cases.

Cherry used a waterless carwash solution that actually worked pretty well.<p>My husband was working for Cherry as a second job 3 days a week, and we're really sad to see it go. The money and hours were decent, and he thought it was better than being stuck in a coffee shop or something like that for a second job. He was solidly booked with customers on the days he worked, so I don't think Cherry folded for lack of customers. I also want to point out that not all Cherry car washers were social rejects who had no others options for work except for menial labor... my husband is college educated, we just needed some extra cash.<p>I think the real crime here, which no one has brought up, is that Cherry gave ZERO notice to the washers that it was going to fold up yesterday.

The article says:  ""For an animal of their size, [bats] also age very slowly...""<p>I'm assuming that, without their gene repair mechanism, they would have been more in line with other animals their size, and occasionally died of old age.  So the gene repair mechanism <i>does</i> extend the bats' lifespan.<p>To do good science, of course, you'd have to confirm this by an experiment to raise some bats that lack the gene repair mechanism and measure their deaths due to old age against a control group.  Or better yet, do a fantastically expensive long-term experiment comparing bat colonies with and without the DNA repair mechanism, and measure their genetic drift over time.<p>Of course, I haven't done those experiments.  If someone else does them, and shows results contradictory to my assumption, it'll be a great scientific discovery.  But in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it seems like it's a safe bet that the DNA repair mechansim would reduce mutation rates on its own, and anything that makes the bats live longer would also reduce mutation rates on its own, and having both longevity and DNA repair together would reduce mutation rates at least as much as either by itself.<p>You may say decades of lifespan is ""modest"" by human standards, but much more relevant comparisons would be to bats without the DNA repair mechanism -- or, if data is lacking on those, to closely related mammals of similar size.",1356407530.0
