But they were not in total compliance with said agreement. The agreement required that tesla keep certain financial ratios up to certain levels, and tesla failed to do that. As a result, tesla asked trhe government to change the terms. The government complied but wanted something in exchange. What they wanted was early repayment of their loans. That is why he is talking about early repayment. And that is probably one of the reasons why they raised extra money (although elon is unlikely to admit that).<p>So that is the full story. It is no big deal, i think tesla are very unlikely to default on the loan, but elon was definately not giving you all relevant info.",1349323091.0

43,4610786,comment,4607895.0,4610744.0,3,0,mbell,,,Some depth can be modeled with phase control.  By controlling the phase of a signal compared to another you can create a perceived time delay which makes it appear as though one performer is behind another.  I'd also add that this is much easier to do with low frequencies (bass player) due to the wavelength being so long.  At 49hz (G1 on a bass guitar) the acoustical wavelength is ~6.9 meters which means even small phase shifts (time delays) can create meaningful depth.  This approach is pretty useless at higher frequencies as the time delay (and depth) achievable gets very small.<p>There are other ways to do this via more complex 3D acoustical modeling.  Mostly focusing on modeling of reverberation effects but you don't see that much in music recording.  It is used a lot in games though.,1349321659.0

You could to put it in a frequency band unused by the surround audio, but masked by the center - but this would show up very distinctly on spectrograms or phase analysis. Likewise, one could modulate the panning of a particular frequency band across the left and right, but that would also be quite noticeable on visual analysis.<p>You could do wideband modulation that would be much harder to detect, but only if your music is repetitive...such that you subtract, say, the instrumental content of the first verse from that of the second to reveal your hidden message. That's not so difficult, given the ubiquity of loop-based and electronic music nowadays.<p>One other issue with all these schemes is that the more well-hidden your steganographic message is, the more likely it is to be corrupted or destroyed by conversion to lossy data formats such as mp3. If you absolutely had to hide a message in musical form, I think it would be better to do in the manner of the purloined letter, <i>ie</i> haiding it in plain site. Encode it into the rhythm of the cymbals, or the sequence of pitch differentials in the primary melody or some other foregrounded musical element.

The sort of safety mechanisms implemented by the exchange (which shouldn't permit errors by member firms from damaging the market) to prevent these sort of problems are similar to the sort of mechanisms that can prevent crashes from faulty automatic trading programs.,1349320947.0

In this case, customers tend to get better prices on their orders.<p>One of the big misconceptions about ""flash"" orders was that customers were being disadvantaged; many customers actually wanted this feature so that they could continue sending volume to more technologically advanced markets such as BATS and Direct Edge and avoid being forced to send to e.g. NYSE (which was very slow) by ""trade through"" regulations.

Instead of trading with each other, both investors would trade with liquidity providers who will step in to buy from one investor at $1.51 and sell at $1.59.
