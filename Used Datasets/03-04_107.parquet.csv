That improves the chances of you being a good listener, someone that really listens instead of being tuned-out while composing your next line.<p>It's important for many reasons to strike a balance between work and play (and quality solitude), but don't be alone out of being uncomfortable with others.  Try to seek a space where it works for you, where you can unwind, and you can be ""in the moment"".<p>By being in the moment I mean not thinking or worrying about what happened last week or last year, or what will happen next week or next year.  Relax... take in the sounds around you.  Get i tune with all of your senses.  Hopefully as you unwind you'll find yourself breathing slower but deeper.  Perhaps you can casually go somewhere with someone on a picnic, a hike, or camping.  Visit the coast or a lake, enjoy the night sky.  The things people stress over at school or work may not even matter years later.  Don't throw your time away in a stressful limbo that's in-between  work/study you're into, and the off the clock pleasure time.  Get plenty of rest, regular sunshine, some exercise (at least plenty of fast walking), eat with variety and moderation.\nThe rest and sunshine play a large role in healthy brain chemistry and various hormones.\nLiving out of the moment is a bit like driving while texting.  Life flows better if you're all there for it. Get in tune with yourself, discover how seemingly small things influence the way you feel.<p>Go at your own pace with people.  Take time to figure out who you are, what you like, and who you want to be with.  If you're thinking about your orientation, don't feel alone.  Whatever you're going through know that there are many like you, and you'll get wherever you're going at your pace.  The people that matter will appreciate you for who you are.  Be tolerant of and not preoccupied with the rest.  Be in tune with peoples' feelings, and learn to see who can sense and really care about yours.<p>You might experiment with different types of music.  There's a rush from the energy of metal, but some other types may work better for relaxed intimate periods.<p>Do what you feel is right, even when no one else seems to. Learn to trust your gut feelings more than what people say.<p>Best wishes.",1285559835.0

There are significant innovations pioneered by silicon valley companies that demonstrate remarkable long term value. I'm also going to use Silicon Valley broadly to mean internet startups because the valley is now more of a culture and group of people than a region. Additionally, I'm choosing technically challenging problems instead of difficult execution challenges or marketing challenges (SMB SaaS companies, local advertising aggregators).<p>1. Media delivery shift: Netflix, OnLive, Pandora are now distributing previously physical media in ways that will disrupt their respective industries. Blockbuster is now bankrupt.<p>2. Communication: Skype is now the largest long distance carrier in the world. It's Scandinavian, yes, but give me some leeway!<p>3. Information processing: Palantir manipulates huge data sets for financial institutions and the government.<p>4. Financial markets: SecondMarket and TheReceivables Exchange are creating markets in previously illiquid markets.<p>5. Medical innovation: there are tens of companies working on EMR systems and building business intelligence applications for hospitals to increase quality of care while reducing costs<p>6. Big Data: Hadoop and other NOSQL databases have been built in the past 10 years to enable massive computation on commodity hardware. Not to mention the three storage companies that just sold for $1B+ each in the past 2 months.<p>7. Energy: Solar panels, fuel generating algae, carbon sequestration: Innovation is happening here in the valley using the techniques and science developed for semi-conductor fabrication and novel ways of processing.<p>The most recognizable startups may not be innovative in the sense the author is describing, but it's clear to me from an investment point of view that there is more innovation across more industries occurring today than ever before.

If you have an office and you are meeting customers, you might have to pay City tax (depending on the City).  Once you have income, things start to change.  First of all, the $800 Franchise tax is a minimum and California actually charges a percentage based on your ""gross"" income, not net profit.  Also, Federal treats any income you incur as an LLC as employment and is subject to self-employment tax (in addition to Federal and State income tax).  My own experience is that in the beginning of a startup, you don't have enough that actually warrants hiring an accountant. My advise is that you learn to be your own accountant until you start hiring.

Sticking to advice that will apply no matter where you are:<p>If you have to equip the place from scratch and need to do it on the cheap, find restaurant auctions around your location.  Restaurant and bar equipment depreciates at a sickening rate, and they go out of business frequently.  You can save well over 70% off of catalog for six month old equipment.<p>Find a local insurance agent and get to know them very well.  Don't ever, ever skimp on liability insurance.<p>In my experience far and away most important aspect of operating a bar is the staff that you employ. Obviously they need to be as trustworthy as possible - employee theft is a constant. Much like fighting illegal downloads you will be fighting to minimize it rather than abolishing it.  The theft will rarely be in the form of removing money from the register till, but rather in the form of unpaid product.<p>The larger reason that your hires will be important though is because hiring the right people is the most effective form of marketing that you can possibly do.  Hiring a staff of well connected, social butterfly waitresses, door guys, and bartenders has an infinitely higher ROI than any print or radio marketing that you can do.<p>Additionally, good employees are perhaps the most important differentiating factor for your business.  Unless you are a multi-million dollar Vegas-style theme joint, your business is a commodity.  There are already twenty other businesses just like yours.  Having employees that are both good at their jobs and eager to establish relationships with your patrons will be key in converting customers to repeat customers.<p>Could type all day, but the last thing that I would add is that as with any new business you will struggle to gain traction. When marketing I always tended to look at my job as one of disrupting traffic patterns.  Potential patrons already had their favorite bar and a list of five others on a short list. My job was to get myself on that list, and in order to do that I would have to offer an awfully compelling reason to get them to disrupt their patterns.<p>I would usually use either a heavy loss leader (really cheap drinks) on a typically low revenue night or high profile events (big name band / DJ, fight night, etc).  Once I had ac customer in the door and I provide a well executed experience it becomes a numbers play much like PPC advertising in the web world.  50% of the people that tried me out will be back someday, I made it on to the short list of 10% of the new customers, 5% wind up being new regulars.",1285558610.0

I guess it really has been such a long time since I've had to consider the impact being introverted was having on my life. After all, I have a husband, two children, a plethora of hobbies and an excellent job. Sometimes I tripped over my own introversion, sometimes other people tripped over it instead. Other times, I approached interacting with other people as a sort of experiment -- though this made me feel like a bit of a sociopath, because as it turns out, most extroverts are disturbingly easy to manipulate.<p>Anyhow, this is more or less what I've told my kids: take a deep breath, listen and learn. Most introverts are excellent listeners, with an above average capacity to synthesize. People like to talk about themselves and they like to talk to people who are actively listening. You can learn a lot about how to make people happy by just listening to them. Of course, it takes a lot of discipline to not talk.

If my startup is set to change X, Y, or Z, no harm in suggesting that to a blogger.
