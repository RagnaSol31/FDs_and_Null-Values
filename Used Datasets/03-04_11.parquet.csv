3,149864,comment,149052.0,149827.0,0,0,astine,,,"It's an ad hominem attack if you are attempting to refute an argument they made for the pay raise.<p>For example, if a senator gave a speech detailing why senators needed more money and someone dismissed the arguments based on the senator's sentatorness rather the quality of the argument's themselves.<p>Also, an ad hominem is not merely a 'personal attack.' For example, an insult is not an ad hominem. An ad hominem is an attempt to discredit an argument based on qualities of the arguer instead of the argument itself. Pointing out a conflict of interest is an ad hominem attack if you are using it to discredit an argument.",1206849376

Video streaming does go slowly across the Internet and seeing that he made his fortune through video streaming it would make sense that he would take this view. However, the things that make the Internet popular are not it's ability to emulate television, but it's ability to do things that television cannot. It's strengths include a low barrier to entry for both application deliverers and users, and a world-wide audience. Neither of those are available with cable.<p>The former could change, but it seems unlikely with the current market, cable is too tightly controlled.<p>The latter couldn't, at least not through Mr. Cuban's scheme. Seriously, what good would an app like Digg/Reddit be if it were only available on an intranet? Who would write a weblog if he knew only Comcast users would be able to read it? Consumers would be divided based on the cable service for which they paid. This seems like it would totally miss the point of the Internet.",1206848853

The result of financial speculation of recent years was the allocation of credit to the real estate industry, distorting the real economy in multitude of ways, by pulling resources in an unsustainable fashion.<p>In 2000, there were 100+ optical networking companies in the 10 mile radius around Palo Alto. That was the result of that period's credit bubble, which worked its way through credit -> stock market/debt market -> telecom companies -> start-ups.",1206848784

When I was running 64-bit Firefox and using nspluginwrapper to run Flash, I was getting total browser lockups and 50% (100% of one CPU) usage in some (totally random) instances of Flash usage. It got to the point where I downgraded to 32-bit Firefox with 32-bit Flash, where I haven't had as many problems (but still some laggy Firefox performance, for example on Buffalo Wild Wings' website). Actually, I would guess that because of issues like this and the Java plugin, Ubuntu probably uses 32-bit Firefox even for 64-bit architectures.",1206848673

14,149852,comment,149708.0,149810.0,0,0,startingup,,,"My point is that <i>real owners of capital</i> (i.e people who saved the capital) will not lend to create the kind of leverage these hedgies have employed. Imagine you are a billionaire. Will you <i>lend to</i> (which is different from having an equity stake in) Meriwether so he can lever up his fund 14x with your borrowed money?<p>Yet, banks have freely lent to them, because they could, in turn, borrow from the Fed. The Fed (i.e us taxpayers) have operated as the ultimate patsy in the system, providing a one way bet to the speculating class. The evidence of it is the relentless expansion of the <i>total credit</i> in the system (as a percentage of GDP). Literally, the Fed has allowed the creation of total system-wide credit at 2-3 times faster rate than GDP growth, for many, many years running.<p>No matter what happens now, most hedge fund managers got theirs. As has already been observed, 8 years of feverish levered returns followed by one year of total wipe-out of capital still makes the managers ahead!",1206848071

The jobs that did well during the Great Depression may well not be the ones that do well now -- the jobs that do well now might not even have <i>existed</i> 70 years ago.<p>More importantly, choosing your career based on transient properties of the economy is a terrible idea. Do what you love, and make sure you're good at it; the rest will work itself out.",1206848049

17,149849,comment,149834.0,149834.0,0,0,mixmax,,,"This is an incredibly cool technology, and the basic idea is pretty simple: You take a RGB LED, modulate the intensity of the red green and blue diode so that the light output matches the scanlines of your projected image. Then you project it onto a mirror mounted on a piezo electric crystal which oscillates to match the scanlines. And voila - you have a projector.<p>The inhibiting factor has been that RGB LED's have been quite expensive but they are rapidly dropping in price. The blue ones are particularly pricey.",1206847856

22,149844,comment,149091.0,149650.0,0,0,far33d,,,"This article uses a classic diversion tactic - focus on a singular issue, which may have contributed, and attribute all of a complex issue to the single issue that fits the agenda.<p>No mention of how lending agencies, given incentives to close as many mortgages as possible, had no incentive to make sure those lenders could actually pay. The article gives no mention to how the Fed's lax monetary policy dropped interest rates and created a frenzy in housing that blocked a lot of people out unless they used non-traditional instruments.<p>The author doesn't say that the ""anti-racist"" policies are one factor (which may be true) but that these policies are the direct cause. As someone who purchased a home two years ago, I became personally aware of how low short-term interest rates combined with a housing frenzy that drove prices up over 20% a year can easily push a lot of people to get low-interest ARM mortgages instead of more stable 30yr mortgages.<p>I just think this article takes on a straw man because it suits an anti affirmative action agenda.",1206847208
