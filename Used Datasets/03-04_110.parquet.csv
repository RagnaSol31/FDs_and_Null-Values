This is very important once you start creating platform type apps. Skinning can be a very time consuming process; IB makes it more manageable.<p>To clarify what milkshakes is saying, IB stops being useful when you are doing custom animations (e.g. moving subviews around - something that is very common if you have a custom animation). Usually, IB will beat a developer coding CGRect type code from scratch (unless they are using Opacity - a great tool that generates code and is very programmer friendly). A custom UIView will probably win the performance race but lose in the productivity/maintenance marathon.<p>Once you start getting into custom rounded table cells, custom table headers that act as row 0 of the table cell, empty placeholder cells, CoreData, and table/cell animations - you are entering the dark side...<p>Using IB for UITableViewCells doesn't have a significant performance penalty now because if you are doing custom cells - the client is probably willing to sacrifice 60fps scrolling - to get their custom table gradients/cell backgrounds (otherwise the cells would be opaque).",1296446047.0

I would have more respect for you if you said for instance yes we have these well documented problems but not everyone in Israel is like that.<p>Legal discrimination is systematized discrimination, it does not imply that every law in the country is racist, but since you're accusing the country of legal discrimination I just referred to what you said it as ""systematized racism"" instead of ""legal [race based] discrimination."" I may have misquoted the degree of your criticism but you are still arguing that relatively small issues are in fact serious racial discrimination issues (small in the sense that they don't contribute to racial discrimination, not that the issues themselves aren't serious.) I don't even deny that there is racial discrimination from a small portion of individuals but to say that there is strong legal action taken to discriminate in the country is just flatly wrong.<p>>> Regardless of your efforts at justifying it with excuses, it stands up to the definition of discrimination, whatever the excuse or the path to that may be. No racist person or entity in history has ever suffered from lack of excuses.<p>No, the country isn't perfect or entirely fair but each of these criticisms has plausible <i>non racist</i> explanations. For example the building permits there are issued just like in the US: you have to pass many different rigorous legal and technical tests before you can build, and it is not entirely impossible that the legwork isn't being done by these Arab communities in the first place. The building-permit process in Israel is widely criticized as unusually slow for any country even in Jewish communities and I believe the OECD just released an evaluation that it takes 3 times as long in Israel as other OECD countries to issue building permits.<p>And another example: the criticism of education funding is no different than what happens in the US, where some people argue that a community's funding for education should be directly from what that community can extract from taxes.
