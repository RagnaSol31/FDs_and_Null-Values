A big issue from my perspective is that everyone is ringing their hands about home values and trying to prop up the deflating bubble.  As someone with aspirations to own a home, this is infuriating.  I can't afford a home, and neither could all the people who bought them.  They need to let the prices fall to where people can actually afford them instead of trying to save the speculative value which we already know was based on hot air.",1285646367

ZFS can easily handle as many drives as you can fit in one machine and if you scale horizontally then that's all you have to worry about.

Towering mountains, twisting caves opening up to caverns, islands, precious ores sprinkled throughout, etc. Notch, could you explain at a high level how the world generation algorithm does this?<p>I'm not sure how to explain it without getting technical.. The complicated high level technical version is: First I generate a linearly interpolated 3d perlin noise offset along the y axis. I fill that in so that everything except the top x blocks is stone, then I do a second pass to add features like grass, trees, gravel, sand, caves and flowers. The world is generated in chunks of 16x16x128 blocks, based of pseudorandom seeds that are a mix of the level base seed and the chunk location in the world.

I've been able to train myself to avoid focusing on the results pane until I get deep into my query string (3rd or 4th word.)  That tends to be where I organically pause anyway, while deciding whether I should tack on another word to my long-tail queries.<p>By that point in the query process, the noisy and wildly-irrelevant entries have already been weeded out, and I can start focusing on the results pane.  Interestingly, on several occasions recently, I've seen a promising result flicker past as I'm in the process of adding that 4th word to my query.  When I'm done typing, I see that none of the results are as good as the one that flickered past when I had just 3 words in my query, so I delete the last word and voila.  Result that I might not have found without instant search.<p>I'm still not crazy about some of the larger implications (pushing most users towards the same query strings, etc.) but am finding it surprisingly useful on a personal level.<p>FWIW, YMMV, etc...",1285645835

The onus is now on the app to be as awesome as possible in both free and paid versions.  It's exposed to more people.
