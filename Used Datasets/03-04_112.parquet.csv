There are also plenty of common libraries with Typescript annotations, so you can just use e.g. Phaser and Typescript together without any extra work.  Other than that Flow and Typescript are fairly similar.  Perhaps someone who has used Flow can explain what makes it different from Typescript.",1448939476.0
