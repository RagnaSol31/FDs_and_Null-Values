That said, penalties for running on the web include:<p>Even a well-written JS app on a great JIT is going to have trouble keeping up with an equivalently well-written native app that has access to SIMD, cache-aware memory layouts, prefetching and other native features.  My CPU can do 200 million matrix x vector multiplies per second using SSE3.  In Firefox4 JS it can do 20 million.  Impressive, but not equivalent.<p>On Windows, you are probably running GL on top of a D3D translation layer.  That adds overhead to an API that you sometimes want to call into 60,000+ times per second.  The GLSL to HLSL shader translation step is a big pain during load times.  I'm not sure how much of a run-time penalty it causes.<p>Web GLSL is somewhere between HLSL Shader Model 2 and 3 from 2003.  The latest desktop GPUs run Shader Model 5 which has many sophisticated features and performance opportunities.  However, many of those are a bit too sophisticated for casual 3D programmers.  Hopefully WebOpenCL will come eventually and shrink that feature gap.",1305259190.0

A lot of work is off-loaded on GPU's now days, and theoretically there should be no reason why talking to the video-card through a browser should be slower than talking to it through a portable executable (.exe). The reality of it is that there is far more sandboxing and verification that needs to be done since no one likes having their browser crashed out of the blue. As for performance of languages (JavaScript vs C or x86), naturally, you will always get more performance the closer to the iron you are but it's getting fairly blurred and compilers/interpreters are pretty damn smart these days.<p>I realize I'm not answering your question entirely, but what I read between the lines is you're wondering whether WebGL will be able to replace ""native"" applications, performance-wise in the future.
