18,667077,comment,666611.0,667065.0,0,0,mcav,,,I don't understand it either. You somehow have to differentiate the tag from the content; maybe he wanted to reduce the redundancy of the open/close tags. Something like CSS:<p><pre><code>    h1 { this is a header }\n    p  { this is the content. }\n</code></pre>\nHTML5-style optional ending tags might also work:<p><pre><code>    <h1>This is a header\n    <p>This is some content.\n</code></pre>\n(Though I remain confused about which closing tags are optional in the HTML5 spec. I think h1 tags have to be closed.),1245554514

Someone needs to set them up, plug them in, calibrate them, feed them raw materials, and generally keep them working.<p>As technology changes, the skills you need in order to rightly be called a ""skilled"" laborer change.  In general, they seem to tend to require more education over time (although this might just be social; I'm not convinced that it really requires more study to become a programmer today than it did to become a good paleolithic hunter, it just seems easier to <i>us</i> because their training wasn't formalized and thus seems invisible).  You can't expect one skillset to just carry you safely through the rest of your life without staying on top of changes.<p>Machines eliminate some jobs, but they inevitably create new ones: designing, maintaining, and operating the machines.  In many cases they eliminate more jobs than they create, which is something we need to plan for, but I don't see any real chance that the machines are just going to make human beings obsolete -- in any avenue of work -- tomorrow.",1245554368

29,667066,comment,666360.0,666656.0,0,0,Kadin,,,"> Ecology aside, that's a very selfish way to think.<p>Saying ""ecology aside"" brushes off a lot of stuff, and not just the sort of hippy-dippy environmentalist shit that corporate types and pro-growth economists scoff at.  It basically assumes extremely cheap raw materials and vast, far-off factories churning out parts.  It assumes horrendous waste, both of materials and energy, in most cases.<p>Disposability almost always carries with it a huge externalization of costs on somebody else.  In many cases when the costs of replacement are fully internalized into the part, it's no longer nearly as cheap; repair starts to become a viable option.<p>There may be situations where it's cheaper to replace than to repair, but in order to find where that's really true, we need to work towards full encapsulation of production costs in end goods, something we do a really shitty job of today.  If we work towards that, I suspect the world we'll end up with has a lot more skilled-labor jobs, but won't create them for nonsensical or romantic reasons, where they're clearly unnecessary or wasteful.",1245553710

I mean, there seems to be an assumption that market dominance in cultural distribution is <i>obviously</i> bad, no explanation required. But it is not clear to me what the precise danger is here, because it is not clear to me what the necessity is for content creators to stick with Googlezon if Googlezon as a content publisher becomes deleterious to their well-being.<p>He mentions that there are only 6 (major) movie studios. Let's pretend that they have a merge-a-thon and get down to one major movie studio. Would it matter to anyone? Probably not, because the 6 current large studios more or less all churn out the same mainstream fair. Would a small independent studio be worse off if there was one instead of six major studios? Probably not, because the small independent (""startup"" in your parlance) exists to cater to a certain niche that welcomes its products almost by definition because they are not a major studio cookie-cutter production.<p>Don't get me wrong - I can seriously wind myself up thinking about the consolidation of the news media, or of chip manufacturing companies, but in this particular case I still don't understand what I am really supposed to be afraid of. And he asks for pretty major action as a result of a danger that is not particularly clear.",1245553296
