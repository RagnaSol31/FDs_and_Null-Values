Apple is a hardware company first, and one market where they already have some expertise is in displays. I realize it's not the exact same technology for TVs, but to think that Apple would not at least give it a shot, with an iTunes backend providing content seems like a missed opportunity in another multibillion dollar market.

While they are so prepared to step up and say something about their convictions, wrapped up and emotionally spirited after been told, all throughout their school lives about how their parents were activists (for things that actually mattered, but that's a different story), my generation lacks what matters when it comes to being an activist:<p>The ability to realize actions speak louder than words.  As long as it doesn't involve going outside, standing in a line or otherwise stepping away from your precious Macbooks for a few hours a day to actually form a peaceful, but resolute protest about a matter, it's very unlikely that this generation will actually accomplish things like this.  And even then, something like deactivating your Facebook account turned out to be a flop.<p>What's more shocking is that they were more than willing to take part in a day in which thousands of people stood up, and willfully desecrated the holy figure of another religion, whether or not they actually understood the overtones of what they were doing, or understanding the undertones of the moderate followers of the Muslim community who reached out to media outlets to explain why the Muhammad drawings disturbed them (Muhammad did not want to be worshiped as an Idol, and they felt that depicting him in the form of an image would detract from the central message he was trying to convey).<p>Surprising, yet expected all at the same time.",1275450896.0

I'm sure you can come up with better arguments that this talking-point line which has no basis in truth.<p>There is no evidence, none, that there is a well funded industry lobby group in operation.  The large mass of skeptical enquiry into climate science is done by amateurs and/or people with tenure in universities. It is done on low-rent blogs and in pay-per-visit speaking tours, and all done on a comparative shoestring.  I remember reading an article somewhere that breathlessly revealed that a climate skeptic had been paid $100,000 for a speaking tour to spread the no global warming line.  $100,000 is a drop in the bucket, an absolutely meaningless figure.  This was the best they could come up with, when it's quite simple to see, say, $1.4 million dollars being spent to explore the link between malaria and climate change when there have been plenty of scientific papers to say there's no link at all, or such a small link it is drowned out by the noise.<p>Compared against the billions spent by governments, NGOs, lobby groups, and yes, oil companies, to promote climate alarmism, it is an ocean compared to the bits and pieces of fuding that well known sceptics.  You've only got to compare the heartland institute's climate seminar in chicago - a two bit affair, to the grandiose climate-alarmism conferences in Indonesia, Copenhagen, and later this year, Cancun to really see the difference.<p>I will agree with you that nobody wants to change their lifestyle, and that is a major problem for the adoption of policies.  But then, in democracies, the burden of proof lies with the person proposing the changes, and they should be self evident.  This is a sup-optimal solution, no doubt, by the inertia involved means that it prevents making too many mistakes.  If all of the various scare campaigns of the last 100 years were all enacted straight away, we'd have seen millions of human lives, and billions of man-years of effort wasted making the planet a worse-off place.<p>By all means continue to argue to your passion, but I would advise coming up with a new meme over the 'industry funded lobby groups' one.",1275449577.0

There's a lot of whining coming from what amounts to Apple fanbois on this issue, when the right thing to do is vote with your dollars and your time.  I have a lot more respect for the developer who blogs about how they are moving to another platform and actually <i>does it</i> than one who complains about having hooked their wagon to the wrong star.  It's interesting that people like this choose the platform where everything is decided for you (users and developers) rather than helping to make another platform that provides them more freedom to be more finished and polished.  They'll use the excuse that they just want to get things done and don't want to be bothered with the lower level details needed to make their app look good/attractive/functional/whathaveyou -- 1) then why bother programming at all, 2) good luck differentiating your app (remove the widgets so your picture frame app follows the new guidelines, now your app duplicates Apple's functionality) when you can't go beyond the preconceived ideas of how apps should operate.<p>That being said, I'm not sure the author would want a mature market that has ""fully expanded and is not growing"" anyway.  This seriously limits the growth potential.  Who's developing for WebOS?  By your definition the WebOS market has matured, has expanded and is not growing.  However, both the iPhone and Android ecosystems continue to grow, so then neither have ""matured"".",1275449452.0

Most anonymity systems assume about 1/5 of the nodes will be compromised (which is reasonable barring a very large global adversary).<p>In general, timing attacks are the biggest issue in low-latency anonymity systems: if you can track packets going into Tor and coming out of Tor, you can link the sender to the destination. But, if the traffic was encrypted, that still doesn't get you the documents themselves.<p>Edit: More specifically to the grandparent---even with a compromised exit node, that doesn't reveal the source (that's the point of onion routing). The case of China is a hard one, due to the level of state control. There are ways to request exit nodes in the Tor network (I have no idea how well documented this is), so for them, selecting an exit outside China for accessing international sites would probably be best (this would remove/greatly reduce the risk of Chinese gov't timing attacks).<p>There has been some work on strategically choosing entrance/exit nodes to reduce the risk of these kinds of timing attacks, but I don't know of anything that has been published or implemented yet (I haven't worked on that particular aspect in a while).
