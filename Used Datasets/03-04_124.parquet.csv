The difference is that, reduce being eager, and these reducers fns being out of the seq game, there's no per-step allocation overhead, so it's faster. <i>Laziness is great when you need it, but when you don't you shouldn't have to pay for it.</i><p>Looking forward to trying this out. I've been implementing another language in Clojure (tho just experimenting for the moment). It's a non-lazy language (Groovy) so I have <i>reduce</i> all over the place, e.g.<p><pre><code>  (defn multiply [a b]\n    (cond (and (number? a) (number? b)) (* a b)\n          (and (vector? a) (integer? b)) (reduce conj [] (flatten (repeat b a)))\n          (and (string? a) (integer? b)) (reduce str (repeat b a))))\n\n  (defn findAll [coll clos]\n    (reduce conj [] (filter clos coll)))\n</code></pre>\nHope reducers give a speed boost by removing the laziness I'm not using.",1336535623

Most trading of these assets happens OTC, between private parties, and never touches an exchange.<p>I was not claiming that it does happen in an exchange. I was claiming that the banks were (successfully, for years) doing everything in their power to stop such an exchange from forming - do you think that is not true?<p>I was claiming that the big banks own the existing exchanges, currenex, hotspot, EBS, is that not true? (I've been out of the game in the last 3 years, the player names might have changed -- but I'd be surprised)<p>I have first hand experience of big banks exerting their influence on those (supposedly anonymous) exchanges to kick participants out when their trading style was not compatible with the banks' interest.<p>> This is far more de-centralized and efficient than having it happen on exchanges.<p>De-centralized, yes. Efficient? Only for the other party (which is a bank, the vast majority of the time).<p>If you want to change swiss francs to USD, and I want to change USD to swiss francs, if we had a two sided market (""an exchange"") to meet in, we'd find each other, agree on a public, easily discoverable price, and that's it; The one of of us who was smarter (or could wait longer) would earn the spread, the other one would pay it; alternatively we would meet at the mid price, splitting the spread. This happens all the time in exchange traded shares, commodities and futures.<p>However, the way it works today OTC is that instead you and I both find a big enough player (e.g. JP Morgan, or Goldman, or whoever), who makes a market in the currency - buys at the lower price, sells at the higher price, earning the entire spread, always. Unlike either of us, that player -- by virtue of its size and position -- knows the ""buy"" and ""sell"" orders of a lot of the smaller players, and can react accordingly.<p>> s someone who negotiated the rate at which he changed his Swiss francs into US Dollars at a JP Morgan Chase branch in New York, it isn't a regulatorily locked market. Having a private banking relationship will lower the threshold for negotiated rates, too<p>That's exactly my point: You would expect an exchange that would make this into a symmetric, competitive, information efficient market <i>because</i> there are hardly any regulatory issues (compared e.g. to running a stock or commodity exchange). The fact that this hasn't happened in 500 years of modern exchanges is a testament to the stronghold that banks have on currency trading.<p>Note that such exchanges have appeared for everything, from bandwidth to energy to pork bellies - but only in a very limited way for currencies (controlled by the same old boys network), where it is easiest to start such an exchange, and such a market benefits everyone except same old boys.",1336535220
