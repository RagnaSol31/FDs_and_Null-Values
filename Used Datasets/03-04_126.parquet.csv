If they don't catch the fraud before capturing the funds, then they'll find out about it when the real card holder charges back the unauthorized payment. Now they:<p>1) Lose the $10-25 chargeback fee.<p>2) Risk their ability to accept Visa and MasterCard cards at all if their chargeback rate exceeds 1% for multiple months.<p>The harm of payment fraud is not the lost product or service. Payment fraud is a direct threat to the very existence of an eCommerce business; the ability to accept payments from customers. If your merchant account is terminated for too many chargebacks, your company and all its principles are added to the MATCH/TMF (Terminated Merchant File) lists which all banks/issuers must consult before opening an account. They're essentially banned from accepting credit cards for life, for that business or any future venture.<p>Considering Adobe's software has historically been among the most pirated, I wouldn't be surprised if they have a significant number of people trying to buy it with stolen card numbers.

The article mentions that heavy squats and cleans will wear you down so you'll stop coming to a gym. Perhaps that's the case for the author.<p>For me the case is the opposite. I get sick of feeling ""burn"" from high rep routines and would rather do squats then cleans that leave me panting on the floor, without burn.<p>It may be a genetic difference. People have different proportions of fast and slow twitch muscle and excel at different sports.<p>And the P90X style workouts with bodyweight do cause some muscle growth. That's how people post ripped pics of themselves after programs like P90X. A bit of muscle growth usually combined with fat loss.<p>I was surprised that a mere 100 lb weight set would feel so heavy even though I could do 50 pushups, 12 pullups, etc. I expected I'd need 2-300 lbs to really feel the weight, really overestimating the shape I was in after doing bodyweight drills.",1338176887.0

As a photographer, I use Lightroom and Photoshop for most of my post-processing needs. Lightroom, when it hit, barely felt like an Adobe application (it's great), but Photoshop has always been a nightmare of crashes. CS5 on OS X is especially bad.<p>As an experiment, I tried to use (only) Lightroom and Pixelmator[1], which is the closest ""indie"" alternative to Photoshop I could find/had experience with. Note that GIMP was out as 2.8 wasn't released by then, and older versions were horribly clunky. Pixelmator gets a lot of things right; it's fast, has a clean UI and supports a raft of layer blending types. But it lacks a lot of useful keyboard shortcuts-and I don't mean ""Photoshop shortcuts"", I mean shortcuts, period.<p>This in itself slowed me down considerably; I have a small set of Actions in PS that I use for some final tweaks on most images. Having to re-create those layers manually, for each image, isn't that fun.<p>I would definitely say that for most users, Pixelmator (or Acorn, etc.) can definitely replace Photoshop. But it's difficult to move away from PS when there's such a large ecosystem attached to it (as unfortunate as that realisation may be).<p>[1] <a href=""http://pixelmator.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pixelmator.com/</a>",1338176818.0

They've committed nearly $100 million to developer support and resources.<p>And it doesn't just end with money. I can engage and communicate with many people within RIM's developer relations team, at any time I want. I have a few on BBM, but that's rarely used as it's quite invasive and personal.

80,4031777,comment,4031163.0,4031629.0,1,0,HorizonXP,,,"Again, I do not work for RIM, I'm merely a developer.<p>I've used a Galaxy Nexus for the last week or so, and my parents have iPhones. E-mails and notifications arrive on the Galaxy relatively quickly, I would say almost on par with the BlackBerry, with a very slight edge given to BlackBerry. To be honest, if RIM wants to maintain their existing BES/BIS infrastructure, they're going to have to give more compelling reasons than just push notifications, because it's a problem that is almost solved on other platforms. However, as a developer, to integrate the notifications into your own app, it's easiest on the BlackBerry, and more powerful. That may be good enough reason, especially for enterprises.<p>You are correct about one BES/BIS account only being able to be associated with one PIN. Remember, this is something that was developed nearly 10 years ago. They could never have foreseen the day when people would need multiple devices. Remember, 10+ years ago, convergence of devices was all the rage.<p>That said, it was a bit shameful that they couldn't make that change, but it is somewhat understandable. I think RIM didn't foresee the need for native PIM apps on the PlayBook, because they figured most everyone would just use web-based clients if necessary. I'll be frank, I have a BlackBerry, so I used the Bridge apps, and I continue to use them.<p>The multiple PIN situation is, I believe, solved. If you look at the SDK documentation, there are numerous references to PPIDs and PINs. Basically, a user has one PPID which is unique to them, but they can have multiple PINs, each representing a different device.<p>I've tried the Cascades SDK, and I do have a Dev Alpha. The Dev Alpha is just a smaller and faster PlayBook, with a bunch of new APIs added and a cell radio (I'm simplifying of course). It's a great little device that has made development much easier. That said, a lot of us are really looking forward to OS updates as there are a bunch of niggling quirks. It's very alpha...<p>I've tried the Cascades SDK, but I haven't done much work with it because I've been focusing on PlayBook apps right now using Qt. Actually, Cascades is built on Qt, and it's wonderful to work with. It truly makes development quick, fun, and easy. You can make some beautiful apps.<p>Actually, a friend and I have just finished porting PySide to the PlayBook, so you can use Qt in Python. Yes, you can write native Python apps on the PlayBook and the Dev Alpha. It is NOT officially supported, but it is there. I've taken advantage of this in my own apps.<p>This post is already quite long, so I won't get into the advantages of QNX over iOS or Android. To be frank, my RTOS course was over 6 years ago, and I'm by no means an expert. I would likely botch the discussion.",1338174928.0
81,4031776,comment,4031357.0,4031357.0,1,0,lazerwalker,,,"I can see value in being able to create and represent your stylesheets as JSON objects, but syntactically this seems like a mess to me. For example, here are two things I noticed from a cursory glance at the example code that have their roots in CS's syntax:<p>* The distinction between representing a selector as a JS object and representing it as an immediately-invoked anonymous JS function that evaluates to a JS object is whether or not it declares any local variables.<p>* If your selector has a colon in it (in other words, :hover/:active/:before/:active or any other pseudo-selectors), it needs to be wrapped in quotes. Otherwise, it doesn't need the quotes.<p>Both of these make complete sense when viewed in context of ""you're actually writing CoffeeScript"", and are sensible solutions to problems you will encounter when writing day-to-day CS. But writing code that compiles down to a static stylesheet is a very different problem than writing business logic: it seems weird to present a DSL where writing two blocks of 'CCSS' code that compile down to nearly-identical blocks of CSS could easily require the two CCSS blocks to superficially look very different due to the accumulation of edge-case language quirks like these.<p>That is to say: CSS has a lot of quirks. CoffeeScript also has some quirks. It seems to me that this doesn't necessarily do a better job of masking CSS's issues than Less/SASS/Stylus, while adding in the mental overhead of dealing with some of CS's syntactic quirks.",1338174805.0

They don't have to be particularly better at it than you, they just have to have a similar level of interest and curiosity.  In grad school we read recently published papers in a small group setting we called ""journal club"".<p>This process helps in a number of ways.  It keeps you from reading too fast or too passively because you're constantly asking and answering questions.  It makes you less likely to get stuck in a dead end for very long, because others will see alternatives.  It gives you an opportunity to ask about notation or background concepts you aren't familiar with.  It helps you keep track of the big picture, because while some people are bogged down in a particular detail (like ""how do they get from equation A to equation B?"") others will be trying to tie it back to the big picture (""how does equation B fit into our overall goal?"")

Therefore take 5, which multiplied by itself gives 25, an amount which you add to 39 giving 64. Having taken then the square root of this which is 8, subtract from it half the roots, 5 leaving 3.
