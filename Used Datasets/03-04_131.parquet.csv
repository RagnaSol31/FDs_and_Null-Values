""<p>It is never a disappointment to read Feynman - an interesting piece from the opening claim:<p>""In this age of specialization men who thoroughly know one field are often incompetent to discuss another...When we look at the past great debates on these subjects we feel jealous of those times...""<p>He then goes on to excuse himself from the debate as he is not an expert on religion but sets up an interesting hypothetical of a young scientist who becomes disenchanted with 'his father's god' - which is a wonderful way to setup the discussion because as it follows he doesnt really pit religion vs science. He discusses a crisis of faith which is really at the heart of any faith based system.<p>Discomfort with one's father's god - Cronos and Uranus, Abraham and Issac, God-the-Father and Jesus - there is something corrosive, some conflict which moves religion forward in an analogous way to how great discoveries unseat accepted truths in science. In a very elegant way Feynman touches on this and moves to a discusson of how science and religion are on different tracks.<p>I find it noteworthy here that he does not equate scientists with atheists but says that scientists if they believe in god do so differently. This is Issac coming down from the mountain, Jesus' last words, Buddha's fire sermon - a deep realization that we are alone in the cosmos. The scientist may worship the same god as before - but it is not longer his father's god.<p>The reason (for Feynman) the Science can never truly supplant religion is that it cannot entertain metaphysical questions - which is consistent with the Kantian tradition of separating reason into realms (pure, instrumental, speculative). Science is pure or instrumental - but not speculative.<p>(As an aside there are good examples of why science should not attempt to be speculative in recent news - Dr in UK who falsified data to support the mercury-autism link; the recent climate science scandals. And even better examples of the perversion of religion in science: ""intellegent design"")<p>This piece is great - it is not meant as a Bertrand Russell type of exegesis but is a luncheon talk intended to spur debate. As such just churns up questions and seeks productive argument.<p>Most throw up their hands at this debate - pick one side or another and the discussion stops. He sets the problem up beautifully - I wonder if the following discussion was saved.<p>What a wonderful man, beautiful soul he was.",1266379187.0

Sounds like a good idea, and something I might actually use.<p>1) I want to be able to upload a list.<p>99% of the people who start using this site are going to have a bunch of movies already.  We're not just starting our collection, so you need to make the ""transaction cost"" of starting to use your site very low.  How many people do you see sitting there entering 100 movies one-by-one?<p>First get search working well.  Then I want to be able to do cd ~/Movies && ls > list.txt, upload that file, and have the movies auto-added to whatever location I type in.<p>For me, adding the movies is so painstaking that I'm just not going to do it.  But if there were an easy way for me to add them, your startup would be pretty useful for me.<p>2) [deleted and too lazy to change numbering]<p>3) Search should allow me to put the year of the movie.<p>I wanted to add ""Hannah Montana- The Movie"".  When I searched ""Hannah Montana"" (shut up, it's my sister's), a bunch of movies showed up, and I thought putting the year in would narrow it down, but it simply eliminated all the movies (since none of them have 2009 in the title)<p>I'm not sure if I'm the only user who would try to put the year in, but that's just feedback on how I used your site.<p>3.1) Search doesn't work very well.  A title with a 100% match should usually be the first result, shouldn't it?<p>3.2) What's ""added on"" mode? Is this the date the movie was added to your database, because I wouldn't think that has much connection to search relevance.<p>4) Where do you get the ""score"" from?<p>5) Clicking on the heart (""add to wishlist"") button should add/remove from wishlist (not just add to it)<p>It's confusing that the same button does something different whether you're on the ""movies"" or ""wish list"" page<p>6) I initially thought the ""comments"" was my personal comments, not a social feature.<p>I personally wouldn't make this a social feature because it's unlikely to ever reach the level of commentary that IMDB or other sites have.<p>But since it is a social feature, you might want to make this more clear.  I was going to put something in there like, ""on bottom shelf"", or ""in thin CD case""<p>If you think other users might use it for that purpose, but you want to keep the social feature, maybe there should be a ""make this comment private"" check-box.<p>Good luck!",1266379096.0

We looked at everything and we finally realized — it was this reduction sauce, a really expensive reduction sauce, with truffles and mushrooms, which was in a bunch of dishes. Who would have thought? We figured it was the fish or the chicken or the meat. It was like a game of Clue, and the culprit was the gravy.” [1]<p>If Daniel Boulud with his team of accountants has trouble uncovering hidden, multiplying costs - presuming they have best-in-class software, is the software good enough?<p>Answer: Maybe Avero has found that niche. Or that niche is still open (despite Avero's elite client base - Danny Meyer)<p>""Avero’s software gets you the 411 by downloading POS reports and morphing that raw data into valuable information you can use to improve and act on every aspect of the operation of a restaurant from menu planning—like how many lobster rolls did you sell for the last four years on Thursday nights when it was over 90 degrees out, what did Moms order most on Mother’s Day, or how many vegans are eating out on Friday nights in winter—to server performance and pinpointing the server who’s, say, strongest in cocktail sales but weakest in wine sales...<p>10,000 food and beverage professionals in 1100+ restaurants—guys like Danny Meyer and Steve Hanson—use his software.  And thanks to Avero, his clients have realized an incremental $100 million in profits.""

Most SEO clients are not ""the website <i>is</i> the company"" businesses.<p><i>Type One</i><p>The client is a plumbing company. Their website gets 300 visits per month resulting in about a call a day. An SEO company can come in, get them to make some changes. Make sure Google can index all the pages, add meta tags, get some more content written, sort out local business listings, get a few links and bring that up to 900 visits and 3 calls a day. I would (and do) call that success. For comparison, the difference in cost between a Yellow pages ad that gets a plumber 1 call a day and one that gets them 3 calls a day would be (very roughly) $10k-$100k where I live.<p>There are lots of companies that can and do achieve this kind of success with decent predictability. They can usually do this without too much reliance on the client for input. Sceptics will point out that you coud get SEO for dummies and do this yourself. SEOs point out that most plumbers don't. Anyway, this is most of the SEO ""market.""<p><i>Type Two</i><p>There are also the kind of SEO companies that advise bigger companies on their SEO strategies. They work with IT/Web on creating more SE friendly designs. They work with content writers on selecting topics that get searches. They run training sessions on metatags and giving your page an ""on page SEO score."" These companies' expertise is mostly consulting expertise. There is some specific knowledge they bring to the table, but not rocket surgery and not really more than the other type of company, usually. I reckon you could train ""SEO Consultants"" in weeks. What they do do well (if they are good) is they are able to get these companies to change the way they do things a little. These probably have as much in common with ""occupational safety consultants"" as they do with the former type. If I was hiring for these businesses, that is the background I would be looking for.

Sometimes it is easier to form friendships outside of school than inside school.

The first few places I told the idea to loved it and so I thought it might take off.  Unfortunately (fortunately?) for me I happened to talk to two restaurant operators who actually used social media and 'got it'.  When I started doing more market research with other operators and restaurant marketers the basic reaction was simply this:  operators are too busy to be bothered with frivolous things like websites, and for some even email addresses.  They're just trying to get through the month, the week, the day without closing the place up (obviously a lot of turn over in the industry).<p>My personal take is that the next generation of operators will likely be more receptive and will see the value in using different forms of media and accepting that people get their information in very different ways than even 5 years ago.

But:<p>> ...it seems what restaurants want to do is increase profits.<p>Yes, but -- based on my experience and dealing with restaurant owners in my area, anyway -- they're not interested in things like metrics or VIP programs. VIP programs don't convert as well as you might expect -- pretty poorly, in fact, given the effort that it takes to manage them -- and restaurants are typically run by chefs or foodies, not by numbers geeks.<p>Restaurants are really hurting right now, so anything that doesn't immediately get butts in their seats is going to be a hard sell.<p>Daily P&Ls are already built into the reporting functions of the POSs I've seen so far, and they have some functions for reporting on popular dishes, although that's usually more clunky. But, the line cooks are usually the ones that tell the boss what was popular that night anyway.<p>> Is OpenTable too big to fail (e.g. restaurants will continue to pay them annual maintenance because it is a legacy system)?<p>Yes and no. Once a restaurant has committed to a particular POS, it is very, very, very hard to get them away from it. First, it cost them -- at a safe ballpark estimate -- $10,000 to install it in the first place, so they're going to milk it for as long as they can before paying for anything else, even if it costs them more money that way in the long run.<p>Second, change is really scary for these folks, because if they're trying a new POS, and it crashes on its first evening, they're going to have a lot of pissed off customers and that translates directly to empty seats. It doesn't help that every single system that they've tried -- or that their buddies in the industry have tried -- have been buggy, problematic, and prone to crankiness.<p>It doesn't matter if you know that you're selling the best system in the world at the cheapest price; the owners are still going to be really gun-shy about converting.<p>> Can OpenTable's database be cleanroom reverse engineered so that it can be migrated to a new competitor platform?<p>In theory, anything's possible, but I would feel pretty safe guessing that OpenTable isn't going to make that easy. They're probably using something pretty funky. On the plus side, they're probably not encrypting it, they're just relying on security-through-obscurity. So, you should be able to figure out the basics, like item description, pretty easily. Figuring out sales or quantities might be a lot harder, not to mention figuring out links between items (like, add-ons for a particular dish).<p>To be honest, you might be better off committing staff to manually re-entering the restaurant's menu in your POS, rather than trying to convert OpenTable's (or anyone else's), and then just roll that into your price. This is not as horrible as it sounds; most restaurants have only a couple of pages of items, with a variety of add-ons. I've done this by myself in under a day, so it's not too bad.",1266375808.0
