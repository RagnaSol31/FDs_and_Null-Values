The 1-5% are usually the ones working by themselves creating a project from scratch and then maintaining those projects as others join the project. The capacity to remain highly focused on solitary tasks (like starting and building an open source project until it is useful enough for others to get involved) is more common in people on the aspie side of the spectrum.<p>The other 95% are not overly sensitive. Maybe just 1-5% are overly sensitive and lack the capacity to function with abrasive and insensitive people. The middle 90-98% plus the 1-5% that are the linchpins of any open source project are responsible for most of the open-source world.<p>We basically only lose the overly-sensitive ones (men and women), which is an acceptable loss until we start seeing open-source projects of significant technical importance written largely by people who are overly sensitive.

But you can possibly achieve something similar by integrating Emacs into Firefox via SSH and using for example .js [1] for automatization work. That way you wouldn’t have the disadvantage that you basically lose most formatting and layout which are actually quite helpful if you stay away from the loud and annoying websites. That’s why I thought it was worth mentioning. I also use Tree Style Tabs and it could be helpful to keep work related websites and Emacs buffers organized in that way.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs</a>",1417144177.0
