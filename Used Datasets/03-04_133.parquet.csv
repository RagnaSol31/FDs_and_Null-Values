Even a decent low-pass filter (say 3rd order Butterworth) requires an order of magnitude of bandwidth to drop the output 60 dB (practically inaudible).  This means that with a Nyquist limit of 22 kHz, you're either attenuating everything above 2.2 kHz (the ""knee""), or you're letting some aliasing noise through.<p>With a 192 kHz sampling rate, the filter's knee can rise to 9.6 kHz, and the stuff between 9.6 kHz and 20 kHz won't be appreciably attenuated.<p>It's important to note also that this attenuation can't be fixed by simply boosting the high end -- filters are linear, so such an adjustment (with an equivalent order filter) would merely cancel out the low pass filtering and reintroduce aliasing noise.<p>(Edit: I am not an audio engineer but I have a strong signal theory background.  So actual audio engineers please feel free to correct me.)",1329969297.0

Why is VLC the only* piece of software to combine volume level and compression-gain into a single output slider?<p>* Amusingly, the iPod's software <i>knows how</i> to apply compression just-in-time--but it only does it if you've applied a ""volume adjustment"" pragma to the song in iTunes. And then whenever the song comes up, you have to turn down your volume slider from 80% to 30% to avoid having your ears fall off, because ""loud"" on desktop speakers is a very different thing than ""loud"" on in-ear headphones.",1329969071.0

Those two ideas seem contradictory but I think what makes it so appealing to women is the sharing part of it. Women love to share their needs and desires, especially material ones, publicly or so it seems.<p>Men definitely do similar things but they just don't share it. Just today I met with a founder and we were discussing ideas for his startup when he pulled out am iPad and showed me a scent sized collection of screen shots and images of features, designs, pricing plans for services, and other things he'd been collecting that he was mulling over using and wanted. There were also a number of folders in his collection that I did not see but am positive were full of clippings of other material things and ideas he wanted.<p>It's a lot like having an idea book for design or a box of junk except the junk isn't junk to you, only to everyone else. We all do it but I think the super social nature of women as far as these things go is makes it so appealing to women.<p><i>Or</i> I'm a totally insensitive sexist who needs to shut up now.

As a heavy net user, I don't feel this, but perhaps older or tablet users (but then why not fix it for them) were clicking it and pulling themselves out of Gmail. I could see this being extremely frustrating for a user trying to click the mail or search button.<p>3. They wanted to shift the functionality to the black bar. This is sort of a combination of the above two. The Google logo is pretty ambiguous. When I click it do I want to reload the page? Do I want to go to the Google homepage? Do I want  iGoogle (why did they ruin Reader temporarily but not fix the mess that is iGoogle)? Do I want to search with the bar next to the logo?

To do this with straight URL's one would need to present different URL links at different times to different users to get different page-2 contents reflecting what was on page2 at the time they started their HN visit.  If so, that would be a feature.",1329966342.0
