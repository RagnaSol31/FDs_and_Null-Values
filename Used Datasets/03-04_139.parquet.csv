34,3101410,comment,3100182.0,3100182.0,3,0,onlawschool,,,"As a starting point, it may be helpful to think about the equity stake that would be required in order to offer the potential employee compensation equivalent to that which he currently receives.<p>To that end, I did a quick back-of-the-envelope-style  calculation that you can find here: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgLVLMvTOJ8ldDlsUWRucHlsZ3p3WVpmWlhBeERoWGc&hl=en_US"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgLVLMvTOJ8ldDl...</a><p>In my model, I assumed that he would receive a 5% raise in salary each year at either job. I assumed an 8% discount rate for his current salary, a 12% discount rate for his salary at your company, and a 25% discount rate for his equity cashout, which I assumed he would receive at the end of year 7. I also assumed that the growth rate for your firm's valuation would be 20% in year 1 and would decrease at a constant rate of 2% per year.<p>Under these assumptions, an equity stake around about 4.5% would yield a $2.56 Million payment when he sells his stake at the end of year 7. The net present value (NPV) of this one-time payment would be equal to $536,302 today. Taken together with his salary payments, the NPV of his total compensation package in this scenario over 7 years would be equal to the $1.13 Million NPV of his salary payments from his current job.<p>You can download the spreadsheet and can play around with the various assumptions that I made. The greater the risk associated with a particular stream of cashflows, the higher the discount rate should be.<p>Adjustments to these assumptions can have a significant impact on the NPV of the payments. For example, if we set the discount rate for his salary payments at your company to 16% and the discount rate for his equity cashout to 30%, then the equivalent equity stake would be more like 6.64%.<p>If you are able to make some reasonably accurate discount rate assumptions and valuation growth assumptions, then you should be able to get a reasonably good % equity stake that would compensate him for the decrease in salary.<p>From there, you might consider adjusting the offered equity stake upward... the spreadsheet will give you the equity stake that would presumably make him indifferent between choosing to stay at his current job or joining your team - In order to persuade him to join you, you want to be able to make him a better offer than that which he currently has.",1318390891.0

I know little more than that but it had all the hallmarks of what happens when engineers are running the asylum. Here's this communication medium in which basically all other communication media can be implemented (Email, IM, forum posts, Twitter, etc). It's the kind of general solution that engineers come up with it.<p>I read a post from someone else (can't find it now but I think it was on Quora) who was familiar with the matter and they were saying the risk-reward thing (which this poster mentions in passing) was  all messed up. Basically the incentive structure rewarded mediocrity.<p>I can't speak with any knowledge of those matters but I can believe it. After all, in a startup what happens if the startup fails? You find a new job. There is a strong incentive to make your runway last and get to your next funding round (or, Heaven forbid, profitability). Inside somewhere as cashed up as Google, those incentives (IMHO) disappear.<p>If the ""startup"" fails, what happens? You just move to another part of Google. What do you think the odds were that with Wave going away, any extra Wave incentives became worthless (as would happen in a startup)? Basically zero (IMHO).",1318390472.0

He loved it.<p>This past weekend he said, ""Dad, let's play Shadow of the Colossus!"" I said, ""No."" He paused for a moment and said, ""Dad... how do video games work?"" I paused for a moment and said, ""You know what? Let's make one!""<p>So we sat down at the computer together, did some quick research on available simple JS game engines (I was hoping for something easy and HTML5 but nothing surfaced...) and decided on the type of game to make. After that we had some conversations about gameplay mechanics and characters. We talked around characters for a bit and he sketched out some ideas. Mr. Muscle and Crocodilehead were born.<p>I picked apart the (horrible compressed JS) code a little bit to figure out how the game worked and then we looked through sprites together. After identifying the various sprites he set to work, drawing base sprites (about 10 of them for Mr. Muscles and four for Crocodilehead) and a background image.<p>While he slept that night, I scanned in all of his sprites and started resizing/animating them.<p>He critiqued my work in the morning suggesting the Crocodilehead should not puke blood on people when attacking (you can still see a bit of the residue in the game now) and that Mr. Muscles should not shoot fire out of his hands when doing the megapunch.<p>After that it was mostly just tweaking and farting around in photoshop.<p>He got a good look at the code this time around and has a pretty solid base understanding of the relationship between files, images, servers and browsers thanks to a web page we built together a few months ago: <a href=""http://audenneedham.com/volcanoes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://audenneedham.com/volcanoes/</a> (he wireframed that one, wrote the content, selected and helped to resize the images, did the Wikipedia searches for pages to link to and helped to edit the HTML...)<p>Nothing too hairy for a 4-y-o:<p>1) identify interest (which it sounds like you have)<p>2) find a platform (a friend recommended <a href=""http://gamequery.onaluf.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gamequery.onaluf.org/</a> for our next attempt)<p>3) brainstorm<p>4) draw<p>5) fiddle",1318388886.0
