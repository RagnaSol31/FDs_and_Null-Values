It doesn't matter if they bought it legitimately as they'd still be infringing - in the same way the MPAA can claim that your download of a torrent of a movie [made by employees of one of the companies it represents] is infringing despite the torrent site not having informed you that it's not a legally acquired work.<p>If the argument ""we didn't know"" works for them then surely that sets precedent for everyone else. If it doesn't work then damages of 10 for every instance of infringement of the work would seem reasonable. That's for every DVD they make with it on, for every showing in a movie theater, for every use in advertising ...<p>though it looks like the MPAA have already set a damage level of $30k per instances [TorrentSpy case as reported at arstechnica]. Now last week the top ten selling movies [which may not be all MPAA ones of course, nor carry the infringed work, but this is just for scale] had sold collectively about 15 million units in the US.

I personally believe a patent license should never be used to enforce standards compliance, and that's not the purpose of that term. Keep in mind, I don't think anyone involved in this standard <i>wants</i> to go around suing people, particularly those interested in implementing and deploying it! In addition to being a gigantic waste of time and money, it would kill the standard dead.<p>But we specifically included a conformance test to make it easy to <i>know</i> if you met the legal requirements, so you didn't have to trust us. At the request of the working group, this test was made so lax that we worried you could start deleting random lines of code (as an ""optimization"") and still manage to pass it (to combat this the test also displays a ""quality"" parameter which drops long before you get to the failure point, so implementors can start marketing that number if their competitors try this tactic, instead of being stuck in a race to the bottom).",1343015148.0

Even so though, it should be allowed if both parties permit it. In the case of food aid where it is paid for with tax funds and is primarily a system of price supports to large corporations like ADM, it is problematic because natural economic forces don't come into play. A government with tax authority can dump wheat surpluses into Africa on a random schedule, creating chaos and starvation indefinitely by destroying local agricultural markets. This is bad.
