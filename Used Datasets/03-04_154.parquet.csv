People are going to think that you are a failure either way. Why? Its their own reflection showing off their fears. You see, when you fail you admit you are human. That you dont know everything. That sometimes you make the wrong choices. One thing that this gives is the power to liberate yourself from those very own choices. Every bad choice itself is an opportunity to further down the road fix it. The biggest fear you should have in your life is not failure, but a lack of failure. Because it means that you stopped trying. That you gave up. And even though very few of us ever manage to make it, from my experience, I can say that its not the goal that matters but the journey. So far, I've managed to impact a lot of lives postiviely. Plan to impact a lot more.<p>When we fail we are forced to change. Change is good. It brings new things into our lives. There is a sayingt that goes something like this:<p><i>If you want to change the world, change your country. If you want to changeyour country, change your town. If you want to change your town, change your neighborhood. If you want to change your neighborhood, change your home. If you want to change your home, you gotta change yourself.</i><p>Failure is the mechanism through which we receive feedback to make sure the change we are doing is positive. Dont shy away from it.

Much simpler than Java in my very humble opinion, it feels a lot like Ruby / Python to me actually. Another advantage I find in Scala, is that for new learners, they get the safeguard of a typed language and all the protection that comes with it, if you write incorrect syntax, you get an immediate feedback, and for new learners, I think it's a great feedback loop. \nAlthough I really like Python, I found that implementing things in it for the Udacity CS courses for example, is much harder for me (just because I'm less familiar with Python probably) than Scala, I tried implementing the same homework in Scala, and it was much more intuitive, especially collection handling, and writing ""functional style"" code, and I didn't have to go to the web and read the docs every seconds because of the notorious, loved to be hated, heavy but yet spoiling comfort of the IDE's content assist.\nAnyway, it's a matter of taste, and I like the Scala flavor.\nBut here I am spending more time on the Ruby tutorial than on the Play framework tutorial, so I guess the language itself is not all that matters...",1358566925.0

People move on, rationale is lost, and increasingly the bulk of institutional >knowledge grows to be dogma.<p>These are good points, and some organization certainly become inefficient/chaotic with age. Yet do keep in mind there are brutally efficient corporations that are extremely good at extracting value just by repeating what they already do. thats bread and butter of F500. Going to extreme evil as example - how Halliburton can extract billions of dollars in what feels like an instant from a newly occupied country they never done business with? Thats power of their formalization. they know what contractors to hire, what officials to bribe, and all these 1001 things they need to do to ""make spice flow"" in no time.<p>My point is to contrast that repeatable and scalable power of formalization of legacy companies to almost free form exploration of startup. You see startup kids doing totally insane things- trying to create processes and structures so they look like ""big corporation"", or failing to create them when they absolutely need to start formalizing whats working, etc.<p>>Additionally, head counts don't naturally go down, people don't automate themselves out of a job and neither do ?>they take kindly to being automated. Change becomes bad.<p>very good point.<p>>What I'm trying to say is that Orkut was less passonate about it and had his creativity and motivation stifled compared to Mark.\n>Mark obsessed over his project and had everything to gain. Orkut on the other hand - What advantage was there for him in building his project from within Google? None. And not much to gain, just a promotion.<p>thats pretty brutal on poor Orkut :) I would be careful here just to say we dont know how motivated or not he was at that time. From what i seen at that time he seem to be rolling out updates pretty quick, it was active and clearly passionate development. You might be right that if he tried ""a little bit harder"" he might have gotten better result. Yet just the same i'm not going to be surprised that all the minefields Orkut/Friendster/Myspace managed to blow up themselves on were critical insights (== discovery of new formal system) that helped Mark avoid these pitfalls. and of course that was also big part of explanation: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVIhUVid4fA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVIhUVid4fA</a><p>>It is not a lack of information. It is more Kafkaesque. Employees had the knowledge and couldn't freely execute >on it -- organizational complexity kills joy.<p>That what i sort of argue against in that and previous essays. Employees are far too busy making sure that stuff they already got works. they joined 9-5 jobs because they <i>like</i> being in predictable field, with no surprises and defining their own success as just repeating what they doing over and over. JWZ said it best ""we joined netscape to build a great company, those who came later wanted to join a great company"". Any startup that plans to grow up past its humble beginnings needs to understand that duality and understand what motivates its people past first 100 employes. Its the whole difference between discovering new domains and formalizing them for revenue extraction.",1358566756.0

One is that is our current realtime rendering methods rely heavily on screen-space operations (blurring, many shadow types, SSAO, bloom, refraction, post-process fx), which confuse the brain when rendered in stereo (I.e. will make things float when the should not).

When comparing the speed of operations, people are rarely comparing apples to apples.  And contrary to what is spattered on the boards, C is not an understandable, close-to-the-metal wrapper around assembly instructions (compilers have advanced quite a bit).<p>I love C.  It does feel fast, and I get the illusion of being close to the metal.  It was one of my first languages, holding a sentimental place in my heart.  Very important things are written in it.  It is a high-level language with some okay abstractions.<p>Is it underneath other high level languages?  Maybe, if you mean that the compiler might be written in C in order to bootstrap the language.  Of course, one could write the compiler in any language; it's all about translating programmer-friendly symbols into assembly or VM bytecode, right?  And speed of compile is a different subject from speed of the compiled program.<p>But here is the gotcha on raw performance: Your large C program poorly implements a percentage of what other high level languages are capable of doing quickly and securely.<p>I once foolishly argued in favor of C's performance, saying that one could write a layer that supports all these nice features speedily, such as the data structures I will mention below as well as GC; by the time you do that, you might as well be using a different language.  You probably implemented that layer poorly, compared to other languages with large communities pounding at and optimizing that layer.  For example, when you implemented your ""fast"" list with the basic struct and next pointer, did you also implement the new-node creation in such a way as it still uses raw malloc(), as opposed to managing previously-malloced memory efficiently?<p>How many implementations of a basic list do we need in C?  Super large integers?  Fixed-point integers?  Growable arrays?  Lazy/infinite lists?  Trees?  Hash maps?  Surely you don't think these other language designers said to themselves, ""Let's support hash maps and make them slow.""  No, they came up with a fast standard, supported by their language, sometimes complete with various configuration options to make all the tradeoff decisions on making those data structures speed-efficient or memory-efficient for reads or writes.  Others, of course, subscribe to a religion, er, a specific tradeoff, such as perl's approach to {}s (""There's more than one way to do it"" ... unless you are dealing with hash tables).<p>What about all the wonderful memory management you can do in C?  Aren't you closer to the metal that way, able to make basic memory allocation super speedy?  Not really.  This is part of the illusion.  malloc() is slow enough that developers have rewritten versions of it several times.  ROM-based MUDs, for example, manage their own memory, using an initial malloc, of course, but regularly using their own set of allocators and deallocators (free_string, str_dup, etc) on top of that allocation.  There are these tricks and more in high level languages, including the sharing of partial structures (kinda like union but with more pointers and fewer bugs associated with those pointers), allowing for resource allocation strategies that can be ""faster than C"".<p>If the argument in favor of C's speed at the end of the day is, ""When we write crappy programs with buffer overrun holes, memory leaks, and no error handling, it's super fast!"", we are (1) not comparing apples to apples and (2) doing ourselves and our customers a grave disservice.<p>Let's be honest: C is no ""closer to the metal"" than other high level languages (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3753530"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3753530</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language",

The time value goes to zero as the expiration gets closer, where the intrinsic value depends on the price.<p>E.g., if you took an at the money (just at 0 intrinsic value) option for a year out, the price might be 20% of the strike price. That 20% will slowly fade over the course of the year. (Or possibly go up, if the volitility of the stock goes way up).
