If anything is likely to condition the median person into scraping the minimum necessary requirement it's drawing attention to how far ahead their smarter peers are. Smarter peers who have more outlets for demonstrating their aptitude other than dwarfing the average test scores, and who are probably smart enough to realise their test scores are a poor proxy for real life success anyway.<p>Skewing the scoring still doesn't make exams resemble real life; one doesn't analyse their successes in percentage-points-from-perfection.

Interviewers who screen out unexceptional candidates are normal; those who waste insufficiently exceptional candidates time <i>repeatedly</i> proving they're not creative or excellent enough for the job might even be considered sadistic.

125,2852814,comment,2852380.0,2852380.0,2,0,bokonist,,,"Mindboggling.  Does the S&P understand that the U.S. debt is all denominated in a currency that the U.S. government can print at will?  If the U.S. government doesn't have an AAA rating, what does an AAA rating even mean?<p>At the moment, the national ""debt"" is over $10 trillion dollars, while the total supply of currency is about $2 trillion, and total government profits are about negative $1.5 trillion.  If we assume that the government will not use it's powers as fiat-currency-creator to back the national debt, than the proper credit rating of the U.S. is F.  There is no way it could possibly pay back the debt.  The debt is five times greater than the total supply of dollars.  It's debt to profits ratio is way worse than many bankrupt companies.  On the other hand, if we assume that the government will continue to use its power of fiat to back the debt, then the rating is AAA.  It's safer in nominal terms than any other sort of debt.  It is the baseline, the reference point.  No other dollar-denominated debt can possibly be safer.<p>So you have two possibilities for the U.S. ""debt"" - AAA or F.  Rating it anything else just demonstrates extraordinary ignorance.",1312599709.0
