Dystonias are neurological disorders that can cause muscle spasms and cramping and do not go away with rest, anti-inflammatories, trigger point therapy, etc. Unfortunately dystonias are often misdiagnosed and untreated, even sometimes by well-trained specialists. The main treatment for dystonia-related conditions is Botox. I have cervical dystonia and have had wonderful success with Botox. To correctly diagnose a dystonia you need to see a neurologist that specializes in movement disorders.",1419825522.0

For example, the ability to explain the exact gauge groups and representations that comprise the Standard Model, or the masses of the elementary particles.  In fact, I would say that a theory that could do this would be &quot;tested&quot; because it is a historical accident that we discovered the gauge groups/masses before the theory.<p>As far as I understand it, string theory once promised to do precisely this.  String theory was considered promising because it had no vertex factors in its Feynman diagram.  Because there were only strings, you only needed to know the free space propagator for a patch of string.  However, as I understand it, string theory then turned out to be have more possible parameters, and this original promise was lost.<p>The kind of elegance that the author seems to be talking about is conceptual elegance, and I also reject this as evidence.  For example, invoking the anthropic principal plus multiple universes to explain the parameters of the Standard Model.
