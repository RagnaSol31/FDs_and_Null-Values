I think there's a limit on what types of things will make economic sense to be automated.

Also, I think as the world becomes less and less ""human,"" demand for personalized and human services will surge.<p>Your bank example is an interesting one.

25,1480097,comment,1479721.0,1479955.0,0,0,shasta,,,"""There is a great deal of historical revisionism happening here. Liberals and progressives don't hate or even begrudge wealthy people. We do have a problem with crooks who use our retirement to gamble on casino derivatives, and then expect the federal government to bail them out (there is an example of socialism for you--privatizing the profit and socializing the risk). Recent wall street action and other corporate maleficent beg the question of Ziad, does wealth accumulation really indicate moral integrity? Does that suggest that people who aren’t rich, don’t have moral integrity? I don’t think rich people necessarily lack moral integrity, but I don’t think it is an indication of it either. There are other great attempts to revise history by the far right especially in an attempt to make Hoover into a progressive, so conservatives don't have to take the blame for the great depression. Hoover was against regulation. The favorite phrase of the Republican presidents in the 1920s was ""What is good for GM is good for America."" This is what led to the great depression. Hoover did implement some tariffs after the depression hit, but that was a drop in the bucket compared to what came after FDR. The GDP drop from the great depression hit a few months after FDR took office. It skyrocketed up over the next several years--unemployment went down by half by 1937. Questions for you who see class envy from those espousing liberal policies? If redistribution is so bad then why, since the income tax was passed (1916), has the US built the strongest economy and middle class known to the world? If Keynesian economic is not successful, then why from 1933 to 1980 (Nixon said ""we are Keynesians now) did the US experience explosive economic growth? If redistribution and Keynesian economics are so unfair to entrepreneurs, why was has there always been a thriving wealthy class since the US inception even during the New Deal and Great Society era? Why, if deregulation is so troublesome, did we not have banking and financial calamities like the Savings and Loan scandal, stock market crashes, and the derivative blowup from the time of FDR until Ronald Reagan come along and dismantled the regulatory infrastructure? And my favorite historical revision attempt: Why, if lowering taxes on the wealthy create more revenue, did Clinton raising of taxes increase revenues and create a surplus? Why when Bush lowered taxes on the rich, did revenues nose dive for six years and turn a surplus to deficit?""",1278042352.0

35,1480087,comment,1479498.0,1479997.0,0,0,alexgartrell,,,"You're talking about saving 3 bytes per int.  I'd imagine it's pretty hard to find a workload where you can achieve 75% compression by using exclusively varints that are less than 128 in magnitude.  In fact, I'd imagine that most of the data shipped in most workloads is mostly strings/binary, which have very little if any savings.<p>So let's talk about the ideal situation where we have exclusively fields that are varints that are limited to 128.  This means that each will be 2 bytes (1 for field data + 1 for the varint itself, both of which are under 128 in magnitude).  How many of these can we fit?  Well, if we use the bottom 3 bits for specifying the type (a conservative estimate) that leaves only 4 bits (remember, subtract 1 for varint or not) to ID them, which means 16.  So if a message has 16 fields and we save 6 bytes per request, we're talking a savings of 96 bytes.  For the next 2048 entries, we're saving, 5 bytes per (5kb vs 15kb), then beyond that, we're saving 4 bytes per (and eventually none).  This is also an incredibly arbitrary situation where you expect ALL of your fields to be small ints.<p>Same with disk, it's unlikely that your workloads will allow you to save a lot by using varints.<p>So, you're right that, for some workloads, this may be better, but if someone put a gun to my head and said ""protocol buffers or thrift?""

Every year, less and less of our food is touched by human hands on its way to the market.<p>According to the USDA, in 1900 41% of the American workforce was employed in agriculture.  If you went back to 1900 and told a farmer that fewer than 2% of Americans would be involved in the production of food in 100 years, would he believe you?<p>This tectonic change has gone unnoticed by most because displaced agricultural workers have been able to find gainful employment elsewhere.  The whole issue here, I think, is what we'll do when most of the productive labor across <i>all</i> economic sectors isn't needed anymore.

There are two GSM bands in the US, 850 and 1900 MHz.  Chris Paget, in spite of having a UK domain, lives in the Bay Area.  His Android demo used RF hardware operating in the 900 MHz ISM band, which does not require a license provided the transmit power is less than 30 dBm (1W) as per FCC part 15.  The maximum transmit power of the USRP hardware is ~23 dBm.  \nErgo, not illegal.<p>Other posters have made reference to Special Temporary Authority that one can apply for from the FCC in order to legally operate radio experiments in licensed spectrum.  A relevant example is the OpenBTS GSM network at Burning Man-- <a href=""http://openbts.sourceforge.net/FieldTest3/STAGrant.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openbts.sourceforge.net/FieldTest3/STAGrant.pdf</a><p>The so-called ""GSM guard band"" between the DECT cordless phone band and the DCS1800 European GSM band being opened up in Western Europe.  Unlicensed low-power GSM installations have in fact been legalized in the Netherlands.  This swath of spectrum, 1781.7-1785 MHz paired with 1876.7-1880 MHz, was also auctioned off for cheap to 12 companies in the UK by Ofcom (the British equivalent to the FCC) in 2006.<p>OpenBTS and OpenBSC are complementary but not cooperative (at least not yet) projects. The Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and Base Station Controller (BSC) are different key components in a GSM network.

58,1480061,comment,1479687.0,1479687.0,0,0,aero142,,,"I find this line of thinking very disturbing.  Mr. Grove follows others in believing a common fallacy, by ignoring secondary effects, and fails to see how issues in macroeconomics affect each other.  Where to start...<p>The American standard of living is higher than China.  In order for a worker in the US to continue to enjoy his standard of living and salary, she must contribute to creating something of value equal to what she consumes that is then exchanged at a market price(which determines it's value relative to goods/services created by others).  When the US is a leader in technology and innovation, we create things that are very valuable, because rare and productive people make them, and trade them for other, largely commoditized goods, from poorer countries.  The reason these commoditized goods are produced in poorer countries is because they can...  The ability to produce them is well known so there is more competition, and therefor demand, and the price drops, along with the wages.  If you work in a factory cheaply, you do so because replacing your skills in that factory is easy.  There are many other people with that set of skills to replace you.  The value you produce is cheaper, therefor you are paid less and have less to consume .<p>Now, back to Mr. Grove's statements.  The factory jobs left the United States because wages were higher here than there.  It's that simple, but where he goes wrong is say that ""managers were happy"", which is not quite as harsh, but very close to the usual line, which attributes the offshoring to ""greed"".  Not quite.  If an American company has to produce it's goods in a factory where people make 2x the salary of the same good in China, the goods will cost more to buy.  If the American company, doesn't outsource, and a Chinese company is able to produce the same or similar good(think commodity again), then they will be undercut in the market and go out of business.  Not only will management be un-""happy"", but the US as a whole is worse off because the profits now go to a Chinese company instead of an American one.  The US has now lost not only the manufacturing jobs, but the high value add jobs as well.  Mr. Groves proposes the ""solution"" that we tax imports and use the proceeds promote American production.  This merely shifts the money around.  Those imported goods were cheaper than their American counterpart. Assuming current wages remain the same, it now cost more dollars to purchase that good because of the tariff and American's have less stuff because it is more expensive relative to their salary.  The other option(without the tariff), is that the American factory worker cannot find other work that will pay him more, so he agrees to accept lower wages for performing that same job here and can therefor buy less stuff.  I believe that these, as a whole, offset one another and are probably net a wash.<p>As for unemployment, I believe that it is caused by many different things, probably many reasons that are poorly understood, but I'll address a few of them that I think are important here.  Unemployment can be caused by temporary mismatches between market demands for goods and supply of those goods.  Demand changes, prices change, companies don't require as many employees to produce the goods(this can also be caused by changes in the efficiency of production), and people are fired.  There may not be a job in their previous line of work.  If there is some other skill set which is in demand, that person can learn a new skill and make whatever salary the market demand supports for that skill.  It is also possible that the market will not support the workers previous salary.  Labor costs go down, but here is where people usually go wrong.  When labor costs drop, it becomes affordable to pay people to do things that you might have automated(for a high cost in machinery or software for example).  Or, the market might now support the cost of producing a good which <i>must</i> be done with tedious manual labor.  Or, if the American worker is more efficient than his Chinese counterpart, then it might be cheaper to start doing manufacturing in the US again.  In other words, as wages drop, the unemployment rate will go down, and less will be outsourced.  This is just the tradeoff.  The fact that jobs are sent to China means that cheaper goods are available here in the US.  Mr. Groves states that the trend is towards an economy where there are high value add jobs and high unemployment.  This is true only if current wages hold. If wages drop, then outsourcing makes less sense and unemployment picks up.  What we really want is lots of high value add jobs here.  This comes through innovation, creativity, a highly skilled and motivated workforce and outsourcing production(if it makes sense) to cheaper markets.",1278041007.0

66,1480053,comment,1479687.0,1479687.0,0,0,SkyMarshal,,,"There's another proposed solution to this problem in the form of tax reform - The Fair Tax proposal.<p>IANA Tax Expert, but I like how they've completely rethought the tax system from the ground up, with the objective of making the US a tax haven for all parts of the manufacturing process - harvesting raw materials, milling into useful materials, manufacturing into products, transport, and sales.<p>In a nutshell, there are 'embedded taxes' at every point in the manufacturing chain.  Take a simplified semiconductor for example, made of sand, aluminum, and copper:<p>1.  Mine the copper and aluminum, collect the sand (payroll + income + other taxes)<p>2.  Purify it all, mill the copper and aluminum (payroll + income + other taxes)<p>3.  Deliver to fabrication facilities (tax the transport company)<p>4.  Convert sand to silicon wafers, etch the microprocessors into the wafers with the copper and aluminum, package into chips.  (more taxes)<p>5.  Transport to OEMs (tax the transport company)<p>6.  Build computers (more taxes)<p>7.  FedEx/UPS to purchaser (more taxes).<p>The consumer ends up paying multiple embedded taxes in the final cost of the product.  The Fair Tax folks estimate that these embedded taxes comprise roughly 22% of the cost of the average product manufactured in the US.<p>The Fair Tax would instead remove all the embedded taxes and add them in one lump sum to the final product:<p>1.  Mine the copper and aluminum, collect the sand (no tax)<p>2.  Purify it all, mill the copper and aluminum (no tax)<p>3.  Deliver to fabrication facilities (no tax)<p>4.  Convert sand to silicon wafers, etch the microprocessors into the wafers with the copper and aluminum, package into chips.  (no tax)<p>5.  Transport to OEMs (no tax)<p>6.  Build computers (no tax)<p>7.  FedEx/UPS to purchaser (no tax).<p>8.  Consumer pays 23% tax (calculated inclusively, 30% calculated exclusively) on the final product.<p>The final cost to the US consumer is roughly the same, but the incentives are drastically realigned.  It becomes much less expensive to make things in the US, and they are only taxed when sold in the US.  Products exported overseas would be tax-free to make and sell (except for taxes in the foreign countries).<p>The concept potentially solves all sorts of problems, from our trade balance to illegal immigrants not paying taxes.
