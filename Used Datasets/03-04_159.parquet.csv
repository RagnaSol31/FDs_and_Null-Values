If they started doing their projects in C, with the current growth in rate of complexity they will never finish their projects ever.<p>>>No wonder Facebook noticed this and desperately trying to compile Php to C.<p>Dynamic languages aren't slower because they are not C. They are slow because they do a lot of magic. C is fast because the magic is left for you to perform. I can't see how any one pull out pace out of compiling Php to C directly, unless they sacrifice things along the way. Which really defeats the purpose of using Php at the first place.<p>>>Well, long story short, with his help another developer converted it to Java in short time it worked around 200 times faster. So there. Moving bits around did not help Perl here at all.<p>Number of programmers who even need to here the word 'bits' in their day to day activities(Talking of application programmers) are rare enough to make their case totally exceptional.<p>Besides there are places where C makes perfect sense. There is hardly any other language heard of in the embedded programming world.",1359431993.0

Security, transportation, lights, banks, credit are all things in which the American public is invested, in the public interest. And any company of size depends on individuals besides the founder to do its work. It is not accurate to pretend that you are 100%, solely responsible for your own success, without any other contributing factors. And it is not right to decline any social responsibility in the society which has enabled your successes.<p>Doesn't mean you were guaranteed success. Doesn't mean you didn't have to pay bills or take risks. Doesn't mean you did nothing. Does mean you are not a heroic John Galt pulling himself up by the bootstraps in spite of the rest of society being parasitic.<p>It was your choice to start a business, don't complain at other people if they have not taken the same risk. They also don't have the business.",1359428722.0

Although I've become a huge proponent of iOS, I still think webOS does some things better than any other mobile OS and I believe it had a profound impact on the nascent trajectories of both iOS and Android.<p>Most of the key webOS team members were actually picked up by Google when Palm was being acquired by HP, most notably UX design guru Matias Duarte.
