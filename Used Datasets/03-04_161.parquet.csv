There's just so much more room for engagement in person, as you can answer questions, provide clarification on the spot, and even obtain advice (perhaps some passerby has a cool idea they want to see in your game).  This is drastically harder to do with a website.<p>This is even more important for smaller indie teams where the developers are the ones manning the booths.  I'd be way more interested in discussing the product if I knew I were talking to one of the developers.  I found this reflected in my behavior at the vendor booths at pycon this year.  When a booth was manned by salespeople, I'd just go take their free shirt and if I was interested in the product I'd only ask a few brief questions and leave with a brochure.  When the booth was manned by the founders and three-quarters of the dev team, I was more apt to discuss further, asking about their software stack, or their thoughts on competing products, or the future roadmap of the product.  This type of perspective a salesperson doesn't have and usually can't officially speak about.",1336967959.0

Even though it was a different University, all fees were waived if you worked in the higher education sector. I studied in the late 80s to early 90s, so I don't know if this is still the case.<p>Mine was a common enough case. In the school where I worked, two more of the conserjes were studying engineering degrees. In the school where I studied (I have a degree in English), at least one of the conserjes was studying a tertiary degree, I don't remember which.<p>In these circumstances, what I wondered is why didn't more of my younger colleagues pursue further study. You have a salary, a job that leaves you quite a lot of free time to study, and reasonable hours (morning and afternoon/evening shifts) that allow you to attend classes during your non-working shift. And, some years later, you could also have a degree and a modicum of learning (or, in some cases, a lot of learning and no degree: your mileage may vary).<p>Great for Gac! Me and my fellow worker/students did it at a younger age, in our country of birth, surrounded by a family support network, and with a much cushier jobs (a conserje doesn't have cleaning duties, for instance). Gac sends part of his salary back to his family in the Old Country, while I could use mine to travel around Europe and buy books. In fact, I nowadays I call that job my ""scholarship"". I didn't have to man the counter of a 7/11 or stock supermarket shelves to pay for my studies, and I graduated with some savings. I didn't always feel privileged, but I was in many ways.<p>In the article, Gac Filipaj quotes Seneca, the Stoic philosopher.

Obviously this doesn't guarantee coverage, but it puts the ball in your hands, once you're stood talking to a journalist while standing over your product it's time to knock it out of the park.<p>I don't really have any customer data I can share with you, the sort of selling points generally used are more vague - such as ""The average spend per visitor at last year's event on products sourced at the show was 767, a total audience spend of 79.8m"" (taken from the sales pitch of a 2012 event). The overall focus of selling - though I'm not actually in sales so this isn't my direct area - is about the size of the audience, and what sort of demographic they are.<p>I don't know if events are a good use of your money when it's as tight as that, i.e. if you can chose between $3k on an event or $3k on a PR company, but only one, as I can't think of any exhibitor I've ever had that paid that little, or that was small enough not to have marketing budget around it.<p>The single biggest argument I can give, I think, is that if you go to PAX you're going to get more people looking at your game than you'd get clicks for $3k online - and when it comes down to it, are you going to sell your game better by having somebody look at your website, or stand in front of you try out your game?<p>Incidentally, what adverts are giving you that click-rate, and do you have any calculated CPA figures?<p>edit: I just want to note that like I said above, my experience comes more from big budget companies like big studio publishers rather than indies, so I can't necessarily say events are or aren't a great idea for people like you, just that they do offer bang for buck.",1336965620.0

I most likely do not even know you\n  personally, and don't make presumptions about your\n  character or habits based on a single posting.\n  I'm only commenting on the ability\n  for the code you posted to do its stated task,\n  with particular attention being paid to:\n\n    * Security\n    * Maintainability\n    * Avoiding needless reimplementation\n    * Contribution to the community\n\n  If I sound like I'm flaming, please re-read the message\n  a few more times until you see that it's about the code\n  and the Perl community, and not about you personally.\n  That is all. Thank you.\n\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=205373"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=205373</a>",1336964925.0
