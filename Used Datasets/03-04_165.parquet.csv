The reason for this interpretation was how he considered passing null values in order to exact a null response to be an acceptable test.

Frankly, in my experience, you can filter out a lot of people in the first minute; and<p>2. Then do the test.<p>Speaking of the test, I had a quick look and it takes time. How much time? I'm not sure as I didn't look at the starting code, just the list of tasks. Maybe it only takes 30 minutes. Maybe it might take hours. I really don't know.<p>Either way, these sorts of things are huge barriers to entry because, as someone looking for a job, I also have to decide on how much time to spend on <i>you</i>. The fact that this test is just to get to the phone screen lowers the amount of effort I'm willing to put in.<p>Also, you don't need terribly complicated coding problems to weed out early stage candidates. Honestly, getting someone to code a relatively efficient (at worst O(n) space and time) factorial function will tell you ~95% of what you need to know from this test <i>if you can witness them actually doing it</i>. Seriously. So screenshare with them and get them to do it. No editor. Just a Google doc or similar.<p>That all being said, I'm really shocked how woefully unqualified an awful lot of programmers are at... programming. The sort of acceptance numbers talked about here and at places like Google (disclaimer: I work for Google) are more testament to the number of clueless cowboys infect our industry than anything else.<p>Also, bear in mind that an interview is a two-way street. The more effort you expect from the candidate the more they need to want to work for you before they even start interviewing. Google, Facebook, Twitter and the like have this kind of developer gravitas. Do you? I don't know.<p>Lastly, the three month trial thing is, for me, a huge problem. After all this there's a 20% chance I might lose my job for no reason other than you may not like me?<p>One reason Google is so selective is we take employment <i>seriously</i>. Leaks and criminal offences notwithstanding, it's actually pretty hard to get fired from Google and those decisions are not made lightly.

TDD has nothing to do with software testing<p>TDD is good for developing rapid changing codebases with short development cycles with known requirements and a harsh time pressure, but it's a front loaded way as well.<p>By which I mean, you have to invest some hours beforehand to make sure you're not shipping crap because you didn't have time to see what would break or to make sure you didn't skipped the controller your GUI developer needed.<p>TDD tries to ensure one thing only: ""Awareness"". You accept the initial costs of TDD if awareness is a big issue for you. Otherwise, use something else which serves you to solve it.<p>If you're aware of what you will be implementing and if there's a mechanism you can check your code against, it'd be efficient, right? TDD uses unit tests for documenting that ""Awareness"", aiming to utilize the benefits of unit testing as well.<p>You're right, that it is not feasible trying to test every aspect of your solution via unit tests and that's why there are integration tests, systems tests and acceptance tests. So if you're planning to find defects via the unit tests you're writing for your TDD cycle, think again. Unit tests are good for checking ""completeness"" and a great tool helping with regressions. Nothing more and nothing less.<p>As a good engineering practice, we adopt the method of working, based on how we planned to work. If we find TDD fruitful to implement, we avoid putting any logic to controllers. We implement our business logic behind the controller, which also cleans it off of implementation specific crap. Besides us using a completely detached GUI layer helps us write controller unit tests running via HTTP.<p>We simplified our working environment and make it suitable for TDD, by ways we found to provide more capabilities to us. If we're not to use TDD, we employ other logics and structures, which would fit well with the method we'd use instead.<p>Long story short, TDD gives what TDD is intended for and as long as you cooperate. If you expect more than it can provide, you'd be disappointed. Regardless of your development method, you have to make sure your development/architecture models and your tool set complies with your method of choice. The rest relies in the question ""What do you need your development model to solve for you?""<p>All the best",1317526278.0

This isn't always a bad thing, but if a company is always hiring, it's usually because they are consistently losing people as well.<p>2) You are experiencing crazy explosive growth, so much so that every month you need to hire more of the exact same positions.<p>3) The requirements for the job are poorly defined.

However, using a series of tests to <i>drive your design</i> (aka ""TDD is not a testing method,it is a design method"" idea) often gives you an illusion of progress as you hill climb using conformance to an increasing number of tests as a progress heuristic and end up on top of a local maximum (as for example in the TDD sudoku episode).<p>(b)in conflating TDD with one or more of (1) testing, (2) automated testing (3) automated regression test suites (4) developers adding more tests to the automated regression test suite as they develop more features, refactor, debug etc.<p>You can have (1) to (4) without either (5)writing tests <i>first</i> (aka ""don't write a line of code without having written a test covering it"") or (6)driving your design with tests. The last two ideas are the real distinguishing features of TDD and are of debatable merit. None of (1) through (4) are novel ideas. (5) and (6) are where differences of opinion  happen.<p>Even if you choose to use TDD, it is good to be aware it is just <i>one</i> tool in your toolbox and not necessarily the default tool to reach for.<p>(c) in the zealotry of some of its evangelists who insist that TDD is some kind of moral imperative and  is the only ""correct"" way of developing software and anyone who doesn't follow that path or make respectful obeisance to it is ""unprofessional"",""dodgy"" etc. This is often accompanied by conflating TDD with more generic notions like ""automated tests"" etc as above.<p>For example, Rich Hickey, the author of Clojure, said recently  at the Strange Loop conference ""We say, “I can make a change because I have tests.” Who does that? Who drives their car around banging into the guard rails!?""<p>(and that is <i>all</i> he said. One sentence in a keynote presentation)<p>For this Hickey was taken to task by a TDD advocate, Brian Marick, for not being ""respectful"" enough to TDD and  for his ""tone"" in daring to mildly criticize it as a development practice.

It's an activity, it has benefits, but is not a panacea. No 'community' should be threatened by that fact""<p>and later ""Accusing people who merely disagree with you of being snarky, intolerant, dismissive etc is both wrong and destructive.""<p>and much later after being subjected to a barrage of tweets criticizing his tone and 'lack of respect' for TDD, ""If launching an ad hominem attack is the product of a lot of thought, it <i>is</i> time for you to move on.

I know that an idea isn't worth much though if you don't act on it and execute. So, I've been trying my hardest to do what I can. I'm not technical, but I've been been working in all the ways I know how and learning what I don't.<p>I've developed the idea, asked potential customers questions, got feedback. I know it has potential. So, I designed the website wireframe, business model, marketing model, logo...<p>But now comes the time where something useable needs to be created. I can show potential customers a wireframe and ask them questions, but until they actually show they are willing to use (and pay) for it, I know I don't have any real traction.<p>I come here asking for advice on how I should approach creation. There seem to be three approaches:<p>1. Do it yourself\n2. Outsource\n3. Find a co-founder<p>Now, I am determined to learn to the technical side regardless. I've started on that journey, tackling HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm no expert, but I understand. I want to go after PHP as well. However, I know I don't have time to be professionally proficient in a reasonable time. It won't stop me from learning, but I'm not sure if it's the smartest way to approach this. But please, tell me if I'm wrong. I don't underestimate the amount of work/experience needed to be a great coder though... so I don't expect to be good enough in a few months.<p>In regards to outsourcing, I have a good amount of money saved, enough to hopefully create something. However, that something might not even be close to the end goal... and then what? What about when customers ask for more? What about maintenance? What if I do go to investors and it's just me... sure, I consider myself valuable on both the business and design end of things, but with no one to cover the technical aspects, who will want to invest? Which brings me to...<p>Finding a technical co-founder. I'm from NYC and plan on going to some startup meetings I've found out about. However, I know this is a scary proposition as well. For one, I have nothing created, so will anyone want to even come on board? Then I guess I need to assess options 1 & 2.<p>I just am looking for some guidance here. I'm at this standstill and I feel overwhelmed with all the options and just pick a direction and go. If that's outsource and then find a technical co-founder once something is implemented, then I'll tackle outsourcing now. If it's DIY, then pick up my pace (hell, quit my job, live at home and make studying and creating my new job) so I can get things going. If it's find a technical co-founder, than go out there and prove myself.<p>Anyway, I apologize for the length of this post, but I guess I have a lot on my mind here. But any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",1317524525.0
