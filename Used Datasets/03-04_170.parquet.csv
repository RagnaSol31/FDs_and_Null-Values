So I decided I might study math again and in 10-20 years maybe I'll be an amateur expert on math. That's cool. But what can I do as an amateur expert in math? Maybe that time is better spent becoming an expert programmer, getting a CCIE, or any number of other practical endeavors. So what cool things can I do with math that might warrant a long term study?

Microsoft is. Google is.

Android is a platform. Google apps is a platform. AWS is a platform. Even AdSesnse is a platform. Twitter is a platform.<p>Here's my outline:<p>1. Yahoo needs to protect their base. Customers might move away from Yahoo mail when eventually people get their own domain names, or when they want to edit documents online on Google Docs. Yahoo should court the small businesses who already use Yahoo to spend more money with them.<p>2. Yahoo needs to aggressive court developers to leverage Yahoo signins, Yahoo mail to provide new services. If Yahoo would handle the payments, it would be even better. A 30% cut would make Yahoo a great affiliate for many devs trying to get traction.<p>3.
