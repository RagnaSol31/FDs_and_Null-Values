Even the idea that cancer is not &quot;one cause, one cure&quot; has not been held for a long time, and was never universally held. Lymphoma was always treated differently than breast cancer, for instance.<p>But the more interesting point in the book, re a cure for cancer: &quot;the only intervention ever known to reduce the aggregate mortality for a disease--any disease--at a population level was prevention. Even if other measures were chosen to evaluate our progress against cancer...it was indubitably true that prevention, as a strategy, had been neglected by the NCI in its ever-manic pursuit of cures.&quot;<p>In other words: cures make good headlines; we get excited by cures.
