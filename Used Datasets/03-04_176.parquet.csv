These were not the &quot;normal&quot; kind of erotic scenes you would find in Pompeii or other Roman cities. They were things that would be considered shocking and perverted by even Roman standards.<p>These murals were in an area that was the Roman equivalent of a locker room, where bath attendees would leave their clothes. Archaeologists speculate that the shocking murals were memory aids--a customer could remember where they left their clothes by remembering the shocking perverted scene on the mural above that section.<p>This is plausible. Shocking or unusual things are easier to remember, so this would have been more effective than just numbering or lettering the sections of the storage room.<p>This is also why people around my age (mid 50s) probably have an easier time remembering the resistor color code.

When magic is a relatively mundane tool, it becomes an <i>option</i> that a player can rely on, and that is really important. If magic is unknowable, then it forces the <i>GM</i> to use the magic rather than the players. This takes agency away from the players and makes it more of a movie (zero-player game) than a game.<p>Personally, I find the &quot;scientific for mundane things, but mythical for greater things&quot; model to be the most desirable, because it&",

Though to be fair I think the correct term is total fertility rate, as sometimes fertility rate is defined as birth rate.<p>Birth rate (technically, births/population rate) is the total number of live births per 1,000 of a population in a year. It is abysmal in Japan because the population is very old, so not many people are in age of making children.<p>Total fertility rate represents the number of children that would be born to a woman if she were to live to the end of her childbearing years and bear children in accordance with current age-specific fertility rates. This rate is going up as Japan is slowly making it easier for couples to have children: more day-care facilities, and most importantly Japanese society is (slowly) becoming more tolerant to mothers going back to work.",1433041566.0
