If the former, you can stop reading, because for someone already up on EC2 and devops it doesn't make sense to insert a middle man. If it's the later, here's more to consider.<p>I think you misunderstanding may step from  underestimating the time needed to make the right choice on an EC2 Cloud vs. Slicehost VM vs. Rackspace vs. Shared hosting vs. That guy with the space space in his rack for a PHP application.<p>For someone not up on EC2 they need to research what the difference between a Standard On-Demand Instance, Micro On-Demand Instance,  High-Memory On-Demand Instance, High-CPU On-Demand Instance, Cluster Compute Instance, and Cluster GPU Instance is, and then decide which type of VM they need within that sub-group for their app.<p>Then they need to figure out where their application touches/stores items on the file system, and decide how they're going to restore that whenever they spawn/restart another EC2 instance.  (file uploads, avatar image uploads, etc.)   Lots of PHP applications make an assumption about about a readable/writable persistant file system (which, coincidentally, is why shared hosting is such a successful attack vector).   The is where PHPFog having the Drupal and Wordpress installs come in handy, the implication there being they've solved that for you.<p>To get familiar with the EC2 infrastructure to make these choices, they need to make a $63/month investment or pony up the $227.50.  Minor, but expensive enough that it creates inertia.  If PHPFog gets their pricing right, <i></i>or<i></i> they have a compelling marketing pitch that this really is turn-key, they can capture a lot of mindshare right now, and possibly be a disruptive player in a segment of the shared hosting market that's been static for a long time.<p>None of the above is hard for a technically competent individual, it just takes time.  It's plumbing, and (this is the important part), in the world of a PHP developer it's the sort of plumbing that up-till-now can be handled by a reliable shared host, or for larger companies/teams/apps, server operations folks who don't do application programming.  That's why there's a lack of EC2 knowledge even among competent profesional PHP folks.<p>Add in all the people just using Drupal/Wordpress/Joomla/Magento/etc who aren't technically competent and you have a another market segment PHPFog could serve.<p>Are we looking at a $212 acquisition for PHPFog?  Probably not.  But that doesn't mean they can't be a successful company, or that they can't use a cash infusion to get the tedious-yet-requiring-a-brain work for getting default installations for all the popular PHP applications running.",1294717066

The goals of adjusting these knobs are obviously only known by Googlers but what is clear to many is that the sole object of adjusting these knobs in not to make the results pages more relevant. Don't get me wrong... they definitely care about relevancy (or they wouldn't have the trust of millions) but they are a public company with obligations to meet so they must take many factors into account when making adjustments.<p>The point? The sex (aka variation over time) that the author refers to will likely come from adjusting existing knobs and introducing new knobs such as social authority, locality, etc... but it doesn't necessarily mean that problems of relevance as we see it will get fixed through these variations. Google will take into account a number of factors when deciding what problems they want to solve and to what extend.<p></rambling>",1294717046

Tech very well would have accepted you, if you had applied, but they would have done it for your demonstrated interest in CS--more likely ACM, since CS at Caltech is an entirely different fish than at other schools--while basically treating your athletics as a null factor. On the other hand, it would have perhaps been a slight negative against you, because athletics took time away from when you could have been volunteering in a local college science lab or hacking some code together. The students who read applications and we who screen them when they apply to sit on that committee are quite serious when it comes to seeking applicants who show a ""passion for math and science.""",1294716639

Cloud storage or services don't mean you have to rely on private companies to store or syncronize your data. You can run a substancial set of the same services on your own trusted hardware.<p>Do you need email ? Do not rely on gmail to store your email or you, use your own server, IMAP and a webclient such as roundcube when you are on the go.<p>Do you need calendaring? Use Ical and a webdav server.<p>Do you need file synchronization? Use rsync over ssh to your home machine instead of dropbox. (that's exactly what I do to back up my Android phone), do you want that to be completely automated? Call rsync from a crontab.<p>My last pictures? a gallery on my home server rather than using flikr or facebook.<p>Do you need to be reachable by phone from overseas? That's very tricky, since you don't control the phone numbering system, but I am doing really well with my home asterisk server, my android SIP phone and a bunch of SIP providers in a several countries. When I want to talk something with my tech savvy friends, I can use Sip 2 Sip directly (not skype).<p>It's susprising the amount of stuff you can do when you are running your own services on a trusted environment. Just a ssh + screen session is more than enough for me to do most of my daily tasks. In case I get increasingly paranoid of the goverment I could you just ship a box overseas or use a cheap controled VPS on a different country. I may not have freedom of movement (since immigration is definitely not a friction-free act), but my data surely has. I am not saying this is a perfect solution, but definitely it's much better privacy wise.<p>The only think I lose with this approach is the 'social' aspect of cloud services. People's attention span is short enough to force them to go to my personal services or my blog to check for my personal updates. Facebook success is that it offers a one single place where you can get a glimpse of how are your friends and beloved ones doing. That's why It's so important to invest on open distribution formats (a la RSS) we can trust and control.",1294716605

81,2090723,comment,2082119.0,2082119.0,0,0,mgh2,,,"First off, I believe it is alright to be harsh on your children but instead of 'deadly and cold' harsh, a parent should learn how to motive the kid, instead of punishing him/her. In psychology, it has been proven that positive reinforcement is more effective in learning than negative reinforcement. This very basic concept should be applied to instill motivation and curiosity in children.<p>For example, when I was young, my parents gave me $1 for any exam I got higher than a 95(A), which taught me to not only earn good grades but to appreciate the value of money. Guess what, it is funny when you think that by giving money as reward, the kid will want to spend it on something he/she likes. But this had the opposite effect, I saved every penny I could (treasure hunt for money everywhere!) until I accrued to ~$400. I had learned the value of earning money, but not to spend it. (By the time I was about 12 yrs old, this reinforcement was not needed anymore and my parents took it away when they needed it the most- during a family crisis.) My reaction? Gratitude, if it was for the good of the family, then my savings and hard work had a purpose.<p>This saving habit I see a lot in the Eastern culture, and not so much in the Western culture. Asians learn to save, not to spend (money they don't have). This way of thinking will affect their adulthood- in the form of credit cards- which might help explain the current economic crisis...<p>Going back to treating your children harshly, it is alright up until a certain age. See, because in an attempt to protect your children from bad influence, which there is so much in this world, you have to be harsh because your children have no idea of the dangers out there and your responsibility is to shield your kids at any cost.<p>Results? There is so much horrible things in the Western culture that I will risk everything to protect my children from getting influenced by. I like American freedom, but when that affects our children (alcohol, drugs, sex) it is horribly wrong. Since kids get influenced more by their peers than by parents themselves (psyc tested), it is our responsibility to protect them, even if it means hurting their self esteem.<p>MIND IT, but this is up until a point in their growth, once they reach adulthood (college), let them free to develop their own identity. That is when they learn self confidence, self worth, independence, and creativity. So many things to be learned in college.<p>It is funny that the very idea of 'not giving up', an essential characteristic of an entrepreneur, was drilled into Asian children from so young. Yet, how many of those kids turn out to be Asian leaders in this world? (i.e. entrepreneurs, managers, etc). Not many. This is the dark side of Asian parenting.<p>A solution will be to be harsh to kids AS WELL as to explain the motives behind parent punishing. You are teaching emotional intelligence to the child, an essential ingredient for leadership success. Read ""Emotional Intelligence: Why it Matters More than IQ"". The book explores how society focuses so much on IQ and not EQ, turning them into unfunctional adults. So far, the best education method I have seen is at Church (I am not not religious though).<p>As for Westerners, how many brats turn out badly because you failed to be harsh at them? Be harsh, it is ONLY NECESSARY, but let them understand the reasons behind your decision. Give them the trust that they will understand what is best for them by following your rules- this teaches them empathy.<p>See the pattern? Raise children to be entrepreneurs so they can appreciate the value of money, self motivation, and empathy. Teach them in school to be entrepreneurs that create value in society- education is to blame in here- there are business schools (money driven people) but not entrepreneurship schools (value driven people).<p>In short, entrepreneurship (not business) ideals can solve most of the problems in society.<p>Where to start? Entrepreneurship school(in college).",1294716121

The valuations only make any sense if you assume that these companies are going to experience very rapid growth rates in the near future.<p>A lot of us who are thinking ""bubble"" just don't buy the hype about that growth. Social networking sites have come and gone. Search engines have come and gone. Technology platforms have come and gone. So far, I see no reason to believe that the likes of Facebook or Zynga or Groupon will be immune to disruptive competition <i>and</i> find new markets or business models sufficient to sustain dramatic growth for several years, which is what it would take as a minimum to make the valuations realistic.<p>> The dotcom bubble was all about people throwing a bunch of money at companies that had no clear or proven plan of success<p>And what is different here? Amazon has a market cap around $80B and a very high P/E by most standards at 75ish, but it has a solid business model (actually, more than one these days) and a strong brand that has stood the test of time for more than 15 years now. Next to that, does $50B for a social network that reportedly makes only ~$100M per year seem like a good investment? They've had 7 years to monetize their system and they've got 500M users; how long should we wait for the astronomical profits, exactly?<p>Another example: for $5.5B, you could supposedly buy Zynga according to a recent evaluation. Or, you could buy about 10% of Tesco (the UK food store juggernaut).",1294716088

You reject the student in favor of the better (if lower scoring) fit.

We kept pushing for more resources allocated to this, but we just didn't have the bandwidth and/or capable engineers that were really experts at information retrieval.<p>Another engineer and I attempted to get search working right, but the difficulty when it comes to search is overwhelming and just not an easy engineering feat. Advanced search integration for integral user experience features, such as understanding user intention, query disambiguation, search term boosting, information metadata, typeahead, etc were very difficult to get right, hard to really test, and required lots of knowledge about information retrieval -- which a domain that not many engineers are familiar with.<p>I think a service that provides an easy to use API and allows the ability for companies to easily and effortlessly address some of the concerns above is always in need.",1294715005
