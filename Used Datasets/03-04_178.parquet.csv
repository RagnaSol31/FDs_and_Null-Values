But this type thing does happen to me a lot on the internet generally, which is incredibly frustrating for me personally. It also happens a lot on HN specifically: I get dismissed by people who are convinced they know science, thus their vague generalizations and personal opinions apparently do not need to be backed up. Granted, it's a huge sore spot for me, but your latest reply doesn't strike me as remedying that at all, though I do appreciate your willingness to discuss it.<p>There are a lot of people who are either obese and have tried everything and can't lose weight or are thin and have tried everything and can't gain weight. But your opinion is ""some people just eat too much"", apparently with no real cause. Equally, you are comfortable with ""bacteria are everywhere -- if you eat too much you can grow them"". You really aren't willing to admit that different people carry different bacteria due to exposure of some sort and this might be a factor in why some people ""just eat too much"". In your view, the eating too much has to precede the bacterial overgrowth. Seems awfully convenient. But people don't get AIDS or anything else because ""well, germs are everywhere"". They get AIDS from an infected lover or contaminated needles or due to exposure to some other specific vector. You can ""eat too much"" all day long and if you weren't exposed to a specific pathogen, you won't grow it.<p>I have lost enormous amounts of weight in recent years. I never counted calories. I had zero goal of losing weight. My only goal was to kill off the overgrowth of germs which were killing me. Last year, I lost so much weight, so rapidly that total strangers began stopping me in public places and asking me how I did it. I did not feel like getting into my medical situation, so I made vague noises about dietary changes and walking a lot. However, I am a sample of one, so that will also be dismissed by most members of this forum as ""not scientific"".<p>I really doubt this discussion will do much for either of us. I regret making my initial post. I really should know better by now, but my recollection was that you are a very reasonable member of the forum. So I chanced it.<p>Please have a good evening.",1355975951.0

As a result he's pretty much locked into it unless he ponies up $100 for the latest version of the software (released in 2003) which has VCard export.

I have a CS and Fine Art degree. I work for a small private company (government contractor) in the Washington Metropolitan Area  (Northern Virginia to be specific).  I am currently the only and lead Software Engineer for two Java enterprise applications.  I ship code about 5 to 7 times a year with about 200-320 development/test hours for each release. I lead and take part in every phase of software development lifecycle including customer support. I have managed to clear two Oracle Certifications in one year, and preparing to clear another in the near future. According to my yearly review I was told I was doing an excellent job and will be promoted to Sr. Software Engineer within a year at the pace Im going.   My company size is in the range of 20-30 people and yearly profit is about somewhere in the range of 5-10 million. I have lot of experience in Java and J2EE technologies, but I am also very familiar with PHP, ROR and somewhat familiar with C, but I can learn anything in a short period of time.

Then you have other glyphs such as Thai, not to mention CJK. You're assuming 10ppl/$100k, but the company also needs to make a profit. The font work is usually done in phases, obviously delivering base Latin first and other glyphs/weights are added later. I can't speak to how detailed the hinting is in the Ubuntu font, but that requires lots of tedious work if you need to be able to display/render the font at very small font sizes.<p>edit: Wikipedia also contains this regarding Dalton Maag, the foundry which created the Ubuntu font:<p>""In July 2012 the Rio 2016 Olympic Games released their brand font created by Dalton Maag. It was based on the letters and numbers within the logo already created by Brazilian design agency, Ttil.[11] The typeface took eight months to create and comprises 5448 characters. The design work was mainly done by Dalton Maags Brazilian office, which worked with the London team during the font engineering stage, and also with Brazilian consultant Gustavo Soares, who worked as the technical interface between Dalton Maag and the Rio 2016 team.""<p>There's an example of a typeface built over 8 months using two teams in two countries.",1355972536.0

I remember a long time ago his twitter description was something to the effect of: ""I'm 23 and advise startups.""  What great wisdom would an (unverifiable) unemployed 23 year old have for startups?  He's no Irish marathoner.  Everybody is an ""idea person"" but it's not worth squat until you do something (more than wireframes or simulations) with your life.<p>Have we considered it's a joke?  A simple joke a first, but over time grown sentient.  Maybe there are multiple people in the cabal of Dustin Curtis: designer, over-generalizing pontificator, and website engineer.  Elite trolling for people who already think they are better than everybody else.  A Fox News commentator of startups, except most people are in so deep they can't see the deranged minds behind the narrative.<p>Does Dustin Curtis interact on any platforms beside twitter and his own website?  nickb taken to a whole other level?",1355972417.0
