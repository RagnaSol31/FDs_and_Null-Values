You can't just copy the superficial aspects of a successful society and expect the rest to just fall into place, for the same reason that simply holding elections doesn't magically turn a dictatorship into a stable functioning democracy. You have to address the root causes, if they are amenable to analysis.",1276401522.0

These rituals cause us individuals to 'tune' ourselves as a collective and as a result, the tribe has increased chances of survival.""<p>This is called group selection. It's ironic that you mention it in response to this interview; Dawkins became famous by explaining the fact that group selection doesn't exist, and why theories like the one you've just suggested violate very fundamental principles of evolution.

It appears that the generation and appreciation of music relies on a number of genes that seem unlikely to have evolved purely for music.

(Sorry if I didn't make that explicit before: I take for granted that SEO can provide value for users, too.)<p>A very optimistic person could say that the search results are due not just to Google's algorithms but the cooperation of Google's algorithms and webmasters optimizing for them, and that without both of these elements, the Internet would be a much poorer place than it is currently.<p>One example is meta description tags.  That is useful for site owners (good snippets increase CTR), useful for users (good snippets make the search results magically better by telling you what you're going to get before the click), <i>and</i> useful for Google.  Good meta description tags <i>only exist because of SEOs</i> and do not follow under the frequently argued ""Meh, that is just a common web usability guideline"" shibboleth.  To the best of my knowledge no common user agent surfaces them anywhere users can see them.  They exist because they're used for search engine result pages, and that's all.",1276399915.0

32,1426908,comment,1426798.0,1426798.0,0,0,aptsurdist,,,"In this interview they speculate about whether our attraction to music might be a by-product of the fact that we have evolved other specialized skills that aid our individual survival.  For example, our survival is aided by our rhythm analysis which helps us walk upright, and our speech analyzing mechanisms which help us in many obvious ways - the idea is that we enjoy music because we are obsessively attuned to these survival-aiding perceptions.<p>I've always enjoyed contemplating the inverse of this theory; what if we gained appreciation for music and other collective rituals because by acting out these rituals (as individuals), our collective tribe benefited.  These rituals cause us individuals to 'tune' ourselves as a collective and as a result, the tribe has increased chances of survival.<p>If this were the case, it would be more appropriate to say that our collective tribes evolved music and rituals for the tribe's sake - it doesn't directly help an individual survive and the individual might not even understand their compulsion to participate.  For example, a drum beat might compel a soldier into battle.  A religious ritual might compel an individual to supersede their allegiance in order to serve a king.  If you look at other species like bees and ants that function as a collective, you see that their 'dance' is not an individual's language but one that evolved because it enabled the collective to survive.  Again, the individuals might not understand their dance - they just wanna dance!<p>So actually, I like the idea that maybe speech, language, and what we call intelligence are all byproducts of adaptations like music and rhythm that appear worthless to individual survival, but in fact are crucial to the survival of the collective.
