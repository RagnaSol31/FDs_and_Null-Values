Branding then becomes irrelevant: they are literally the exact same OS. No different to iOS for the iPhone and iPad, or Android running on phones and tablets.<p>It doesn't have to mean bloat either, assuming Windows sufficiently is modular. Just don't include or load the Win32 subsystem. The ARM version doesn't have backwards compatibility anyway.<p>Windows 8 should be out within the year, and given that it's an extension of the PC market it shouldn't be too late.<p>If Microsoft can pull it off successfully, it should hugely improve their mobile prospects by allowing them to use their dominance of the desktop. Buying an application once and having it work on your phone, tablet and desktop (and potentially console) is an incredibly compelling selling point that would overcome WP7's current marketshare problem. It would also make it much easier for Microsoft to introduce features: do it once, and get it on every platforms for free. It's a very forward-looking idea.",1312688940.0

Copyright owners have the right to control distribution and adaptation, which would cover the legitimate intellectual property rights that companies should have over their software, and could eliminate the frivolous patent suits that are such a waste of resources. This of course would depend on what early cases would establish as a basis for what counts as copyright infringement, but hopefully it could be interpreted in a narrow enough fashion to provide protection for people's software while eliminating the threat of baseless suits.",1312688658.0

Option B should be that if an inventor can show a clean history of evolving an idea, it should be allowed to freely enter the market.<p>Ideas evolve over time, and the originate from something.  Perhaps if inventors were willing to register their invention documents through a set of steps mapping to something like the Technology Readiness Level (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level</a>), then they could be eligible for immunity against patent based litigation.<p>But lets say this certified patent wants to protect its IP on the market through litigation.  In this case, the inventor could first request certification of the invention in question before any further legal action occurred.<p>If we could create a certification process that is less than $2000 or so (about the cost of a provisional patent including attorney fees), it seems feasible.  This system would seek to encourage a regulated invention process that filters new inventions from even being eligible for litigation.  This allows for inventor insurance in a sense - keeping a capped cost for protecting certifiably original ideas while encouraging original invention and discouraging the incentive behind patent lawsuits.",1312688656.0

So we'll give Zuckerberg credit for launching his online social directory for college students just as the social-networking craze was getting underway. He also built it right, quickly making Facebook one of the most popular social-networking sites on the Net. But there's also something to be said for knowing when to take the money and run. Last spring, Facebook reportedly turned down a $750 million buyout offer, holding out instead for as much as $2 billion. Bad move. After selling itself to Rupert Murdoch's Fox for $580 million last year, MySpace is now the Web's second most popular website. Facebook is growing too - but given that MySpace has quickly grown into the industry's 80-million-user gorilla, it's hard to imagine who would pay billions for an also-ran.</i><p>As I remember it, Facebook didn't have wireless either, and had less space than a nomad.",1312686042.0
