Until I left academia I used to work with matlab a lot, and pyexperiment is probably a result of trying to get that experience while making scripts that can easily be shared along with the data needed to run them.<p>E.g., the issue with irreversible mutation of data is addressed in pyexperiment with rotating state (and log) files. For example if you store the state of your experiment in one run, and then change it in the next, you will get a backup of the old state with a numerical extension (by default up to 5 backups are rotated). Moreover, pyexperiment by default comes with commands to display stored state and configuration options (though they still need to be improved), and both are stored in formats compatible with a host of other software (including matlab).<p>Btw., along the same lines, I love ipython notebooks, but the way I use them makes them very hard to share, and compared to plain python scripts, version control is a pain (even with the usual hacks to make diffs readable).",1439264127.0
