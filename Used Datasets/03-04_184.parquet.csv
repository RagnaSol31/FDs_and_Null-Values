We will be following up with a detailed performance outline as more data comes in. You can compare the progressive JPEG image against the WebP or JPEG XR to get a sample of what the ratios might be for a standard JPEG. Besides, a surprising number of websites still serve wildly uncompressed and unoptimized imagery. We help websites that are serving uncompressed JPEG and PNGs all of the time.<p>Furthermore, what should be understood (and I will clarify in the post) is that apart from the example image, which is designed to show the comparative compression ratios of the file formats, the data we report is based on the images that these companies are ALREADY serving. We analyzed our logs for what the image size is that they are currently serving as JPEGs and PNGS at the same size and simply enabled content negotiation for those same sized images.<p>With regards to the Vary header. You are right that the cache fragmentation of varying by Accept or User Agent would be extreme. This is why we do not do this. Instead, we perform normalization on the request and generate a specific &quot;content ID&quot; that takes into account any number of input signals that should be normalized and varied on. We can expose this as a separate header to folks who want to Vary on if folks want it. Finally, if you are serving directly out of us, none of this really matters. There is no web server involved. We handle all of the hard work on our end.<p>I disagree that content negotiation is the wrong approach though. The fragmentation we see across all of the input signals (e.g. format support, device pixel ratio, user agent, etc) is already so extreme that the best answer is to serve dynamic responses for images. If you want to stay within in the browser prefetch stage, which is critical for front-end performance, you have to make decisions about the content you want to serve at the server. This means potentially serving variant content under a single URL. We serve targeted responses for text content all the time across the web. It is not clear from your argument as to why this same treatment should not apply to imagery.<p>Happy to discuss further,\nChris",1408679765.0

It ends up being stressful, but good things come out of it. This is not a long term strategy, but works for a few weeks/months.<p>When I started my career, I went into a very famous IT firm here in India. Being from a non-CS background they put us through a grueling training schedule. Which together with the course work, assignments, project work, tests, interviews and exams put us on a 20 hour schedule for around 3-4 months- Failure means getting fired, and in this country where getting jobs is quite difficult for a fresher that was not even an option. We stayed in the campus hostel, pretty much training and occasional recreation is what we did.<p>Guess what even after 7-8 years later, the biggest edge I hold over my peers is that training. Basically because we went through every thing there is about out there. At the end, we might have gained what one would gain after 2-3 years of working in a few months.
