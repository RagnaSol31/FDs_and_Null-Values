I can't decide if that's sad or hilarious.<p>I'm not an open web fanatic, but such naivety from a tech savvy site is scary. \nRegular people must think Facebook is a given, like air or tap water.\nThis widespread lack of education is going to get ugly soon.<p>Maybe I'm just a grumpy young guy, but I can't understand why people not only use, but depend on Facebook.<p>Look at Hacker News, there is something interesting here everyday. I'm sure there are equally relevant sites in almost every field of knowledge.

Now I'm thinking to make this solution at least somehow useful, by making it open source.<p>My previous startup was focusing on detecting web vulnerabilities with an own written scanner.<p>The main purpose why I have formed this startup and developed this scanner was bit a too big ego which wanted to compete with some big player solutions ( in this case IBM and HP), despite the fact they just bought companies who build those scanners instead of developing them ;).<p>Unfortunately or luckily? I have managed to establish an OEM-partnership with a well known Web Application Firewall Vendor. They used a new, polished and rebranded version of my scanner now to gain attention in the enterprise market. Especially as most of the enterprise are more interested in security scanner at all than in application firewall solutions. They also had some success selling the scanner to Telcos, Gov’s and large retailers. But at the end, far to less to keep the business and support running.<p>Now I have seen this issue early enough and started to sell the solution as an online scanning service similar to that what you already know from McAfee Secure, GoDaddy or Comodo.<p>I can't tell how often we have switched layouts and the pricing. We tried everything . Developed online wizards and offline configuration clients, recorded demo videos and so much more but it just seemed that an web application scanner is far too specific for regular users.<p>We had about 800 registrations and some few sales, but still not enough to keep a business like that running so at this point I started to give up.<p>I realized selling an enterprise solution to enterprises is very hard but selling it to regular users is almost impossible.<p>We also had some attempts to sell the company or the source code to great US enterprise security companies and all of them were really excited about the scanning results in comparison to other scanning solutions. But due my chosen program language it became impossible to sell it<p>I have to say, we've been always a small startup, we were 2 founders and we had some halftime trainees, which just graduated from school. So by all the time I was always the only fulltime developer and did 90 % of the work.<p>So here I am hating the code and the time spent for a company, a company that didn't brought me forward and stole me years of hard work (15-18 hours every day).<p>I remembered talking with a friend about why companies don't make stuff open source if they close, after he only found dead links to a mac application, that's the reason why I'm now thinking of making this open source.<p>I thought if I can't or don't want to sell the scanner anymore, why shouldn't I help other people by making this open source and at least earn some appreciation.<p>The scanner itself is very accurate, at some point it was almost able to compete with the big players on other even better or worse.<p>Now some information's which you possible dislike.<p>The scanner has a 3 tier model, is written in C",

Don't just <i>think</i> about it, whatever that means to you; just thinking tends to get people's minds running in smaller and smaller circles-which is why going away and coming back the next day helps.  But thinking, and working, differently will help you more and help you more quickly.  Try diagramming the problem, try working a simplified or more specific example, try generalizing the problem to see if it fits something you learned in another context.  There are many things you can <i>do</i> to work on a problem.<p>Polya's <i>How to Solve It</i> is mostly simpler types of math, it is intended for teacher training after all, but the general methods he demonstrates can often help with much harder and more complicated problems.<p>Wickelgren's <i>How to Solve Mathematical Problems</i> (originally titled, <i>How to Solve Problems</i>, the new title is more accurate) has both basic and more advanced tactics for problem solving.<p>The best way I have found to use these types of books, after reading them through quickly for an overview, is to stop and browse in one of them when you get badly stumped on a problem.  Then go back to the problem; if you still can't make headway, stop and browse a bit more.<p>ADDED: Mathematics involves three distinct types of learning and work: learning the mathematical theory, which I generally find fairly easy.  Learning and applying problem solving methods to apply theory to actual problems, which is much harder.  And doing the calculations to solve the problems once you have worked out how to apply mathematics to the problem, which I find really, really hard, fortunately this is the easiest aspect to automate (calculators and Mathematica, for example).",1304046237.0

It's so simple and elegant.<p>Even though they are not-technical, you can start with the tags:<p><pre><code>    bug, to-do, need-advice\n</code></pre>\nAnd then add different project domains or whatever else you please.<p>In a ten minute presentation you can teach them how to make issues, close issues, assign people to issues, and tag other people in the issues, and you're pretty much done with the learning curve.<p>Have everyone make an issue, tag it as something, assign it to someone, have that assignee close it out, and they've completely gone though everything there is to know themselves.<p>The caveat: It is only free if you allow the project to be public. If you want it private, it will be 12 dollars a month. I would urge you to give it serious consideration regardless. If you're making any sort of money at all, 12 dollars a month is peanuts compared to the peace of mind of a simple online system accessible from anywhere.",1304046086.0

But that's just a stop-gap measure to fix a deficiency in older browsers.",1304046086.0

I like its built-in counter functions, necessary to keep track of statistics, and the native support for HA, something other RDBMS do not provide. They have a nice architecture, which you will really like if you want to host multiple sites on one machine, and they are controlled by different network devices. They have a middleware called the broker (you can look at their architecture for more info), which you can create for each db, and each of them will listen to a port of the particular  device. Quite useful implementation. Overall, the performance is quite good, especially with tuning. If you have questions on this, CUBRID has quite responsive community. You can always ask them, they are always online at least for me GMT +6. Also, they recently tweeted that they are going to release a new version these days which will be the best release so far with almost full compatibility with MySQL. It's not important for my projects as they are natively developed for CUBRID, but I believe it will be really useful for those who migrate from MySQL. I plan to run the new version on a test machine and see if there is any performance gains. If so, will upgrade, otherwise, I will stay on the current 3.0. Let's see. Anyone else want to share their experience?",1304046075.0
