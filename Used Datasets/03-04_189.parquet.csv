I'm not sure where they are anymore they tend to go up and down a lot and I haven't paid attention to any of this for a couple of years now.<p>Some of these scams can be so profitable that the scammers literally buy small banks to make sure they don't get shut down and give great rates to people with legitimate business and high enough volume so that the blended rate between their legitimate customers and their scammy cash cow looks ok. They take a loss on the legitimate customers but the cash cow is a scam and almost pure profit so they still make a huge amount of money.,1329796276.0

They claimed to be generating $75k ""in profit"", but had no F/T devs on the project. Combine that with self-proclaimed stalled growth, and the company's a loser. I'm going to guess that a huge slice of that $75k was due to parasitic hosting -- they probably put it on infrastructure belonging to (or at very least subsidized by) their other ""real"" projects, so even $75k is a stretch.<p>Next, the codebase is hacked together (as they say in the ""why we're not open-sourcing it"" paragraph). People buying entire companies in a packed market like this are looking to buy something that's basically running on rails. Newsberry isn't this. Hacked together is fine for a bleeding-edge idea, but this thing had been going for 7 years.<p>A buyout would have landed somewhere in the 4-figures.

I believe you're wrong -- it is a legitimate and valid complaint and here's why:<p>Most software can't run for very long. A lot of high-end software can be /very/ unstable (hello, Maya! ;-). The user is not just starting that software once at the beginning of the day for a long productive day of work, they are all to often starting it again after a crash. Or after they shut it down to get enough RAM to run Excel. Or after rebooting Windows for /another/ mandatory update from IT.<p>I once had to restart a particular high-end compositing package thirty times in an hour. Twenty seconds of the average two minutes were spent staring at the splash screen. But I had to do it, because I needed thirty frames rendered and a particular plugin crashed after running one frame.<p>The user is not starting your software to admire your credits or the clever graphic design of your logo. They are starting your software to /use/ it get a job done, a job that they have in mind to do and any distraction at all (even a harmless splash screen) is a new stumbling block on their way to resuming their task.<p>I heard of a study done back in the mainframe days that determined that anything that took less than two seconds felt instantaneous to the user. However, anything longer (even five seconds!) took ""forever"". In my years of programming, I have found nothing to disprove this (possibly) apocryphal conclusion.<p>Your user's time is valuable.

58,3615105,comment,3614703.0,3614703.0,3,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Honestly...<p>I've lived in St. Louis my whole life (other than collage) and recently went to Startup Weekend St. Louis as well as php and code till dawn meetups. I know only a few people, angel investors from Startup Weekend, community organizers and others who are really trying very hard to get something started here. But it's a very VERY tiny tech community. However, there are angel investors, mentors, startup weekends, and The Founders Institute just came to town so you'll probably get lots of attention. I call these passionate people ""Queen Bees"" because they are very generous and dedicated to turning St. Louis into a tech center.<p>However, the problem I see over and over again in St. louis is are the lack of ""Worker bees"". These are the people that actually build companies and startups and do the work. There are very very few of them.  And that is where the flaw of the St. Louis startup scene becomes very apparent. The Queen Bees here like the Arch Angels, Jay Delong, Brian Blanchard, Israel Vickers, & dozens of other community organizers are the warmest people you'll meet. They are amazing. They really want to lead this kingdom towards glory but for this whole ""Tech Scene"" to work there have to be worker bees and that's exactly what St. Louis is missing. It's like trying to build a Craigslist for Antarctica, or trying to build a Farmers Market in Death Valley Arizona.<p>So in the event that your startup does grow, good luck finding talent. The mentality here is different. I went to PHP meetups a few times a while ago and the developers there literally didn't give a single ""fuck"" about any startup ideas, from anyone. They'd gather up every month, talk about stupid shit that ""happened this one time..."" then at the end ask each other what they should do the next meetup because chit chatting is boring. The idea that they could work on a startup that could change the world is completely over their head. They are oblivious to their own possible greatness.<p>$50,000 grant for startups is a great deal for people who already live in St. Louis but a terrible deal for people who have a chance to move to the Bay Area. Getting a startup off the ground is hard enough, why make it harder by moving to a place where you have less oportunity and less people to make it happen?<p>In the end you need to do what's best for YOUR startup and YOUR idea, not what's best for St. Louis. A startup is like a child you are raising, and if you want the best for your child, you pack your bags and move to an area with better schools, less crime, and better collages. Depending on the situation, the best place for your child and most startups is Silicon Valley. People who try to convince themselves otherwise are the type of people who either don't have the balls to move (like me), or are emotionally attached to their city (New Yorkers, Seattleans), or don't have the funds to move. There's lots of stories of people outside the valley making it but I bet you if they moved to the bay area they would have made it farther and faster than in their home town. Silicon valley is not a ""place"" but a certain type of ""people"". They are very intelligent, not always educated, bat shit crazy and hell bent on building something great. And Silicon Valley is FULL of them. They will fuel your startup's success faster and better than anyone else can.<p>So if you're young and able to move, go to the Bay Area, if you're stuck in New York or St. Louis or Seattle because of family or emotional reasons. By all means take advantage of these deals and try to give back to the community so you can help others who are stuck in their home town too.

If my parents were to pass away while I was gone out west, I'd never forgive myself. To me there's no afterlife so you have to love those around you as much as you can while they are alive because there's no second chances after that.

I imagine they'll freeze the money at some point but if you're running a large operation you'll know at what point that will happen and will have stopped using that merchant account before then and have taken most of the money out.<p>EDIT: I forgot another reason why banks don't like chargebacks: banks themselves have to stay below a certain aggregate chargeback threshold across all their clients' accounts or they get grief from the credit card companies and have to pay penalties/fines.

Was I really learning history or just arbitrary numbers? You could claim that it was real history, and probably be technically correct, but I think that's silly.

I grew up there and went to college + medical school there (until I was about 25). Then I left.<p>I always say that St. Louis is a nice place to be from. It's a nice place to raise a family. But I'm never going to move back. Or under extreme protest if my wife decides she wants to move back to be by family. There's just nothing <i>interesting</i> about St. Louis. White flight ruined the city in the sixties and highway 70 divides the majority black population (north) from the majority white population (south). So it's basically a segregated suburbia wrapped around a lifeless inner core. No one lives in the city. They drive there to work, drink and watch sports. Period.<p>I certainly wouldn't want to start a tech company there.",1329793479.0
