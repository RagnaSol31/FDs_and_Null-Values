In WWI all sides were completely caught off guard by the destructive power of modern industry applied to warfare.  WWI was a case of ignoring the looming technological disruption of international relations and politics caused by modern warfare.

They never really understand callbacks initially, but they can mash things up to see something on their screen.<p>Another big thing about Node is the boilerplate to run NodeJS programs (compared to PHP where installing apache can be a nightmare for beginners, and makes it much harder to understand the big picture)<p>Async is hard, and takes a long time to breath in I agree. But closures + callbacks nearly look similar to to sync code in other languages. Async code looks much more scary in other languages",1434942300.0

Being a Greek, I could potentially feel relieved by an outcome such as the one you describe. Nevertheless, any such solution would be just a painkiller that fails to address the source of the pain. The Eurozone is fundamentally broken so, even if it is painful, I think exiting the Eurozone is the most appropriate action at this stage. How we can work together in Europe to make sure this does not mean we default to our obligations towards other European people is the question. And of course this should be based on an assessment of the debts we took to support indigenous corruption and consumption (which we should be paying) versus the debt of the last five years which has accumulated just to support imported incompetence (as proven by the outcomes) and mostly served as a concealed European banks bail out.",1434942015.0
