This is how one ends up with Postgres instead MySQL (or Informix instead of Oracle) with Scala instead of Ruby (because you do understand principles Scala is based upon), with Erlang instead of Java (you do understand the differences and principles),etc. Basically, sysadmin is a system (or service) designer and architect.<p>Nowadays the term sysadmin is used to describe a job of issuing memorized commands to AWS or some &quot;containers&quot; without any deep understanding of what dynamic linking is, what is libraries and API visioning, how to compile from sources and run several versions of some sets of libs, how to recompile a source package disabling unnecessary features, and so on. This is the same nonsense as to call an auto-mechanic an engineer. Most of moderns sysadmins does not know what the <i>./configure; make; make install</i> sequence or a syntax of Makefiles or how the mess they called cmake works.
