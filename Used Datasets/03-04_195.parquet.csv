What's missing from written and or auditory only communication is the body language side channel.  While you can feel fear when reading a novel, and joy when talking on the phone etc it takes a lot more effort to evoke such emotions.  What would be really interesting IMO is if you could add that side channel to recorded video etc and really feel what a directory was aiming for etc.<p>PS: Learning to communicate over a neural link would be at least as hard as learning a new language, which is why I suggest the side channel approach.  Body language is useful and much simpler than say Spanish.",1362110304.0

It has the navigation system built in and you could even record the trip as if your glasses were a dash cam (hey, worked for Russia!).<p>2) People gradually forget they have it on when driving and end up getting out of the car with the glasses still on. You'll maybe see a few people wear them briefly while walking from the parking lot to the store but it still won't be that public. At least by now it will have been out long enough that people know about them.<p>3) People wear them more and more out in public and eventually it becomes the norm. Sure, some people might be like ""oh that's weird"" but they won't think too much about it.<p>I highly doubt that suddenly the streets will be flooded with Google Glasses right from the start.

Current flagships from Apple and Blackberry are 4"" and 4.2"" respectively.<p>I'm a person who dislikes carrying a <i>shovel</i> of 5"" in his pocket for a phone. Sadly, this is becoming a standard for top of the line devices. There's even a new term now - phablets - for phones over 5"".<p>This trend puts people like me in a difficult situation. There's simply no compact alternative of similar capabilities. They're cut down in functionality, downgraded versions in the mid to low market. If you want a modern phone of 4"" with LCD high-res display, 8MP camera, 4 cores, NFC, etc - it is virtually non-existent.<p>My question is why companies push for ever larger displays on smartphones? And what can we, compact phones aficionados, do about it?<p>Is this where we're going? :) http://i.imgur.com/SZ31YuL.jpg",1362107223.0
