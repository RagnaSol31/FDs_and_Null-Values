It could be that it does not address an issue that the HN community finds valuable, especially in a startup context.<p>It could be that it is a good post, but hey, it’s the seventeenth similar post today. That happens, I recall some talk years ago about bundling posts so that there could be one discussion, but Hn doesn’t, and there isn’t room for seventeen posts on the same subject in one day.<p>It could be that it’s a little heavy on my personal feelings and light on objective information. That’s fine, a blog ought to contain subjective experiences, but a site like HN ought to weight towards information on the whole.<p>It could be that it reads like an SJW having a hissy-fit and rage-quitting, and we don’t need that ‘round here.<p>Either way, I just want everyone to know that I appreciate that some HNers value its existence, but I am not dismayed that it isn’t going to be on HN.
