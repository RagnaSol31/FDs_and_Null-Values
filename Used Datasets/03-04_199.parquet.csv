While what you mention is indeed a factor, I think the greatest factor is the fact that on the internet, ROI can be calculated. The metrics are much more precise and I have a feeling that there's been a <i>LOT</i> more money spent on advertising than was ever justified.<p>I think this is just the effects of greater transparency on the client side. When the client can measure effectiveness, advertising prices plummet.

What happened to ""Right, just the <i>other</i> guys should be regulated?""<p>I'm not sure what's not clear about the notion that large risk should be regulated.  If a company is capable, due to size or what have you, of harming a large number of people due to malice or incompetence on the part of its corporate governance, then sanity demands it should be regulated.<p>However, small companies should be regulated as little as possible.  I mean, assuming you want a working economy.  I'm not sure you do - actually, I'm not sure <i>what</i> you want, but from the standpoint of pattern recognition of your strawman attacks, I'd assume you want to regulate <i>all</i> business as little as possible.<p>Where I suspect we differ is the degree of ""possible"".<p>In my opinion, any business that can destroy hundreds of miles of coastline for other people while still having a banner profit year?  Yeah, that should probably be regulated, since the Invisible Hand ain't gonna do it.  Look up the Tragedy of the Commons sometime; you might find it instructive.  (Or perhaps not.

I hasten to add that Americans have the same model - even though we live here and see reality all the time.<p>Europeans and the Japanese, for instance, think that society naturally agrees that education is a good thing.  After all, educated people have created everything worthwhile in life, right?  Doctors are educated, government administrators are educated, engineers are educated - stands to reason!  Americans, on average, mistrust educated people, to such an extent that education can actually be a liability for anyone proposing public policy.<p>And yet this is not reflected in movies, where scientists or engineers may be goofy, but they're always respected.  So the America of the mind is profoundly out of synch with real America, in ways that flummox anyone who tries to live here in the blithe assumption that America is a first-world nation.<p>That's just one example off the top of my head.

That is also true of Berkeley and Stanford (I can't attest for any schools other than that).<p>I think the higher universities with older programs would be more inclined to teach theoretical than younger programs just starting during the dot com boom or during the past few years.,1275275168.0

Microsoft basically finally made a nice portable media player just after the point where growth stopped in portable media players.<p>Courier I find interesting. I was one of the people who thought the demo looked really interesting. It totally spoke to me as a device that if it operated the way it did in the video (which is a big if), I'd have had a real use for. But I don't know if that means it would have actually been successful as a product. I think if Microsoft thought they could build it, and that it would be successful, they'd have done so. The fact that they scrapped it (or did whatever it is you do with a product concept video that you never actually said was going to be a product) shows me that they don't understand that market, or don't think it exists sufficiently.<p>I think part of the problem is the way Microsoft Research is structured.  According to Bill Buxton (who is kind of my dream ""wish he was my uncle""), Microsoft Research is basically tasked with incubating long-term technologies.<p>In this video, he talks about how some of the stuff he's been working on over the past decade is now starting to get used in shipping projects: <a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/LarryLarsen/CES-2010-NUI-with-Bill-Buxton/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/LarryLarsen/CES-2010-NUI-with...</a><p>While I think that's awesome for Microsoft to be that forward-looking, I think they also need a more short-term skunkworks.<p>Maybe not as radical as Google's ""20% time"", but I think something that shortens the amount of time between ""concept and prototype"".<p>Windows Phone 7 seems like a pretty good idea. It's a fairly novel approach to interface design; but it didn't just spring up. Microsoft basically plodded through ten years of bad mobile strategy and pissed away their technology lead until even they couldn't pretend that they were headed in the right direction.<p>If you contrast that with Palm, who also developed and launched a completely new platform in a relatively short period of time, I think it's obvious that Microsoft works in glacial time.  Then again, Palm's gamble hasn't really paid off either.<p>I think Microsoft couldn't possibly bet too big on mobile. I know it's trendy, and I'm certainly not being profound, but I don't think it's ludicrous to consider it the largest growth market in computing for the next decade. I think the problem (which the original article points out, is that Google has pretty much screwed their existing business model by giving away Android).",1275274985.0
