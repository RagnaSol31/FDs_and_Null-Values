6,195669,comment,195160.0,195570.0,0,0,vitaminj,,,"Statistical randomness is pretty well defined. Say you have a set of independent and identically distributed (iid) random numbers, then if you plot a long run histogram it should resemble the probability density function of the distribution. Irrespective of whether it was generated by a pseudo-random algorithm or by quantum disturbances, your set of numbers is statistically random in a practical sense.<p>Your question seems more philosophical, though I think at the quantum level things become more or less random whichever way you think about it. Furthermore, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle suggests that we'll never have sufficient technology to measure both the position and momentum of a particle, which I would say is a pre-condition to observing a deterministic process at work on the quantum scale.",1211341954.0

10,195665,comment,195423.0,195626.0,0,0,jshen,,,"""any smart coder can pick up Ruby quickly""<p>True, but can they pick up ruby quickly, and rails (rails is non trivial these days), and rspec, and rake, etc. I'm guessing it would take at least 6 months to become merely comfortable with all of these. This is far different than having a proficient coder walk in the door.<p>You'll have much better luck getting a proficient rails coder than a proficient django coder. On the flip side I'm starting to get a lot of rails candidates that aren't really interested in rails, but used it at their previous job. For  while if someone had rails on their resume it meant they took the time to learn it on their own (which is a good sign). Those days are gone.",1211341609.0
