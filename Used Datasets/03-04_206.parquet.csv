At all.<p>I disagree with this, and it was Eric Meijer's ""Fundamentalist Functional Programming"" lecture that really changed my mind.  The point isn't that Haskell prevents side effects.  It's that it requires you to be explicit about them.  Indeed, some advocates say that Haskell is ""the best imperative langauge"".  I don't know that I would go that far though.",1293595122.0

Dave Arnold at the French Culinary managed to make extremely high-quality flavored vodka out of pure food-grade alcohol --- an industrial supply! --- for a couple bucks a gallon. So there's an easy counterexample.<p>In the US, by law, flavored alcohol is not ""vodka"".  Vodka is a tasteless, colorless combination of ethanol and water.

Responsibility - give employees responsibility, trust and hold them accountable for their actions<p>4.

As if design was somehow beneath them, or as if it's wallpaper that you can plaster over a project once the code is written to ""pretty it up"".<p>To answer your questions:<p><i>Why are you interested in learning more about design?</i><p>Because I want to spend my career making people feel the way I felt when I first used an iPod. I picked the iPod here because it seems to  be the stock example that gets trotted out whenever someone needs to reference good design, but you can replace it with whatever well designed product you like. We've all had those experiences in our lives where we use something new, and it makes something that was previously difficult easy. That's the kind of stuff I want to spend my time creating, and a sound knowledge of design is a means to that end.<p><i>What have you found confusing about design?</i><p>When and how to break the rules. I'm a fan of Robin Williams' <i>Non-designers Design Book</i> (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Robin-Williams/dp/0321193857"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Robin-Willia...</a>), but as a consequence my projects can look a little sterile because I follow the rules exactly as she lays them out.<p>In contrast, if you go and look at something made by Jason Santa Maria (an outstanding web designer at the top of his game) (<a href=""http://jasonsantamaria.com/portfolio/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jasonsantamaria.com/portfolio/</a>) you'll see he breaks a lot of the rules, and it doesn't matter. In fact, it often times makes the work better.<p>Perhaps you can't codify or reverse engineer that. Jason has design talent. Me, not so much.<p><i>What is one blog post/book/movie, etc. that has helped you better understand something about design?</i><p>I'm fond of <i>The Contemporist</i> (<a href=""http://www.contemporist.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.contemporist.com/</a>) for its great photography of great architecture. It's a great place to draw inspiration. My favourite post so far: <a href=""http://www.contemporist.com/2010/05/20/chicken-point-cabin-by-olson-kundig-architects/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.contemporist.com/2010/05/20/chicken-point-cabin-b...</a><p><i>What software tools do you find useful when designing?</i><p>For HTML/CSS/PHP I tend to use Espresso (<a href=""http://macrabbit.com/espresso/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://macrabbit.com/espresso/</a>). I never mock up web pages in Photoshop. I go straight to code.<p>For desktop software, I'm a big fan of Microsoft Visual Studio's IDE.",1293592152.0

The house I grew up in would have been < 100 square metres, and the block about 1000 square meters or so. This meant loads of backyard; we had a large workshop (loads of wood, tools etc), a chook run, a few fruit trees, some trees for climbing, paved area (concrete slabs) for bikes, some grass and a veggie patch. Now most houses are well over 200 square metres, and land much smaller. Many new housing developments near us call anything over 500m2 'large'<p>And beyond the house... when I was a kid there were large areas of natural bush land to play in/explore. Now they're pretty much all gone, replaced in part by (what we call) ovals - a grass playing area for footy/soccer and with perhaps a swing and slide in the sun. Not much fun.<p>Roads are busier too. We built a go-kart (non motorised) and my parents had no problems letting us tear down the local hill road in it. Street cricket or footy was also very common, but again, just not possible now",1293592137.0
