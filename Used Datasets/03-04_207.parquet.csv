There are remarkable physical differences between a 16 yo, and a 28yo.<p>Your mental capabilities are different, your hormonal level is completely different etc.<p>Yes, there are cultures or where teens are forced to act as adults to function in society, but that doesn't make them they have the same capabilities as of an adult, be either physical, or emotional/mental.<p>And, traditionally armies are staffed with 17-20 yo.  Do you know why?  Because they make better cannon fodder, and more likely to obey orders, take higher risks, which are correlated with the high testosterone levels that teens do have.<p>(BTW, I am 30, and when I was 16 I was basically acting as supervisor of a team of 12 workers when my family was building the house due to my father having heart problems.  Yes, I was good with money, I could negotiate some, tell people what to do to a certain point, but I lacked emotional intelligence, tact, or general maturity to handle more finer problems).",1299556711

Up until quite recently they've basically been able to collect monopoly rent. It is quite likely they will not be able to do so by this time next year. It is entirely possible that they will lose this ability this year, with the speed this market has been moving with.<p>Especially if iPhone users start to migrate to Android. While Apple partisans will swear up and down this is simply Not Possible (TM), it in fact is completely possible. Broadly speaking, most Americans will choose to save money and get something ""good enough"" over something perfect. Even if I stipulate that Android will never be more than ""good enough"", a statement I would not necessarily agree with but let's go with it, you will still find a lot of not-Apple-partisans getting peeled off proportionally to the price delta between the iPhone and the Android. In which case Apple will either have to drop prices and profits or firmly entrench itself as the high-margin, low-sales player... and drop profits. There really isn't a scenario in which Apple gets to be the high-margin, high-sales player that some people seem almost desperate to believe will be the outcome, but even mighty Apple with its Steve-Jobs-powered RDF can't actually flout economic realities, only harness them.",1299556661

It segments young adults into age groups, and then limits the entire days interaction to the same lot of children.<p>You can't define people simply by what year they are born in. Some family environments provide children with an outlet where they end up with a very mature outlook, others don't.<p>The problem with this stratification is that it soon becomes the ""norm"" for children. My kids would say, for example, he wouldn't talk to some other kids because they are in another grade or in another class. It is a totally artificial barrier.<p>In days past, you'd have a grandfather or grandmother around. Kids would hang around their uncles and cousins workshops. There no distinct border. Children can see how they are expected to transition from one role to another.<p>Fast forward to the present day, the ""teen"" is now effectively a market segment, and it has become ""weird"" or uncomfortable to deal with kids who are too young for them or adults who are uncool for them. The narrative behind TV shows and books only serve to reinforce this.<p>As parents, we have a duty to help our children recognize these artificial barriers and help them overcome these perception.",1299554117

I get it when I learn more math -- I can feel my power or whatever it is expand into world.  Teens in a good environment get it when they do their homework -- they know they are expanding and they feel it.  All teens get it when they discover and become proficient at adult fun like fighting, working (at least some get this ;)), sex, driving fast, and becoming a mother.  And when we crank down on this flowering of a person, they get upset.  As they should (I love a pissed off teenager, myself, as long as they are smart too ...)<p>I don't think it's independence, it's this Nietszchean sort of power.
