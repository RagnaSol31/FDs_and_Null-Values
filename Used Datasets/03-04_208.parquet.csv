Look at the guy that ended up prosecuted in the UK under RIPA part III, nobody believes he was actually any kind of criminal or threat, and yet they wanted to make a sacrificial lamb out of him just to emphasize how serious they were about having this power available to them.<p>Sure, it may be <i>easier</i> for the government to attack the digital storage device to find the terrorist's journal or plans or whatever, but that doesn't mean it's the only way to do it. If someone has been making bombs, there is plenty of evidence outside a document on an encrypted volume, etc etc etc. The entire idea that a crime can exist purely in information is a step too close to thought crime and all the problems that entails for my tastes.<p>If a crime supposedly exists, investigate the entire crime, not just some theoretical digital footprint on a supposedly inaccessible storage device. Don't try to backdoor negate the right to private information of the citizenry purely because you're too lazy and inept to do so.",1321675066.0

When I questioned about this (as my camera was being confiscated), people were outraged at the thought of legalising child porn. And when pressed further, they will only say its morally wrong (and threatened to turn me to the police! - to which I backed down of course).<p>The best I can come up with is that legislators fear it will lead to copycats. Its been shown that people who hear about a suicide are more likely to both commit suicide and do it in the same manner. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_suicide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_suicide</a>. ""Examples of celebrities whose suicides have inspired suicide clusters include the Japanese musicians Yukiko Okada and Hide and Marilyn Monroe, whose death was followed by an increase of 200 more suicides than average for that August month"". And if you consider that copycat suicides may not have happened without the trigger suicide, the thought that copycat child abuse may not happen without a trigger child abuse is not a wild leap. And the trigger child abuse can be that harmless few bits.<p>I'd feel fine about losing some freedom to stop that child abuse trigger. There are all sorts of reasons why some information is protected from the public, and when that information can cause public harm but not be in any public interest the case to ban it is very strong. Child porn may be equivalent to that sort of may be ""harmful and not in public interest"" category which gets it perma-banned.<p>tl;dr maybe to stop copycats",1321673635.0

The amount of shares authorized must be in your corporate charter and requires shareholder approval to change.  From that pool of authorized, the board can then issue shares which then become the issued and outstanding shares.  If you add in the amount of shares that could be issued if all securities convertible into that class of  stock were converted (e.g. convertible debt, options, warrants) then you have fully diluted issued and outstanding.

Gladwell proposed that it takes almost 10year to become an expert as you go through the do, learn, tweak cycle. Steve Jobs took something which was existing but questioned a lot of assumptions to come up with new inventions (an approach which Elon Musk mentions in his ""Reasoning from First Principles"" interview). On the other end of the spectrum are people like Einstein who clearly wrote the first principle because there was none before that. I am personally encouraged that Steve Jobs was able to bring about massive change in the world with this approach....the valuable lesson for budding entrepreneurs like me is that given time, identification of good ideas and persistence, we could also do something similar though on a smaller scale without being born with an IQ > 140.",1321672366.0

If this idea picks up steam, Netflix becomes a competitor to the networks and their relationships get worse. Heaven knows they're tense enough already. It seems likely that others may pull their content, as Starz recently did, lessening Netflix's appeal. So yes, in the short run they'll gain subscribers, but I don't think this outweighs the major risks this poses in the long run.",1321671951.0
