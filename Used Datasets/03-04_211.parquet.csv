One advantage I se is that using git-flow specific hooks we add some metadata to every time a feature/ branch is finished. This metadata goes into an automatic Release notes file which is automatically added to the repo (as an amend of the flow&,

(For instance, two sines shifted 90 degrees.) You can save space by representing all similar sounding waveforms as the same waveform. This might make for a giant delta when you subtract it from the original recording, even though nothing audible was lost.",1403927433.0
