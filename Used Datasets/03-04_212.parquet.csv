Oddly enough, it wasn't so much the issues that were raised by the reviewers that made me a better programmer (though they certainly helped), but the knowledge that every aspect of my code could be inspected, and I'd be expected to fix it, that forced me to double- and triple-check my work before sending it off.

From their perspective, engineers are cogs in the machine and the only thing that matters are executives.
