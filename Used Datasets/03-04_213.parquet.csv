Time wasters as some people may call it.  There is a huge difference between apps for productivity and having fun. In the end being productive is not always fun.  Claiming some languages are not geeky enough is super ignorant.  As long as the person is coding out of some level of enjoyment is all that matters.  Figuring out how to scale is an amazing challenge.. its not super fun and its not something not all people may find enjoyable, but its something that people in Enterprise have to deal with.  Hacking on kernel code to make something run more efficiently is not a ""Superstar"" activity that will be enjoyed by millions of users like Facebook but someone has to do it.  Every day there are millions of businesses that rely on these day coders to help run businesses more efficiently.  Not everyone wants to work in a start up and dedicate 12 hours of their days to a company that may never come to fruition.

Students need to see how cool it is to be involved in the tech startup community. The Social Network movie did a great job of showcasing this, but I think it needs to be taken further. Essentially we need to work on turning tech companies and their founders into celebrities in the same way that sports teams and their players are.<p>Also I think we need to change how people are exposed to programming. For many people, the phrase ""I'll explain how this works later"" is highly discouraging. As such when the first language they are exposed to is a C variant, they tend to be immediately turned off. Languages like Python should be the base of programming education as they provide the ease of use that can excite new users, while still providing the foundations necessary to learn more complex languages. Also, when learning a language students should really be shown what they can do with the tools they are learning.

When it became obvious that wasn't going to happen for most CS graduates and there was a glut of talent in the market, people switched to something else.<p>2) Outsourcing: Right on top of the dot-com bust was the trend towards outsourcing.  There was lots of scary noise about how programmers were the next factory workers: gone overseas and never coming back.<p>3) H1-Bs: They hurt the supply of U.S. CS students by making wages lower which makes CS a less attractive major.  (For the record, I'm pro immigration, but anti-H1-B.  H1-B workers have very little ability to negotiate salary and companies like Tata abuse the H1-B system).<p>Issues ",
