Every UI-based program you have ever used is asynchronous-event based, even if it has synchronous components, to say nothing of the many many other Node.js-like libraries that have been written over the past decade in other environments, many with more capable languages that Javascript. None of these have been able to fix RPC, and many of the biggest and most well-funded attempts like CORBA and COM have come from smack in the middle of some of the largest piles of event-based code in the world.<p>The reason trying to pretend a network transaction is a function call fails has to do with the different semantics of a function call versus a network transaction. Latency differences even when everything is working correctly certainly are a factor, but are really less interesting than the problems of the unreliability of the network and the fact you are crossing a semantic boundary. Every network transaction can fail. Every network transaction might succeed, but with unacceptable levels of latency. Every network transaction might initially succeed but cutoff halfway through, or dribble its results in one byte at a time, or send you a gigabyte unexpectedly, or any of a variety of other failure cases you must at least be ready for, even if you can't ""handle"" (because in some cases there is no ""handling"" them). Furthermore, every network transaction incurs a serialization step, in which the semantics of the local program must be re-enforced on the data, possibly with failures thereto. For instance, you might get back JSON that specifies an integer greater than 5 billion in size where your environment is still only 32-bit; no local function call can do that. (Which isn't to say local function calls are therefore perfect, it is just that their failures lie in other places. For instance, your overlarge number got truncated somewhere else in your program, but it wasn't a function call that did it, it was some actual math computation somewhere. The point is that there is a different sort of semantic failure that can occur with an RPC vs a local function call and this inevitably leaks out of any abstraction you could try to wrap around the RPC.) And that was simply one tiny example, not the totality of the issues you can encounter, the vast majority of which are far more subtle than that.<p>RPC (where ""procedure"" is an old synonym for function) should by design <i>not</i> deal with these issues if it's really going to be ""RPC"", because by definition of RPC it really ought to look like a function call. Therefore it must handle all of these issues implicitly, and since no one answer is adequate for all cases, usually incorrectly. You can't seal over network issues anywhere near well enough to make dealing with a network as easy as dealing with a function. You must deal with latency issues, but again, these are ultimately the least interesting aspect. You must be able to deal with serialization and semantic issues; if your language forced you to deal with that on every function call you'd never use it. You must have some way of dealing with the various network failures and even throwing various appropriate exceptions only gets you a subset of the actions you might actually want. You must, inevitably, allow these things to poke through somewhere, at which point your are ""configuring"" your RPC call, at which point it is really no longer a ""procedure call"" at all, it's something else.<p>That it has historically imposed an additional point of synchronous behavior in some cases is because languages up to this point have also been largely synchronous, but that has nothing to do with RPC's far more fundamental failures as a network communication metaphor. It is also the case that if you've absorbed too much Node.js hype that you may underestimate the world's understanding of the problem; take a moment to search for ""asynchronous COM"", for instance. The first hit I get is an article from April of 2000. The synchronous problem is easily and trivially solved by turning RPC calls into futures objects instead, which has been done, and has not salvaged RPC because it is not the core problem RPC has. And there are other solutions, too, which also don't work.<p>Regrettably, calling things over a network <i>must</i> be more complicated than a local procedure call; all attempts to make it otherwise have indeed failed to live up to their promises.",1299988370.0

When I moved away from MediaTemple in search of a real virtual server, I wanted a major hosting company that gave me a reasonably good web interface and community support, which is why in the end I just had to decide between Rackspace and EC2:<p>On Rackspace you can have a 512 MB RAM instance with 10 GB in and 1 TB out (I'm not sure how much disk space) coming an at $202.70 per month. Now, EC2 is more complicated because they make you pay for things like I/O operations, but base cost for a Micro instance with 613 MB RAM + 10 GB in and 1 TB out makes $175.70 plus some change for I/O. So from where I'm standing they're both in the same league with pricing, and it's not surprising that the major component of each offering is bandwidth cost, both offered at comparable levels. Just the servers themselves cost $22.08 at Rackspace and $5.11 at Amazon.<p>Obviously, this is all with a big YMMV. In my case, I went with AWS, mainly because it felt cheaper and was easier to set up from Germany (this is where the phone verification shenanigans come in the article is talking about). They say EC2, especially the EBS-based Micro instances, are slow and crappy. But my instance is pumping out moderately complex PHP pages to visitors at a rate of about 8 requests/second, with an average speed of 10 milliseconds per request, with a Linux load avg of 0.04. I'm quite happy about that. So that's not a high load scenario but my guess is it's fairly typical for some dude with a couple of low-profile web projects - and EC2 was the right choice for that.",1299986857.0

I don't disagree that the Angels trying to cut their losses would get little back and there would be no value in rushing out. But in a panic logic is seldom the driver.<p>In your experience, would most startups survive if their angel investors with convertible debt wanted out, even if the cash wasn't there to repay it anyway and there were no tangible assets to sell?<p>Adeo's post reads to me as being a warning about the potential fallout in a context where people want out. I don't think there is much argument that the Angels wouldn't recoup much anyway. But neither is that the case when people sell public stocks that they've acquired at the top of the market when it hits the bottom. But even professional investors do that too with predictable regularity.",1299986506.0

However if there is 'no' fallout, then there is no spectrum, and no room for subjectivity. Those against nuclear power would have to admit this whole episode is <i>not</i> ammunition for their argument. Until 'the results are in' there will continue to be a lot of nuclear apocalypse sensationalism, I'd just like to see it retracted afterwards when/if it turns out to be unfounded. Put another way, we already know that it's possible to have nuclear accidents, what we don't know is whether it's possible for nuclear facilities to withstand major disasters with no such accident occurring. If that's the outcome, then to ignore it would be sort of like a type 1 error.",1299986388.0
