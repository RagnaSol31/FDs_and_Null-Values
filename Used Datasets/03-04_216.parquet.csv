I've cited the copyright clause several times and even paraphrased it. It does not ""forbid"" copyright. It creates it as a limited monopoly on a creative work.<p><i>the Constitution expressly promotes the idea of intellectual property</i><p>That's a big leap. It says, in short, that since they think that advancement of the sciences and arts is important, they will allow authors and inventors a limited monopoly on their work, in order to motivate them. Nothing there implies the creation of a pretend property, not does it promote such an idea. And if you read Jefferson, who wrote extensively on the subject, you'll see that he was completely <i>against</i> the idea of ""property"" consisting of ideas.

In contrast, smaller investors should find the time spent vs. potential upside quite reasonable, and will have to compete only with other small investors -- which makes it more likely they can find investments that are a good deal.",1282190257.0

14,1616447,story,,,10,8,prasanmishra,Review my startup: CodeSnipr.com Learning is easy,,"I am following the startup space since last 4 year. Addicted user to HN. Despite strong interest and motivation never able to startup. I have lots of ideas and spent lot of time learning different programming language. But not able to focus and execute well or some other issue related to day job. Finally thought to give it a try. First thing I thought to build up a team though it is not suggested idea as per HN culture. But my idea is not to hire software developer, rather build a team from scratch. Literally the group I started they have very less exposure to computer or some never touch the keyboard. It's true. Any way it started. Guys are really hard working. I divided the team into groups and started learning small small thing at a time. One started on html,css coding, one guy started gimp, one php, one javascript/jquery, one sql,ubuntu stuff and other helping on marketing. The team expense is not much. $100 running monthly cost of living expense of all 5 people one working part time from home. As English is not the first language we had very hard time to understand the articles and learn the concept behind them. Still we persevere and able to know little bit.<p>Though we still learning and will continue to learn. We think there are few people like us who will face the same problem as us. And they also want the learning is simple experience. So we started working on the idea for allowing anyone to post a simple code snippet with title and explanation about that code snippet. It's that simple nothing much is there. Only one problem we found how to order those information, becoz new user want the table of content format style. If we allow the user to keep on posting the content it may be random. We didn't found the solution yet. But for the time being we are curating those articles, and making the ordering so that if user click on the HTML and click the basic tab on home page he can see a ordered list of articles. Also very small feature we added like syntax highlighting, and copy the code functionality and basic commenting functionality from user.<p>Much appreciated any feedback or suggestion to improve the site. And few encouraging word or feedback to keep us motivated and continue to work towards it. This is just the starting from our team and we will be continuing.<p>Thanks!\nCodeSnipr team\nhttp://www.codesnipr.com\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/codesnipr",1282189892.0

CONE 1,∗ ,	H.A.	ROBBINS 2 ,	J.D.	ROITMAN 2 ,	M.F.	ROITMAN 1,2 1 Program in Neuroscience, University of Illinois at Chicago, USA 2 Dept of Psychology, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA\nThe rate of obesity has climbed dramatically over the past several decades as food high in fat content has become more read- ily accessible. In the US alone, approximately one third of adults are considered obese. Obesity has been correlated with changes in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system. Human imaging stud- ies have revealed that DA terminal regions differentially respond to food depending on body mass index. In animal subjects, high fat diet exposure reduces motivated behavior and responses to amphetamine. Thus, high fat diet exposure may lead to obesity, in part, through feed forward mechanisms that suppress mesolimbic DA signaling. Here, we determined the effects of different durations of high fat diet exposure on phasic DA release evoked by electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area. Rats were given ad libi- tum access to either a high fat diet (60% kcal/g from fat; HFD) or a low fat diet (10% kcal/gm from fat; LFD). After different durations on the diet (2, 4 or 6 weeks), rats were anesthetized with urethane. Phasic spikes in DA concentration were evoked once every 2 min by stimulating the VTA and measured using fast scan cyclic voltam- metry at a carbon fiber microelectrode in the nucleus accumbens. DA function was assessed by altering the number, frequency, and intensity of current pulses before and up to 1 h after cocaine injec- tion. Cocaine caused a dramatic increase in evoked DA in LFD rats. In contrast, cocaine caused a much smaller increase in evoked DA in HFD rats. The data were modeled to determine if baseline and cocaine potentiated differences in evoked DA between LFD and HFD rats were due to changes in DA release, reuptake or both. The results demonstrate that high fat diet exposure results in dramatic changes in phasic DA signaling. Given its established role in reward, rein- forcement and motivation, these changes in phasic DA signaling likely contribute to further imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure.<p>doi:10.1016/j.appet.2010.04.046</i><p>--<p>The abstract still doesn't say what kind of fat it was (saturated, pufas, etc) only that it was 60% kcal/g for high fat and 10% kcal/g for low fat.<p>The linked summary also says nothing about how they measured the dopamine effects which turned out to be anesthetizing the rats, giving them cocaine, and then measuring their dopamine levels. The study seemed to show that cocaine caused a dramatic increase in the dopamine levels of the low fat diet rats and much less of an increase in the high fat diet rats.<p>As far as I can tell from that abstract:<p>Low fat diet = much higher dopamine response from cocaine<p>High fat diet = lower dopamine response from cocaine<p>So the authors are concluding that the lower response will lead to eating more fat in order to get the dopamine reward.<p>Further reading on dopamine: <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/developingintelligence/2007/02/dopamine_for_dummies.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/developingintelligence/2007/02/dopam...</a>",1282189299.0

Exactly one state at any point in time. And that state is a true value, i.e. it never changes.

Here are some other phrases I have a problem with:<p>""It's super simple""<p>""We look after you big-time don't we!""<p>""Servers are yucky""<p>""Things couldn't be easier!""<p>It all sounds very childish, but that's just the tip of the iceberg ...<p>Where do you address the issues of discounts based on time or quantity or shipping or percent of the price, local and state taxes, shipping, and all the other issues REAL online store owners have to deal with and decide upon?<p>On the one hand you keep repeating the mantra ""Things couldn't be easier!"" because apparently you want people to think you've taken care of all these issues, but then you're apparently leaving all the difficult issues in selling online -- but in reality you're leaving it all up to the sellers themselves -- which makes your platform anything but ""simple"".<p>Personally I would not want to sign up before learning how you handle these issues if I actually had something to sell, yet I cannot find any facts or substance to show me how (or if) you're going to do anything to help me with these issues.<p>Perhaps the most important issue is that you seem to be dictating the ""rules"" by which the shop owners must run their online stores (""In accordance with the Shop Owners Agreement you agree to ship all orders within 7 days of receipt"") ...  but if you stick your nose into your store owner's businesses too much the regulators and tax authorities are going to determine that YOU are the merchant -- not the suppliers that you're referring to as store owners.  Then you'll not only be paying all the taxes that your suppliers are not paying, but you will also inherit liability for things you probably didn't want or expect.<p>I think you have a lot to re-think and reconsider before getting into this business the way you've described it here.  I've been in eCommerce for nearly two decades and it disturbs me the way you're going about this, because I'm concerned about the legal and technical issues you don't seem to be addressing.",1282187549.0
