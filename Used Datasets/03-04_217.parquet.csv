That's pedagogically useful because it exposes the student to all the properties of the Turing machine without having to be too specific about implementation (not that MIPS assembly isn't also a good choice). Similarly, the reason to teach Smalltalk is to teach OO, the reason to teach Lisp is to teach Lambda Calculus. The only reason Java is taught is because students demand it because they've heard that if you know Java you can get a good job.<p>Now, that doesn't imply that Java shouldn't ever be taught.

A similar product to what he is suggesting, that covers pre-existing conditions already exists in CA as a shall-issue product, it's called a small group coverage.  It's also many times more expensive than individual insurance.<p>Should an individual insurance product with transparent pre-existing condition coverage exist?  Absolutely. It's going to be more expensive than today's individual coverage, and that's why an insurance company could not successfully sell it against existing competing products in the current individual marketplace, even if regulators allowed it to.  It's up to the government to set up or to allow insurance companies to setup such a group/coverage/underwriting-criteria combination.

Here's a randomly googled CNN Money report:<p>""After grant aid and tax benefits, full-time students at public four-year colleges are paying an average $2,700 a year in net tuition and fees.""<p>So, if they commute, like I did, it's just over $10,000.  I hit an inflation calculator and that's almost exactly what mom and dad spent for me, 1977 - 82.  <i>So in fact, there's been no change in 30 years.</i>   Maybe we should complain that the price hasn't fallen, like it has for computer hardware;  shouldn't technical advances have made it cheaper? ...But wait, it isn't a commodity....<p>So to pay his imaginary $100,000/annum Purdue prof, our writer will need to get not the cozy group of 3 or 4 others -- but 37 or 38 others.  So much for his little utopia, the fruit of careless headline scanning.<p>If your parents are willing and able to spring for the country club, great, you'll make lots of contacts; that's the point, and of course it costs a pile; though frankly I'm surprised how cheap it is, given how far colleges do compete on a country club basis with indoor rock-climbing, etc. ... And it may be worth it, if money is what you're interested in.  Lifelong friends can be made on the artificial rock-cliffs of  University X;  they might come in handy.  (I wonder how much of the later-in-life dollar value of a college education as it is usually measured is like the possible dollar value of a country club. )<p>All these headlines about ""average tuition"" are a total fail statistically ...  What they mean is the average of <i>absolute tuition maxima</i> across universities and colleges -- something that only the royal families of Persian Gulf principalities pay.   The stated tuitions of colleges are <i>pure accounting fictions</i>.<p>Let me say that again: the stated tuitions of colleges are <i>pure accounting fictions</i>.  Arguments based on them belong to the realm of fantasy and demagogical politics, not reality and truth.<p>I remember once hearing the provost of X -- a super-elite private univ., now president of another -- say that if it were up to her, she would make X's ""tuition"" infinite so she could collect ""what they could pay"" from the Saudi princes et al., and use it to fund other students.  But, she said, the alumni always oppose this sort of thing; they didn't what X making the headlines as the most expensive school.<p>One can't help sympathizing with the alumni, but the massive ""tuition increases"" ""far outpacing inflation"" etc etc. is entirely due to <i>the massive increase in trustees and others taking the point of view of the provost.</i>  Or put otherwise, the ""massive increases"" are in the degree to which stated tuition is an accounting fiction.  This may be somehow stupid or corrupt or whatever, but it is a fact.   If reality is under discussion a completely different set of data is necessary.<p>(I should add, by the way, that our writer might be able to get away with a cheaper prof.  The average salary figures he is quoting include the salaries of medical and law professors at Purdue, which completely distort assume the salary facts.  (And medical schools in particular are huge, remember). Thoughtless use of these sort of statistics stuns the mind. In humanities and suchlike faculties, at researchy places, people start around US 40 - 50,000 these days and end up at like 70 - 80,000.

52,738521,comment,738357.0,738485.0,0,0,kgrin,,,"There's a pretty clear medical consensus (based on tons of data) that diet and exercise affects the development or progression of diabetes (well, type II).  There's also a wide consensus that professional counseling and monitoring helps (though I believe it's harder to get really ""clean"" studies to support this, since you'd need a control group of people who you monitor closely enough to get good comparison data without actually talking to them about what's going on).<p>The follow-up question, of course, is whether (or how much) the <i>cost</i> of checkups/counseling affects whether/how much people seek it out, or whether that behavior is more idiosyncratic (i.e. ""some people just don't care about their health, so even if checkups were free they wouldn't bother"").<p>To be fair, I haven't seen any study that conclusively proves the issue (which of course doesn't imply that one isn't out there).  However, if we're really going to make the claim that economic incentives don't matter, then we really need to question a lot of other assumptions as well.  I'm pretty comfortable saying that at least on some level, to some degree, economic incentives have <i>some</i> impact on people's behavior in seeking care.<p>In terms of ""we'll just make it up on preventative care"", I agree, that's not a panacea.  At the same time, a lot of the money that's slated to be spent on covering the uninsured is still spent today, just in really stupidly inefficient ways.<p>For instance, because you generally can't be denied emergency room care, people without insurance often end up using ERs as primary care.  Because ERs are primarily meant to handle, well, emergencies, the standard of care is generally more expensive than a clinic or ""regular doctor"" (this means things like faster and more expensive tests, drugs, and so forth).  Many of those people simply can't pay, but the hospital treated them anyway (which, just to be clear, is a GOOD thing - it would be a pretty horrid society where we let people bleed to death or what have you).  Many hospitals would have a hard time staying open if this went on indefinitely, so the government reimburses them for this uninsured care.<p>So, at the end of the day ""we the taxpayers"" still pay for a good deal of uninsured care... we just do it via an indirect subsidy to hospitals for expensive ER care, rather than paying directly for (much cheaper) clinic care, or something along those lines.  As with most things, the less directly we're tackling the problem, the more inefficiency there is in the system.<p>It would be foolish to claim that all the costs of a big health care/health insurance overhaul would be paid for by money already in the system - clearly, that depends a great deal on the details.  But at the same time, it's important to remember that <i>some</i> of the money <i>can</i> come from within the system: at a minimum, if we reduce the number of uninsured people, we can reduce payments to hospitals for uninsured care.<p>It's not a zero-sum game - electronic medical records and that sort of stuff aside, there's a lot of honest-to-goodness inefficiency and perverse incentives in the system, and that's what (a good) reform ought to tackle.<p>Edit: just to be clear, reimbursements for uninsured care take many forms, and there's another, more obvious one: higher prices for everybody else.  The salient point is that much of this care is being provided <i>anyway</i>, so why not do it more efficiently?",1249269514.0
