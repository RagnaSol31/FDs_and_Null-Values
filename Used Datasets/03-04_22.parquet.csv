He's simply acknowledging a fact:  the economy of today is much <i>faster</i> than it has ever been before.  Scammers can effectively hide behind the speed of their actions.  That's new.<p>Once upon a time, regulatory agencies like the SEC had a fighting chance of catching stock scams, because the market was <i>slower</i>.  It was still efficient, but because there were fewer players, making fewer plays per billionth of a second, they had a chance of stopping crime.  Today, the best that the SEC can do is to (maybe) catch these guys in retrospect -- and there's absolutely no chance that they're catching all of them.

I understand that people have credit card debt but to say no debt allowed in the country at all is just plain stupid.<p>You are basically arguing that massive across the board deflation of every good in the country and literaly putting every single person underwater on their mortgage is a GOOD thing. If house prices have to fall to the levels you want, everyone who owns a home now would lose so much money that the great depression would look like a cakewalk. Nearly every person with a mortgage would be bankrupt.<p>So this grand idea is to prevent a repeat of this temporary 50% reduction in our investments due to 5% of the people in the country defaulting on their mortgage? What?<p>Not to mention anyone that has a pile of cash today (i.e. those that are old enough to have paid off a mortgage and had the advantage of credit in their youth) would be able to outspend everyone else.

Moreover, context switch between processes on Windows is also a little slower, because NT-based kernels went ""maximum security"" route and perform full process isolation, that's also why Windows doesn't have a fork-like syscall, only environment variables, IIRC, can be cloned. (which is how, I suspect, Linux threads are implemented - they're probably share-everything fork calls).<p>On the other hand thread/fiber switch on Windows, I believe, is fastest of all popular x86 OSes.<p>All in all I like Windows process model a lot more. Clear separation between processes (share nothing) and threads (share everything except the stack) is well-known and well documented, and leads to a much nicer server-like application programming experience.<p>Although... I really like how easily you can nuke frozen processes on Linux if there is a problem. No programming tools/knowledge required. Dealing with hung threads would have been a lot harder.",1229484286.0
