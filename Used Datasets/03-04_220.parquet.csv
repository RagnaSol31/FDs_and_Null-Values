In addition to that a large portion of the people I've met here come from fabulously wealthy backgrounds (dynasty money) where failure is largely irrelevant because there is always a near infinite supply of backup money.<p>I think part of the reason the valley does well is because the population is some of the most homogenous and highly selected in the world all living in the same place and there is enough wealth to try things.",1366516790.0

27,5583761,story,,,1,0,fizwhiz912,Ask HN: Animated sequence diagrams that help explain your tech stack better?,,"I've been looking around for sequence diagram software that's a lot like websequencediagrams.com (a tool that I really like) but that also accommodates the use case where you visualize the movement of data & request/response between services through simple animation. Think of the interaction model of different components in a specific tier of a technology stack (or even across tiers): You're showing the origin of a request, how it gets processed and passed on by a cluster of services that may conform to different architectures/design principles; the diagrams would help a user express parallel processing, asynchronously sending back messages/data, pubsub patterns, latency at each hop, and pretty much most things that could really speed up the distribution and understanding of system-architecture design. A basic animation would be the directional movement of an arrow/beam from service to service. A more elaborate one could be the shading of an entire component in a pulsating color suggesting a specific architecture/design-pattern.<p>Can we vary the speed of the ""beams/arrows""? Sure. ""Are we trying to ultimately generate a GIF image that can be circulated thus obviating excessive meetings?"" Indeed. ""Maybe create an applet that let's you tweak speed and other variables, and simultaneously generate the diagram in real time. THEN you export it to .GIF"" That's definitely one way of doing it. ""What's the level of abstraction presented here? Are we talking about large system components, or something like design principles that could be influenced by a programming language's runtime environment""?

I've heard on more than one occasion that the company was great, but the only reason they are not investing is because it is not located in Silicon Valley.<p>The truth is that the World Would be Better if a) VC in the Other 50 Silicon Valleys had the Same Appetite for Risk Taking as is present in Silicon Valley <i>or</i> b) If Silicon Valley VCs were much more open to investing in the Other 50 Silicon Valleys.<p>Yes, it is true that at the Angel level, there's a much broader access to capital now more than ever in a broader range of geographies, but once you start to get into Series A rounds and higher, the bottleneck (""squeeze"") becomes evident, and this is where Silicon Valley has a sizable advantage over other regions.<p>There's no lack of entrepreneurial talent, willpower, or ideas in the Other 50 Silicon Valleys. Rather, the lack of investors willing to invest in these risky endeavors to the point where they can reach the liquidity necessary to self-perpetuate their local entrepreneurial ecosystem. Small exits are necessary, but not sufficient to keep a startup ecosystem going on its own. You need large, $1B+ exits and IPOs on a fairly regular basis to do so... and that requires the financial power equivalent to what's now mainly in Silicon Valley, and perhaps one or two other locations, tops.
