Clients expect them to be an intuitive cheap publishing platform that will magically format, organize and display an endless array of content and content types, while developers expect them to be fast, easy to extend, scaleable, lightweight and fit a theoretical ""goldilocks zone"" of adhering to conventions but still being flexible.<p>To fix the client problem, clients need to understand software does not create good content for you.  Content needs to be curated and software is there to help with the heavy lifting.  Instead of forking out X amount of money on software, spend half that and spend the remaining half on writers, photographers and people to make your content great.<p>As for the software/development problem, each specific case can require a different platform.  Just like one specific programming language is only one tool in the box, one CMS follows the same pattern.  Educate yourself about all your tools and explain the pros/cons to the client before making a decision, but in the end, isn't that what were being paid to do?<p>Sorry if my comment is a little more about the business side of things and not necessarily about the CMS itself, but I feel its a pretty important point on this issue",1310700687.0

I may be wrong, but I have not recently* encountered it on FF, IE, Opera, nor Chrome.<p>Em sizing is counterproductive because 1. That's not how most designers think, (We use Points, Pica, and Pixels.), 2. It's unnecessary for scaling with normally configured browsers, and 3. If someone changes their default type size, I am NOT going to support them: they have full knowledge of how to change the setting to fix a suboptimal page, and they have chosen to have suboptimal pages in the majority of their browsing (You think leading and optimal line width don't matter just as much as text size?) To anyone who actually forces their typeface choice: please do so on a site-by-site basis--or at least typeface-by-typeface for those you find illegible. Please do not try to override the informed choices of typographically-aware designers.<p>Sorry if that sounded like a rant. :) I'm a designer, and I'm passionate about my work being displayed and read the way I designed it to.
