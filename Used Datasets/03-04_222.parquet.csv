It is very important to live within your means (income + some delta > expenses). I don't think anyone would disagree with that statement. There is some debate how big that delta should but that isn't the root of the issue.<p>But then concluding being frutal will provide opportunities is false. All frugality enables is the ability for one to take advantage of opportunities that someone that is in a lesser financial situation could not.,1316231660.0

68,3007126,comment,3006369.0,3006369.0,11,0,aculver,,,"I've found the interest rate on outstanding debt to be a tremendous motivation to try and limit the number of frivolous things I buy.<p>For example, our interest rate is 5.5% and we're not due to pay off our mortgage for 28 years. That means (more or less) that for every dollar I spend, I could have put that on my mortgage and saved 5.5% interest (compounded) over 28 years. Another way of looking at it is that I'm going to be paying 5.5% interest (tax-deductible) on anything I buy instead of putting the money in an extra payment on my mortgage.<p>Given the terms of my mortgage, that makes an $500 iPad actually cost about $500 now and another $481.06 in interest over the next 28 years. My $2300 MacBook Pro will actually end up costing me $4512.88.<p>The great thing about this approach is that it doesn't discourage me from buying <i>nice</i> things that are actually worth their value. The MacBook Pro for example produces incredible value, much more than I paid for it.<p>However, knowing that for every $5 smoothie I buy now, I'll be paying another $4.81 for it in 28 years? I don't buy $5 smoothies 2-3 times a week anymore. Instead I go to Rita's when they're doing $1 kids cones on Monday and I go again on Wednesday for the $1 Italian Ice.<p>Anyways, I found this so helpful in curbing frivolous spending that I created a small iPhone app to help folks do the calculation on the fly. <a href=""http://whatll-it-cost.limelightapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whatll-it-cost.limelightapp.com/</a> . I'd be happy to give a promo code to anyone who thinks it'll be helpful. (After all, that $0.99 would actually be $1.94 after 28 years at 5.5%. :p)",1316229107.0

Since the system is very simple to configure, I can easily dump all that cruft (and in this case the ""cruft"" is the already pretty lean and efficient netcfg) and just use ip, iw, and wpa_supplicant.<p>It takes a bit of time to learn those tools, not long, but it's time.

I've just been using what is there. For me it is all the little things that I need to do regularly that are real annoying.<p>- When I login the widgets that show me what issues I have are pretty useless. They don't show my progress/logged work, they don't show what you last worked on. The priority icon is kinda tiny. So I feel like I am having to track some information manually or in my head.<p>- If you start work on a new task and try to log work, the log work action is hidden under a menu. And when you do log work, it doesn't automatically set the issue to ""In progress"".<p>- Creating new issues is also a bit annoying. First it's hidden in a menu. Then it is a 2 step process. The first form is completely silly. You have 4 inputs, Project, Type, Next and Cancel. Did that really warrant it's own page?<p>- Subtasks are also a bit crazy. Once you enter your subtasks it's hard to reorganise and prioritise your tasks.
