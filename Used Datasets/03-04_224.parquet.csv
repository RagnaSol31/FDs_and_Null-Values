When I set out to profile such a laboratory, I wanted to find out who is drawn to these environments, what it is really like to work there and whether long hours lead to more or better science. I approached eleven laboratories with reputations for being extremely hard-working. Ten principal investigators turned me down, some expressing a fear of being seen as 'slave-drivers'.<p>Number eleven  Quiones-Hinojosa  had no such qualms.

How, otherwise, did we get from TV-land to the internet? Was it not a case of frustrated need for self-expression and response to new stimuli?<p>What is missing here is actually a perspective on how consumption is a form of production itself of perspective. Better access, and new forms and content for consumption, will create (that word!) new forms of consciousness, which are fed back in production.<p>Consumption today seem to me more of a form of networking of sources and producers, production of perspective. There's so little that we yet know about our still new internet reality. Polishing consumption may very well be necessary in order for us to make sense of our current social/technological stage, to produce new forms of social networking/organization and ultimately new every-other-form of content/artifacts.<p>To dive in at the deep end: consuming stuff on a tablet, with the accompanying delights and frustrations - is part of the networking of the device itself into the cycle of human content consumption-production. There's no reason to believe that the tablet as an object is finished, and that it won't evolve to fit the 'expressive needs' of people  your own frustration/pessimism are a part of this cycle, both leading people to not use tablets, to look for different desktop paradigms, new forms of interaction with tablets, improving tablet ergonomics and on and on.

The readfa.st curriculum forces users to read at speeds that push the upper limits of your comprehension and by constantly challenging you to push yourself faster; at the same time we use regular quizzes to ensure that you maintain your understanding of the text.""</i><p>What is the 'latest speed-reading curricula' you've based the site exercises on?  I have an interest but not expertise in this subject, would love to know more details.<p>Also...<p><i>""Ani, one of our co-founders, read at over 1,000 words per minute without any training. When we noticed how blazingly fast he was finishing books, we began to look into what makes people read at such vastly different speeds. We did extensive research into the scientific (and pseudo-scientific) literature around how people read, but the body of work is not very encouraging. Most speed-reading products make unverified and unverifiable claims about their effectiveness, and because of their SEO and sales interests, those specious claims overwhelm most legitimate discussion around speed-reading. One of our goals is for readfa.st to help us better understand the process of reading and what factors affect speed and comprehension.""</i><p>It would be both awesome in general and good marketing in particular if you elaborated on your findings.

It's possible to edit the registry to install the required driver, but that requires booting into Windows... a Catch-22 if ever there was one.<p>I was eager to see how the problem had been solved... but apparently Windows Vista and Windows 7 don't have that particular problem, and the IE6 VM (with Windows XP) just says ""IE6 support is currently disabled"".<p>That's kind of sad; at least for the light web-development I've done, IE7 and IE8 aren't nearly as fussy and hair-pulling as IE6.",1315019924.0

They can imagine whatever they want but the reality is that plugins support a lot of things that IE cannot do and Microsoft has not announced plans to support.,1315019912.0

VPSs, formerly the high-end option, are now the cheap stuff.<p>Exactly this.  I have been using shared hosting for around $100/yr, which was cheap 3 years ago when private servers were double or triple that.  But recently I bought a VPS for <i>$15/year</i>.  Sure, I have to do my own admin, but I'm fine with that.  If the cost for the shared hosting doesn't come down, I'm going to have to move everything to my VPS.",1315019732.0

The entire ecommerce world would be at Challenger-level rationalization, in essence, <i>""How do you know it will burn through the O-rings? Since we don't have enough evidence we can't shut it down!""</i><p>I think it's much more likely that lacking any evidence of widespread active fraud, ecommerce would simply go on as usual but with more trip wires to detect fraud and perhaps delayed payments to reduce the chance that money from fraudulent transactions would make its way to the bad guys. And of course, they'd switch out all the certs ASAP. It's a chance merchants and banks would be willing to take, I suspect, and sort out damages in court afterwards.",1315019607.0

Illustrates just how we're still living with the implications of just how the first extremely undemocratic reality of 'code as content'  first encapsulated in program devlopment, then going through a slight democratization route regarding computer usage through the Macintosh, and moving on through the html web  still is playing out.<p>One can at least see that the path-to-market of content has been democratized with the web over time and the App stores/'App paradigm' are also helpful in making it possible for more to program.<p>I think a big part of our dilemmas have had to do with how isolated and abstract programming and development have been compared to mainstream society. A <i>relative</i> 'mainstreaming' of programming is still an incredible thought  yet it is happening right now!<p>Whatever happens to our present jobs, I can't help but think that the infusion of new programming talent is about to create a new reality  a wave that could lift a great number of us  given appropriate channels for us all to contribute so much more than regular business logic programming - and us people practicing and getting ready to catch it!<p>(over the top eh? :)",1315019375.0
