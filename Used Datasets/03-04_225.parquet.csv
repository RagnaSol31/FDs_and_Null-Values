This isn't quite true, non-payment is often a bill-reducing tactic.\n:)<p>I'll answer your last question, and one someone else posted.  I simply don't have time at the moment to get into a protracted discussion right now, humorously due to dealing with lawsuits, so this will have to be my last real response.  I actually don't have a dog in this fight, even though i'm a corporate IP lawyer.  I actually also manage a team of software engineers, and spend most of my time on the legal front either dealing with open source licensing, or trying to put myself out of business by getting rid of software patents.<p>On the corporate side:<p>Money from these cases doesn't go to hiring more lawyers.  Ignoring NPEs and other weird cases, in most companies, the number of lawyers is fixed relative to the size of other things, like any support staff.\nFor example, i can name a huge tech company where lawyer headcount is limited to 1% of engineer headcount.<p>Until engineer headcount increases, winning or losing lawsuits has no impact on the number of lawyers being hired or paid. It does not make the lawyers more or less money.<p>Again, the above is common even in companies that derive large amounts of money from licensing (though i'm still excluding NPE's).\nThey are simply ""understaffed"" and deal with it.<p>Please also note that corporate lawyers nowadays often make less than equivalent engineers, unless you are talking about the very top folks.  People do corporate law because of better hours, not better money.<p>On the law firm side:<p>There are too many lawyers already.  The vast majority of lawyers coming out of law school right now cannot find jobs.\nVast majority being 70+%.\nIt's no longer economically worth being a lawyer, in the sense that the debt you incur is more than your expected increase in earnings.<p>For the first time in a long time, law schools and the ABA are actually starting to tell students it's not worth it, too.<p>A large number of firms are downsizing heavily, including IP firms.<p>This in turn, has caused two things to happen:<p>1. Good lawyers are looking for work, and willing to work cheap. <i>very</i> cheap.<p>2. Cheap fresh-out graduated law students are willing to work for basically nothing, because they have debt but no jobs.  ""Basically nothing"" = there are large numbers of fresh-outs from top schools willing to work for 20 bucks an hour.  No joke.<p>This, combined with outsourcing (which most find a hilarious thought), is <i>seriously</i> pushing down the hourly/etc price of lawyers.  The amount of <i>profit</i> you will now make in a trademark suit, even with a client like apple, is not that large, but the <i>expenses</i> haven't changed, because law firm structures haven't changed.

Frequently vm.overcommit_memory is set to disable malloc calls for more than the available amount of memory, which means the oom-killer never gets inolved.

There are Energy Star refrigerators that use only 34 watts averaged.[1]<p>>air conditioning units<p>This is certainly true for now. Over the long term, low power passive cooling can be surprisingly effective. Taking advantage of evaporation, diurnal temperature changes, ""wind chill"", thermal mass, phase changes, passive geothermal, and solar gain reduction have the potential to provide comparable comfort for a lot less energy.<p>A small personal anecdote: in college I had no AC, so I would circulate night air through my apartment ($15 fan + $5 timer). It reliably kept it 5-10 degrees cooler than it was outside, but doing nothing it was 5 degrees hotter. It cost $6/month, drawing 60 watts on average, even with a very inefficient motor.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?startNum=1&resultsperpage=20&fuseaction=refrig.search_products_submit&pd_code=RRF&configuration=Top%20Freezer&total_volume_pair=16%2E0%3A19%2E0&sortColumn=PB&sortColumn_order=DESC&layout=default&phase=search"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?startNum=1&resultspe...</a>",1351912523.0

It can bury you in games that aren't even remotely fun.  It can lead to ideological arguments that destroy friendships.

As a developer, the conclusion is to stick with Windows 7.  my observations are:<p>1. work and play don't mix.\nmetro is for play, desktop is for work. they don't mix.  I am consistently thinking about where things are. should I switch to metro or desktop for what I want to do.<p>2. desktop become handicapped.\nRemoving the ""start"" button is a mistake in my mind. I understand Microsoft want to emphasize the new ""starting place"" for windows is the new metro, but taking away start button means that I have to switch to metro and search for ""control panel"" to access it. To access visual studio.net? I have to switch to metro and search for ""visual studio"" and click the icon which switches me right back to desktop.  I'd perfect happy to spend all my time on desktop had they kept that start button.<p>3. Things looks different between IE9 and IE10\nand there is no quick fix if you are really aiming for pixel-perfect. It is a nightmare for me.<p>For a non-developer: a Metro only windows 8 would be very appealing\nFor a developer: a desktop only windows 8 is at least as good as windows 7 which is really good thing.<p>but mixing metro and desktop, I am afraid that it is just gonna slow me down.<p>What do you think of windows 8?",1351911895.0

We are talking about this arbitrary thing called ""the smartphone market"" but Apple doesn't really compete in ""the smartphone market"".  Apple competes in a tiny corner of ""the smartphone market"" called ""the $450+ smartphone market"".<p>I remember when Apple competed in a space called ""the $300+ music player market"".  And how it ""felt pretty much like PC vs Mac again"" when cheap mp3 players were taking market share.  And then Apple brought out a $250 music player and then a $200 music player and then a $100 music player etc.  Now Apple found a bigger market to play in then music players but I'm saying that I doubt there's a bigger market to play in then pocket computers with wireless broadband [1].   And Apple can keep having amazing success in that market by doing both (1) what they did in 2007 (make a much better pocket computer with wireless internet than what was currently in stores), and (2) what they did in the portable music player market (by continually addressing a larger share of that pie).<p>What's called the iphone in 5-10 years may look radically different, maybe it's Siri on steroids, maybe it's brain control, maybe it's holograms and haptics, maybe it's Kinect, maybe it's aug reality ala Glass, maybe it's smellovision...  But what's essential about that product is that it will replace the functions of the current smartphone.<p>If you're asking me if Apple can keep growing at it's current rate the answer is clearly that they can't long term (law of large numbers).  I do think Apple will enter other markets -- luxury watches, tv/console gaming, search and cloud services are the obvious areas.  I don't think they will make as much money in all of those put together as they will in the pocket computers with wireless broadband category though.<p>[1] There are bigger markets of course (cars, houses, health care, education, etc) and there will be bigger new markets (girl robots lol?) but none of them play to Apple's strengths.",1351911606.0
