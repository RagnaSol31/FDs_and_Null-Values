It's a bunch of discrete events that are built out of many, many nigh-identical repetitions of even <i>smaller</i> discrete events.<p>The other point to make is that baseball controls the combinatorial explosion by either having the players act in relative isolation (when fielders handle the ball) or by grouping them in tiny groups of two or three (pitcher, batter, and to some extent the catcher), one of whom is generally a constant in any given game (the catcher), and one of whom only changes a few times per game (the pitcher). This is a fairly restricted set of possible matchups, and these are replayed over and over to get better stats. That's why baseball is the statistician's dream.<p>Similarly, in basketball there are fairly few players on the floor, and they tend to match up with each other fairly predictably. And while American football puts 22 players on the field, most of them never touch the ball, and most of the remaining players do the same sort of job over and over in the same relatively small part of the field, interacting with the same small subset of players on the other team.<p>But soccer is all over the place. ;)",1274240912.0

At Fusion, we do our part to get our promotions in front of the right eyeballs. As well, by now the value of our brand can lend some credence to our customers.<p>Unfortunately, we sometimes get a client who thinks that just by getting some exposure on a network like ours or in an app like Tweetie, sales will sky rocket. But for that to happen, some thought and hard work also have to go into the promotion.<p>We can help an advertiser get the traffic, but if the product/service is low quality, conversions will be low. We do our best to filter out the bad and only promote the good stuff, products we believe in or use ourselves, but reality is that the occasional lemon gets in the door.<p>Advertising with Fusion will help with your brand awareness, but because so many of our customers our smaller one/two man shops — which we love — we care about conversions as well.

I told them I paid it, she said it wasn't and said it was going on my report unless I paid that day.  Luckily I paid by check and my bank (like all banks I guess now) keeps canceled checks online for pretty much ever.  So now I had to go back 6 months and find this check then call the apartment then the collections agency, etc...
