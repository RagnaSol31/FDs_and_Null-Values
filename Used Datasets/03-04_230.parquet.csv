That's ""just another formal modeling tool"" and isn't particularly likely to lead to a revolution in programming of any sort anymore than any other formal modeling tool that formally models the ""same old"" programming techniques the author decries.<p>I was tempted to link <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Zippers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Zippers</a> , and now I guess I have, as another sort of ""thing that happens to share terminology with calculus"", but it is equally offtopic. Calculus here is metaphorically the same calculus that you looked ahead to when you were in middle school; a mysterious land where the impossible is trivial and full of strange concepts and funny squiggles. We are that middle schooler.<p>Really, though, it's fair to read this essay as ""Gosh, I sure wish a silver bullet existed"" and stretching only a bit further ""If only there were some way to get around the fact it takes great programmers to make great programs"". The silver bullet is that metaphorical calculus here, but it's a call for a silver bullet all the same. We can all nod in recognition of the desire, even as we are fairly sure nothing more will come of this than any other desire for the silver bullet.",1278388742.0

Soon after, Kurt Godel demonstrated that in any given formal system, consistency and completeness were mutually exclusive.<p>It seems to me that this had the same devastating impact on philosophy as Einstein's relativistic theorems did on classical mechanics and the popular acceptance of scientific determinism (please note I am not positing any scientific relationship between Godel's theorem and Einstein's work on relativity). Einstein apparently found quantum mechanics an equally alarming intellectual innovation.<p>So between incompleteness, relativity and QM, 20th century intellectuals were hit with a kind of triple whammy showing that our beliefs about logic, observation and causality were all inherently limited and that in many respects The Truth is fundamentally unknowable.

The issue is whether we (can) classify <i>truth</i> as an essential quality of a statement, or as a description of a statement from a particular perspective.<p>To make an analogy that dawkins would surely crucify me for, it's like the difference between the notion of absolute time, and time as described by Einstein's relativity.

When the price is right, I'm very happy to use a service like this, despite the DRM.  The user experience beats anything else out there, including going to the local mall and buying a game boxed.<p>The key is the price though.  With Steam games, I lose the ability to sell the game on after I'm finished it, and publishers of all kinds (music, movies, ebooks, videogames) need to understand that I'm not going to pay them the same (or more) for something that doesn't give me the same rights as the physical media.<p>The policy of certain publishers to charge considerably more for the same game in different regions (in my case Australia - see e.g. the price of Mass Effect 2 in Aus here: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/clwk1/steam_final_day_borderlands_sid_meiers/c0ti2lt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/clwk1/steam_final_da...</a>) is also something I'm not going to tolerate.  I didn't buy <i>any</i> of the games in the Steam sale that were priced higher in this country, so those publishers lost out.<p>I presume that this is due to the way publishing rights are apportioned internationally, and I've seen similar problems afflict other media (particularly ebooks, where the availability of a particular Kindle title varies a lot depending on whether you're in the UK, US or Aus).  Again, publishers need to understand that consumers really couldn't give a toss about this sort of thing: we just want to buy their product, not have to worry about some international publishing agreement bullshit.  If somebody can't buy something on Amazon/Steam/iTunes/whatever in their region, that's driving them towards the pirates, not towards the locally-published version.",1278385926.0

At any rate most of the original white settlers in the south, Georgia especially, were subjects of ""transportation"" and subject to seven years of indentured servitude, or were Scotts-Irish recruited to be frontier settlers. Only a relative handful of ruling-class whites could afford nannies. And those families, the Washingtons and Lees for instance, were descended from landed aristocracy back in England who were on the losing side of the English Civil War. Take away the minority plantation owning families and the average white household at best could afford one, maybe two slaves as full-time field hands. Still, west African dialects probably did make their mark on southern dialects.",1278385504.0
