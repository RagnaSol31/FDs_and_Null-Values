Depending on what source you believe English text has about 0.6 to 2.3 bits of entropy per character. This means you need somewhere between 4.7 and 18.3 characters in each word to reach 11 bits of entropy per word.\nAssuming entropy is closer to 2 bits per character this is a realistic situation. However, when you assume entropy is closer to 1 bit per character the words have to be too long to be realistic.",1313121568.0

The money is in the medicine, not the cure.<p>I'm generalizing, but It seems as if institutions who have made a living researching treatments to major diseases don't seem that interested in cures.

Good speculation smooths out price fluctuations to the point that bad speculators receive nothing, while good speculators receive all the alpha. This is true not only of HFT, but of any good strategy.<p><i>...claims of HFT value are heavily undermined by their tendency to drop out of the market during crashes.</i><p>If you don't want HFT and other speculators to drop out of the market during crashes, don't break trades after the fact.<p>During a crash, most HFT's should make money hand over fist. But if the market centers break trades, HFT's are in danger of stabilizing the market and being heavily penalized for it.<p>I.e., if an HFT pushes accenture up from $0.05 to $1.00 and sells at $35, following which accenture eventually goes up to $40, they run the risk of having their $1.00 buy trade broken. Then they are stuck with a short sale at $35, while the price of accenture went up to $40.",1313121499.0

How do you know when to stop?<p>So here's what I got: figure I have a bias to switch keys. That means that 01 and 10 are more common than 11 and 00. So what I need to do is group 01 with 00, and 10 with 11. What I do is generate twice as many bits as I need, treat the string as a sequence of two-bit pairs, and reduce each one to its first bit.\nThat looks like this: 01011110000010111000010011111011111111000000111010110001111000111100111100001100011010011101<p>Gets you past the litmus test, but looks like it goes too far the other way? Hard for me to tell, actually.<p>Another thing would be something like a sequential xor of each bit in triples (i.e. 010 -> (0 ^ 1) ^ 0 = 1), which segments triples across probability like so:<p><pre><code>     -       +           +       -\n    000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111\n      0   1   1   0   1   0   0   1\n   </code></pre>\nYou can do that quickly by counting the 1s— 1 or 3 is 1, 0 or 2 is 0.\nThat looks like this:\n00011011011011000000111111001011000101010000100100110011011010<p>I don't know if it adds much more (apparent) entropy, though.<p>Data:<p><pre><code>    011101101010100100010100100010111001010100110000101011101101110\n     0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n      0  0  0  1  1  0  1  1  0  1  1  0  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  1\n\n    111010111010100101000101011110100011011011010001111011110101001\n     1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n      1  1  1  1  1  0  0  1  0  1  1  0  0  0  1  0  1  0  1  0  0\n\n    101110100101101010110101010001101101010010110111010110101001110\n     1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1\n      0  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  1  1  0  0  1  1  0  1  1  0  0  1  0</code></pre>",1313119810.0
