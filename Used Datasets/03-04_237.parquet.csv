In a purely resistive circuit, current and voltage vary exactly the same way at every instant.<p>You can actually go a long way with this just by understanding that, e.g., for an inductor,<p>V = L dI/dt<p>so that small current changes will imply very large voltage changes.  If you're in to intuition, this means ""voltage leads current"" (i.e., the sinusoid of voltage is 90 degrees ahead of the sinusoid of current).<p>The above equation is also why lights in your house dim when you turn on a motor (= inductor).  There is a significant current change, and the voltage changes even more, so the lights dim.<p>Or, you can be even more intuitive, and note that it's obvious that when you put a coil of wire (= motor = inductor) across the two sides of your house's electrical wiring, the coil of wire will pull the + and - conductors together in voltage at first.  Until the magnetic field sets up to provide reactance, the coil of wire is basically a short circuit.<p>And finally, a capacitor is just the dual of the inductor.",1309059895.0

As you accumulate failures, your motivation flags and your desire to quit increases. Now, this might meant that you're about to make a breakthrough that will turn your business into the next Google. It also might mean that you're bashing your head into a brick wall and you need to pivot in order to become successful. Your desire to quit gives you no information as to what your strategy should be, and, therefore, is totally useless as a decision-making strategy.<p>tl;dr; Your desire to quit is also greatest right before you go totally bankrupt and wreck your life.",1309058124.0

63,2697270,comment,2696283.0,2696811.0,12,0,pfedor,,,"It is a commonly used argument that the lives of poor people are very hard and unpleasant and that dealing with the hardships sucks out all their energy and brings down their spirits so they can't take advantage of all the opportunities that middle-class people have to improve their situation.<p>The problem I see with this reasoning is that if you consider the entire range of standards of living which people had throughout history and geography, with maybe middle-age European peasants on one end and say Larry Ellison on the other, then on this scale, the standard of living of contemporary American poor is very close to the standard of living of the reasonably well off.  From the point of view say anyone in communist Poland, as well as at least a billion people living today, what you call poverty would seem like mind-blowing opulence.  On the other hand, I rather suspect that for anyone featured in The Real Housewives of New York, the lot of doctors and software engineers and struggling janitors alike must seem like horrifying wage slavery.<p>So, to claim that there exists a standard of living threshold, and that below this threshold life is objectively hard, whereas above this threshold it's easy, and that it so happens that the line lies between the poor and the middle class in contemporary America, you have to believe that we're looking at a very unique time and place.   Of all the possible values that the threshold could potentially have, what are the odds that it would actually fall within this narrow range you're looking at?  A hundred or maybe even fifty years ago in the US (and much more recently in many countries around the world), almost everyone's standard of living was way below that of contemporary poor.  Do you think all these people were equally as incapacitated by the harshness of their lives, unable to make rational decisions and work to improve their lives?  If the civilization does not collapse for one reason or another, chances are in fifty years time even the poor will have the standard of living as good as wealthy people have now.  Do you think the poor of the future will not suffer from this ten-people-in-a-room-screaming effect?",1309057953.0

Its a social web application. Me and my co-founder are really good friends, we started working on this idea, just after college. We had couple of good offers to join, but we decided to do our own startup. Weve read all the essay's of PG, we have the hackers attitude. Weve worked our asses off, we got one funding offer as well, but that was too low to do anything, we are based out of India. Weve all the latest technology stack, djang/jquery/orbited/apachemq and all. Weve learned a lot of things during these 10 months, Ive became a different person altogether, from a college kid to an entrepreneur, have came a long way.<p>Coding, testing, deploying, releasing, going to the crowd, iterating, we have learned this all. Ive worked upon everything, from django to UI/UX, making banners to videos, PR to marketing, support to sales, everything. Its been a wonderful life so far. I wouldnt have learned all these things, had it been a regular job after college. I am so grateful for myself and my co-founder for letting me work on all these, all these months.<p>Its been an emotional roller coaster ride too, many many strange, weird, unimaginable things happened too. We started with very small amount in hand, it was the worst decision among all others. Money started to become a problem of us. But we managed somehow.<p>The story has many twists as well, 3 months back, both of us lost our laptops, yes both of us. It was a painful time. It took us well two weeks to recover from that. We met with so called startup mentors of India, listened all the bad things one could listen, we iterated our product, pivoted again, but its a social app, it takes time to take off. Especially, if you are in India ( nothing that I am complaining). We have all the patience an entrepreneur can have. We got covered in national newspapers as well, but nothing big has happened so far.<p>Its been 10 months. We have simplified our product, removed almost all features, weve worked on the design, very hard, its come out good now.<p>Lessons that we have learned is, social web app is a saturated market, you are compared with facebook, even if you dont want, everything can be done by making a facebook app or whatever and you need a lot of good people/networking into the tech world to really get them off the ground. We lack it.<p>Final words, we are not doing good. We are in good state of mind, have taken all the positive things from it, me and my co-founder has a great co-ordination, its just that we didnt pick the right idea or we were too young then. Now, we are at the point that we want to take some decision, whether to move on, do something else or to stick on it for some more time.<p>Personally, I am thinking of working at a startup in SV. The biggest thing I lack is exposure, contacts and the experience of working in a real startup environment. I am not really sure, if that is even possible. But I really want to make things move fast from here on.<p>I need advice from fellow hackers.",1309057726.0
