That kind of homage is patronizing by default. We don’t have a Jew filesystem or a Tutsi browser, however flattering they might be the minds of the founders.<p>I think it’s mostly irrelevant that Gimp is an acronym. As an extreme case, if the initials of my descriptively named project happen to spell the N-word, people would be right to question my taste if I ran with it. Obviously “Apache” is not the same as the N-word, but you can see the point. It doesn’t matter if the connotations in my mind are only wholesome: I’m assigning to symbols that are already bound in outer contexts, and that’s dangerous in human culture.<p>I’m not trying to be the political correctness police here. It’s not my job to get angry on other people’s behalf – I’m not Apache or physically disabled. But I would think very hard before calling a project anything like Apache or Gimp, and to me they seem at least as bad as Diaspora.<p>Anyway, I do see how a reasonable person could hold your position.",1273636606.0

It's kind of an interesting ethical question actually.<p>Personally it just feels wrong in some hard to define way to algorithmically determine the other sides maximum/minimum price through some process they don't have access to. I can certainly understand why you would do it but it just doesn't feel quite right.<p>I don't think I have an ethical problem with using small orders to sound out the other party. Where it tips over into being unethical for me is if those exploratory orders are cancelled rather than fulfilled.

Hydrostatic pressure is essentially only a function of depth: P = rho.g.h. Think about the design of a damn, it needs to be much thicker at the bottom due to higher pressures. You can experiment (or thought experiment) with two cups of water and a tube on the same level. Fill one cup and fill the tube.
