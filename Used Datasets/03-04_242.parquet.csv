15,3556113,comment,3555927.0,3555927.0,14,0,physcab,,,"I'm an analyst for a gaming company too, so let me offer my perspective.  I consider myself to be an ethical, non-creepy person, and I disagree with what this person says.<p>Yes, gaming companies are extremely data-driven and they measure everything they can.  I'm in charge of dashboards that have over 300 KPI's (key performance indicators) on them.  What do we measure?  A whole lot of shit. ARPU, ARPPU, HC (hard currency) spend/gained, SC (soft currency) gained/spend, Retention, DAU, Spend DAU, Gained DAU, Downloads, Activations, plus funnels for every page, every user action you can think of.<p>Do I think measuring all this is creepy? No. Why? Because when I come in the morning, I look at my stats. I'll be able to tell within an hour if the build the engineers shipped the night before had a bug that affected 30% of our users in a certain location. I'll then report this to the Engineering team, they can create a hotfix, and users can be happy again. Engineers are happy knowing that we have actual data to validate and confirm their gameplay suggestions (made during scrum/sprint planning sessions).  I also report monetization metrics to the VP's. They want to know if the boatloads of money they are spending on user acquisition are actually paying off.  And the PM's want to know if users are playing the game, or how far they get into the game.<p>Yes, we maximize for users who spend over $10k. These users even have names. They're called ""whales"" in industry parlance.  Why wouldn't you want more of them in your game? This is a business afterall.  I feel just as bad as the next person wondering whether some of these ""whales"" are addicts. I don't want to be creating products for addicts.  But what if these users are just rich people who have tons of money to spend off the cuff? There's no way we can know because we never get that data. All I see is what's reported in ItunesConnect.<p>Do we ever record any personally identifiable information? No. Do we ever sell or distribute this data to outside parties? No. Can any of this data ever be used maliciously? No.<p>Personally, I like the way game companies work (hence why I work in the industry).  It teaches you to measure everything. You make decisions quickly. And no one can argue with the facts.  You'll know real fast whether the product is shitty and you can do an about-face, gather the troops, and push out something new.",1328500297.0

My wife is a high school teacher, and amongst her department everyone knows who is good and who isn't, same as any job. The only difference is that that knowledge can't possible have any effect on your career.<p>In any case, the point you are making about standardized testing is completely beside the point. No one who advocates using testing advocates using only testing for teacher evaluation. And no one advocates using the raw scores. Of course teachers with poor students in bad schools will have worse raw scores then teachers with rich students in good schools.
