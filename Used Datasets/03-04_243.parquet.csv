You can basically take any text editor and do a standard 'write->compile->run'.  However, most people that are familiar with Lisp, prefer a more interactive development environment that allows you to make changes to a running app.  Probably the most powerful environment for doing this is SLIME in Emacs.  As a result this is what is mentioned the most.  I think this tends to scare people off.<p>I don't know why the Enclojure plugin for Netbeans isn't mentioned more.  It provides an interactive development environment for Clojure in package that is much easier to digest for anyone who is familiar with an IDE.",1278129411.0

Google's Web UI Engineer interviews do ask for C++/Java knowledge, how to design a programming language, and Big-O notation, for example.  And then people complain about how Google's interviews have nothing to do with reality.<p>The thing is - they do.  Everything I was tested on in my interview was pretty analogous to something I've faced in my job.  If you don't know your server's language, how will you write code that interfaces with the client-side software you're writing?  If you don't know how to design programming languages, how do you evaluate various templating systems on the server side or JS libraries on the client side?  If you don't know Big-O notation, what'll you choose when faced with the choice of attaching event handlers to each child in a DOM tree vs. using event bubbling and dispatching on the particular target?  (Never mind that most Google interview candidates don't know about event bubbling in the first place and wouldn't be able to write a tree-walk if their job depended upon it.)<p>I'm a web UI engineer.  My last two days at work were spent writing a JIT with LLVM for a templating language.  Google Wave is all based on implementing operational transforms (a grad-level CS concept) in JavaScript.  Maps has a fair share of computer-graphics concepts embedded in it.<p>You don't need to understand CS to do a web UI, but that limits you to the same type of web UIs that other people have already done.  Pulling JQuery or Prototype snippets off the web and sticking them together.  There's a whole other level of performance and flexibility you get by understanding the fundamentals, which most web developers completely ignore, and then they wonder why they don't need CS concepts.",1278127701.0

Does this income gap help the leaders to feel comfortable setting up policies that hurt the people at the bottom?""<p>An alternative hypothesis: Higher compensation can instill a sense of pressure that makes a person more on edge, stressed, and curt with people, regardless if you're an engineer or a manager or something else.<p>I've got anecdotes both ways, but generally speaking, whenever I've been working on something with lots of pressure or higher compensation, I've noticed myself being unintentionally more on edge and a little shorter with people. The best example I can think of off the top of my head - I spoke at a few conferences from I think '06 to '08. I always tried to be really nice to all the staffers and volunteers there, assistants, everyone making it happen. I remember how when someone who was slightly important was nice to me I always remembered that and felt good, and made a big effort to do so.<p>Largest conference I ever spoke at my hands were shaking <i>bad</i> before I went to speak. Actually, my hands regularly shook before public speaking, I broke a water glass like this once. But this time it was <i>bad</i>. Someone came to chat with me, and I just said, ""N-n-n-not now. Sorry. Later. Maybe later."" I tried to mumble out something about having the shakes but it didn't come across really well.<p>Now I'm comfortable admitting I've got the shakes before speaking and I fight through it by acknowledging it and fighting through it. But how many people push that inwards? The result comes out, you get shorter with people.<p>So I think the author came in with a perceived notion - executive compensation might lead to meanness. Then she picked metrics that would indicate an atmosphere of intense pressure and labeled these signs of ""meanness"" - whereas maybe cause and effect runs the other way? Maybe people under pressure are more curt and ""mean""?<p>Now, I might not want to work somewhere like that. Or, if that place did produce the best results and offered me the best mix of compensation, advancement, travel, and furthering my other goals - well, maybe I would want to work there for a little while. The more interesting question to me is how effective these cultures are at accomplishing their goals - I wouldn't mind spending time in a pressure cooker for a while if it furthered my goals. (But then, it might not - but it'd be interesting to see some results; I'm going to go off on a limb and guess Apple has a more intense culture than Yahoo, for instance, but also much more prestige and opportunity these days)",1278127194.0
