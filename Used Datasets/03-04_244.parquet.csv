The cost for a qualified IP contract attorney to do an adequate document review of this document and explain its consequences to a typical member of the public that it is imposed upon would be more than $1000 per review. That would be necessary to enable informed signing.<p>We need laws getting this under control. These contracts should not be binding. The consumer side has no chance of understanding them even when they do read the documents. That means there is no real consent and no real moral contract. If companies insist on these extremely complex contracts for routine transactions, the companies should pay the full cost of legal representation for the other party.",1304827044.0

Google power users only. And Google would have an algorithm being modified to suit your interests.

And how do you do that if the user can't tell what he/she wants.

I'm concerned about the ""late bloomers.""  I want a system in place that will help them realize their potential.  There are plenty of authors who are now considered iconic, who had very rough starts and only realized their potential because someone in the publishing industry spent a lot of time and money helping them develop.  Frank Herbert is a prime example of this.  Despite all of the mentoring he got from experienced editors, he certainly broke a lot of new ground, so I'm really not all that concerned that ""unleashing experienced editors on new authors probably reduces variability in writing.""  Mentoring is all about helping other people develop, and part of being a good mentor is understanding that you're there to facilitate growth, not direct it.  We might get a little bit more uniformity from having editors mentor new writers, but I think that's far better than losing great works because they are never written when new authors have no choice but to jump right in to the sink-or-swim world of self-publishing.<p>Consider an author who has great potential, who will, given enough development, write bestselling novels.  Unfortunately, he's still too inexperienced and his current work could be described at best as mediocre.\nIf he tries to self-publish, his books will be (rightfully) criticized as being not worth reading.  He will not make any money, and will likely be forced to give up writing and take up another profession.  If he is especially persistent he might try again, but without a mentor his skills won't improve very quickly, and even if they did he still has to fight against his well-earned reputation as a second-rate hack.\nOn the other hand, if he sends his work to a traditional publisher, there is a chance that someone will see the potential in his work, pay him for the book, and work with him to improve it to the point where people will want to read it.  Then he'll get a crack at a second book, and the help he needs to make it better than his first.  In this way, he has a chance to grow into a truly great author.<p>As long as there are publishers who are able to successfully identify and develop such diamonds in the rough, and unless someone comes up with a different way to perform this task, the traditional publishers will not go away.  Even if they lose all of the authors who are good enough to jump right into self-publishing, that still leaves them with a significant role in the market, growing great authors.<p>I strongly suggest that you check out <i>Baen's Universe</i>: all of the issues are electronic and DRM free, and since publication has ceased, you can buy every issue ever for $30 (+ $6 for the very last issue).  Every issue has at least one (usually more) article about the publishing industry, usually focused on copyright and DRM.  The first issue includes an article explaining why the magazine was started, and it was to provide exactly the sort of development opportunities to new authors that I've been talking about here:\n<a href=""http://www.baens-universe.com/articles/editorial_one"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.baens-universe.com/articles/editorial_one</a>\nThe last issue includes an article explaining why publication was ended (in short, the magazine had served its purpose):\n<a href=""http://www.baens-universe.com/articles/So_Long__and_Thanks_For_All_the_Fish"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.baens-universe.com/articles/So_Long__and_Thanks_F...</a>",1304824796.0

75,2525147,comment,2523758.0,2524401.0,0,0,rdtsc,,,"I guess ""blocking"" is overloaded here.  To me it refers to the process of performing IO, but you think about process states from the point of view of the scheduler (as in RUNNING state vs BLOCKING (or IOWAIT)).<p>Yes, if aio_* system was never invented, we wouldn't be arguing, but because it exists it introduces a new possible way of doing IO. It is a general enough way of doing IO and at hardware level we have DMA but in the land of syscalls we have aio_<i>.<p>Ok, just curious, what words would you use to describe what aio_</i> calls do?<p>Over the years many have thought of a way to bring that style of IO to networking. So far it works for disk IO very well. For example take a look at this benchmark from lighttpd for a sendfile:<p><a href=""http://blog.lighttpd.net/articles/2006/11/09/async-io-on-linux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.lighttpd.net/articles/2006/11/09/async-io-on-lin...</a><p>It looks like there is a consistent 50% improvement in speed when using aio with a 1MB block.<p>Wouldn't it be nice to have that kind of improvement for network sockets as well? I think it would be and there have been many attempts over the years but nothing good yet has happened.",1304824391.0

But when it's not documents you're talking about but companies offering probably identical flowers for probably similar prices it's hard the make the argument that one is more 'relevant' than another.<p>I honestly think Google should start a different 'business' section of the search engine that plays by different rules.
