Pronunciation will shift, elisions and contractions are going to happen, and the perfect match between orthography and pronunciation will evaporate. Sure, you can adjust the spelling to keep up, but whose dialect is the &quot;real&quot; one? Irregularities will creep in. There will be a tendency to push and pull the word order (and long lists of conjugation and declension affixes that may overcome word order difficulties would be a barrier to use). Oh, yeah: about word order... whose do you use? SVO is common among creoles, but that has as much to do with the vocabulary source languages as anything else (even if it can be argued that SVO is the least marked case).
