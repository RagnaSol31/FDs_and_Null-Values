Make extrapolations as necessary.<p>Remember your first year (or two?) of development?  Looking back, you were probably way in over your head, had mentors looking after you, making tons of mistakes etc.<p>Fast forward 5 years.  Can you write code faster? Probably not. Can you write better code? Sometimes.  It's all about experiences and learning from them.  When you take a new job, or a new project, or a new anything, you call upon past experiences to guide the efforts of this process.  It might be something as vague as ""I am going to write tests first because I found it helped me earlier"", or (ignoring TDD), ""I'm not going to write this function like this, because I know the code will be hard to test when I get around to writing a test for it later""<p>You learn this all from experience.  Senior people who have been in the field longer have more experience.  They aren't ""better"" in the sense that they are smarter or have more intelligence, they just know MORE because they've been exposed to more.<p>It's also why so many people (especially in hacker news) have been successful without degrees.
