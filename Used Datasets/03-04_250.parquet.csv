43,4768680,comment,4765067.0,4765067.0,2,0,klibertp,,,"This is my third time reading this article; this time I stopped reading after a few paragraphs, but still skimmed it to refresh some things in memory. This is very good article, and one I would recommend to anyone to read, were it not for it's length - these days I guess half of the responses would be ""tl;dr"", sadly.<p>It's one of the articles that convinced me to take a look at Lisp a few years back, among others, which caused me to learn Scheme rather than Common Lisp or Emacs Lisp (I think Clojure was not around then yet). I invested half a year time to learn PLT Scheme/Racket and felt enlightened quite a few times along the way. First class continuations were the most mind blowing thing and I spent a few weeks trying to understand them. To prove to myself that I know what call/cc (or rather - it's delimited brethren) is all about I wrote python-style generators using them and this was one of the most rewarding experiences in programming for me.<p>Then I moved on, to Erlang IIRC, which was much easier to understand and use after being exposed to Scheme. In the following years I learned many more languages, all the while aiming for ""purity"" of the concepts and knowing full well that I won't be able to use any of them in real world. Many programmers would call Smalltalk a toy language - at best - but I had great time learning it and expanding my views on OOP, for example. I thought that the compromises that widely used languages make cause these languages to represent only a piece of what is possible, even if they are called ""multi-paradigm"", and wanted to explore more.<p>All this time I was writing commercial software in Python; I can't say if other languages I learned made me a better programmer - from the business perspective - but some really helped me expand my understanding of what I do. Forth and Lisp and Smalltalk did this and I was perfectly happy with stopping to use any of them after gaining some ""enlightenment"". They were not practical, not made for real world, they were there just to prove and demonstrate some kind of point, perspective.<p>This past week I couldn't work due to health problems and suddenly, after a few years of almost continuous work, I found myself bored. I thought, hell, why not? and went to reimplement a tiny bit of what I was working on earlier. I did this using Racket, my first ""esoteric"" language, so I had quite some things to relearn (good thing, too, because the language evolved in the meantime), but I finally (8 hours or so, in one go... they tell me it's <i>not</i> healthy to do this when you're ill, but it was fun) did it.<p>And it worked. And looked great. It was much shorter, more elegant and performant than Python. Certainly, half (or more) of this improvement came from me implementing the same thing the second time; but still, I was amazed at how easy and fun that was.<p>So the next day I decided to create another piece of code in Racket, this time a fresh one, which output would go straight into the larger system at work. It's good I had a task at hand which could be broken into pieces that small. And again, it worked, I did it in about the same time I would do this in Python, despite the lack of ""concurrent.futures"" or even thread-safe queue in Racket. I didn't use continuations or any other obscure features; just higher order functions and a few macros here and there to simplify error handling and such and some conveniences over pairs and lists.<p>I'm not sure what should I think about this situation. It's not a ""proof of suitability"" for the real world, of course - I'd need to write much more code to even begin to be able to claim that Racket is ok to use at work. But on the other hand I felt   bad for ignoring really good language and environment for such a long time. I should have been trying to use it more and more often and I didn't because I thought it's not meant for that.<p>But above all, it was fun. Not because I was learning new stuff, like the first time, but because the language made it fun. And, what's almost as important, it worked - I have the code that does what it should be doing.<p>Well, I plan to try using Racket much more often from now on... Maybe someone else will give some Lisp a chance after reading this :)",1352604579.0

66,4768655,story,,,1,1,logizec,My quest for a reddit iPhone app,,"	I have started using Reddit a lot more than I did a year ago. Im a new kind of browser, and I like to explore multiple subreddits. While on the go, I tend to just browse the front page to see where all the karma gloriously rained down upon. While Im on the go, I tend to not make many posts..simply browse. However, when I find something that I like while using pulse, I tend to share it with Reddit. Only one problem : iReddit wants $1.99 for me to gain the posting ability. I felt that I shouldnt have to pay for a Reddit app, and started looking elsewhere.<p>I downloaded Alien Blue, and I found it dull. I had to buy a $1.99 feature pack for posting, and discarded it immediately. I was scrolling through the apps (thanks Apple for making it take longer), when I stumbled across an app called Karma. As soon as Karma downloaded, I found a way to add my account. I was easily able to view my subreddits, create subredditsand the best thing of all? The ability to post.  Karma is a good basic app, especially for what you get for free. I think with some polishing and just making the app run a bit smoother (and look better), this could be a really good app. For now, ill enjoy my posting abilities.",1352603453.0

The other way is to do optimistic lock (or conditional update) to allow the client to detect change during the time and retry with the new value.",1352603418.0
