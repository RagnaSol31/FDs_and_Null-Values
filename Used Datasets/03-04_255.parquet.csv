Honest helpers, however, specialize in helping.

Hence your life stops being full of unimportant things, as ultimately they're all equally significant (or insignificant).<p>After that, my thinking usually goes the following order: 1) Why do anything at all in such circumstances, life has no point, etc. 2) Wait, I still might as well enjoy the process.<p>For some reason, the latter normally looks superior (if I'm in good shape), so I'm trying to learn to enjoy the process.

No, Facebook is still up sir, well call and find out why your ISP has gone down.<p>You will calmly and professionally deal with the idiot who deleted his files (again) and remind them that no, you are not alone, other people do empty their deleted items then want it back.\nWere not asking you to design the next billion dollar system but youre supporting our small business customers so youre going to provide outstanding support for their crisis of the day.\nWe cant pay huge sums right now, but we do have an excellent selection of snacks, as long as you save some for the rest of us we really dont mind.  If the customer is in a real jam and you cant possibly talk them down over the phone then occasional travel to the customer site is necessary. We do reimburse travel expenses and you will definitely need more than a bike because we cover wide area from our office and lets face it, public transportation just isnt what it used to be.<p>Certainly you need to know the criteria for this job and were pretty flexible. Obviously computer knowledge is a must. Were a Microsoft shop so the more skills you have with Word, Excel, PowerPoint and the whole office suite the better. If you have the ability to design SharePoint sites then you will get the special snacks. Any certifications like MCSE, CCNE or EIEIO will definitely be a big bonus. Please detail your entire computer history from ENIAC forward. If youve built your own home computer network in your basement, please include a diagram.<p>Hopefully you can tell by this that we have fun, but we take our business seriously. We provide outstanding service for our customers. If you are totally absorbed into computers then we provide the ultimate in work life (always connected) balance. All kidding aside, it is important to unplug from the Matrix from time to time.",1321067858.0

Understanding ethnocentrism was one of the fundamental teachings from PSYOP and enlightened me in ways like nothing else.<p>Codeslush's words ring true and reflect what I would say regarding another poster's comments about capitalizing on skills.  The Army allowed me to capitalize on life.  My sacrifices were miniscule for what I think I gained with my service.  \nWe are fortunate that military service today in the U.S. is voluntary and as such is a very personal choice that is often misunderstood by many (even friends and family).<p>Be a generalist and open to any opportunity.  If you are good at what you do and are dependable you'll make great connections with all ranks whether their enlisted or officer(commissioned/non-commissioned or warrant).  And if you really excel there will be plenty of opportunities to work directly for (and yes with) O-6s and higher and see an entirely different military. If you're able and willing, the world by way of the military can be simply amazing.<p>I have always been a techie and still remember being playfully bashed for carrying around my Sharp 286 laptop after rotation back to staging at Hohenfels in Germany.

Wanting to try it out, I dove in and dropped $200 on an Intuos 4 small. Combined with a Das Ultimate Silent, I have a desktop input system that rivals pretty much anything. Using a stylus for desktop computing lets you move things around with rapid speed and precision since the cursor maps directly to what your arm is doing. Scrolling involves a tiny bit more work (although the Intuos has a scroll wheel that works decently well). Another neat thing is the ability to instantly open MyPaint and jot down notes when I need it. It doesn't hurt that my entire desk is jet black :).<p>Going from a stylus back to a touchpad feels like going from pens to finger paint. Mice feel clunky as well. Try it out!",1321067270.0
