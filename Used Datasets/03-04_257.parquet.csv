I guess I was naive, but I believed that Strafor was more like a news agency, and they would do their best work to uncover information, analyze breaking situations, and supply information to its members.<p>However, from reading the news release from Wikileaks, I get the vague sense that maybe Stratfor was gathering a lot more information than I thought, using it to their advantage, and then throwing a bone to its subscribers every now and then, just enough to keep them subscribing and generating income.<p>It certainly seems like there's a lot more going under the covers than I anticipated.  The comment about ""Control means financial, sexual or psychological control... This is intended to start our conversation on your next phase."" makes it seem like Friedman is more than willing to make anyone their pawns, including subscribers.<p>Also, the idea of their StratCap Fund really kind of makes me question exactly what they are.  I thought their motivations were really about analysis and information, but I kind of don't believe that now.  At first, I didn't think the emails themselves were important, but now I'm definitely going to be keeping a close eye on whatever gets turned up from this point on.",1330315162.0

Let's give them the benefit of a doubt.</i><p>You don't seem to be aware of just how disastrous a bad hiring decision can be.  The direct financial cost is easily in the tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on how long it takes to identify their poor performance, warn them, and finally fire them (all the while documenting their performance rigorously to avoid frivolous lawsuits later on).  Beyond that, the opportunity cost of having a poor programmer in place of an excellent one is even worse.  It is far, far better to avoid a bad hire in the first place than to catch them later.<p>> <i>Your argument seems to be that there are only two possible programmers: effective designers that are slow to code or fast coders that are bad designers (designer in terms of code architecture, not graphic design, of course).</i><p>I'm sorry, but you wrote a lengthy rebuttal to an argument I never made.  Read my comment again.  When describing the ""10x"" programmer, I never said that they <i>had</i> to be a slow coder.  In fact, I explicitly said they ""may be"" lightning fast.  My actual argument was merely that the most dramatic improvements in software construction speed are due to making better decisions about what to code, what tools to use, how to approach the problem, etc.  And, in my opinion, the benefits of making good decisions about these things absolutely dwarf the benefits of being able to slam out the code in record time.",1330314441.0

If enough people are interested in doing that, businesses will appear to help the less technically literate do it as well, just as there are numerous businesses today that will make you a web site, register you a domain, and host everything on their servers but otherwise under your control.<p>Unless that starts happening, all the big video sites (not that there are many of them in the grand scheme of things) can impose more or less any terms they want, including claiming all kinds of rights to use any content you upload and not giving any guarantee that they will continue to host it or that they will not modify/corrupt/ad-splatter it.",1330312877.0

Let's give them the benefit of a doubt.<p>Your argument seems to be that there are only two possible programmers: effective designers that are slow to code or fast coders that are bad designers (designer in terms of code architecture, not graphic design, of course).<p>I claim that there are no good architects that are slow coders i.e. all good architects are also good coders.<p>When you look into research of skill acquisition, or even common sense, in order to become good at something you first have to master the basics before you master higher-level skills.<p>In the field of programming, being able to implement a piece of highly constrained code are the basics of our craft.<p>Once you're really good at that, people move up to tasks that have less constrains and are therefore high-level: choosing an implementation language, designing how pieces of the whole app fit together etc.<p>But you won't ever get to do that if you were not able to quickly and confidently implement a function that someone else specified, just like there are no chefs who can't cut vegetables very quickly or basketball players that are brilliant tacticians but can't run very fast etc.<p>Mastery of basics is not a guarantee of mastery of higher-level skills but it is a prerequisite.",1330312634.0
