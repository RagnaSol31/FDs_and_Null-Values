This seems to be substance of your argument, as I understood it:<p>The computational expense of a brute-force attack against a hash is the lesser of (hash length, text length). Well-known hash functions (md5, sha*) are optimized for large blocks of text, which leads to two properties: 1) they are made fast 2) them being fast is not a problem - if the text is long the strength against the brute-force attack is determined by the hash length which is very respectable for sha256 or even sha512.<p>However, the passwords themselves are small - the typical password is 8 characters and assuming 7 bits per character you're looking at search space of 56 bit, at which point it doesn't matter if your hash is 64, 128 or 512 bit because your strength is 56 bit. The search space can be further reduced by accounting fr various password selection biases, for example phonetic bias, tack-number-at-the-end bias, keyboard layout bias and so on.<p>To deal with small search spaces we need algorithmically slow hash functions - their slowness is not a problem because text is small, but it's a benefit against the brute-force attack.",1260849420
