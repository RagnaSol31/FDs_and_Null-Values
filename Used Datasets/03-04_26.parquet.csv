The whole funding model of universities in aus now means you get funded on the number degrees granted and bums in seats.  It seems like a way to game the system by lowering the quality bar.  So I remain unconvinced that this is a better approach.  Taking 5 years to do the same overall content, 3 year generalist and then 2 year masters just seems too long (may be experience bias though).  I always though the generalist was things you should just be doing on your own.<p>Bond university when it existed, allowed you to do law in 2-ish years I believe; no holidays and extremely small classes (< 15).  Expensive though.",1243223988

32,624980,comment,624701.0,624918.0,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,I suppose there are a lot of reasons (see the other reply) but my thinking when posting was this:<p>In-N-Out is a burger joint with a niche meaning they have a few million customers.  Those customers come by maybe once or twice a week to get a meal.  Apply that same number of customers to the software industry and you'll have trouble surviving because they're either only going to pay you once or in the case of websites pay you little to nothing.  So my conclusion was that an In-N-Out level success would not be what most software developers would be interested in.<p>So that was it.
