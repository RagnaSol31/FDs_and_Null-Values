5,1089940,comment,1089479.0,1089666.0,0,0,GHFigs,,,"I'll bite. I like disagreeing with you! I think I've been rude to you before, but I like a lot of your posts, and you definitely don't deserve a drive-by down mod.<p>Your solution is not viable because the problem is not an interface problem. The problem is that Flash does not actually make the iPhone, iPod, or iPad a better product in any way that matters to Apple.<p>Some potential customers (which Apple surely cares about) may demand it, but they also demand ponies, etc. Whether they would actually buy the product if it had Flash or would like it if they had it is something we can only guess at, but if you had to guess if users would really like poorer performance, poorer battery life, more advertisements, games which run but don't fit on the screen or work well with touch interfaces, choppy video with non-standard controls--well, if that's what Flash support means in practice, it's quite possible that those users really don't know what they want.<p>If this all sounds very paternal and ""Steve (and whoever else at Apple) knows best."", well...it is. Good design often is pretty dictatorial. It's not the only way to design a good product, but it has a pretty good track record, and not just for Apple. They've certainly had a pretty good run in declining to support Flash. Is that going to come to a grinding halt over Farmville and Punch The Monkey? Maybe. Probably not.<p>Apple generally doesn't want to soak up any of the credit or blame for technology that they don't have any control and hardly any influence over.  If Flash on the iPhone/iPad sucked, it would mean something about the iPhone/iPad sucks, <i>and Apple wouldn't be able to do anything about it</i>.<p>Think about that. Would you want to release a product that not only incorporated a flaw (even potential one) that you couldn't fix, but which you <i>depended</i> on to meet the market's bullet-point test and which you couldn't remove on pain of user revolt? Dreadful scenario. Why not ""just"" try not to depend on things you can't fix?<p>The Apple story in the past decade has been shrewd application of this rule to very great effect in every case that I can think of, from touchpads to retail. It isn't an ignorance of real world circumstances (like Flash's installed base), it's a refusal to depend on them. Where they can't roll their own or do without, they tend to bring a ton of leverage to the table and leave with a bag of concessions.<p>You may have noticed that Apple has a strong brand. They got that way by trying hard to not release crap. Contrast (say) Microsoft which has a wildly uneven product line ranging from really great to utter trash. Contrast the  Android platform, ""iPhone Killer""s all, and all striving to escape the pit of their own shared mediocrity.<p>So, they don't want to release crap, and they don't want to depend on anybody else? Now the question is: Do they really have to depend on Flash to make their product great?<p>The thing is, most people outside of Adobe that ""want Flash"" don't actually want <i>Flash</i>. They want the things that they currently get through Flash, like games and video and rich interfaces. Now <i>that</i> is something that Apple can work on. And they do. And sites that would otherwise depend on Flash do. And native application developers do. And the result in most cases is a <i>better</i> overall experience for their users for each of those things. And there is more of that every day.<p>So even though they're losing a bit to the non-fungible nature of the content (i.e. you can get games but not Farmville...yet; you can get video but not Hulu...yet), what they are gaining in the end is actually a higher-quality result overall. Isn't that what it's all really about in the first place?",1264909989.0

46,1089893,comment,1089481.0,1089481.0,0,0,kennu,,,"I tried to build a solid web platform on PHP and Zend Framework for a few years. It proved very difficult. PHP doesn't provide much structure to build on. On the other hand ZF is overkill and slow with its massive class hierarchies and complex autoloading systems. And ZF's data models are a joke: they're just simple SQL table wrappers.<p>After moving to Python and Django, everything changed. Now there is a clear, simple structure for every application, defined by the framework itself. There is a good balance between models, views and templates, because Django enforces templates to be simple. There is no weird magic like ZF's autoloading or CodeIgniter's library loading, just basic Python imports.<p>It's really cool that whether you download a third-party Django app or use your own, you always have the familiar app structure of xxx.models, xxx.views, xxx.forms, xxx.admin and so on. This makes it really easy to understand how any code works.<p>I did go through a learning curve. First I tried to tweak Django to my own ideas of a good architecture. But slowly I realized that it actually makes sense to follow the conventions to the detail. Especially when you have a team of people that needs to follow the same principles, in order to understand and reuse each other's code.<p>I also used Python for several years as a shell scripting language before building real websites with it. Looking back, some of the code is pretty horrible and un-pythonic, more resembling Java or PHP, and not using Python's features properly.<p>So anybody new to Python should expect to go through a period of unlearning their old programming habits. Your code will shrink from the old 10-line-for-loops into 1-liners, you won't write much of your own classes any more, and eventually you'll start metaprogramming with decorators and metaclasses, to get rid of 90% of the remaining (boilerplate) code you thought you needed. :-)<p>When you reach Zen, you will no longer have to code. Instead you will declare your Django applications as data models, admin definitions, URL mappings, view decorators, HTML templates, and just a few lines of logic in the view functions.",1264908244.0

I've not used other declarative form systems besides this but it seems like a terrible idea in general.<p>Do anything even slightly complicated (say validations dependent on other field values) and you end up having to extend the framework in truely monstrous ways just to get it to happen. (On a side note, using the validate decorator in Pylons is NEVER the great idea it initially seems to be).<p>In the end I replaced the form system with my own that let me work procedurally instead of declaratively (without the need to memorise the multi-tiered internal form handling API) but I could still plug into the existing declarative system (no need to re-invent the wheel).<p>In that regard Rails form handling is a pleasure to work with. Validation is just as easy for simple and complex scenarios. Integration with the ORM is fantastic removing a tonne of manual pain when constructing forms.",1264907882.0
