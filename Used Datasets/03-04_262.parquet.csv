If the companies in question are privately held then to a certain extent the risk is only with investors brave (or foolish) enough to back them. However, what do you think would happen to the tech industry, and potentially the wider world economy, if a big name company suddenly went up in smoke, public or otherwise?<p>Now, please pause for a moment and consider: it doesn't have to be Microsoft or Apple or Oracle. Some of the crazy valuations are putting much less robust companies within an order of magnitude. If one of them goes, it's going to be big news and stock prices right across hi-tech industry could race to the bottom scarily fast as we've seen before.<p>If you are, for example, Zynga, then the kind of disaster that could lead to catastrophic failure seems awfully difficult for you to anticipate or control. Likewise all kinds of new companies being built on Twitter and so on, keeping in mind that Twitter (as far as I know) doesn't actually make any money itself yet and could easily be displaced by the next new shiny thing tomorrow.<p>I'm not saying it's going to happen at all, never mind tomorrow, but there is definitely a house of cards building up here, and of such things, market bubbles are made.",1298519902.0

Living in China and going to a local university learning chinese, I've feel that a lot of the symptoms described in the discussion are more of a result of education systems.<p>A lot of my Chinese friends have expressed the need to get a good job, thus there is pressure for them to be in a major that 'guarantees' that: computer science/engineering is seen as desirable in that light. Having attended one of the computer science classes, I've seen two striking things:<p>1) Only a small percent of the people in this major are have an actual interest in the topic. The rest hope to get some administrative job in a big company and that this degree will be their ticket in.<p>2) There is a mechanical sense to the way projects and assignments are done. The philosophy seems to be: if I follow the steps that the teacher gave then I am able to solve this problem. There isn't an emphasis on analysis or synthesis. I attribute this to the emphasis on rote learning.<p>These two things make it easier to see why the symptoms described in the discussion occur. In addition, I noticed that the level of education is quite behind my own college experience. They were learning things in their third-year first semester that I learned in my first-year second semester.<p>As a side note, I don't go to one of the top tier universities; I was told that my university is a second or third tier university, so I suspect that this is the reality for most Chinese computer science students.",1298518898.0

(Actually, you can see the three of us sitting in the front-right-most seats in the photo!)<p>In my opinion, the notion of ""radical innovation"" depends on one's point of view: one could argue that, although the spectacular innovation during the space race, e.g, like landing a man on the moon, was indeed remarkable, it was, for all practical intents and purposes, little more than a political publicity stunt to the average individual, i.e., it did not have a profound effect on a personal level.<p>In contrast, the developments of the past 20 years -- internet, cell phone, facebook -- have profoundly changed individuals around the planet.<p>I don't think the question should be whether a thing is more or less innovative than another thing, but rather what effect the thing has had on a group of people on an individual level.",1298517758.0
63,2256803,comment,2256647.0,2256647.0,0,0,dkarl,,,"<i>the qualities of character men once needed to play their roles—fortitude, stoicism, courage, fidelity—are obsolete, even a little embarrassing</i><p>I am far from a Biebersexual, but when I read something like this, that's who I side with.  Woman want to see certain things, but men can't honestly advertise them.  You can't prove your ability to withstand hardship without, you know, <i>actually experiencing some hardship</i>.  When a woman looks at a man and visually measures his ""fortitude,"" all she sees is how impressed he is with himself.  It's hard to feel impressed with yourself when you've never gone hungry, never even had to sleep on a friend's couch, and never had anyone close to you die.  In this privileged life, the men who advertise the ability to withstand and endure are almost all posers, and the women who eat it up are willing suckers.  I'm not going to pose for anyone.  Hang around until a challenge comes my way, and you'll see how I handle it.  Manufacture a challenge for me, and I'm going to raise an eyebrow and ignore you.<p>Now, a second point.  There's a lot of cognitive clean-up everyone needs to do to accommodate the advances of feminism, and it's taking a few generations.  Women complaining about the lack of real men are suffering cognitive dissonance from an incomplete assimilation of feminism.  Take me, a male who measures up pretty well by most of the standards of the article.  I watch grown-up movies and don't play video games.  I play a sport.  (Wait -- is that good or bad?)  I don't smoke pot.  I have a corporate job where I fit into a hierarchy and make good money.  That's all fine, but I bet I'm not a ""man"" by the author's definition.  Why?  Because I don't cultivate that authoritative ""I know everything and have everything under control"" presence.  That's the missing element of ""manhood"" I refuse to take up.  <i>They are more like the kids we babysat than the dads who drove us home,</i> she says.  Nice choice she presents us with.  Did patriarchy come back in fashion when I wasn't looking?  I refuse to pretend I'm anyone's dad.  I won't talk down to people.  I don't have all the answers.<p>Do women really like guys who control everything and think they know everything?  No.  Yet some women want men to <i>act</i> that way.  They are programmed to find that macho arrogance comforting, and they refuse to deprogram themselves.  They want to feel that reassuring and directing masculine presence, right up to the moment when there's a disagreement, and then they want to deal with him as an equal.  I won't accommodate that immaturity; I refuse to impose that cognitive whiplash on myself.  I don't have all the answers.  You run your life, not me.  I won't let you treat me like an autopilot that you turn on when you want to be possessed by a manly man and then turn off again when you want control back.  (Except in bed.  Anything is fine in bed or on the way to it.  I'll be John Wayne or Justin Bieber or Marv Albert or Daffy Duck in bed.)<p>I'd say the men who are showing fortitude right now are the ones who are enduring unemployment without letting it crush their spirits, but this author probably thinks they are slacker guy-children who show an irresponsible lack of concern for their failure to win bread.  They should stop acting cheerful and optimistic; instead, they should watch Humphrey Bogart and Steve McQueen movies and practice their rugged, haunted, stoic looks.  It may have as much to do with real manliness as a bag of silicone has to do with breast tissue, but that's what this author wants.  That's how she can tell the difference between an unemployed ""man"" who is manfully enduring hard times and an unemployed ""guy"" who is goofily refusing to grow up.",1298517746.0

As my co-founder and I worked, we realized that people have way too many photos and most are not that interesting to look at. We wanted a way to find our friend’s best photos quickly, so we created what we are showing today.<p>Portrit is all about filtering you and your friend’s photos. This happens through a method of nomination. You look through your friend’s photos and nominate one that you think is above the rest. We have 10 categories that we call “trophies”, including Hot, WTF, LOL, and Fail. Once nominated, the photo goes into the active stream where you can see all you and your friend’s nominations. At this point it’s up to your social graph to determine what photo is the Hottest, funniest, etc. This is done through a simple voting system similar to HN, Digg, or Reddit. At the end of a 24 hour period (11PM PST), whoever has the highest votes in that category wins the trophy and the losers are cleared out for the next day. The trophy is added to the user’s profile so their friends can easily find the best photos.<p>For the non-facebook people, see screenshots in our chrome app: <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hbbhgkmmpcjnmijojodbgebcklobaijh?hl=en-US"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hbbhgkmmpcjnmijojo...</a><p>We would love any feedback!<p>Quick technical info for those that are inclined:\n* Standard backend: Django/Apache/Nginx/Memcached\n* frontend is a single page with dynamic views.\n* Around 90% of the code base is on the frontend.
