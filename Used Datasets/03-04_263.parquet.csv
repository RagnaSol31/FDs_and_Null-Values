This, however, must not be unnoted by us, that as the chief object of the Holy Spirit is to preserve the coherence of the spiritual meaning, either in those things which ought to be done or which have been already performed, if He anywhere finds that those events which, according to the history, took place, can be adapted to a spiritual meaning, He composed a texture of both kinds in one style of narration, always concealing the hidden meaning more deeply; but where the historical narrative could not be made appropriate to the spiritual coherence of the occur\u00ADrences, He inserted sometimes certain things which either did not take place or could not take place; sometimes also what might happen, but what did not:  and He does this at one time in a few words, which, taken in their “bodily” meaning, seem inca\u00ADpable of containing truth, and at another by the in\u00ADsertion of many.&quot;</i> - <a href=""http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.vi.v.v.i.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.vi.v.v.i.html</a> section 15<p>Origen was one of the foremost Christian scholars of the 2nd-3rd century.

Rolling hash approaches can be very sensitive to &quot;high-frequency&quot; variation, so all a spammer would need to do to evade it is insert a reasonably high rate of spelling errors or word substitutions.  That would have the effect of keeping the segment hashes themselves well-randomized (since even a single character difference should result in a completely different cryptographic hash), or prevent the rolling hash from selecting segment boundaries in a consistent manner.<p>One of the nice things about locality-sensitive hashing algorithms for less-than-pristine data is that you can instead tune it to construct the fingerprint from a larger number of smaller samples, which makes it more likely that you&",
