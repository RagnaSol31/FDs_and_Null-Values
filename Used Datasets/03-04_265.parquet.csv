17,1762626,comment,1760791.0,1761621.0,0,0,thwarted,,,"Yes, and it works pretty solidly.  We used to use syslog-ng, writing to named pipes, but you have to be sure that there is something reading from the pipe before you start writing to it, otherwise it blocks.  You don't really want to use the syslog protocol (via the syslog(3) library call) for random logging because you may end up hitting the upper bounds of the log lines.  I wanted to use rsyslog, mainly for the local buffering, but it ONLY seems to support the syslog format/protocol, including prefixing all lines with a date and time and a hostname.<p>We use scribe and we have a stdin2scribe program (python) that can be used to hook into any log output (like apache access and error logs).  We have it set up in a two tier system, all systems that we'd want to log from run a ""scribe leaf"" on a port on localhost, and this forwards all logs to a ""scribe aggregator"" (behind a load balancer), with a buffering space on the local disk when the aggregator can not be contacted.  It's a pretty solid system and I recommend it.<p>We also have services, and command line and library interfaces to those services, that let you grab all the logs that came in on a certain time frame, or tail all the data coming into the aggregators in real time (one of them is a wrapper around a more generic tool that just tags the logs, the wrapper takes grep-style filtering arguments and the output is pipped to a pretty printer).",1286337144.0

41,1762600,comment,1761172.0,1761172.0,0,0,adammichaelc,,,"The assumption is made that since the immune system's reaction to a cold is inflammation and other cold symptoms, you are therefore experiencing the symptoms of a cold because of your strong immune system.<p>If your immune system was sufficiently strong, you would never start experiencing the symptoms of the cold because your body would destroy the invading virus during its incubation period -- in other words before the virus duplicated enough to warrant a stronger and more full immune response.<p>Also, the body's immune response, like all other responses in the body, is performing a constant balancing act. When your body is in balance (homeostasis) the right amount of inflammation occurs to destroy viruses and bacteria, but not so much that you're out of commission. If your body is consistently getting sick and producing high amounts of inflammation (runny nose, itchy eyes, sore throat, etc.), two things are happening:<p>1. Your initial immune response isn't kicking in fast enough to destroy viruses while they are in their incubation period<p>2. Your body is out of balance and your immune system's cells aren't able to shut down inflammation when necessary.<p>Recent research suggests that vitamin D plays a critical role in both ""awakening"" the immune system's T-cells, or turning them on, and moderating inflammation , or sending the immune system into ""sleep"" mode when it's done fighting off invaders. [1] [2]<p>Dr. Carsten Geisler, head of the Department of International Health, Immunology, & Microbiology at the University of Copenhagen said, ""When a T cell is exposed to a foreign pathogen, it extends a signaling device of 'antenna' known as a vitamin D receptor, with which it searches for vitamin D,"" If the level of vitamin D is inadequate, ""they won't even begin to mobilize.""<p>Based on this (and other interesting studies) I'd say that the best way to prevent the common cold is to make sure you have enough vitamin D in your body. What to do when you've already got the cold... probably not much you <i>can</i> do except take some zinc lozenges, pound the vitamin C, and try to get rest.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=another-reason-vitamin-d-is-importa-2010-03-07"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=another-r...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090408140208.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090408140208.ht...</a>",1286336253.0

(I'm not aware of the study you refer to, but I suspect a good deal of the phenomenon is due to intersection collisions.) What you want is the converse - driving under the speed limit causes most accidents (I doubt it).
