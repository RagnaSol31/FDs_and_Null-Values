We had a plethora of ports in the olden days, slow ones like serial, parallel, and PS/2, for modems, printers, and input devices, and we even had SCSI ports for external storage, and ethernet jacks for networking. Those days were terrible. We converged into a few physical ports than can do all of that for a reason, and that reason was because we wanted something inferior. The reason was because one port is better for humans. Computers are here to make our lives easier, not the reverse. Firewire was good for external storage and moving large amounts of data (like audio/video) fast, and when USB became as good, while also handling everything else, then Firewire became obsolete, as it was yet another port to take up space and cable to hang on to and lose.
