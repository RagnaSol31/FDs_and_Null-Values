Are we debating religion or technology?<p>I've taken the time to <i>explain</i> my opinions, and they're fairly well-informed:  I use Git daily, for real work, and I used Subversion for many years.  Moreover, my opinion is fairly measured:  I can see the value of Git -- just not for most types of non-distributed development.  My direct experience with the system trumps whatever theories you have about the quality of the approach.<p>Maybe my experience is due to the way that I use version control;  maybe I'm just not a ""power"" user.  I don't know.  All I really know is that if you can't a handle a civil discussion of a <i>version control system</i> without resorting to emotional retorts, then you're WAY too invested in the debate.",1227671983

So, objectively when regarding a large mass of people.<p>My only objection to that would be that again, an audience can vary wildly in different conditions. My professor gave an ""enlightening"" lesson on Delicious to my class, that the audience (college freshmen) on a whole found insight from. But the same lesson to, say Hacker News, would be far less insightful. You could get two different objective readings for the same material. Or am I missing something in what you said?",1227671798

8,377232,comment,376820.0,377196.0,0,0,unalone,,,"The problem, as I stated before, is that the idea of ""humor"" is in itself subjective. There's an objective basis for ""cognitive expectancies,"" but that isn't the only aspect of humor as we define it with language.<p>For instance, there's slapstick humor, which derives from being over-the-top. There's absurdist humor, which relies on the unexpected. There's clever humor, which is funny because it requires effort to understand it, and so there's a congratulatory aspect to it. There's dark humor, which - at points - doesn't trigger any laughter at all, but which still must be included under the umbrella.<p>I'm certain that you can measure certain parts of humor. But at the same time, while there's a physical part of us that <i>derives</i> humor, that does not make humor itself objective. The fact that every single person has different objective reactions makes humor inherently subjective, even if there's a physical element to be studied and torn apart.<p>It's like - I said this in another thread - the testers who try to analyze creativity. There are certain ways that you can identify a creative person. The problem is, none of those ways are perfect and all of them are thwarted by different studies. While you can test creativity and create an objective model, you'd only be fooling yourself.",1227671656

I experimented with different levels of payment prior to launch and had to offer more than I expected but my customers are receiving quality results, very quickly.

10,377230,comment,376694.0,376885.0,0,0,dmv,,,"I disagree with the blanket statement that ""spending 10x more on hardware will give you roughly 10x more value"", especially in the context of this article.  You only receive 10x value increase IF your software will scale to use the better/more hardware AND your software is rate-limited by hardware AND you receive value based on the speed of the software.  Those are pretty big predicates.  Of course, there are sensible ranges and strawman ranges.  That's true for programming talent, too.  But the article wasn't advocating for hiring more people.<p>The idea of the article is that footprint matters and needs to be reexamined periodically.  This is true for programmers (sadly) as well as hardware.  ""Hardware is cheap"" is not a sustainable growth substitute for efficient solutions.  We see the same thing with outsourcing, where a company discovers that ten programmers for the price of one does not always yield the desired outcome (faster, cheaper, better).<p>Because of course everyone wants to be in a position to use your math (10x more on hardware == 10x more value), but you can not be confident of that unless you know that your solution has a hardware bottleneck.  And you don't know that until you drain the swamp (or stress test extensively).",1227671559

14,377225,comment,376820.0,377198.0,0,0,astine,,,"Yes, but it can be objectively subjective; or rather, it is subjective, but in a different sense.<p>To illustrate, the phrases ""The audience finds this interesting,"" and ""The audience finds this insightful,"" are both subjective in the sense that their truth-value is dependent on the subject (different speakers likely would have different perspectives,) but they are objective in that, given a particular subject, they are either true or false. So: ojective in the particular, and subjective in the universal. The difference is that the later can depend on factors that are external to the subject, are objective and can be shared.<p>A phrase (or whatever) can be insightful with respect to a particular context if it adds something that was not previoulsy present in that context. So an analysis of Hitler (for example) revealing him to be a raving ego-maniac would have been insightful in the early thirties when most people had rather more benign opinions of the Nazi party. Released today, the same analysis would be rather less insightful. Given that when people use the word 'insightful,' they usually are speaking from a particular context (usually shared with the listener), the word can be said to be used objectively.",1227670973

The language seems primed for complaints. Anagram programs always turn up ten times as many insulting phrases as compliments: there are simply more words with negative connotations. This is probably because when people enjoy something, they want to experience it rather than natter about it. But whatever the reason, the result is that it takes a lot less effort to be snarky. Praise, unless you put a lot of work into it, tends to get dull and a bit samey.<p>Praise also makes you vulnerable. Negativity is like a shield: you can keep throwing barbs at things without ever exposing yourself to attack. But praise is different. It's difficult to like something a lot without investing some of yourself in it, and without it becoming part of you. To praise something in writing is to reveal some of yourself, and face the possibility that there isn't much to reveal.

So saying the clock is broken does not necessarily imply that it's wrong <i>now</i> just that it has been wrong in the past and will probably be wrong in the future.<p>When parsing arguments look for words like <i>and, or, because, so, thus,</i> etc as they are the foundations of arguments.  You can add a lot of meaningless drivel around the core argument but as soon as someone starts tossing those words around they are probably trying to use logic.  His point is the way an attack is connected to the argument determines if calling something ad hominem discredits the argument.<p>PS: People sometimes add an ad hominem attack as part of other more rational statements, so IMO attacking the person even alongside a rational argument is still an ad hominem attack even if it is not used to directly attack their argument.  However, simply calling part of what someone says an ad hominem attack does not destroy the rest of the argument if it's not directly linked to it.  It's like a defense attorney that counters the DNA evidence but ignores the video tape and the confession is going to fail.",1227668878
