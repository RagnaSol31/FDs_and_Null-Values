(This is sort of related to how it was tres gauche to mention that Soviet Russia was a brutal, genocidal dictatorship and how a huge portion of the American and European intelligensia supported that model and wanted it for their own countries.

Their decision, I believe, has very little to do with the principles of common law and a great deal to do with our own history as a country.<p>Regardless of their reasoning, racial issues are a bit off point.  You said it <i>does</i> matter if you do something warranting eviction, but that's not entirely true.  The rule stands, just with a clause added: The owner of a piece of property may evict anyone for any reason or no reason at all, unless his actions are proven to be racially motivated.<p>Again, this rule has existed since man has formed social structures. It's a rather important issue, and the Founding Fathers took it very seriously, which is why the third amendment prohibits the quartering of troops on private property. I understand the Supreme Court has upheld one exception, but that does not destroy the rule.  I would be very surprised if the Supreme Court considered a man's opinions -- political or religious beliefs -- as worthy of as much protection as facts about himself that he cannot change, such as the color of his skin.",1265082181

This includes faster JavaScript processing and new standards like HTML5.  As a result, over the course of 2010, we will be phasing out support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 as well as other older browsers that are not supported by their own manufacturers.<p>We plan to begin phasing out support of these older browsers on the Google Docs suite and the Google Sites editor on March 1, 2010.  After that point, certain functionality within these applications may have higher latency and may not work correctly in these older browsers. Later in 2010, we will start to phase out support for these browsers for Google Mail and Google Calendar.<p>Google Apps will continue to support Internet Explorer 7.0 and above, Firefox 3.0 and above, Google Chrome 4.0 and above, and Safari 3.0 and above.<p>Starting this week, users on these older browsers will see a message in Google Docs and the Google Sites editor explaining this change and asking them to upgrade their browser.  We will also alert you again closer to March 1 to remind you of this change.<p>In 2009, the Google Apps team delivered more than 100 improvements to enhance your product experience.

I mean them literally.<p>1)  North Korea runs concentration camps, in which inmates are worked to death in mines and factories to increase industrial production.<p>2)  North Korea is a military dictatorship which has used democide via famine against its own people to make it impossible to resist its dictatorship.  If you're on the winning side with the army, your family gets to eat better than grass.  In the late 90s a famine killed about 3 million people.  That's the regime's estimate, incidentally.  (Communists tend to have rosy accounting about such things.)  The population of North Korea is about 23 million.<p>3)  North Koreans are some of the most desperately poor people on earth.  They don't have much, and what they do have gets forcibly expropriated to maintain one of the largest standing armies in the world.  Its number one enemy is its own people, though if you believe the propaganda it has crushed the imperialist Yankee under its boot and exacts tribute from him, which explains all the bags of rice bearing American flags without which the population would again starve.<p>4)  The regime is supported by a personality cult of Kim Jong-Il and his father, Kim Il-sung, who has been essentially deified.  That is not an exaggeration -- North Korean propaganda has attributed the creation of the world to him.<p>Any educated person should know the above four facts already.

So why would we teach software development?<p>Besides, the only way you're going to get anybody but the tinkerers to be interested in modifying the parameters of the thrust calculation in their Spacewar game (I recall how in school we modified the trajectory of the bananas in QBASIC Nibbles) is to not give them anything else interesting on the device that already easily does something interesting and fun... I also recall that there wasn't much else to do on the 386s in my school other than Minesweeper or setting up new groups in Program Manager. Now we've got billions of web pages and thousands of free apps.<p>Necessity is the mother of invention -- except for when it comes to tinkerers. And I'm super thankful for tinkerers: they push us forward in software just as they do in other fields. But in a world where devices already do way more than their users can imagine (most people very much do NOT have good ideas for how software could be better or do something new) and offer a ton of other easily accessible options for activity, the vast majority of people just aren't a bit interested in tinkering.",1265081096

A company is either going to make them a ton of money, or it is not. If a VC thinks it is going to make them a ton of money, there is no such thing as ""isn't right for us right now"". If Larry and Sergei came to a VC firm that only invests in space exploration and offered to take their money in exchange for stock, they'd do it in a heartbeat.

You don't have any faith at all in 100 years of social progress?<p>I believe the reason that we have as many social services programs as we do is because this country has learned that helping out the poorest of our citizens significantly raises the productivity, happiness, and health of the country as a whole. Public health programs that keep those below the poverty line vaccinated prevent outbreaks of dangerous diseases. Unemployment insurance helps those who have lost their jobs get back on their feet before they become homeless and less likely to become employed, or desperate enough to commit crimes. Reduced-price meals for poor students ensure that they are focused on their studies rather than on trying to feed themselves, and therefore more likely to get the most benefit out of their education. The entire idea behind healthcare reform is the idea that if we work to insure every citizen, it will benefit all of us in the end by keeping us healthier, and hopefully driving down costs as a result.<p>I don't like my money being taken by force either, but to think that the free market would provide any meaningful wealth distribution without being directly forced to is just naive.",1265080536
