There're lots of people that I <i>wish</i> I was a better friend to, but there're only so many hours in a week, and I already have a fairly active social life and a demanding job, and so time and mental energy spent keeping up with them is time that's diverted from keeping up with other people.<p>It's the same reason that fewer people are willing to take on more ""demanding"" friendships.  That time spent caring for a sick friend is time that can't be spent hanging out with other friends.  Some people will do it anyway, either out of a sense of duty or because that particular friendship meant a lot to them before their friend got sick.  But we don't often see these people, because all the energy they invest in their sick friend is energy not being spent hanging out with us.",1308110372.0

For example, i consider Google/Wikipedia to be an invention that ""pushed humanity forward"" because it raised the collective IQ of the human race (with access to it of course) by a few notches. Both companies certainly didn't need $90m worth of capital initially to start off but benefitted from a few angel investments.<p>What i probably should have said is that the $90m could have better been allocated to things that are more worthwhile to humanity and not investing in just another ""clone"" of something.<p>But I guess kristofferR is right.

I can't imagine what that thing had to have cost when it was new.<p>In 2001, when I was in college, some lab in my engineering school decided to dump some SS5's. My roommates and I rescued a handful of them from the dumpster, and then mixed and matched parts from them so we'd have three decent machines.

In its own way, ocean acidification is far scarier than global warming, because there is absolutely no question that it is taking place.  While you need a PhD to analyze climate data, you only need high school chemistry to demonstrate ocean acidification.  Moreover, you have to deal with the carbon dioxide directly to solve this problem; you can't just try changing the albedo of the Earth, through mirrors or surface reflectors or particulates in the upper atmosphere.

Professional level tools like Omniture Test and Target or Optimost with Autonomy Segments handle MVT testing per segment, segment defined by external variables (appended data or data from Dataxu et al), business variables (return customer, prospect, etc.), or just online variables (IP address Geo, repeat vs. new visitor, etc.)<p>Professional level, btw, is defined as ""costs a lot"" and ""are painful to use"" and ""have poor interfaces""; more recent tools give up some of the power and cost for ease of use.<p>However, as you point out, these easier MVT tools (or Split-Test tools) focus on showing the ""winner"" or ""winning variables"", winner defined as ""most impactful on the total traffic or sample of this traffic during this time"".   You are right that this is not the final answer... but it's a good starting place; if you solve for the majority of users, it's usually the biggest step.  Then solving for unique smaller groups can often result in lower volume but higher value conversions... if you have time.<p>That being said, including segment variables in the analysis is a wonderful thing to do, and I encourage it.

Groupon takes half of that as their commission, leaving the restaurant with $25.  Now the restaurant has to provide you with $100 of food for the $25 that Groupon gave them.<p>If the cost of goods are 30%, that $100 in food costs them $30.  They're only getting $25 for it.  My slide rule tells me that's a $5 loss per customer.  The restaurant hopes to make it up on drinks and such, but that $5 loss is only cost of goods and doesn't include staff, rent, and other overhead.  It also doesn't factor in the fact that people who came to your restaurant only because they could get cheap food don't tend to be big spenders.<p>I'm sure you've seen this: <a href=""http://posiescafe.com/wp/?p=316"" rel=""nofollow"">http://posiescafe.com/wp/?p=316</a>",1308107410.0

His point is more nuanced.<p>My read is this:<p>1. Don't panic.<p>2. Get professional guidance.<p>3. Weigh the calculus well of how the troll will likely respond to resistance before deciding to fold: the troll is aiming at low-hanging fruit and may not choose to pursue someone who is prepared to raise obstacles (a matter that needs to be carefully weighed with professional help).<p>4. Part of this calculus (not emphasized in the article) is the position of the larger company whose platform is being targeted, whether Apple, Google, or whomever. I find it intriguing that the developers first targeted were very quick to publicize their plight and then went dark after being sued. This <i>may</i> signify that Apple has privately agreed to hold them harmless in exchange for their agreement to keep this confidential. And this would make sense. Apple would be foolish to make a blanket commitment to indemnify all developers when its agreement with them says that all the risk falls on the developer. At the same time, it can't afford to let a vulture come in and feed on the people who ultimately make the platform work. Hence, a strong letter to the world saying that it will vigorously defend its license rights (but with no public commitment to hold developers harmless), a motion to intervene in the lawsuits already filed by Lodsys against select developers, and dead silence (and, we assume, a forthcoming defense) from those same developers who normally would have taken the extortionist license terms and folded. This very likely means that the developers will stay the course with support from Apple, and that support almost has to include a private agreement to indemnify for this scenario to make sense. I am of course speculating here and might be dead wrong. The point for developers who have been threatened, however, is not to fold reflexively in such situations before exploring what Apple (or any other party defending its platform) is <i>really doing</i> behind the scenes. Even though this article did not get into this aspect, its main point really brings one to this sort of examination: if you are threatened, get good advice from knowledgeable people who know how to help steer you through this sort of maze. <i>That</i> is money well spent and it does not require you to spend a fortune fighting a troll one-on-one. The fact that a proper assessment might show the troll to have a flimsy case only reinforces the idea that there may be room to resist, if you do it right.",1308107172.0
