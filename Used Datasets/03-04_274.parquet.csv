If all but the top 5 hands or so fold every time you slow play, you're not playing against good players (experienced != good when it comes to poker) and you should just start slow playing and stealing every pot. Then when they figure it out, don't do it again until you get a monster. Most of abusing amateurs is simply doing this, exploiting a weakness until they realize it, then doing the opposite. By the time it stops working you're ready to go.<p>Regardless, presumably you'd have to memorize this order of the deck in order to stack it that way, thus you could look at your hand and determine the opponent's hand and what the board would be. You could play accordingly. It's easy to make a lot of money at poker when you know what all the cards are.<p>On the other hand, I've never seen a game for significant stakes where the players were dealt, and I've sure never known anyone good enough to take a deck and sort it into a specific 52 card pattern without being noticed.",1284263451

38,1682963,comment,1680149.0,1680149.0,0,0,kragen,,,"Here's my own rant.  (I think Paul Dirac 137's rant actually contains more words than P. A. M. Dirac's textbook about quantum mechanics, which I spent many evenings in high school trying unsuccessfully to get to the third page of.)<p>I remember when I thought Forth was the next big language, too. And like you, my experience trying to program in it was disillusioning.<p>A big part of the problem, I think, is that I tried to use the stack instead of variables. Forth has always had variables (at one point in your post, Yossi, you say it doesn't; but I think you mean local variables.) It doesn't have to be any harder than C to write. You can translate directly from C to Forth; C:<p><pre><code>    static int mac80211_hwsim_start(struct ieee80211_hw *hw)\n    {\n            struct mac80211_hwsim_data *data = hw->priv;\n            printk(KERN_DEBUG ""%s:%s\n"", wiphy_name(hw->wiphy), __func__);\n            data->started = 1;\n            return 0;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nForth, just a straight translation of the C:<p><pre><code>    variable hw  variable data\n    : mac80211_hwsim_start  hw !\n      hw @ priv @ data !\n      KERN_DEBUG s"" %s:%s""  hw @ wiphy @ wiphy_name  printk\n      1 data @ started !\n      0 ;\n</code></pre>\nThis function doesn't happen to be recursive. If it did happen to recurse, we'd have to explicitly save the values of its ""local"" variables on the stack before the call and restore them afterwards.  On the other hand, most functions aren't recursive.<p>Now, maybe you can optimize that Forth a little bit; for example, you can probably dispense with the variable ""data"" and just use the top-of-stack, and actually that variable is only read once and surely the debug message line doesn't modify hw->priv, etc. etc. Maybe I should have randomly picked a different piece of C. But at some point along the path of ""optimizing"" and ""simplifying"" the Forth code, you find yourself getting into the kind of nightmarish code you demonstrated above, where you have four or five things on the stack and they move all the time, and understanding it is just a nightmare.  But you don't have to do it that way. You can use variables, just like in C, and the pain goes away. You never have to use any stack-manipulation operations, not even once.  They're always there, tempting you to use them, taunting you; and you have to exercise a great deal of restraint to avoid writing your code as cleverly as possible, because that will make it impossible to debug.<p>I think in this case the painless-but-optimized version looks like this:<p><pre><code>    : mac80211_hwsim_start\n      dup wiphy @ wiphy_name  log   priv @ start ;\n</code></pre>\nHere I figure that ""log"" is locally defined as something that printks a KERN_DEBUG message with the calling function name followed by a colon and then the argument, and that : start started 1 swap ! ;.<p>But when I said ""it doesn't have to be any harder than C to write"", I lied a little bit. It doesn't have to require detectably more code, but per line, Forth is still a bit more error-prone than C, in my experience. In C you get enough static type checking to immediately detect something like 90% of your type errors; you get a warning if you forget to pass an argument to a function, or pass too many; the data flow of any subroutine is easily approximable without having to know the stack effect of every subroutine you call; and so on. But maybe if I programmed enough in Forth, these errors would become less significant.<p>(I suspect that global variables are less of a problem in Forth than in other languages: you can have multiple global variables with the same name without accidental sharing; you're very unlikely to have mutually recursive functions without knowing it (and, in any language, recursive or mutually recursive functions require special care to ensure termination anyway (that is, recursion is error-prone); etc.)<p>On the other hand, as you pointed out, Forth is easily extensible. I think, as Eric Normand pointed out, that you want to use that extensibility to bootstrap into a less error-prone, more problem-level language/system as quickly as possible, and in fact, this is the standard approach using Forth promoted by the likes of Chuck Moore and Elizabeth Rather, as I understand it. It's just that the next layer up they're talking about is a more traditional domain-specific language, something like FoxPro or Rexx or sh, rather than something with garbage collection and data types.<p>In theory, at least, it seems like as you scale to a larger program, Forth's advantages over C would become more significant, as your program looks more like a tower of DSLs --- up to the point where you split your C program into multiple programs that the OS protects from each other.<p>There's a quote from Jeff Fox in my quotes file:<p><pre><code>    [In C under Unix] Bugs are planned, and the whole picture is all about\n    the planning for bugs.\n\n    Forth is about planning for good code where the bugs don't happen. If\n    you say BEGIN AGAIN damn it, you mean BEGIN AGAIN not twenty other\n    possible meanings based on C insisting that it is one of twenty\n    different bugs that need extra hardware and software to be handled\n    properly. \n\n	-- Jeff Fox <fox@ultratechnology.com>, in a discussion on\n	   comp.lang.forth, inadvertently explaining why Forth is not\n	   widely used, 2006-05-20, in message-id\n	   <1148149942.763594.292230@u72g2000cwu.googlegroups.com>,\n	   subject ""Re: hardware errors, do C and Forth need different\n	   things in hardware?""\n</code></pre>\nMy own take on Forth is that it's by far the simplest way to build a macro assembler, and you can do anything with it that you can do with any other macro assembler, perhaps a little bit more easily and with more portability, and syntax that's not quite as nice. At some point you want a high-level language on top of your macro assembler, though. The Forth theory is that implementing a domain-specific high-level language has a better cost/benefit ratio than implementing a general-purpose high-level language, and a macro assembler is a perfectly adequate way of implementing a domain-specific high-level language.<p>Where this approach falls down is that it's true that implementing a domain-specific high-level language has a better cost/benefit ratio than implementing a general-purpose high-level language if you're implementing it for a single user, such as NRAO. But if your program memory isn't limited, and you can share the language with all the computer users in the world, a general-purpose high-level language like Lua or Python or Tcl or Ruby is a more economically efficient tradeoff, because whenever you implement some optimization, they all get the benefit.<p>(Also, I actually think it's easier for me to write bug-free assembly than bug-free Forth, but that may be a matter of experience.)<p>With regard to 18-bit words, I guess the advantage over 16-bit words is that you can fit four instructions per word instead of three. (The low-order bits of the last instruction are necessarily 0; fortunately that is true of NOP.)<p>Once I asked a famous CPU designer (who shall remain anonymous, since this wasn't a public conversation) what he thought about Chuck Moore. He said something to the effect of, ""Chuck Moore? I used to work under him at AMD. He's great!""<p>""No,"" I said. ""The Forth guy.""<p>""Oh, HIM!"" he said. ""In my DREAMS I could do what he does.""<p>I think the GreenArrays people are making a big mistake by marketing their chip as competition for microprocessors and microcontrollers. What they're really competing with is FPGAs and PALs. Unfortunately, they don't have a VHDL or Verilog synthesis system for their chips, and I don't think they're going to build one.<p>I think the reason that almost every bytecode system under the sun is stack-based is that low-level bytecode is basically a bad idea these days, but it made a lot of sense in days when code density was really important. (Bytecode as a compact representation of an AST might still make sense.)<p>And stack-based bytecode is a lot denser than purely register-based bytecode. Hybrid bytecodes like Smalltalk-80’s, where you have 8 or 16 or 32 bytecodes that fetch and store to registers, are even denser.<p>I can't claim to be a good or even an adequate Forth programmer. So take all of this with a grain of salt.",1284261527

49,1682952,comment,1682581.0,1682581.0,0,0,philwelch,,,"I would recommend studying philosophy, not so much so for its content but for the opportunity to learn to write well. You may have noticed that many philosophers seem to write poorly. It turns out that writing about philosophy is pretty hard sometimes--getting difficult ideas and complicated reasoning across in a clear manner is fantastically difficult. And while becoming a historically legendary philosopher may require having fantastically innovative philosophical ideas more than it requires being able to communicate them well[1], being a philosophy <i>major</i> generally involves just learning how to write well about existing philosophical ideas and perhaps making various arguments about them.<p>Also, it turns out English is a waste of a major--while there are English majors who are good writers, you'll run into just as many, if not more good writers in college who are not English majors--and plenty of English majors who are very poor writers indeed. If you want to work on your writing chops, find writing intensive courses in history and philosophy. (Studying literature doesn't teach you a think about how to write literature, it teaches you how to criticize literature.)<p>On the quantitative side, you want statistics more than you want to worry about other types of math. How much can we infer from how much data? How do you set up an experiment to collect valid data? Is a difference of x really a difference? You're completely at sea unless you can answer those questions. You can easily be a huge success in business and in life without understanding calculus. Being poor with statistics will make things much more difficult.<p>Finally, business classes vary by quality--classes like accounting which correspond with an actual set of skills are sometimes worthwhile, but some business subjects aren't worth taking classes in (MIS, management) and others (marketing) lie somewhere in between.<p>[1] It turns out that if you misunderstand Hegel, you still have a potentially interesting set of philosophical ideas to work with, even if they're different from the ideas Hegel was trying to convey. So it's no impact to a philosopher's stature to write unclearly, just an impediment to one's original intent being understood.",1284261046
