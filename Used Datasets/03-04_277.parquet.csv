That's basically what it seemed you were describing: an organized priority system for how people should get your time and attention. And that's what good CRM or contact management systems already do.<p>One thing those other solution do not do is let people see your evaluation, or create network effects based on everyone's evaluations. Maybe you are thinking in that direction, but the video didn't say much beyond just setting priorities using a point system.<p>Good luck with it!",1255319998.0

Multitasking is a bitch of today's productivity.  It makes you think that it helps you get things faster but research indicates then on the contrary it does not.  The  laps of time you brain takes to switch between the task is the waist.  It is also very addictive.   I used to multitask a lot and now try to discipline myself not to do it unless one task is taking time without my direct control(like coping large files or running long process).   Sometimes I find myself ridiculously starting to read and article or code few lines of code while my brain start doing something also and looking for other task to start.

39,875910,comment,875261.0,875317.0,0,0,linhir,,,"As Sandel points out, there are three classic ways to categorize justice: welfare, freedom and virtue. Although I doubt that we need to have a long conversation here, I think that what is great in America has not been that it maximizes freedom over all else, but rather that it has continued to find an appropriate balance between these conceptions of just government action. To dismiss the idea that promoting welfare--through education--is a worthy ideal of our government, and rather to say that freedom is the paramount ideal is short-sided, and naive.<p>Krugman's point may not be convincing, but neither is yours that unfettered liberty is the reason that America has prospered. Krugman's inaccuracy, in my opinion, is not that America's education was a driving force in economic growth, particularly in post-war America, but rather that the federal government was a driving force in the growth of education.<p>The sad thing is that the arguments we have today are not all that dissimilar from the ones that were had on the local levels during the common school movement in the 19th century. Some felt that certain segments of the population were not worth being educated, which is essentially what a lot of people today are supporting with a radically inequitable system, especially for those from poorer (both monetarily and 'culturally').<p>OCW is a laudable example of open education, but that does little to address one of the key points that Krugman is making. Namely, that on indicators of educational success far lower than college education, we are failing so many of our students. The fact that I can read graduate level micro notes from MIT doesn't help someone who can't properly add because they were provided with poor primary education in the Bronx.<p>I'm a firm believer in the idea that we rise and fall by our citizens, and it is sad that so many of our citizens are provided with substandard education. To that end, whether you think that federal government does or does not have a role in the educational system, I think we can all agree that something needs to be done, or we will continue to fall behind the rest of the industrial world.",1255318532.0

Even if they had unlimited funding, the problems are not a result of a limited amount of money, but rather arise from a variety of complex, systemic socio-political problems. Christensen, Horn, and Johnson (2008) have applied the disruptive paradigm to education and have some really startling insights in their book: Disrupting Class: How disruptive insights change the way the world learns. Definitely worth checking out if you are at all interested in transforming education.<p>Krugman also highlights another problem. The financial crisis has resulted in real job cuts. Consequently, there will be less specialized classes, AP classes etc., especially in rural and urban areas. Christensen's point is that this is a great place to introduce an education based disruption. That is what we are doing at www.nixty.com. As a country, we have limited ""teacher bandwidth"" (David Wiley, 2009). Whether we like it or not, this bandwidth is going to continue to decrease. We need to find ways to harness the Web, informal learning, opencourseware etc. to create real learning opportunities for people of all ages and across different backgrounds. Many of these disruptive processes are already underway in the homeschooling and unschooling domains. It'll be interesting to see how they play out and impact the traditional K-12 and higher education systems in the coming years.<p>We are looking for people interested in helping us solve these problems. If you would like to join us, then shoot me an email at glen at nixty.com",1255317697.0

Taught/supervised skydiving students from the second jump on. Sometimes sat in the plane and supervised/critiqued, sometimes jumped out with them for some task they were learning that involved another person in the air.<p>One student was having trouble staying stable when he left the plane. Tried everything I could think of, he was just tense and maybe a little tunnel visioned. He really wanted to succeed, and I really wanted him to.<p>However the student leaves the plane (there are many ways), you or the student would typically say out loud ""ready, set, go!"" and go on ""go."" Regardless of how he left the plane, he tumbled.<p>As we went up once again, near the end of the day, I had no idea what to try except some variation of what I/we had always done. We got to altitude, turned on jump run, and he climbed past me to stand on the step outside the plane. I still didn't know how to help him.<p>He got in position, looked in at me, and almost without thinking about it, rather than saying ready set or whatever, I took a big, obvious breath, slowly let it out in an exaggerated, relaxed way, and casually pointed at him.<p>Beautiful exit, and he had a big smile when we met on the ground.

We were speaking about how Facebook has seemed to become the dumping ground for acquaintances that you'd like to keep in contact with, but never will, and who you're not really comfortable texting. It's a problem I've had with Facebook for a while. They just don't differentiate the relationships I have with people enough. And because almost everyone is on the same level, I'm hesitant to share information and act as I would if it were just me and my close ring of friends. Often times, others will just post things to garner attention because they're posting to the world, and so my news feed is usually cluttered with garbage I'm not really interested in.<p>Anyway, I think adding points to relationships, or even people really, is a good way to go about differentiating friends. Come to think of it, I can see a Facebook app where you have 3 tokens to choose your top 3 friends to be pretty successful. Throw in an option to let people buy more tokens to add more best friends, and you'll have a bunch of teenagers buying tokens so as to not make the 4th and 5th best friends feel left out. :P",1255317324.0
