So, no, I don't think she supports living a life of charity, even if it is voluntary.<p>I am also aware that societies which protect property rights and refrain from excessive public welfare programs have higher economic growth rates than others. In the long run, economic growth surely benefits the least well-off as well as the most well-off.<p>However, many people's moral feelings lead them to choose a society with lower economic growth if it would benefit the least well-off in the short term.
