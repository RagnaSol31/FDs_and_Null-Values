We propose to create a button, deployable on ecommerce product landing pages, which allows users to recommend a product to specific friend(s) (instead of the whole world) via Facebook and Twitter. The recommender, acting as a reasonably shrewd person, would hopefully direct qualified leads to the ecommerce website and drive targeted marketing. We would then charge the ecommerce website for clicks (CPC affiliate marketing), giving a cut of our revenue to the recommender if a sale indeed happened (CPA-based profit sharing).<p>What do you think?",1273116028.0

Thus P(Q(Q)) can indeed exist, because P(Q) does, even though it does not return.<p>There may still be a way to prove such a paradox-avoiding P cannot exist; I'm not claiming that.
