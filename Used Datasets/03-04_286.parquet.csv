But mea culpa, the title ""Apache vs Litespeed"" does need the Varnish bit added. I'll correct it shortly.<p>2. You're making the assumption that varnish/VCL is caching the first server-side result indefinitely (ttl). That is not the case. So apache is still doing work behind the scenes, albeit less work than it's used to. Whatever hosting conditions we imposed on Varnish/apache are the same imposed on lsws. It's fair game (for better or worse).<p>3. Actually Litespeed is able to handle more than 100 concurrent connections. What choked it apparently is its inability to manage the 100 PHP requests well. It actually ran out of memory during the experiments. Again, Litespeed  was given the same amount of memory and was under the same conditions as Apache/Varnish. While the environment/conditions are not optimal, both varnish/httpd and Litespeed started equal. At first, we started with -c 10 and -n 10000 but both setups performed fairly well. So we upped it to -c 100. Checkout the load average from the Litespeed node below.<p>4. One of the goals of the experiment is to install stock Litespeed and stock Apache (RPM). No configuration changes were made to either. Litespeed has static object caching (20MB) enabled by default. Varnishd was given a 16MB cache. Stock installs are common in the Web hosting business, which is the scope/interest here.<p>5. Based on experience with client portals, Varnish as a cache seems to perform better than Nginx as pure cache. It could a perception. We use Nginx and/or Varnish where it makes sense though. They're both free and open so why not!<p>6. Can't agree more. Just for the record, we didn't select the hardware and environment to favor either web server. We had a vacant server, network, and resources and went from there. The fact that this environment did not produce good results for Litespeed is purely coincidental.<p>FYI, Litespeed Tech noticed the benchmark and mentioned that they're working on developing a cache module that will ship with Litespeed web server.  We'll see.<p>[root@lsws_node /]",

11,1593766,comment,1593533.0,1593724.0,0,0,lsc,,,"Yeah.  Contract work sucks. it takes much effort away from your primary goal.  But you know what?  I think that contract work is usually less distracting than debit.<p>Debit, I think, has a ongoing negative effect... you are committed to paying $x a month, even after you've spent the original loan on your initial bad idea.  Now you've gotta come up with operating cash for the business, for yourself, /and/ the cash to make a payment.<p>I see debit as more of a ""you have this one shot... if you fail, bankruptcy""  kind of thing.  Which can be okay for some things... but it's not how I work.  See, usually I end up doing the wrong thing first.   After that, I have a better idea of what the right thing is... but if I took out a loan and spent it on the wrong thing?  now I'm stuck with a pretty big debit payment.  Only spending the cash I can get my hands on through the fruits of my own labour puts an upper bound on how much money I can spend on bad ideas.<p>Now, for me, I ended up just spending a while contracting and paying off the debit that way...  if I hadn't been an idiot to start with,  I'd be a year ahead now.",1281498822.0

54,1593715,story,,,11,10,coryl,"Tell HN: My ""remote employee management"" startup",,"Hi HN,<p>I've been working on a startup for the past few weeks to get our MVP out the door. We're ready to let the world know about our product, called HiveDesk.<p>HiveDesk is a solution for managing outsource/remote workers. The idea actually came from a friend who manages 5 Filipino employees on monthly salary. He was concerned that they weren't being honest about their hours worked, and didn't want to keep paying 10% fees associated with outsource portals like oDesk (who offer time tracking/screenshot capturing software). What he needed was a 3rd party service that let him manage his workers at a cheaper price. Thats where we stepped in.<p>HiveDesk lets employers oversee and manage remote workers through our client software. The worker installs it and ""checks in"" to a project whenever they're ready to work. The timer is started and automatically tracks time worked, and screenshot data is submitted every 10 minutes. It helps keep bosses in the loop as to work progress, and keeps contractors honest (no lying about hours worked, or goofing off on your dime).<p>You can learn more about HiveDesk at http://www.hivedesk.com<p>What do you think guys? We still have yet to build a proper business model / price points. Opinions and suggestions appreciated. Thanks",1281497205.0
