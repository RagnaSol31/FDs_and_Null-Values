""Go and paint the most beautiful flower that you can find."" - he said, while pointing towards the door.<p>Julius took the brushes and walked out. He decided that the most beautiful flower would be found in the forrest. And he was right.<p>For hours, Julius painted and painted. He stroked the brushes from side to side. Sometimes angry, and others with patience.<p>Nightfall came and Julius was exhausted. The painting was not finished. \nHe walked back to his master and slammed open the door.<p>""You have given me bad brushes. I have not been able to paint anything with them"" -said Julius with an angry tone.<p>""Those brushes are the same ones I used to paint my most coveted paintings. They are very good."" -said Alavis with the kind of tone that only a wise man can have.<p>""Tools do not matter. It is what you do with them, Julius. Go back tomorrow and the day after. Keep returning until you paint something that makes the flower justice."" -said Alavis.<p>""But you have only taught me the basics"" - said Julius.<p>""Yes. It is now up to you to learn how to use them properly. Only by painting every day will you improve."" -said Alavis.<p>""But I should only paint that one flower?"" -asked Julius.<p>""Flowers have short lifespans. When that one says goodbye find another."" -answered Alavis.<p>And so, Julius went on to paint many beautiful flowers. Each more elegant than the last. He never quit.<p>The end.",1336276526.0

Three gave me offers within a day, with very little effort on my part. On the other hand, one told me that I had little idea of what I was doing and told me to study up and apply again next year. And, that was after wasting my time with 3.5 hours of interviews.  Of the offers I received, two were well over 120k plus great bonus.  The other came in under 90k but told me that I could work anywhere in the world, whenever I wanted, as long as I got my work done.<p>Over that same time, I flat out rejected three recruiters from large engineering companies because their recruitment processes would have cost me $700-1500 just in opportunity costs.  And, they weren't even willing to give me the info I needed to help me determine my chance of success or even my expected pay.<p>Everyone these days seems to believe that their company is so important that they deserve or need a team of top 1000 engineers. When in fact a top 20-percent team who bonds well together would likely be sufficient.<p>The topic of interviewing is fascinating because there seems to be very little science behind it.

I'm not an expert in the field and I'm not up to speed on what Numenta's current form is, but his concept of creating half an intelligence has always offended my sensibilities.<p>I wanted to say something useful here but I don't know enough about what Numenta's <i>actually</i> doing. I know much of what is not being done, and it basically amounts to willful ignorance in my opinion.<p>Edit: let me revise this, since I'm being voted down with prejudice anyway. Hawkins has stated very clearly that the only valuable part of the brain to ML/AI research is the neocortex. He's plainly <i>wrong</i>, it should be easy enough to understand this is the final touch on the evolution of our brainsthe least important in a survival sense. More directly, without a motivating force there is no opportunity for an intelligent system.<p>My gut reaction is that the whole thing is a fraud, but I have up to now refrained from using such terms because I'd rather not argue from a position of ignorance (there are things I don't know about Numenta.) On the other hand, it's obvious this subject brings about the ignorant, so I'd like to take the opportunity to address these people: <i>you are deluding yourselves, just because you want to believe something doesn't make it true.</i> (That goes double for you Jeff.)<p>Have a nice day.",1336276337.0
22,3934100,comment,3933217.0,3933217.0,37,0,jaysonelliot,,,"I'm surprised at the lack of discussion around the correlation between the decline of the hat and conformity and formality of appearance in general.<p>Prior to the 1950s, most men dressed in a uniform fashion. Your appearance might vary depending on your class, but within social classes, one man looked pretty much the same as the next. A neatly trimmed haircut and a suit were standard everyday wear, and a hat to go with it.<p>After WWII, the 1950s saw the invention of the teenager. Youth culture was more prominent than ever before, thanks to many factors, both social and technological. As those teenagers entered the workforce, they were filled with new ideas about individuality and style. Along with the Baby Boomers ideas about style also came changing ideas about hats.<p>The change didn't come overnight, of course, but by the time JFK became president in 1961, you could see a definite trend away from hats and suits and every man's hair cut well above the collar. It would take another decade or more for hats to really fade out, more or less along with the decline of suits in general.<p>Take a look at this film from 1967, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJgaaAfhR5I"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJgaaAfhR5I</a><p>Watch for the crowd scenes in Manhattan at the beginning. You'll see a lot of hats, just not as many as you would have seen on the street ten years earlier, but far more than you'd see in a crowd scene from the same area in 1977.<p>There was no single cause for the decline in men's hats, and it didn't happen all at once. Stories like ""it was Ike with the interstates"" are appealing and make good cocktail party conversation (although I suppose the cocktail party died along with the hat, now that I think of it), but reality is usually not that discreet and simple.",1336276329.0
