Out of 12 people who didn't know about private/public key systems initially, but were experienced with email:<p>Roughly between 1/4 and 1/2 of them (worse in a couple cases) succeeded at a given task (send a key, encrypt an email, etc).  Others failed completely, or took a long time to achieve it (~30 minutes in several tasks for a couple people), and some couldn't manage the essentials - even with feedback - by the end of the 90 minute trial.<p>Reasons given for the failures were primarily focused around workflow / UI design.<p>---<p>Strikes me as accurate, probably better than many alternatives at the time, which is somewhat frightening.  And, given my experiences getting signing / encrypting working in Mail.app, it's hardly improved in the past decade.

It's interesting to note that though it's possible to securely exchange e-mail, most people don't. I took a course offered by Prof. Tygar (co-author of the paper) last year and we evaluated how easy it is to send encrypted mail using Thunderbird+Enigmail+GnuPG. While the usability of the software has improved in the 10 years since the paper was written, it is nowhere near the level required to make this a mainstream technology. Maybe it is inherent to the process itself. I don't see how you can simplify key exchange to make it very easy for the average user. I guess the price you pay for security is to go through the pain of figuring out how it works. Of course, most people will not / cannot do that even if it is in their best interest.<p>I'd loved to hear the thoughts of the security gurus on HN about this...",1275191625

Bring the oil/water mix up to the surface, maybe filter it, dump it in a ship/tank on the surface.

26,1389894,comment,1389583.0,1389709.0,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I clearly didn't explain this idea very well. OK, let's imagine we have a mains pipe of 3 inches in diameter sticking out of the ground on a building site gushing water which we can't shut off, but fortunately it's at least fixed in place. That's our high pressure source of unwanted liquid, analogous to the oil gusher.<p>As you say, sticking something into it or even over the end of it to create a seal is not very practical. But suppose we took an oil barrel, which is about 2 feet in diameter, and drilled a hole in the bottom big enough to fit over the pipe. Getting in place would be a bit of a hassle but once you got the hole lined up with the pipe it wouldn't be too bad, right? OK water is still gushing but now it appears to be gushing in a narrow jet from the center of the barrel resting on the ground. It's still coming out of the same 3 inch pipe, rather than the whole mouth of the barrel.<p>We anchor the barrel with steel cables or whatever we can. Maybe we seal around the bottom of the barrel with concrete, so it's well and truly fixed in place. Water is gushing out the whole time, but money's no object here. When we are sure the barrel is sturdily anchored, we start shoveling gravel or lead weights it as fast as we can. As it fill instead of gushing in a narrow jet, the water will start (quickly) filling up the barrel - it's the same amount of liquid at the same pressure, but in order to get through the much heavier lumps of rock it's now flowing through a much wider pipe, at a rate proportional to the circumference of the original pipe/the circumference of the barrel.<p>If we work fast, we can get some kind of plug - perhaps on with an open valve on it - into the end of the barrel before it fills. OK, so then the liquid comes gushing through the open valve. But that means there is not too much pressure around the edges of the barrel, so we seal them with more concrete (I am of course assuming that the walls of the barrel can handle whatever pressure of water is coming out of the original pipe).<p>Come to think of it, we might as well just drop the barrel with the open valve on top of the thing. The valve prevents pressure buildup inside the barrel while we work on making a seal between the bottom edge and the ground. It just seems a bit easier to me to use filler material to step down the flow from a narrow jet to a wider tube.<p>Now we still have a gusher, but instead of coming out of a small hole in the ground it's coming out of a big faucet which we have built around the flow without making too much effort to halt it. At which point we close the valve at the top and hope the seal between the ground and the barrel is stronger than the pressure of the oil.",1275190942

I get that we're talking about pretty subjective things here:)<p>* UI appearance: I think the new HTC sense looks and feels on par with my iPhone 3GS. It's attractive and intuitive. My wife actually finds it be far superior for her tastes.<p>* Responsiveness: This is less subjective. Android running on the snapdragon is VERY responsive, certainly on par with the iPhone. I have played with a buddies original Droid. It definitely has some general lag to it. The difference between my phone and his is night and day.<p>* Quality of apps: Seriously?:) The app store is filled with  180,000 apps. 179,000 of them are complete crap. I've owned an iPhone since day 1... fart apps, picture of the day apps. I bought a fitness tracker a couple of months ago that crashed constantly and barely worked. Apple is not hand auditing applications. It's random at best. The auditing process is a content-control not quality-control. Among the apps that I actually use, I find the quality to be quite high on Android as well. There are bad apps and there are very good ones (weatherbug on Android is actually much nicer in my opinion).<p>* Android market: I guess I've never considered this. I've actually never even looked at apps using desktop iTunes. 100% of my app purchases have been on-device. I think this really comes down to the philosophy of the platforms. Google is building a self-contained pone-in-the-cloud. Apple still sees the iPhone as a bit more of a computer satellite (like Palm, but far less tethered I imagine).<p>* Countries: Ya.. that's definitely lame. I assume it's going to change soon. I would hope at least. You definitely have a fair gripe here (and I'm sure it colors some of your opinions a bit?;> )",1275189462

Modern browsers with canvas, svg, webgl etc. are trying to develop what I think is essentially poor man's virtual machine. It's basically concept that Java Applets and Flash pioneered long ago. Except they didn't get implementation exactly right. This whole “Flash sux. HTML5 rox” hype is very short-sighted. Current implementations (except video) are slower than Flash (esp. on Windows) if even existent. And what do you think will happen in few years? If we're lucky we might have fast and reliable implementation of a decade old idea. The fact is that innovation doesn't come from standard bodies. In few years, we'll face this same exact situation, when attempting to use some new technology in our webapps, might it be 3D screens or thought-controlling or speech recognition, yet again to face lack of API or its 3 different implementations.<p>So what new does HTML5 bring to the table?
