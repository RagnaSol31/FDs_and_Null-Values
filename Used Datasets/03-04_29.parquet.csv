Since then, my responsibilities have expanded to that of what I'd consider the responsibilities of a product manager.<p>I'm essentially the jack of all trades for the company. I can pretty much play the role of anyone in the company in the off chance they are out of the office, although my main responsibility remains as a copywriter. However, lately I've been given the ability to hire people as I deem fit to complete projects. Next week, I sit down with my boss (the CEO) and his partner to discuss putting me on salary (I work hourly right now), and I don't know how to go about valuating my skills and the responsibilities I've been given.<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.
