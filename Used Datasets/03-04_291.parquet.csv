Spay your dog already!"" You are arguing that there is no difference. You seem to base it on the idea that if someone feels offended by Bob Barker talking at them specifically, then they <i>need</i> to be offended by Bob Barker broadcasting to a large group of people in general.<p>In the same way, the general idea of Father's Day is different than talking specifically to someone about <i>their father.</i> At that point, it is no longer impersonal (or easily dismissed as, ""They are just talking to other people / people with happy father memories"").",1308542091.0

Other than that I don't see the reason why the author feels like programming languages require advanced mathematical concepts. In my opinion it's not the language itself, it's what you're using it for that may require math. And when that is the case, there's absolutely no way you can try and avoid it -- you have to understand how you're solving the problem in order to actually solve it, and this will have to be true regardless of what language you express your solution in.<p>Anyway, he mentions C a lot, and to me that language was more of an abstraction over how computers work as a machine rather than an abstraction over some mathematical concept of computation. Mind you, my only experience with C is reading K&R and fiddling around with pointers and memory allocation a few times, so by no means can I claim I actually know what I'm talking about. It's just to me it felt like I was concerned with getting some metal to do what I wanted instead of expressing something mathematical, and therefore, I can't follow this person's critique of the language.<p>* And even in the case of Haskell, a lack of knowing anything about Category Theory did not stop me from getting a basic idea of how and why Monads are so fundamental to the language. It does not stop me from being able to write something in Haskell, etc.",1308541488.0
