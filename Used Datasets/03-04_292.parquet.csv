IP is essentially protection racket. Sure you can learn a little bit of the dance but it won't unless you're on of the 'big boys'. In the end, there's no great difference between between a patent troll and a corporation seen as having 'legitimate ip'. IP rackets resemble <i>states</i> in the sense that they are gangs trying to suck the fattest t<i></i>t they can find.<p>The best strategy isn't to ""know what's legal"" but to <i>avoid attention</i> `till you're big enough to kick the snot out of these bandits.<p>IP mavens are [INSERT SOCIALLY DIMINISHING ADJECTIVE HERE].",1299038340.0

Why? Well, we don't have to compete with a bar full of people for places to sit / stand, and we don't have the noise and buzz of a full bar to deal with.  BUT... conveniently, SplatSpace is within walking distance of both a bar and a coffee shop!  So if people get tired of mingling at SplatSpace and want food/coffee/beer etc., we can migrate - individually or en masse - to one of the other establishments.<p>The other positive is that we have access to a project at SplatSpace, so if you want to bring a laptop to demo a project, or practice pitching your project or something along those lines, we can do that sort of thing.<p>It'll still be pretty unstructured and free-form, but this does give us some more options.",1299038046.0

10,2278381,comment,2277831.0,2277831.0,0,0,sarahmccrum,,,"I once had an employer who seemed (to me) to prefer people who were (in my opinion) pretty inappropriate for their jobs because they had so little ability to do them. I found it very difficult to understand at the time, because I generally like to have people around who are better than me at most things, so I can concentrate on what I do best.<p>It was interesting over the years, though, to see what happened. That particular employer was a great believer that anyone can learn anything, and she was incredibly patient with some people who really were not gifted at all in their area of work.<p>Above all she valued loyalty (and in key areas, such as finance, she preferred absolute stupidity). I learned a lot from her. I saw that most of the clever people who were around left, often when they were most needed, whereas the slower, more loyal people were still there getting the job done. I also learned that loyalty and commitment are more valuable than brilliance. I saw that she liked stupid people in sensitive areas because then they couldn't mess up in any serious way. They made lots of small mistakes but they didn't have the ability to make big mistakes and they always asked whenever they didn't understand what they were doing.<p>Personally I think there is a balance here. I would find it hard to go as far as she did, but it certainly caused me to look at people decisions in a different way, which I would never have come up with if I hadn't seen her in action.",1299037940.0

By default, new founders just have no idea that IP matters at all. They understand moral principles like ""stealing is bad"", but they are clueless about licenses, patents, copyright and trademarks. It takes at least 2 hours of a pretty intense discussion to get them to even remotely open their eyes.<p>And in practice, does it really matter? Look at YouTube, they cheated to get started, and no one seems to care. Better cheat and win than play by the rules.",1299036534.0

However, this rarely means that they're good enough to succeed at that thing without working on it. I.e. if your ex wanted to make a living as an artist she'd still likely have had to go to school / practice extensively before being good enough that people would have bought her stuff.<p>Also, and I don't know whether this is the case with your ex, it's entirely possible that she was better at art because she'd been idly drawing over the years. I've certainly known people who wouldn't call themselves artists whose default idle activity is to sketch away on a piece of paper. They're vastly better than me, because they've been practicing in a low-key way for years.<p>Natural talent just gives you a head start on others. Someone willing to put in more effort than you can still be better than you.<p>I suppose this may break down around the limits of a field, especially one rooted in physical activity. E.g. Michael Phelps seems to be nearly perfectly physically adapted for swimming. If he never practiced then he'd be easily outswum by anyone half-decent... but by putting in massive effort training he reaches a point where he's practically unbeatable.",1299035354.0
