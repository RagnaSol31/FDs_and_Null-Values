The web browsers would never have tolerated that -- you'd get a fly-in-amber-from-1995-or-1996 version of Python or Lua, forced into a standards body such as Ecma (then ECMA), and then evolved slowly _a la_ ECMA-262 editions 2, 3, and (much later, after the big ES4 fight) edition 5.<p>Interoperation is hard, extant C Python and Lua runtimes were OS-dependent and as full of security holes, if not more full, than JS in early browsers, and yet these languages and others such as Perl were also destined to evolve rapidly in their virtuously-cycling open source communities, including server-side Linux and the BSDs (also games, especially in Lua's case -- Python too, but note the forking if not fly-in-amber effects: Stackless Python in Eve Online, e.g.).<p>JS, in contrast, after stagnation, has emerged with new, often rapidly interoperating, de-facto (getters, setters, array extras, JSON) and now de-jure (ES5) standards, the latter a detailed spec that far surpasses C and Scheme, say, in level of detail (for interop -- C and Scheme favor optimizing compiler writers and underspecify on purpose, e.g. order of evaluation).<p>The other languages you cite have been defined normatively over most or all of their evolving lives entirely by what their C implementations do. Code as spec, single source implementations do not cut it on the web, what with multiple competing open- and closed-source browsers.",1289793517.0

Basically they'd give one best bid/ask update on a stock, gather new orders for a while (it was slightly random, sometimes as little as 22 seconds IIRC), match them at the volume-maximising price, and send out the new best bid/ask update. (Within this structure there was still time priority --- i.e. you only had to wake up once every 30 seconds, but when you did you had to send your new order ASAP. Also there was no atomic price amendment message ... you had to send an order delete and then an order create message, which caused all sorts of hilarity when they decided to take more than 30 seconds to send you a cancel acknowledgement.)<p>I read a study from 1998 basically supporting your position ... the authors concluded that ""The call market method is more effective in reducing the volatility of high-volume stocks than low-volume stocks. This contradicts conventional wisdom which suggests that the call market method is superior for thinly traded stocks, while the continuous auction method is preferred for heavily traded stocks. The call market method does not impair liquidity and price discovery in the call market appears more efficient than in the continuous auction market."" <a href=""http://www2.hawaii.edu/~rheesg/Belgrade/Taiwan/TSEfinal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.hawaii.edu/~rheesg/Belgrade/Taiwan/TSEfinal.pdf</a><p>On the other hand, just a few months ago, the TWSE introduced continuous trading in response to pressure from exchange participants --- but only for warrants:\n<a href=""http://www.twse.com.tw/en/about/press_room/tsec_news_detail.php?id=5635"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twse.com.tw/en/about/press_room/tsec_news_detail....</a> <a href=""http://www.twse.com.tw/en/products/trading_rules/mechanism01.php",

In fact the subsidies you're talking about usually don't even benefit the group they're purported to target.<p>For example, take the gasoline subsidies in Iran.  The group the subsidy purportedly helps is the poor.  Yet, if you look at the demographic and vehicle usage data, the middle class and rich have more cars and drive more, hence claiming most of the benefit from the subsidy.  If the government of Iran really wanted to help ameliorate the cost of fuel for their poor, they'd hand out coupons for free gasoline/diesel directly to the poor.<p>This also applies to American farm subsidies. The only reason they're in place is because politicians claim to be protecting ""family farmers"".  Yet, if you look at the statistics, family farms haven't been the primary form of American agriculture for almost three generations now.  The vast majority of the subsidy goes to helping corporate farms, simply because the vast majority of all farms in America are owned by corporations.  If the government really wanted to protect family farmers it would simply write them a check for the amount of the subsidy every year.<p>No, I'm with the parent.

Normally, an accumulation precedes price rise while a distribution is in tandem with a selloff. When shorting, the long-term trend goes the opposite way - there's more buying than selling, yet price consistently drifts down. Caveat: being based on a composite of price/volume/time, it's not totally accurate and even changes dramatically across time scales. )<p>Market-maker quotes on Level II behave unusually in response to buys or sells(on small, low-volume stocks in particular, MMs are sometimes colluding forces and will ""paint the chart"" with tiny trades that, in a fair market, would not affect quotes).<p>Message boards for the ticker symbol suddenly see the appearance of paid bashers who will repeat negative news multiple times a day.<p>---<p>With a lot of heavily shorted stocks, the company is fundamentally weak to begin with.
