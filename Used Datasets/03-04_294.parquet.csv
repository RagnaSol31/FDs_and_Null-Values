The Falcon Wing could be modified to decrease the size of the passenger door opening, resulting in a stronger and lighter body by reducing the degree to which the door openings compromise the structure of the car body. If they ensure that the floor of the car is fairly low, then they can require a passenger to step over a low wall to get into the car. 12 inches (30 cm) wouldn't be too onerous, but would do wonders for the structural integrity of the vehicle. The rear hatch could be kept low to the ground to enable easy loading of cargo. Passengers in folding rear-facing rear seats could use the rear hatch as an exit.<p>Just speculating out loud. Tesla's real car is probably not going to look anything like this.",1364442996.0

Any minor crime, quite literally even (a conviction for) jaywalking will massively impact your life (specifically your employment chances). You can buy your way out of most tickets and not doing so is a serious life-altering mistake. This is combined with only sporadic enforcement, meaning that effectively the people affected by this are random : nearly everybody jaywalks, 10 San Franciscans are convicted for it on a yearly basis, and find out the consequences are huge.<p>Once convicted, your chances for employment go down an order of magnitude, and this is not the state's doing. It is companies, but not as a matter of policy, it is regular Americans. In other words: the people on the street are doing it too themselves.

This combines hardware capabilities with software tricks to allow running multiple levels of VMMs. It may not have intense IOPs testing but it's got a couple benchmarks that would be representative of real-world workloads. Keep in mind that this paper was published in 2010 and virtualization performance has been on a dramatic rise the last several years.<p>Jump to the results section. The more relevant bullets here are 'single guest' (either virtio or using direct mapping).<p>Highlights (or lowlights, depending on your perspective):\nkernbench - 9.5% overhead\nSPECjbb - 7.6% overhead<p>I don't agree with your point about suboptimal allocation of hardware resources. Virtualization does not require you to divide a machine in a different way than processes do (you could easily have one VM consume nearly all CPU cycles, one consuming nearly all I/O capacity, etc.) IMO, the key difference is that virtualization <i>lets</i> you easier establish hard, enforceable limits and concrete policies around resource usage (not to mention the ability to <i>account</i> for usage across all kinds of different applications and users). And, it lets you do that for arbitrary applications on arbitrary operating systems. So users don't have to write to one particular framework/language/runtime/OS whatever. That's all pretty important for large scale.<p>[1] <a href=""http://static.usenix.org/event/osdi10/tech/slides/ben-yehuda.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.usenix.org/event/osdi10/tech/slides/ben-yehuda...</a>",1364440446.0
