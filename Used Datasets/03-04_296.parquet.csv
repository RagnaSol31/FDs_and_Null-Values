Really like the artwork and the idea.<p>I just dug out a bed in the back yard which is waiting to be planted, so I would seem to be your target customer.  However, I'd be inclined more to use your free email reminder service and buy seeds and seedlings from another source.  I wouldn't describe myself as cheap; just that I want control over the source/type of the seeds and would like to know whether I'm paying a reasonable amount.  One thing might be to make it clear what kind of seeds I'm getting earlier in the purchasing process.  Bulk?  Heirlooms?  Makes a difference, I think.  But maybe I'm just a snooty gardener.<p>And I know this an extreme suggestion, but I think a heftier garden planner would also make me more likely to buy... work on summer/winter layout and buy the calculated seed quantities.
