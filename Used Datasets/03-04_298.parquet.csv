Even on really complicated or foreign names, like my wife's for example, it rarely makes an error. So rarely I can't think of an instance in recent times. The search space is really small, but it takes advantage of that in a way that makes it useful.<p>Android does not do a good job with this. When I use it to do a voice dial, it has two major problems. First, it must be connected to the internet, because the sound or a signature of it is going to be sent over the wire. Especially when I am in a low signal area or on Edge, this is a deal-breaker. The second problem is that it's much less accurate than iPhone's voice dial. It typically will only get one word of the name of the person I'm trying to dial -- the surname. As a result, if I'm trying to call someone in my family, it pops up an alphabetical list of all of their names. So I would never use Android voice dial when I was on Android, because I invariably had to repeat myself or interact with the screen, which if I'm already doing that then why use voice dial at all.",1281671599.0

You still need a standard Java SDK to develop Android applications in order to compile the Java source code to JVM bytecode.<p>So far Google has been able to get the best of both worlds by leveraging the vast Java tools ecosystem but then in the final step they convert the standard JVM bytecode to run on their own Dalvik VM which means they don't have to pay license fees for the standard Java runtime.  IMO this is what is really annoying Oracle.  (To be fair there are also good technical reasons why they created Dalvik.)<p>I can understand where Oracle is coming from legally, but business-wise I think this lawsuit is bound to backfire.  Google has the resources to defend themselves and move away from Java in the long term, but in the meantime Oracle has created serious uncertainty about the openness of the Java platform which will scare technically innovative players away from Java that don't have the financial and legal resources that Google does.

Yes, the iPhone has some limitations but it's nowhere near your 100:1 ratio.<p>Don't get too hung up on the ratio.<p>> Actually, there isn't that many limitations honestly.<p><i>Followed by a list of limitations and caveats.</i><p>Actually, I'd argue the opposite, the iPhone <i>can</i> currently do many things that an Android can't do...things that I'd really like to do, like play Katamari Damacy (lest you think I'm trivializing, I have a serious soft spot for that game)...I think it's not hard to make a compelling case that in terms of software availability <i>and</i> general quality, the iPhone trumps the Android hands down at present.<p>However, I think that it's also easy to argue a few other related points, the Android phones are simply shipping with a better out-of-the-box user experience in terms of capability. Sure one can purchase a variety of add ons and pay for some subscription services and eventually bring the two phones to parity at a cost. But that doesn't exactly disagree with that point then does it?<p>And while there are certainly more apps in the iPhone store at present, the Android Market really is the domain of hobbyists more so than the iPhone app store. This is good and bad, in the Android marketplace, I think it's possible to find more hobbyist style apps at $0 that provide pretty good add-on functionality for the phone for no cost whatsoever. Like the tri-corder app which really is quite cool and has no equivalent on the iPhone. The difference between market opportunity and buyer habit between the two stores is often brought up here on HN. I think the Android platform draws its strength from this in many ways.<p>However, it has a downside in that the equivalent apps on the iPhone, ones that you have to pay some nominal fee for, really do <i>tend</i> to be of a higher production quality than the Android. And that's normal, professional paid software just tends to be of a higher production quality than hobbyist derived software. Perhaps in there's not much difference in functionality, but if I make money on my iPhone apps, I can afford to hire a graphic artist instead of using much maligned ""developer art"".<p>>Also, regarding ""look/feel good"", it sounds like you feel that the iPhone is still a status symbol.<p>Not at all, I'm simply saying exactly what I'm saying.<p>If you'll allow me to make a very labored analogy: A Honda Civic and a Mini Cooper (bear with me, I'm trying to use functionally equivalent cars) perform about the same, but you'll look better in the Mini. However, the backseats in the Mini kind of suck, so I can't really use it for four adults as well as a Civic, and because it looks nicer I probably don't want to load a bunch of mulch or yard equipment in the trunk of my Mini. And the operating costs of the Mini are higher than a Civic, it's less reliable, harder to find qualified technicians, has more specific fuel requirements, more expensive to do body work on and takes longer to find parts, whatever etc.<p><i>But</i> (and this is a big but for all the Mini owners of the world) you'll look better while sitting in traffic and the key fob is really cool. The Mini is no more a status symbol than the Civic is in the same way an iPhone is no more a status symbol than an Android phone is. You just get what you want and that's that.<p>The relative capabilities of the two platforms in terms of software availability is the one area the comparison of iPhone:Android::Mac:Windows falls down. There simply is more and better software available for the iPhone, it's just that it doesn't ship on the device. The stuff that ships with an Android phone simply makes it a more capable phone from the time it's first powered on. And in some cases, there simply isn't an equivalent functionality available for the iPhone (and likely isn't going to be one due to Apple's strategic policies).",1281670388.0

The union would mainly be concerned with issues like these patents.  A strike would be called on any company that tried to use software patents.  A strike would mean not only that the programmers of that company would stop working, but also all programmers nationwide would refuse to work on that company's products and platforms.<p>If such a union existed it would immediately stop the use of software patents.  The union could also lobby congress for the elimination of software patents and could work on other programmer related laws, establish standards bodies, etc.  IOW, give programmers some say in the industry that is currently driven by the suits.",1281670202.0

Indeed, if I had enough bonds and income to meet my obligations for decades to come, I might well describe myself as being in possession of ""fuck you money""<p>Going forward, in general, the Federal Government will not be able to rely on the Social Security Trust fund purchasing the bonds it issues. It can cut spending, raise taxes, or find other buyers who want to purchase bonds.<p>There is no particular reason to be concerned about the ability of the Social Security system, for years to come, to support it's obligations to the workers who have paid into the system.
