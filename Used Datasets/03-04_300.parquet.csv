Surfing with uBlock with strict javascript settings leads to a surprising amount of broken pages that do <i>nothing</i> with javascript that is mandatory. From graphical gimmicks that get stuck covering the page to breaking buttons on search forms, there is a lot of stuff that could work just fine, without the scripts adding any real benefit.<p>I get that for more complex use cases there are tradeoffs to be made (e.g. implementing a server-side AND a java-script version of functions, adding dynamic content to staticly hosted pages, ...), but there also are a lot of low-hanging fruit.",1423451200.0
