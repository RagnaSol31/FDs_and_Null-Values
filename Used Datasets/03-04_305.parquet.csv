They don't count twice.<p>The only way this makes sense is if you actually regress during your missed practices. That way, not only do you miss 2 practices, but it takes you 2 more practices just to get back to where you were before. Then it's like 4 missed practices total.",1289447774.0

If you look at the picture that Venturebeat chose for the article, it is someone sleeping on the floor in an empty room. Which to me does not seem exactly like the kind of PR message that is congruent with hospitality.<p>Based on his speech at Startup School, the founder and CEO Brian Chesky seem s like a very charismatic guy, which is great for a CEO, but from a business perspective, it seems like it might be time to think about changing the message that is sent out to the public and leave the old message of austerity in the deep dark past.<p>Good job Brian, and congratulations on the financing!",1289447685.0

Users use data exporter en masse to abandon Orkut.<p>2. Google breaks the exporter. Supposedly a bug, coincidentally when people are actually now using it.<p>3.

Google breaks the gmail exporter to Facebook. Social networks apparently are now expected export all e-mails. Press eats it up.<p>Look, I'm not arguing that email exporting should or shouldn't be allowed. I don't really want my friends giving my email to Farmville so they get a golden banana, but it's not the end of the world.

Imagine you wanted to\nlearn French, and there were no books, courses etc available to teach\nyou. You might decide to learn by flying to France and sitting in a\nFrench Cafe and just listening to the conversations around you. You\ntake copious notes on what the customers say to the waiter and what\nfood arrives. That way you eventually learn the words for ""bread"",\n""coffee"" etc.<p>We use the same technique to learn about protocol additions that\nMicrosoft makes. We use a network sniffer to listen in on\nconversations between Microsoft clients and servers and over time we\nlearn the ""words"" for ""file size"", ""datestamp"" as we observe what is\nsent for each query.<p>Now one problem with the ""French Cafe"" technique is that you can only\nlearn words that the customers use. What if you want to learn other\nwords? Say for example you want to learn to swear in French? You would\ntry ordering something at the cafe, then stepping on the waiters toe\nor poking him in the eye when he gives you your order. As you are\nbeing kicked out you take copious notes on the words he uses.<p>The equivalent of ""swear words"" in a network protocol are ""error\npackets"". When implementing Samba we need to know how to respond to\nerror conditions. To work this out we write a program that\ndeliberately accesses a file that doesn't exist, or uses a buffer that\nis too small or accesses a file we don't own. Then we watch what error\ncode is returned for each condition, and take notes. """,1289445663.0

It was originally implemented in SICStus, sure, but Prolog lets you add your own operators, and Erlang added a ton on top of the (rather clean) Prolog syntax. How would Ruby (or whatever syntax you like) look if you made a DSL <i>by adding every operator that wasn't already in use?</i><p>You know all the problems with the ambiguous ; , . stuff that Katz gripes about in that post? Prolog terminates every clause with a period, and all related rules just occur in sequence. Prolog has a read function, much like read in Lisp - ""read the next complete (s-expression|Prolog clause) from stdin"". The original Erlang compiler needed to read all of the alternative clauses for a function in one go* , so they strung them together with "","" and "";"", which are Prolog's <i>and</i> and <i>or</i> operators. (They could have fixed this when they started self-hosting, but probably had other priorities.) In practice, it isn't a problem (and Erlang has many perks to make up for those minor syntactic irritations!), but that can't be blamed on Prolog. It's sort of like if you used Lisp's (read) to load more expressions, but since your compiler needed you to read a whole module at once as an implementation detail, you used [ and { pairs instead of parens. Yuck!<p>In Prolog, that sort of code looks like this:<p><pre><code>    parent(terach, abraham).\n    parent(abraham, isaac).\n    parent(isaac, jacob).\n    parent(jacob, benjamin).\n</code></pre>\nNote the conspicuous lack of semicolons.<p>* I'm reading between the lines here, so if Robert Virding swoops in and tells me I'm wrong, <i>Hello Robert!</i> :)<p>If anything, the reason that Prolog isn't good for entire applications is that it's fundamentally a rules/database query language.
