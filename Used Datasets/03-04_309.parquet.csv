Languages and automata lead into algorithms for text processing. Architecture may be less generally useful, but I find it interesting (and unavoidable since I'm interested in compilers). Set theory and logic are sort of the base language for other topics in math. Abstract algebra seems to be the canonical way to really learn how to prove things. Graph theory and linear algebra have some more direct ties to computer science topics (e.g. linear algebra comes up a lot in 3D graphics). Combinatorics does too, but a lot of it seems to be a quick way to realize that brute force is going to be a bad idea. There are a lot of ties between some of these subjects. Algebraic graph theory applies linear and abstract algebra to graphs (I recently had a chat with a professor on applying algebraic graph theory to characterize finite automata). A lot of graph processing algorithms, of course, make more sense with a good background in graph theory. I've also run into some other interesting topics for which the math background was necessary: for example, error-correcting codes are easily understood with linear and abstract algebra.<p>The best thing studying math has done for me is to give me many different ways to describe a problem. Chances are one of the ways will have some well-developed theory behind it revealing a nice way to solve the problem. What you specifically will gain from such study will depend a lot on what you work on.",1288583762.0

Of course nobody actually needs to know the answer to this problem, but the point isn't to give an answer to that question so much as to provide an example of a certain kind of word problem. Using contrived examples to practice a skill (mathematical or otherwise) is a very common and perfectly valid pedagogical approach; Ramanathan's attack on the content of this problem fails to establish anything regarding the utility of the knowledge such a problem is intended to reinforce.<p><pre><code>    > bemoaning the innumeracy of common folk and how it is \n    > supposed to be costing billions\n</code></pre>\nLike, for example, how people don't understand how a mortgage works and consequently can't establish whether or not they can afford one?  Yeah, that hasn't hurt anyone recently.<p><pre><code>    > convinced that the path to good citizenship is through math\n</code></pre>\nRight, that's the only reasonable explanation for such behavior. Straw man again.<p><pre><code>    > and the National Assessment of Educational Progress math\n    > scores for 17-year-olds have remained stagnant since the 1980s\n</code></pre>\nThis is orthogonal to the relevance of math. ""We shouldn't teach math"" in no way follows from ""we can't teach math well.""<p><pre><code>    > How much math do you really need in everyday life? Ask \n    > yourself that -- and also the next 10 people you meet, say, your \n    > plumber, your lawyer, your grocer, your mechanic, your physician \n    > or even a math teacher.\n</code></pre>\nWell, don't ask me. I recognize that my profession (electrical engineering) requires much more math than the average person.<p>It's impossible to estimate how competent you are at something unless you have some base level of competence. So, if we don't teach (much) math, we'll also be failing to give anyone who needs it the skills to recognize whether they need more than they have. Moreover, given Ramanathan's previous stats regarding the dismal state of math education, my guess would be that most of the people he listed can't actually say whether more math would help them or not.<p>Of course, I can say without asking that lawyers need to understand the tenets of logic in order to make sound arguments, and any physician who is following literature at all needs to understand enough  statistics to grok what is being presented and judge whether the claims seem sound. And anyone who wants to make sound financial decisions needs to understand amortization, expected value, et cetera.<p><pre><code>    > That courses such as ""Quantitative Reasoning"" improve critical \n    > thinking is an unsubstantiated myth\n</code></pre>\nThat they don't is an unsubstantiated claim from G.V.R., and let's be honest: it rings hollow. I have little inclination to consult the relevant studies; recognizing that the plural of anecdote is not data, I nevertheless will stop at the observation that, e.g., learning to write mathematical proofs was, for me, a fundamental shift in the way that I approach problems of all sorts.<p><pre><code>    > As for the rest, there is no obligation to love math any more than\n    > grammar, composition, curfew or washing up after dinner.\n</code></pre>\nYou won't get any argument here from me, but the implications GVR and I take from this are very different: I, for one, have no wish to be an unwashed, ungrammatical fool.",1288583332.0

While the work was mindless and painful (LA can be hot!), there were actually a few important things I learned.<p>We often finished pools in Beverly Hills.  One job we did was a ""grout demo"".  The deck of their pool was tiled rock and they just didn't like the grout.  It ""wasn't sparkly enough"" apparently.  We didn't want to do such a pointless job that would take so much time.  So the owner of the company bid on the job.  He gave them a figure that was so ridiculously high that he wouldn't mind doing something that pointless.  They agreed (crazy people live in Beverly Hills).<p>Moral of the Story:  Find your price.  Figure out how much they would have to pay you to get you to do the same thing you've always done, regardless of how much value you feel that adds to the company.  If they balk at that price, fine.  You wouldn't want to work for less than that anyway.  If they take it... good, you are valued.",1288582210.0
