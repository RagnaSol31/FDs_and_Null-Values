For example a generic numeric multidimensional integral library would take a callback that implements the function that needs to be integrated. This function is typically computed several hundreds of thousands of times in a very tight hot loop incurring a call overhead on each one. In a C library such callbacks cannot be inlined as it is compiled ahead of time. The whole program analysis paradigm helps a lot in determining the callback function and inlining it in place, this triggers more opportunities for more conventional optimizations.<p>I think a lot of this can be done now with C++&",

Ideally, this should be readable (though verbose) on its own.<p>- Create an IDE that renders the JSON/XML using the typographical stylistic flourishes, and that possibly allows the definition of new styled &quot;blocks&quot;. This could even be done with CSS.<p>Creating a language that is sufficiently connected to its IDE that it can define new syntax highlighting, autocompletion, etc. in the code itself would go a long way toward making something like this practical.
