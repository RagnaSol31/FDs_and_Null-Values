These 'pundits', lets remember (beside the question of whether it was even accurate or significant-- enough pundits and someone will have said anything), we didn't know what the iPad was going to be. The possibility that it would be a powerful, fully-fledged OSX running computer was considered very real (remember the slamming people gave it as just a big iPhone).. if the question had been 'what do you think we will charge for our iPod touch with a bigger screen', not even the most hardcore apple pundit would have said '<$1k'.<p>Then he lingers on this issue-- talking about how much they have accomplished for the price-- almost making a value proposition for it at $999. After about a minute of $999 up on the screen he announces that '[apple] have met our cost goals'. I think this phrasing is very interesting-- he doesn't say 'we have beaten our goals', 'met our aggressive goals' or 'achieved a low cost'-- nothing to remove from the perception that it could be $999. At the point at which your expectation is highest that he is going to announce that the goal they met was a $999 ipad, and he has built tension, they dramatically drop in the real price.<p>Even the fact that they managed to manipulate their audience is in turn a suggestive indicator that this is great value, a shock, at this price. This can have a big effect when you consider that the press are not immune from this manipulation-- who then present this device as highly desirable and of great value.",1330746944.0

I strongly agree with you regarding the importance of data being used to empower relevant stakeholders. This issue has been on my mind a lot lately. I would even take it a step further: the priority should be empowering the individuals closest to the data and then working outward. So first priority is making the data empowering for students, e.g. so they have the access and tools to be more reflective about their individual results, learning practices, strengths, and so forth. Depending on age, parents would be here as well. Then teachers. And last should be using the data to empower administrators or bureaucrats. What we have seen is precisely the opposite - the people at greatest distance from the activities generating the data, i.e. the actual learning activities, are most empowered by it. This is reflective of big data business models in general. And I think that is at the heart of where the use of data in education has gone most astray. And this issue is relevant not only to government, but edutech companies as well. Are they maximizing empowering themselves with the data they are collecting to the detriment of empowering students, etc.? Who owns the insights extracted from the data? Are students free to extract their own data and take it elsewhere? etc.<p>It seems Khan Academy has taken this student-first approach as well and has put it into practice.

60,3659263,comment,3657927.0,3658814.0,1,0,polshaw,,,">buyer's remorse will set in<p>Not necessarily. Take our case of the iPad. It came out at a time when netbooks had created a new low for computer pricing. The iPad lacked a keyboard, a proper/large HDD, had a processor that was even slower, ran a smartphone OS that couldn't even multi-task properly, and had a screen resolution right out of 1995.  The 'logical' price for this would have been $200-300; pretty much the only hardware that was not a cost reduction on a netbook was the (low cost) touch layer. Yet it had excellent customer satisfaction. They created perceived value- lacking USB, storage expansion and replaceable battery were all practical disadvantages-- but these weren't things that created desire like the buttery-smooth operation provided by the GPU and capacitive touch, the large viewing angle from the IPS screen, the sleekness from having just one button etc, and the light and slimness gained by forgoing so many features available in even a netbook.<p>And it's not just something like apple does. Think of a tech 'consultant', or a fashionable web-design company. Chances are you see their prices and think 'WTF are they smoking'..I could have better than that done for me for 10x less. but their clients, i bet are pretty happy.

85,3659238,comment,3658528.0,3659153.0,1,0,sbucher,,,"Current accountability reform places too much faith in the power of incentives and hence many metrics (not only teacher effectiveness and not only the NYC accountability system) are not directed to offering any sort of guidance towards improving schools. The NYC Progress Reports, which give schools grades, are another prime example of this. Personally, I hope that the next stage in accountability will see a shift to making the data more actionable from the perspective of practitioners and it is something I have been encouraging for a few years. I think part of the obstacle, though perhaps not the primary one, is the criticism that measurements are not accurate. So given the option of re-thinking how to make actionable reports or measurements vs. just improving what exists (via extending and revising statistical methods, refining business rules, improving data quality, and including additional data sources) the latter is winning out even in areas where there may be diminishing returns to doing this.<p>On the other hand, one could argue that the issue of how to improve the schools is addressed by other projects or other areas in the system, and it sufficient for these tools just to make clear and accurate evaluations. We are dealing with a big problem, both in terms of depth and significance. So there is room to approach this from many angles.<p>Regarding the issue of making the data public (i.e. Gates' Op Ed), there are competing values at play. Yes, it will be misused and some folks will be unfairly hurt. I would rather have data public (not just the teacher effectiveness data), and allow everyone the option to create there own diverse conclusions, perform their own analyses (like the one linked to), and as a society we can become more sophisticated and knowledgeable about these issues. The alternative is that the only people that will has access to this data is bureaucrats with a specific policy agenda and a handful of academics. Broader society, especially parents, has a right to weigh-in on these issues and be a part of this discussion and they cannot do this effectively without open data. To reiterate, I don't want technocrats driving education (that is part of the broader problem with current reform); hopefully open data such as this can limit that.<p>The solution is to do a better job of disclosing the information and providing the necessary context rather than just hide it. NYTimes did a pretty sweet job in this respect . I like where they are going with schoolbook.<p>I would like to see the media and public consistently push government for better open data.
