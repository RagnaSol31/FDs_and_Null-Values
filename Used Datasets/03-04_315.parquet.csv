I try to read both 'liberal' and 'conservative' media to get both sides of the stories. I feel a lot of arguments could be avoided and consensus more easily achieved if more people tried to understand what the 'other side' thinks/feels ... and so I try to keep myself 'educated' by reading all sorts of media.",1278906963.0

More than any other company, Apple has improved the state of the art in cell phones for US consumers. Now they are getting sued because they didn't improve it even more. Reminds me of Samuel Johnson's description of a critic:<p>""Criticism is a study by which men grow important and formidable at a very small expense. The power of invention has been conferred by nature upon few, and the labour of learning those sciences which by mere labour be obtained is too great to be willingly endured; but every man can exert such judgment as he has upon the works of others; and he whom nature has made weak, and idleness keeps ignorant, may yet support his vanity by the name of a critick.""\nJohnson:  Idler ",

23,1506729,comment,1506578.0,1506578.0,0,0,Diogenes,,,"Those claiming here that Fox news are lying bastards are probably going to be equaled by the number of people here claiming that NPR leans left.  As objectively as I can observe, the real outliers (far to the left) are the entire NBC/MSNBC set of stations and Newsweek (which is about to go under anyway).  Among ABC and CBS, I think the only valuable sources are 60 minutes (which can lean left) and CBS Sunday Morning (which isn't hard news, but is informative and entertaining).<p>Again, in my opinion, NPR <i>leans</i> left.  Fox news <i>leans</i> right.  And if you want to watch the NEWS programming on Fox, then it is usually accurate as opposed to the OPINION programming on Fox like Glen Beck and O'Reilly.<p>Surprisingly enough, the most worldly, unbiased, informed and thorough daily news sources are the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  Unfortunately, both of them use some combination of pay-for-service access - which changes regularly as the newspaper industry figures it out.  They're both very close to centered, although the editorial boards lean left and right respectively.  The big difference, however, is that both also give voice to dissenting opinions (where appropriate - on the OPINION pages) and publish well-thought-out, if contrary, letters to the editor.<p>Some of the other commenters are right - you need to take a look at multiple sources and discern for yourself not only where they sit on the political spectrum, but also the percentage of news to bullshit each chooses to publish.",1278906185.0

It's unclear to me that I'm actually faster at this point, but I downloaded a speed test app -- I clocked myself at 47 wpm in one run, 100% accuracy. Cherry-picking the best number, to be sure, but still.<p>More importantly, it felt like the switch from button-mashing to T9. Swype is the way typing on a touchscreen should work: gestures that know what you want. So many of the brilliant idioms popularized by the iPhone (pinch zoom, left/right swipe to get between screens) are, in my opinion, why touch screens work at all for a phone. Buttons are unsatisfying due to the lack of tactile feedback; gestures feel natural and expressive. Given all that, making gestures the way you enter text makes me that much happier using the phone for typing at all.<p>To answer your question: Swype is in no way a replacement for a traditional keyboard. It's a language entry tool, and it's as useless as the stock iPhone/Android keyboard for things like keyboard shortcuts and arbitrary strings. As far as I can tell, I'll never move to a touchscreen keyboard for regular work because it's such an efficient interaction tool (if you live in tools like emacs/vim/command line like me). Swype actually limits the overall universe of your input[1], but it makes the common mode of language very easy.<p>Short answer: no, Swype doesn't try or succeed in replacing hardware keyboards.<p>Now that you've got me thinking about it, though, a full-sized Swype keyboard set up with better modified key support and a dictionary that included keyboard shortcuts in the app you were working in would be pretty great. Take vim: all those 2-4 letter combinations you type all the time would be available to you, and you could apply heuristics based on your document to help fill in more free-form keys like find-replace strings. You could even find ways to structure the shortcuts around easy directions, essentially re-inventing keyboard shortcuts as well-placed single swipes of a finger.  Somebody with more time than I have now could work that into a neat proof of concept.<p>[1]I mean, you can still use it like the stock keyboard, but that's not the kind of interaction I'm talking about.",1278904431.0
