To take this to an extreme, a compiler that deletes any source files that contain UB could be compliant, but would also be one that no one ever wants. Much of the utility of C comes from its use as a &quot;portable high-level assembler&quot;, meaning that its constructs are supposed to intuitively map almost directly to machine instructions. Aggressively optimising compilers that exploit UB violate this, so they are not in the spirit of the language: UB is either unintentional (a bug), in which case the compiler should issue a warning; or it is intentional, in which case the compiler should translate it with the intention the programmer had in mind. Making assumptions that &quot;UB will never occur&quot; and using that for optimisation is &quot;wrongheaded and dangerous&quot;; C&",
