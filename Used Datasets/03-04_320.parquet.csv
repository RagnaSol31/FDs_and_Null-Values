Escaping from poverty means being careful about debt.<p>The debate is actually about what informational tools people have available to them.  This is demonstrated by your statement:<p>>It's not hard to stay out of debt - you simply have to heed the message that money is transmitting to you.<p>which is equivalently ""It's not hard to stay out of debt if you're equipped with the attitudes that let you stay out of debt"" which is tautological and therefore a non-statement.  My point is that poverty _means_ being less likely to understand money.<p>My point is _not_ accurately summed up by ""But one shouldn't have to forgo an education to avoid going into debt.""  I make no assertion about what a person _should_ do because that doesn't have anything to do with what they actually will do.  I would prefer the phrasing ""People _will_ choose a risk of debt in order to have their kids better educated"" as that more accurately captures the situation.  Not all of the people who put it all on the line to live in a better neighborhood ended up in debt.  Some of them got lucky and did not have medical emergencies--for them, the risk paid off.<p>So your statement about whether or not schools are ""overwhelmingly important"" is true but irrelevant.  Schools aren't overwhelmingly important, but they _are_ important.  They improve the odds of success.  Your personal success in a shit-hole school does not speak to the average of that school nor does it comment on whether or not it is sensible for a parent to risk additional debt for a better school.",1296877194

If they choose to leave their old ways upon discovering/learning (through whatever means) our ways, what does that matter? Please explain why these things are bad to me.

It's not hard to stay out of <i>debt</i> - you simply have to heed the message that money is transmitting to you.<p><i>Poverty</i> is a wider question, and includes whether or not it is fair & just that some people have to make the sacrifices needed to stay out of debt.  When I say that you can simply choose not to send your kids to college to avoid taking on crippling student loan debt, that is a 100% factually true statement.  When you then say ""But one shouldn't have to forgo an education to avoid going into debt"", that's a <i>normative</i> statement.

Glad to see someone mention it.<p>My rough interpretation of the article is that cheap labour from Poland distorted the Irish economy, and the banking contagion resulted in loans to the Polish who couldn't afford the loans, and subsequently disappeared, especially once the whole economy went sour.<p>An important difference to Ireland's story is that the people who make up Australia's cheap imported labour face greater restrictions in entering the country as they are, with the exception of New Zealanders who are have the same living standards as Australians, international students (and possibly people on working holiday visas) who, to my understanding, are required to demonstrate sufficient funds to get by. Staying on after graduation of whatever course is not guaranteed and has become more difficult post a recent policy change. Australia runs a points system in issuing residency visas and has just cut the number occupations/courses which receive points.<p>My feeling is that the same expectations fueled bubble has arisen here (I'm in Melb) but has been sustained by the resilient resources dependent economy as well as the capital inflows from those who see Australia as an attractive place to invest and/or also live/have a holiday home.<p>""real-estate bubbles never end with soft landings. A bubble is inflated by nothing firmer than expectations.""<p>Although the factors driving the housing bubble in Australia are different from those in Ireland, if we concede there is a bubble in Australia, and we listen to economics professor Morgan Kelly, we're due for a crash.<p>A couple counterpoints to the above: China's demand for resources will probably span another two or three decades, and also Australia's financial lending practices are not and haven't been as lax as those of Ireland or the US.",1296875199
