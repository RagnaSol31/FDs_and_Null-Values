It's a great asset and I think everyone benefits which I know was one of your goals.<p>However, I'm glad you're leaving.  You've become so dogmatic, so preachy, and so full of immutable opinions and religious stances on how the ""community"" should behave, down to the most micro of behaviors, all while saying that the community owns the process and makes the decisions, while at the same time expressing intolerance for those who do not see things your way.  You talk at people, not to people.  Ironically some of these attributes are what made SO so successful.  You've also become arrogant.  I've heard you on numerous podcasts where you spend the first 5 minutes telling the interviewers what you will <i>not</i> talk about.  Who are you?  You should be happy you're getting attention.  And on your blog, which you built over so much time with so much effort and with which cultivated your huge audience, you've become absent.  The guy who is all about the community hasn't participated in a discussion in your blog comments in quite some time.  You just can't have it both ways.  Additionally, you lived so deep in the weeds of SO user behaviors and in the intricate meta details of how the site works that you lost sight of the bigger picture.  You became so meta that the metas had metas that had metas.  The first incarnation of the podcast jumped the shark and was killed because of this yet the second incarnation focused on this almost exclusively.  The vast majority of SO users have no interest in this level of meta; I'm not even sure who the podcast audience was.<p>A company CTO isn't just a technologist; it's a business person.  Someone who makes decisions - business decisions - based not just on their own techie insular opinions but on many factors.  You're not a business person and that's not a criticism.  You're a developer, an evangelist, a vision guy.  Stackoverflow is a business, not a pulpit for spreading your views on how people should behave online.<p>I'm thankful for what you've created; I benefit from it often.

Not to mention that given they cater the high end of the market, they do offer the best prices, or near. Can you find a cheaper touch tablet or phone? Yes. Can you find a cheaper tablet or phone that you feel it belongs in the same league?

For others, it's still the primary means of business communication.<p>My work e-mail is largely about communications, with a todo element to it and unfortunately some file storage too. My ""home"" e-mail is completely different. It's where I get my monthly statements for banks and investments and where my notifications go.

My e-mail client (web or otherwise) should know that an e-mail in this case is actually just a twitter DM notification and be smart about how it presents that to me. It should know that something from Bank of America is probably something I want to keep, but something else from Bank of America is just marketing junk.<p>I haven't seen anything that is smart enough to do that on it's own.
