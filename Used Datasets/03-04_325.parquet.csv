20,4469024,comment,4468731.0,4468849.0,27,0,lkrubner,,,"Lisp had a condition system that was very clever. You still had to write the code, but you were able to separate the problem, the handling, and the restart.<p>This is the problem that comes up in many languages and which needs to be dealt with:<p>""Because each function is a black box, function boundaries are an excellent place to deal with errors. Each function--low, for example--has a job to do. Its direct caller--medium in this case--is counting on it to do its job. However, an error that prevents it from doing its job puts all its callers at risk: medium called low because it needs the work done that low does; if that work doesn't get done, medium is in trouble. But this means that medium's caller, high, is also in trouble--and so on up the call stack to the very top of the program. On the other hand, because each function is a black box, if any of the functions in the call stack can somehow do their job despite underlying errors, then none of the functions above it needs to know there was a problem--all those functions care about is that the function they called somehow did the work expected of it.<p>In most languages, errors are handled by returning from a failing function and giving the caller the choice of either recovering or failing itself. Some languages use the normal function return mechanism, while languages with exceptions return control by throwing or raising an exception. Exceptions are a vast improvement over using normal function returns, but both schemes suffer from a common flaw: while searching for a function that can recover, the stack unwinds, which means code that might recover has to do so without the context of what the lower-level code was trying to do when the error actually occurred.<p>Consider the hypothetical call chain of high, medium, low. If low fails and medium can't recover, the ball is in high's court. For high to handle the error, it must either do its job without any help from medium or somehow change things so calling medium will work and call it again. The first option is theoretically clean but implies a lot of extra code--a whole extra implementation of whatever it was medium was supposed to do. And the further the stack unwinds, the more work that needs to be redone. The second option--patching things up and retrying--is tricky; for high to be able to change the state of the world so a second call into medium won't end up causing an error in low, it'd need an unseemly knowledge of the inner workings of both medium and low, contrary to the notion that each function is a black box.<p>Common Lisp's error handling system gives you a way out of this conundrum by letting you separate the code that actually recovers from an error from the code that decides how to recover. Thus, you can put recovery code in low-level functions without committing to actually using any particular recovery strategy, leaving that decision to code in high-level functions.<p>To get a sense of how this works, let's suppose you're writing an application that reads some sort of textual log file, such as a Web server's log. Somewhere in your application you'll have a function to parse the individual log entries. Let's assume you'll write a function, parse-log-entry, that will be passed a string containing the text of a single log entry and that is supposed to return a log-entry object representing the entry. This function will be called from a function, parse-log-file, that reads a complete log file and returns a list of objects representing all the entries in the file.<p>To keep things simple, the parse-log-entry function will not be required to parse incorrectly formatted entries. It will, however, be able to detect when its input is malformed. But what should it do when it detects bad input? In C you'd return a special value to indicate there was a problem. In Java or Python you'd throw or raise an exception. In Common Lisp, you signal a condition.<p>A condition is an object whose class indicates the general nature of the condition and whose instance data carries information about the details of the particular circumstances that lead to the condition being signaled.3 In this hypothetical log analysis program, you might define a condition class, malformed-log-entry-error, that parse-log-entry will signal if it's given data it can't parse.""<p><a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-co...</a><p>Read the whole thing.

Even getting error handling and testing to be a trivial percent of the actual useful code would be a major improvement.  At the moment my testing code is around the same size as the useful code plus error handling, and error handling is around 10% to 50% of the code.<p>I think part of the problem is error reporting is still somewhat shaky.  To a certain extent you only actually need to handle errors that occur in the real world.  Some languages like Java and Python can get you a reasonable amount of information when an exception occurs, but you still have to find mechanisms to report it back, and chances are you won't have detailed program state or operations leading up to the error.  But if you did you could in theory release programs with no error handling as alpha releases (in the original sense, not current marketing usage) and see what shakes out.<p>> I dont know what kind of testing you have in mind<p>Using fdr's example of a cat program, it consists of an open, a sequence of read followed by write and a close.  I would like to point the language/environment at that and say ""test it"" with no further effort.

You seem to want someone who can make it <i>disappear</i>, or at least get as close as possible to that ideal. I feel your pain, but I fear you are asking the impossible. :-(<p>Some errors are recoverable, and maybe it would be helpful to have default policies like if the file is read only, have the OS prompt the user to make it writeable and retry to take care of a lot of the repetitive coding work in those cases. At least then we wouldnt have to do things like writing a top-level file-handling operation in a loop that tries (in the exception handling sense) to do something, and if any recoverable error occurs, attempts a suitable recovery and goes back to try again. On the other hand, to have some sort of default policy, youd need something in the semantics of your language to indicate which policies should apply and where. By that point, you might not be doing much better than a try-catch in a loop.<p>In the end, though, not all errors are recoverable, and that is the fundamental problem. Some errors are fatal, and you just can't carry on as normal or rely on some automatically generated default behaviour, because the semantics of your program are now broken. What would you want to see that you dont have today in terms of minimising this kind of error handling code or making it easier to test?<p>I dont know what kind of testing you have in mind, but one thing Id really like to see going mainstream is a serious effect system built into the type system of the language. That would be useful for a lot of reasons, one of which might be checking that whatever error handling constructs were available didnt do things like leaving effects half-applied, transactions open, or resources locked, in the event of a change of plan because of an error condition. I expect some relatively near-future languages will start to pay more attention to formal effect systems as fields like distributed systems, concurrency and security become ever more important in the programming mainstream.
