Despite working the hardest I have ever worked in my life, I barely made it through Demo Day, and my Demo Day presentation was not exactly riveting. Furthermore, after Demo Day, you still have to continue building the business.<p>Solo, first-time founders will undoubtedly lack the emotional support systems necessary to give them even a baseline sense of sanity and the mental clarity to persevere. They are far more likely to make stupid and irrational decisions. It was not until I found a cofounder, long after YC, that our company began to behave even remotely like a normal company.<p>Having a cofounder to share the load with has unforeseen compounding value that one does not have the awareness of to offset in their first company. Maybe in a second or third company you can pull it off by planning around the repercussions of being a solo founder. Unfortunately, without previous experience, you will have no idea how to do that.",1353211106.0

I think once you raise lots of money and have reached product market fit, whether you have a cofounder is not all that important.\nYet, the solo founder discrimination starts at the beginning stage. Sure, there is data to back it up. But the sample size is small to begin with given how reluctant they are at funding solo founders.\nI think the biggest reason is probably once past YC, VC and other investors don't fund solo founders. It's really hard to break the conventional wisdom that all the large companies are started by a team. What I am trying to point out is that this conventional wisdom is deeply rooted in a time when the cost of starting up is very high.\nSo, the real question is if you can build a prototype, gain traction and make revenue, why is it still frown upon that you are a solo founder.",1353211093.0

8,4799778,comment,4799479.0,4799691.0,2,0,leif,,,"We don't do anything super special here. Most databases have some notion of ""node"" (or in mongo, ""bucket"", to distinguish from a machine as a node in a cluster), and keep track of which nodes in memory are clean or dirty. We log all operations and by default, fsync that on commit, so we're completely durable, there's no data loss (unless you didn't commit something before you pulled the plug, of course). To trim the log, you have to know that everything dirtied by a transaction has been written to disk, and if you don't trim the log often enough, it gets big and your crash recovery takes a long time (innodb sometimes exhibits this). We and others have a notion of ""checkpointing"" which says ""all the nodes as of this point in the log has been written to disk and marked clean"", and that allows us to trim the log. Note that this doesn't have to mean ""stop the world and write out everything in main memory"", you can do a lot better (but that's a long discussion).<p>Because a given operation, even if it involves lots of random writes in the key space, still only dirties a few nodes at the top of the tree, we actually checkpoint faster and by writing less data than the same b-tree would (because it would have to checkpoint a bunch of leaves, with random I/O, for every one of our nodes), so our log is often much smaller and our recovery times are much faster, usually on the order of seconds or minutes, rather than hours. By default in our mysql product, we checkpoint every...I think 60 seconds, but it could be 90. It's configurable but that's the ballpark.<p>But most of my comparisons here are with innodb, to be fair. Mongodb's storage system doesn't support transactions and we're still learning about its durability and recovery model, so I can't make any totally fair claims comparing us to them.<p>(I love talking about this stuff, so keep up the curiosity)",1353210909.0

(Please contact me at using the feedback form on congocart.com or master-technology.com) I would like one of us (I'm willing to volenteer) to contact Mr. Qunibi of Novus partners in a position of consensuses from those who actually have code in the product.\n\n   My thoughts that would I believe be amicable (i.e. win/win) to both sides is that they can have our permission to take ALL of our changes closed source in the own future versions as long as we also (the community) may use the last release under the open source (Apache) license it has been under since shortly after it was released on there official novus github account and go our own separate way.   I know my changes were really early to the library and some of my code may not even exist anymore (lol).   \n\n    But I believe the cost for them to audit the whole library and rip out all of our changes and rewrite it all could be major -- I believe Bob could legally remove all of our code; but for the actual re-implementation Bob would have to hand it off to someone to do a fully clean-room version to make them legally safe from being sued.   And that could be very costly in time and resources.   Cost wise for them It might even be cheaper for them to ditch the last 6-7 months of changes and to just revert to the version before my patch/commit (which was issue ,

What business goal is promoted by such a retraction?  It seems like it will just generate controversy, tarnish the company's reputation, and lead to endless ownership fights with contributors.<p>In addition, I suspect that major open-source projects usually actually do have the approval of people who have the authority to make that decision.<p>> What happens to the commits by other authors to the source tree?  Do they own the copyright to their commits, even if they modify invalid open source code?<p>My understanding is that a contributor (or his employer) owns the copyright to his own patches when they are written.  Larger open-source projects often require contributor agreements before they'll accept patches; the contributor must legally give the copyright to the project as a condition of their patch being incorporated into the official tree.  If there's no contributor agreement in place, the patches continue to belong to the contributor.<p>You can think of the pre-patch tree and the patch as two parent nodes of the patched version.  Novus owns the pre-patch tree; the contributor owns the patch; the post-patch tree is a derivative work of both of them, and can only be distributed with permission of both owners.<p>The contributor's patches may be useless without the parent tree to patch against.  But if the contributors own the copyright to their patches, they can still use that copyright to forbid Novus from using or distributing the patched child tree.<p>> How does the open source community react when this happen?<p>Read the Google group and see.  My feeling of how they <i>should</i> react is by the contributors banding together and telling Novus the following:<p>We contributed patches to Novus based on the understanding that the patched software would be released publicly as open source.<p>As soon as Novus became aware of the situation, it made a clear, unambiguous statement that Novus is not, and never was, willing to agree to these terms.<p>Therefore, since Novus does not accept the terms under which we gave them the patches, we revoke all permission for Novus to use these patches, or any version of the software which includes them.<p>If the contributors do this, and Novus is using the project internally, then Novus will have to either (1) back down and say that they're okay with open-source after all, (2) spend engineering resources on proprietary reimplementation of the features the community gave them for free, or (3) live without those features.  Only option (1) lacks significant cost and/or risk from Novus's point of view.<p>> Perhaps there are reasonable solutions to these<p>This suggests that the more contributors an open-source project has, the stronger it is against any one person or company claiming ownership in this way.  The remaining contributors can band together in response and pull out their patches, leaving the proprietary project at a feature-poor, ancient version -- especially compared to people's still-fresh memories of the open-source version -- if not making it entirely nonfunctional.  The contributors could even attempt to make their patches useful again with an independent implementation which presents the same interface as Novus's now-proprietary code.  Or they could toss their patches and rewrite the library from scratch.  It would presumably take much less effort because, while they can't re-use the proprietary code from the Novus version, it should be okay to re-use the design decisions and API that may have been a big reason that the Novus version was so successful.",1353210101.0

I'm the only unreplaceable person in the company at this time, I worked for 10 years before I even got to the point of incorporating, and if I left to start something else, the company would immediately fold. I recruited every person, and could unilaterally let anyone go. It's my money and reputation on the line. I wrote the business plan, designed the product, and most importantly, identified the market and invented a way to reach it and fund the company during growth.<p>In five years, yeah, I'll be able to move on without killing the company. But not now, not when it's still a startup.<p>Dropbox was the same, and pg nevertheless counts it in the multi-founder column.

Multi-founder companies shrink the available pool of founders.<p>Assume the pool of available founders is fixed at any given point in time. By requiring start ups to have 2 or more founders, YC is able to capture a larger part of that pool, harming competitive incubators and increasing the likelihood that the founders they've been able to capture will produce for YC.<p>2. Split ownership is much easier for YC to manipulate favorably.<p>By providing YC with two or more avenues to affect the actions of a company, the autonomy of a founder is reduced even below the numerical amount: a single founder in a company with two isn't just half as influential, it's probably more like 1/3. The extra influence is retained by YC, which can play the founders against each other.<p>3.
