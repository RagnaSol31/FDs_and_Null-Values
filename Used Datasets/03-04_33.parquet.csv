That this criminal syndicate, which spans the health insurance, legal and financial industries and for which health care is merely the bordello on which the operations cash flow depends; is regarded as a legitimate business is merely one symptom of how corrupt our society really is.<p>There is an entire industry devoted to extorting money from people under the threat of illness and death. And yet those who run it are considered fine upstanding members of society; always good for a donation to a good cause.<p>If you go looking it's not too hard to find instances of people who paid in to health insurance for decades, only to be stripped of their coverage when they became ill.<p>Tying it to jobs makes it even worse, if you know you need medical coverage, you basically can't leave your job; even if it's to start a company that would produce much more value for society than the job left behind.<p>As it stands now, on average Americans spend twice as much and get worse health outcomes compared to the citizens of any other industrialized nation. It is a disgrace and a crime, and we need to start labeling it a crime and treating it as such.",1242014386

We spent the first five weeks learning/using ML, recently switched to Scheme, and will dive into Ruby for a few weeks before the quarter ends. While I'm sure many of my peers will leave the course thinking of functional languages as a quirky set of under-developed relatives to the tried-and-true OO family, I've spent the last 6 weeks breathing functional programming, both in my coursework and in places like this thread. I feel that I'm taking more away from the class and that much of introductory computer science works this way. The burden of learning is on the student to become engaged in the subject matter and make use of the resources the school and professor provides.<p>At the end of the day, the department won't make the student great. To a degree, a driven and talented student can succeed anywhere, regardless of how many ooh's and aah's a name-dropping of their school will produce.",1242014380

Even if all you do is use the camera in auto mode the ability of the better lens to let in more light will produce the better picture all other things being equal. If you also have a camera that has a larger light sensitive ""film"" area you will also get a better picture with the same inputs.
