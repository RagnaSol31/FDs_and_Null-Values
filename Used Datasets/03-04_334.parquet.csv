If you read the article, Einstein also warned that a planned economy did not preclude the enslavement of the individual.<p>Living is essentially a contradiction - each human being is an individual and as a creature of nature, possesses instincts which guards against others who seek to deprive him/her of his individuality and his chance to live. Yet he/she benefits from cooperating with others to achieve a greater goal larger than the sum of his/her parts.<p>This is a never ending struggle and it has dominated political discussion for twentieth century. It disappoints me that most people would take an extreme position - i.e. capitalism is good/evil or socialism is good/evil - leaves us no room to negotiate solutions which will work out for the individual and society.",1299902397.0

EDIT:  In other words, ""I just turned mine on"" shouldn't get any reading on any system that is more accurate than about 10 meters.  It takes time to get accurate readings with GPS.<p>Someone with a more recent credential/professional experience want to confirm or deny that recollection -- or even update it with more recent facts?

LuaJIT also performs <i>quite</i> well, and IMHO is very pleasant to work with. Either way, Lisp performance is quite good, <i>significantly</i> better than Python or Ruby, which are often good enough.<p>Lisp's convenient format for data was a HUGE win, for a while, but other languages have caught up. Python has dicts, Lua has tables, Javascript has JSON, ML has its variant types, Erlang inherited Prolog's terms (its parallel to Lisp's s-expressions), etc. All of the above are <i>extremely</i> useful. Expressive data and simple code is far easier to maintain than overly simple data and compensatingly elaborate code. Languages without a good high-level format for structured data either lose out on a lot of functionality, or (sigh) fall back on XML.<p>Also, Quicklisp is quite nice, and props to Xach for setting it in motion.",1299901932.0

Ex. although I can't prove to you the correctness or to create a good hash function that still doesn't prevent me from understanding basic concepts such as hash collisions due to excessive entries or the look up speed O(1) of hash vs O(log(n)) for btrees. On the other hand, if I actually were to implement search for a project I would just use MySQL(I don't need to understand set theory at all to be able to write efficient queries with a firm understanding of the role of indexes).<p>Never tried programing in scala, but I have no problems with functional programming concepts like map/reduce(currently doing a lot of new projects in couchdb because I think its more interesting to writing sql queries).<p>I also would like to point out that none of the example you gave require calculus, which was the requirement that I found to be a bit ridiculous and all of your examples involve very different branches of mathematics with very little overlap and most computer algorithms can be applied to great effect without a perfect understanding of the mathematical foundation or proof of correctness. At what point do you stop and ask whether you are teaching too much math and not enough computer science?<p>I would agree that its easy to pickup how to code but nearly impossible to become a good coder on your own without criticisms and feedback from others. The quality of code I've read some really atrocious code from cs graduate students or engineers all of whom have a extremely good understanding of math. And I would also argue that it is very unrealistic to expect someone to download and read tens and thousands of lines of open source code and hop on IRC to discuss why things were done certain ways with the maintainers.

This is a critical difference to libertarian types: (as I understand) they advocate tort laws -- you are liable for the damage and injury you cause; but not most regulation -- government mandates actions to <i>prevent</i> you from causing damage or injury. Building codes are the latter.<p>So I disagree with your analogy with the Hammurabi laws.

Learning Lisp will teach you new and genuinely mind-expanding ideas (e.g. continuations), much like learning C and suddenly understanding pointers. Many other languages have been strongly influenced by elements from it, because its design makes it particularly convenient for prototyping languages. After learning Lisp, a lot of ""experimental"" ideas in (say) Ruby really won't be all that surprising - they've already been debated for <i>over thirty years</i>, after all. There are also many great research papers and books about <i>programming</i> that use a Lisp dialect as their lingua franca. (I'd suggest learning <i>at least</i> enough Lisp to read Peter Norvig's _Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming_, but maybe you're a tl;dr kind of person.)<p>Still, Lisp isn't the <i>only</i> language you should learn. It's not like it sits alone, atop some mountain, wrapped in golden clouds. I learned a ton about language semantics from Lisp, sure, but I've also found inspiration in Prolog (unification!), OCaml (static typing, done right! plus LOTS of good compiler texts), Erlang, Forth, K, Oz, Lua, awk, Self, and many others over the years. I also prefer a mix of Lua, C, and Erlang for real work, though I know many people that prefer Common Lisp or various Scheme dialects. (Chicken and Scheme48 are both pretty practical, imho.)<p>It's much like learning object-oriented programming <i>and</i> functional programming <i>and</i> constraint/logic programming <i>and</i> several different styles of databases <i>and</i> Perl <i>and</i> ...

It also shares with other dynamic languages the features of closures, currying, and the usual benefits of first-class functions. Scheme (as opposed to Common Lisp) has continuations, which are very powerful. These are all features that open the mind to new ways of thinking, hopefully for the better.<p>In the realm of the pragmatic -<p>Lisp- unlike other modern dynamic languages I know of ( I think Smalltalk can do this)- maintains an ability to version running objects in a system. It can perform hot-swapping of code remotely without bringing the run-time down. I haven't delved into this deeply yet, but I plan to later on. I <i>believe</i> Erlang is the only other major language that can hotswap well. Further, unlike the other mainstream dynamicaly typed languages going (Ruby, Perl, Python), Common Lisp can compile functions directly to native code. You will find SBCL is one of the best dynamic language contenders on the Alioth Shootout. (I'm not sure how Haskell and OCamls classify - I think they might generate binaries).<p>Therefore, Lisp is a good candidate for code that requires 'relatively' good performance, but isn't worth taking the time to do in C++.<p>The commercial Lisp implementations have GUIs that are supposed to work seamlessly on any of the 3 major OSs. That's a major feature in my book.<p>Lisp is famous for its ability to be expressive via its macro facility and the regular notation. So if you have a problem which your language is fighting you with - maybe you should find Lisp and check it out.<p>I've done some small work with a Lisp program that dynamically created random functions and then mucked with them on the fly in an optimization effort. It was, bluntly put, trivial to do the meta-function work. The chief difficulty was the actual algorithm (and my inexperience with Lisp. :-) ).<p>In regards to basic Lisp data storage, it is analogous to JSON's relationship with Javascript: really easy.<p>So to move this from a boostering to an engineering post, I'd like to consider some of the cons of Lisp.<p>Con 1 is the tooling. It's not as flashy as Java's or C",

Russian nuclear reactors were designed to be <i>over-moderated</i>, while modern power reactors are <i>under-moderated</i>.<p>The moderator is the substance which slows down the neutrons to a speed where they're likely to fission with the Uranium-235 in the fuel. This is typically water. Water can also absorb neutrons, so it has a poison effect as well. When the moderating effect of the water dominates its poison effects, the reactor is said to be <i>under-moderated</i>. When the moderator is reduced (for example, when it boils away), the reactor becomes less efficient, so it reduces power. This is called a <i>negative temperature coefficient</i>.<p>The Soviets, however, designed their reactors to be <i>over-moderated</i>, for efficiency. Thus, when the water heated up, and started boiling away, the net result was to increase the efficiency of the reactor (a <i>positive temperature coefficient</i>), since the water was more of a poison than a moderator. Because the reactor is now more efficient, it got even hotter, and boiled more water away. You know the rest.<p>We've learned a lot about designing safe reactors since Chernobyl, and it's extremely unlikely that an accident on the scale of Chernobyl will happen again (not only because of the moderation issue).<p>I hope this helps to alleviate your concerns.
