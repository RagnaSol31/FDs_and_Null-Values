It brings all of the expectations of corporate america to the position that I don't think belong there. As much as I think companies are one of the best ways to innovate and compete in the world I don't think government should be run like a company.<p>CTO is a top down position where you get to call the shots. This government position is just doesn't have that kind of power (nor should it) and I think the name should reflect that.

That choice might not ""work"" if you're in the clergy, or a school principal, but making that choice as a caf owner or software company spokesperson falls a long way short of ""not acceptable"", at least in my book.<p>It's always impossible to measure the _really_ interesting stuff, but I wonder if 37Signals earned more benefit from people thinking things like ""DHH is _really_ passionate about his business."" than they lost from people who though ""he used curse words on Twitter, I don't want to do business with him anymore""?

The person doing the copying entirely lacks knowledge of the process that is required to produce good work, and has no idea why the site they admire so much works so well.\nEven putting copyright and ethical concerns aside, I would have no interest in working with someone who lacks the competence to understand why wholesale copying is usually a stupid idea.

I remember your post about your YC experiences, and it was great, especially since I was considering doing something like this and really identified with it.  I think I probably would have quit my job anyways, but getting into an accelerator like TechStars really made it a no-brainer.<p>I'd like to raise the point that the idea you apply with doesn't matter a ton.  It should be good enough to show that you're not stupid, but that's about it.  We've already changed what we're working on significantly based on early customer development and discussions with the amazing TechStars mentors.  It's actually been a little hard to convince myself that the reason we got accepted was like 90% team and only 10% idea (totally made up numbers, of course, but you get the drift).<p>I completely bought into the concept of an accelerator validating your idea, and that was really just kind of wrong (at least in our case).<p>Anyways, thanks again for the comment.
