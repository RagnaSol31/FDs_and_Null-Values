Given the obvious nature of fake likes, some of the heuristics seem very straight forward i.e.<p>- just filter profiles with an insane number of likes<p>- have very few friends but relatively a huge number of likes,<p>- certain regions in the world where the brands that the users have liked have no market. It looks like a straightforward matching problem.<p>- Suspicious Like activity and patterns from an account (like/click arrival rates, diversity in liked campaigns etc).<p>- De-duplication of profiles that may have liked a certain \nentity by clustering on some obvious signals e.g. if too many disproportionate likes all fall in egypt relative to other primary markets, that would be an obvious red flag.<p>All of the above is not difficult to figure out for the quality of talent Facebook has.
