I'm no Rails expert, but I've never encountered a Rails plugin that was configurable without using Ruby. (Which is, of course, perfectly in line with Rails design goals and philosophy.)<p>The majority of Drupal modules are designed to be used without writing a single line of PHP code. (This is not to say that Drupal developers don't end up writing PHP code anyway... or that this design philosophy doesn't often lead to unusable confusion, or that it doesn't entail some big compromises, of which the tendency to have code stored in the <i>database</i> is one of the most annoying. But I have seen quite impressive Drupal sites built by people who refuse to touch PHP. That's a big selling point.)<p>So, no: This isn't Drupal. But we are getting there!",1238990346.0

It turns out that married people who seek prostitutes do so for the 'thrill,' and sex is a distant second. There are many parallels here: women who shoplift are often rich, they do it because they can't stand the boredom.

She argues that there is a continuum from physical beauty to mathematical symmetry and elegance to traffic laws to a representative democracy -- which is related to ancient Greek naval warfare, fwiw.  It's vaguely utopian, in the sense that she seems to suggest that universal is enough, and the cranky shadows in the basement don't really enter the book.

32,548262,comment,547938.0,548125.0,0,0,nostrademons,,,"No idea why they turned you down then. :-)<p>As for whether to join someone else's startup or start your own - I'd say do whichever will answer more questions about your future life (in answering them, it'll raise more).  If you feel you absolutely must start a company to be fulfilled, go do it.  That's how I felt, though I waited until I was out of college and had a couple years of work experience under my belt.  I started it, it failed miserably, and it was still one of the best decisions I made in my life.<p>In my case, I worked for someone else's startup in my gap year, just because the opportunity presented itself.  My math teacher was starting a company; his company had a wholly owned subsidiary that was doing a teen-content .com; it was being staffed exclusively by teenagers (many of whom were my friends from high school); did I want to join?  Of course I did.  You will probably learn more technical skills working for someone else than you will on your own; there's a vast body of knowledge in everyday software engineering that's largely passed from engineer-to-engineer, and you miss out on a lot of it if you only learn from the Internet.  OTOH, you will probably learn more about yourself and what you want if you start your own company.<p>It's hard for me to say precisely what I learned in my gap year, because most knowledge takes the form of skills, not facts, and you can't reduce skills to words.  I do think it was one of the most educational experiences, perhaps the most educational, that I'd had up to that point in my life.  A quick list, based on what I remember 8 years later:<p>I learned Perl scripting (actually, I sorta knew it before, but I learned it better.)  I learned how there's always a core group of people that actually get things done while the rest of the office takes long lunches and bitches about how the core group is usurping their authority.  I learned how to exaggerate your PR budget so companies pay attention to you.  I learned how to feed newspapers a hook so that they do a story on you (""all teenage dot-com"" actually got us a lot of free publicity), and I learned that all this PR doesn't matter if your product sucks.  I learned that what you think of as ""intelligent"" content usually just seems pretentious to other people.  I learned that even if you start with users, they'll leave if you take away the reason they came - and that reason is not always obvious to you as the designer of the site.  I learned that teenagers can be just as vicious at office politics as adults.  Actually, this last one is a really broad lesson.  Next time you think ""That guy is evil; I could do his job so much better"", think about what you would actually do if you were placed in his job and had to operate under his constraints.  Chances are, you'd be just as incompetent and evil as he is.<p>Anyway, I'm only 3 months into my gap year...<p>I learned about version control and IDEs.  I learned Java Swing.  I learned about maintaining other people's code, and that it's basically a waste of time to fix their formatting (other than mixed tabs/spaces, which should always be converted to spaces. ;-))  I learned about OOP and how to split up responsibilities between classes.  Unfortunately I didn't learn about avoiding cyclic dependencies, but at least I was primed so I could understand why this was a problem when I learned it in college.  I learned that your first attempt at a program usually turns out badly, even if you have 30 years of experience under your belt, and so you should always be revising and refactoring your code.  I learned that companies will often shift their business plan entirely when they are a week away from beta.  I learned that this is not always a good idea.<p>I learned that cool projects often go to the guy who happens to be in the office at the time someone dreams them up (sorry, Trevor).  I learned how to design UIs myself and get them working.  I learned that you should always, always try to code things up incrementally, working in small chunks, though I had to relearn this about 5 times more before it really sank in.  I ""learned"" C++ and why manual memory management sucks.  While I should've been debugging those segfaults, I learned that thousands of fangirls will go wild for Draco Malfoy in leather pants (this turned out to be very important for my career later).<p>I learned InstallShield, and why just about every desktop software package leaves behind a ton of junk when you uninstall it.  I learned that manually testing installation executables on a half dozen VirtualPC boxes kinda sucks.  I tried to learn WinRunner but it never sunk in.  I did learn design patterns while I was avoiding WinRunner though.<p>I learned that companies that stay ""2 weeks away from beta"" for more than 2 months have a tendency to stay that way indefinitely.  (Though not always: I've heard that offline GMail was ""2 weeks away from launch"" for a year, and they <i>did</i> eventually get it out.)  I learned that code quality matters <i>a lot</i>, and that if you write sucky code in the name of just getting it done, you will pay for it later, possibly forever.  I learned that you need to know what you're building in order to build it, but I took the wrong lesson from that: I learned that you should always have specs that try to think of every eventuality, when I should've learned that you should always have prototypes and working code that tries to explore every eventuality.  I learned that companies should always keep track of their cash very carefully, and they should <i>know</i> when a $6M bridge loan is coming due, and that VCs behave basically like sharks when they smell blood in the water.  I learned that certain company founders will also do pretty crazy things with the remnants of their company, like run off to China with its IP when the VC sues them.<p>All in all, I'd say it was highly educational. :-)",1238989210.0

Let's start with this notion that TE's are vital for evolution. Real answer: sort of. You see, there's an awful lot of species that don't have an overabundance of ""junk"" DNA, yet are still able to adapt and evolve. The reason that TE's at least <i>seem</i> to be more important in higher order plants and animals is because of how such organisms organize their genomes.<p>Ok, before I get carried away on a long rant, here's the heart of the matter for the hacker audience:<p>Proteins fold into domains. These are compact structures with a rough upper limit to their size that typically can carry out one biochemical function. In <i>E. coli</i>, most genes code for proteins with only one domain. So, <i>E. coli</i> can evolve by grabbing new genes, turning genes on or off, or in some circumstances, evolve new functionality from existing domains through random mutation. (In reality, random mutation takes a long time to produce anything useful, and the creation of novel domains appears to no occur. There's a theory growing in prominence that all of the protein domain folds that exist today were present when life began, and may even represent independent life originating events...but I'm getting off track.)<p>In humans, most of our proteins are multi-domain. Not all of these domains, however, are catalytic. That is, in a human protein with 5 domains, maybe only one actually has biochemical activity. The function of the rest is to modulate that activity or localize the protein to one part of the cell or another. Also, the mechanisms controlling when genes get turned on and off in humans is much more complex than in bacteria. Therefore, evolution in higher order plants and animals is much more likely to occur through a ""shuffling"" of domains and regulatory elements. Because TE's are good at ""shuffling"" DNA, it's not surprising that having a healthy dose of this sort of ""junk"" DNA is advantageous. Of course, that's not all...there's also neutral evolution and pseudo-genes and epigenetic inheritance, etc. Biology is really on the cusp of exploding (oh, and I'm writing a book about that too ;-).<p>tl;dr -- The genetics of higher order plants and animals is not unlike a program which relies heavily on many libraries. If you swap out one XML parser for a better XML parser, you'll get better performance (and more customers!). Transposable elements function (sort of) like biology's equivalent of a linker, and can help organisms swap in and out libraries/protein domains.",1238987073.0

You're clearly qualified, so getting rejected shouldn't be a terrible thing for you.<p>To answer your first apprehension: being around like-minded people is incredibly important.  Graduating from one of the best high schools in the nation, I was around people who were intellectuals so there was always wonderful discussions to whet and kindle my growing mind.  Two years later, I'm at the local state university whose stigma is entirely accurate.  Few people—even in the honors college—are true intellectuals.  Living here has been an intellectual nightmare for me, and I can sense my acuity and mental agility suffering.<p>However, I really didn't have a choice.  My family could not afford to send me anywhere else.  Basically, the situation I got stuck with was this: paying $40k+/year for a wonderful, private institution or paying $0/year (including room and board) and getting compensated a stipend for the local state university which still made USNWR's top-tier colleges list.<p>And really, if you're going for engineering, then you're going to learn the same thing anywhere.  I'd argue that illustrious universities really aren't a frugal choice.  Graduating debt free is really going to free me up financially to start up my company instead of needing to find a job right out of school to fund myself.  Also, the local state university offered a lot of options for testing out of classes, so I'm graduating in three years, as opposed to four.<p>One more thing to consider: student life.  You don't want to be miserable, even if it's cheaper or a better school.  I've known to many of my peers who went to their dream school and then hated their life.  Consider spending time on campus and getting familiar with the local scene.<p>Good luck.",1238986986.0
