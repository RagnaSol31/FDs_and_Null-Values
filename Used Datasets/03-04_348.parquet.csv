I have seen the one rule per line in the wild, but it is rare. The CSS the author has shown is fairly representative of what I see in production code.<p>However, the author should have stuck to plain CSS instead of including the syntax favored by SCSS. Some of the syntax is specific to the later. Single line comments are a particularly egregious example; they can appear to work in vanilla CSS, but that's only because they force a syntax error that makes the parser skips the line. Including such syntax defeats the entire purpose of the guide.",1339300763.0

In fairness, that was not part of the competition.

The value is highly dependent on the features though (length, for instance, would probably be a prominent ""explanation""), and I haven't actually tried it.<p>2) The ""This would grade Dickinson/Hemingway/DFW/etc poorly"" argument is true but, again, read the essays. These are serious edge cases - ones that should be addressed (by, for instance, correlating algorithmic scoring with human scoring), but this argument doesn't diminish the applicability of the algorithm to the vast majority of essays and students.",1339300046.0
17,4090114,comment,4089566.0,4089566.0,2,0,bmelton,,,"There are a lot of good answers in here, but to compile them and maybe add some:<p>1) The time between payments gives you the ability to verify that the service has been done correctly and isn't in any way fraudulent.  Adwords is a great example, they hang on to the cash for as long as they can because once they pay you, they can't take the money back.<p>2) Immediate payment, even if automated, doesn't give any opportunity to double-check things.  If you're dealing with $10 items, maybe that isn't a huge deal.  But what if your task queue goes crazy and redistributes tasks over and over, and now  you've just paid somebody $10 every minute the heartbeat pulsed and now you've paid them $20,000.<p>3) Processing deductions.  The more you can charge on a single transaction, the better of it is.  If you're making many small transactions and are losing 30 cents + 2.9% on each one, that's 33% you're losing on a one dollar process.  Obviously, higher amounts negate this, and Net-30 terms help to negate that even more.<p>4) I assume you're talking digital processing, otherwise, I do not want to be the guy that has to cash 30 checks when I could have only had to cash 1.<p>5) The most important, possibly, is interest.  The longer you can keep the funds in your account, the more interest it draws.  I once worked for a restaurant that paid well, but had pretty thin margins due to competition.  They always paid on time, but very politely asked that you waited until noon the next day to cash your paycheck, as interest calculations 'ticked' every day at noon at the bank they used, and while it doesn't sound like a ton, the interest on the paychecks of a 30-person staff adds up pretty quick, and every penny counts.<p>6) Lastly, if you have to track these payments for tax purposes, the less payments you make the better.  Rolling in everyone's accruals into one 'lump sum' for payment could easily be the difference between filing monthly taxes in a couple of hours vs. having to take days to file.",1339300034.0

When I moved into my Manhattan apartment, I was told before lease-signing that the rent would be less than the $2000/month ceiling (at the time) for rent control. However, upon lease signing, the rent on the lease was $2050 and there was an attached rider saying I would be paying a lower, ""preferential"" rent - the originally agreed upon amount - presumably to avoid rent-stabilization.

This is not to deny the importance of paying attention to the real world. Nor is it to say that abstract theory is necessarily more valuable than applied work. Nothing could be farther from the truth. But I do believe that mere relevance of an issue will not guarantee good research unless you have a genuine drive to work on it. If not, leave it to someone else. Good work on an apparently unimportant problem will have more long-run value than mediocre work on one of greater intrinsic importance.

There are no new rent controlled apartments in NYC.  When you hear of $200 three bedroom apartments in Manhattan, it they exist at all they're likely Rent Controlled vs. Stabilized.<p>Rent stabilization applies to apartments built roughly between 1947 and the mid-1970s.  Rents can only be increased by a percentage determined each year by the NYC Rent Guidelines Board (<a href=""http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/dhcr/dhcr1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/dhcr/dhcr1.html</a>).<p>Tenants can be evicted from either style of apartment if the landlord can demonstrate that the unit is not the tenant's primary residence, amongst other reasons.  While it is almost unheard of for a rent controlled tenant to be evicted, stabilized tenants get evicted all of the time.  It is by no means easy.<p>Stabilized apartments can be removed from the rent stabilization program if the rent exceeds a certain amount, or if the tenant's household income exceeds a certain amount.<p>Typically landlords would love to eliminate RC/RS entirely, while tenant groups would like to see Rent Stabilization expand.  The current vacancy rate in NYC is less than 3.something percent (<a href=""http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/decades-old-housing-emergency-continues-and-so-does-rent-regulation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/decades-old-hou...</a>) so stabilization is unlikely to end any time soon.<p>[I own in NYC, I don't rent.
