Why is a paper any less trustworthy just because there's code involved?<p>It was always true to an extent.<p>Code is a force multiplier that makes it significantly harder to evaluate the paper with out it (and without reproducing an equivalent).<p>I'm not in academia myself, but I've heard from friends more than once that when they actually received code (and/or data) they requested from an author, the code turned out to be not precisely described in the paper, and the data is often massaged to fit in a way that's not precisely described either.<p>The question shouldn't be ""why aren't you satisfied with what was good 20 years ago?"", but rather ""when sharing the bits that makes everything reproducible is a 'git push' away, why isn't it considered mandatory?""<p>It is a common error that science is about proving things; The scientific method is actually about trying to disprove things and failing to do so. If what you want to do is science, why don't you make it easiest to disprove your results?",1357963007.0

6,5046437,comment,5044862.0,5045435.0,2,0,SiVal,,,"One of my highest priorities for several years has been a full-page, portable PDF reader. My mountainous ""must read"" inbox is increasingly electronic instead of paper, with most of the serious stuff in PDF format. I can listen to fiction in audio format with half of my brain while grocery shopping with the other half, but my serious stuff requires my full brain capacity (or more) plus hi-rez graphs, equations, charts, maps, etc. to give me a fighting chance at figuring it out and learning something. These little eBook formats are fine for things that I could just as easily listen to in audio (if only they were available), but I need a better reader for my REAL stuff.<p>The iPad is the closest I've come, but I'd hoping for something more like a touch screen eInk reader in a form factor like the lid of my RetinaMBP.<p>It may be that those of use who read full-sized technical textbooks after graduation could all fit in the same elevator and aren't worth building devices for, but there must be a huge market for students reading textbooks and everyone else reading magazines.

We would like to support Java, but it's not an option right now (Native Client doesn't support Java, and I'd need to research the Java sandboxing technologies).  Another issue is that we limit memory usage, and Java memory usage tends to be higher than C++ programs; ditto for virtualization.  Note that virtualization isn't really a security solution on its own.  I can't really see Ruby being the right approach for CPU-intensive computing (we're talking hundreds of thousands of cores, so it's worth investing in making the code efficient).<p>BTW, I definitely think seccomp <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp</a>\nand linux containers\n<a href=""http://lxc.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lxc.sourceforge.net/</a>\nor perhaps OpenVZ:\n<a href=""http://wiki.openvz.org/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.openvz.org/Main_Page</a><p>could be engineered into a secure sandbox, without having to resort to virtualization (which I'd like to emphasize isn't really a security solution).

Verizon has a great network in the DC area. If they win, then say a Houston ISP subsidizes them. At that point they have zero incentive to improve.

They spent half the budget on interconnect, and don't want it wasted.  It's entirely possible the OP's project allows them to run embarassingly parallel codes, but frankly, that's just a waste of energy given what the hardware is capable of.  I had this argument when I worked at the supercomputing centers, over and over (I told them to build loosely coupled commodity clusters with great storage IO throughput) but they never saw my point of view, so instead I built exacycle and work to make it available to scientists who can keep it busy.<p>With regards to sharing scientific information related to pharma, I (and the rest of the Exacycle team) believe strongly that the results the Exacycle Visiting Faculty achieve must be made public- ideally all the raw data in addition to the published analysis.  If you look at the blog post I referenced, you'll notice that three of the faculty are working on protein/drug related problems, and we'll be sharing the bulk of the results with the scientific community.<p>The work we've done has moved protein folding and drug design far beyond incrementalism.  The scale we make available also turns things that were 1-10 year projects and makes them an overnight job.  I also spent a year running MD simulations on a supercomputer, so I can appreciate the higher level of scientific productivity that a system like Exacycle provides.<p>Some of the questions you raise about cloaked IP sharing are interesting, mainly from a theoretical perspective, but I think pharma would be more likely to use existing IP protection mechanisms, or they would simply not collaborate at all, before adopting stuff as ""complicated"" as this.",1357960735.0

For such proteins, the structures <i>can</i> be determined experimentally. That means coaxing pure samples of protein to form single crystals and then subjecting the crystals to X-ray diffraction (XRD). Backing out the structural information from the XRD patterns takes serious horsepower (though admittedly not necessarily power with Titan-class interconnects). XRD does not give information about the location of hydrogen atoms in the structure though. For that information you need to do neutron diffraction (the de Broglie wavelength of the neutrons is short). ORNL is actually one of the few places that do neutron diffraction. The OP could connect with some of the neutron folks there and assist them with their research. If not for proteins, maybe for superconductors.<p>I had a chance to run some Monte Carlo code on some of the machines at ORNL as part of a supercomputing workshop there during the reign of Jaguar.
