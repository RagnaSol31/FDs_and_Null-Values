I think it is a very weird position to hold. Imagine there was a very dangerous disease, should it be discussed openly in physician congresses? Yes? Same here (HN is the hackers congress, right?), so let us discuss the topic freely.<p>Why is Bitcoin so dangerous:<p>- Could break the current economy.<p>Ok, and so? Is the current economy that perfect a thing that we do not want any replacement? Just have a look in countries where all the wealth created is sucked by a very few corrupted nababs lying down in sofas, and meanwhile people starve silently in the streets. I don't say Bitcoin will fix this, I just say that changing the current economically rules is still a possibility, and Bitcoin-like currency could be a part of the picture. The current economy applied to the world is in fact a very specific and recent invention. In Imperial China (only 200 years ago), the inflation was artificially set to a very high level, so the price of money would go down very fast, and nobody would think of ""keeping money aside"", so everyone was just spending. That's another model, it did work not so bad for a big part of humanity for some centuries. I am no technotarians, I respect the law, but I think it is quite possible that our economical model is not the best possible.<p>- Bitcoin could ease the work for wrong-doers (drug traffic, etc.)<p>This argument is very weak. The same has been said for cell phones, Internet, etc. If this powerful tool is kept secret and hidden in a kind of black market, it will help mostly people in these places. If we discuss it openly, and make it accessible, it may help more ""normal"" people.<p>- Tax<p>Tax is the biggest issue, but let's not be in fear: Governments are very imaginative when it comes to getting money from their administrates. For example, they could easily ask for Bitcoins in exchange of the right to use information vectors (cables, wireless).<p>Every great innovation have been seen as extremely dangerous by the people in place. Do you take the plane? Yes. Did you heard about this guy a 100 years ago who tried to fly like a bird: he held tight a set of man-made ""wings"", jumped from the top of the Eiffel tower, and flatly crashed on the floor.

24,2551569,comment,2551142.0,2551288.0,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"His criteria are subjective, yes, but isn't that the point? The point of music recommendation engines isn't to figure out the absolute ""best"" playlist based on a starter song. It's to figure out the best playlist <i>for the individual user</i>. If the user is asking ""WTF?"" about the songs on his list, then by definition, the engine has failed that user.<p>While the author could have been more objective about his criteria, ironically enough, I think he missed the more salient point that he raised by implication: that music engines should be mapping the user's behavior patterns vis-a-vis the songs in his collection, and not so much objective connections between songs. This is what Genius does and has always tried to do, and it's why Genius seems to work better for the author. Genius doesn't focus as heavily on attempts to forge objective links between songs, so much as it focuses on attempts to draw links in behavior patterns w/r/t songs by likeminded users.<p>When listening to songs in a collection, our brain maps out its own connections between songs, as reflected in the way we compile our own lists consciously or subconsciously. Sometimes those connections make objective sense (i.e., ""I want to listen to '70s funk, so I'm going to pick ten '70s funk songs in a row.""). Sometimes those connections make little objective sense (i.e., ""I am listening to a track by Lady Gaga, and afterward, I feel like listening to a track by J.S. Bach.""). A good mixing engine figures out the idiosyncracies and subjectivity of our brains, as reflected statistically by the choices we've made in the past.",1305517838.0

Your point about being a lamer in context of something you don't understand or like was precisely my point. My point was that a community full of ""lamers"" is a community that has somehow attracted posters or commenters whose tastes, opinions, knowledge level, interest level, and/or posting intent do not mesh with those of the majority of the userbase. To the extent that these lamers -- as defined by their context -- exist, that's usually a function of a community's having lost focus (or never had proper focus to begin with).

That is for an OTC forward you have one fair value and for a future you have a different fair value because the future is has margins and the function calculates the difference between the two.<p>Now you have some useful code that works out margin payments for various trajectories of prices for the future/forward based on some model for price movements and and another model for interest payments/reciepts on the margin calls.<p>Now you have a simple change where some exchange changes way they do margin calls.<p>One way to resolve this is that convexity adjustment function takes in a margining function as a parameter.  But if it was not known that this was needed from the start maybe another part of the model was parameterized rather than this.<p>In practice in this case assumptions about the margining are baked into the mathematics of the black box, and handling arbitrary margining systems is not done and you write a whole new function.",1305516736.0

Reagan had also explicitly asked for it, and the 1996 bill was introduced and mostly supported by the Republicans, who you may recall had a Congressional majority at the time. Senator Bob Dole, who introduced the bill, was the GOP candidate for president in the same year, and one has to wonder if its introduction was partially aimed at burnishing his credentials as an opponent of pork-barrel politics. There were two attempts to bring it back in 2006, both sponsored by prominent Republicans.<p>Any president would like more authority over the budget, but the GOP does seem to have invested the most political capital in it.

I seem to recall that this same query was previously displayed on HN.<p>I take amphetamines because it is part of the medication that has been prescribed to me by a doctor for ADHD. I take my medication because it is nigh impossible for me to do anything that I am not interested in for more than five seconds. The unceasing flow of ideas and internal stimuli that I generate by thinking can be rather bothersome as well. Life is difficult when you are thinking of a solution to a problem, designing parts of software systems and considering the best approach to dealing with someone you had a tiff with (and more) all while you are supposed to be listening to your current boss, wife, lover etc. Life becomes more difficult when you forget everything you are supposed to be doing because you cannot pay attention long enough to finish the three second task you meant to finish five seconds ago because you forgot what that task was.<p>The beneficial effect of taking my medication is that I am better able to write code that I am not interested in writing, give closer attention to detail and generally operate like a human being without ADHD would operate. There is more to ADHD than just lack of focus. Lack of focus and all of the other things, lack of organization, forgetfulness, fidgeting, non-sequitur outbursts in conversation, lack of follow through... All of those things are why I take my medication and also the reason that I stopped listening to other people telling me that I should stop taking meds.<p>I do not think anyone should take amphetamines for any other reason than a real medical condition. I have no idea why they would want to. When I took dexedrine for the first two weeks I felt like hell. I switched to an XR dexedrine and I feel much better.<p>I know that adderall and dex are really popular with college kids to help them study. I have had people ask me if I would give them my medication, I guess they do not know or do not care that giving narcotic meds to people who do not have a prescription is illegal...<p>To each their own I guess. If you want to take drugs to code that is your deal. Why not just code without the meds if you can? I wish I could.<p>I guess I got a little ranty here. Sorry about that.",1305516124.0
