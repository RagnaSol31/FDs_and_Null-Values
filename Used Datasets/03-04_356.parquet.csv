Do you learn by learning the basics/fundamentals first or by walking through a complete project and along the way picking up fundamentals? I am in the later category learning wise and my last programming experience was using FORTRAN on VAX systems several decades ago.<p>Below is my experience in learning PHP and launching the MVP for my personal project in six weeks:<p>I first started with the SitePoint book: Kevin Yank Build Your Own Database Driven Web Site Using PHP & MySQL. I read the book and coded all examples in the book. The book walks you with building a project while introducing the basics of PHP and SQL languages.<p>By the time I was 3/4th of the way with the book (took me about 5 days of 8 hours each day), I started to look for PHP framework to use while implementing my project. After googling and reviewing what people wrote about different frameworks and just reviewing the quick start information for each framework, I settled on Codeigniter (CI). The reason I went with CI was its simplicity, excellent documentation, helpful community and by just googling for anything + codeigniter, I was able to find enough information to know that I am most probably not going to be first one to encounter a problem not already solved and shared online. I spent 2 days going through a quick start project on Codeigniter website to become comfortable with the CI framework.<p>After a week, I just started coding my project using PHP, Codeigniter, and SQL that I learnt from the book and just googling for information whenever I ran into issues/roadblock that I couldn&",

There were dozens of non-individualist societies when we started, there is arguably a single (relatively new) one left, one that is at least partially individualist, and a single new one. There is the western civilization (sometimes  referred to as western individualism, especially by non-western scholars), islam, a relative newcomer that is certainly more individualist than most the competition it massacred out of existence (like e.g. the Roman Society it is mostly modelled on), and communism (which is arguably dead today, as China can hardly be called an example of a communist society. Who is left ? North Korea ?).<p>Any solution that requires individuals reacting against their own self-interest on a large scale is a complete non-starter, for such a thing would not be Nash Balance.
