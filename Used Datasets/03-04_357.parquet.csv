This means you can focus on making the availability factor as close to 1.0 as possible.<p>This may not be the case when you're forced to balance all three CAP factors. I sometimes wonder if a follow on result to CAP will be a ""practical"" (physical or information theoretic) limit like C x A x P <= 1-h for some constant h, and we'll just have to come to terms with that as computer scientists, as physics had to with dx x dp >= h. This is of course wildly unsubstantiated pessimism.<p>Also, I would gladly entertain any argument demolishing the ""local disks are not subject to CAP"" claim I made above by talking about read / write caches as separate copies of the local disk state.",1303703874.0

14,2480368,comment,2478658.0,2478658.0,2,0,kamaal,,,"Not just the start up in general its a little to hire good developers in India. Not because they are unavailable, but because they are often lost in the huge crowd rush. The general good folks that come out IIT's and REC's do either join a company like Google or alike. Or Write a entrance exam like CAT to work for some investment bank. Or do their MS in US and permanently plan to settle down some where in the west. In other words they just don't want to be a part of the system at all. Barring a few.<p>The other good folks have a very terrible problem they are forced to run with the crowd. Often they get hired by the IT big giants. The scenario there is pretty different. In the 90's and early 2000's most of them in such companies got promoted very early to managerial designations, went to onsite location like the US. Got very rich due to stocks, money earned in foreign location(due to foriegn exchange) and the hikes from promotion. They have a lot of money and give a damn on how things run, they have nothing to loose after all.<p>When folks join such big companies often these are the sort of people whom they meet and are forced to draw inspiration from. Most managers have hardly coded and don't know a jack about technical stuff.And since the hurry is to now become a manager, buy a flat, a car, marry with rich dowry and settle down. The struggle happens on three counts and chief being get rich as early as you can, BY ANY MEANS you can. So since now becoming manager is the key, most don't want to code at all. Some how fight, do politics(Which is very common here, due people from so many languages and regions mixing together. there is severe politics and biases towards there respective people) and go to onsite. And if this doesn't happen, go job hopping until you get it.<p>The sad fact is companies reward jop hoppers but the sincere ones who for long time and perform. I even know few folks who have hopped 5 jobs in 4 years, consider themselves Java expert and don't even what CLASSPATH is. Once they get the tag of 'lead' or alike they think they can just give orders and have servants do the job for them. This how 95% project managers and other designated alike work here. Adding to that to 'CYA' they purposefully promote inefficient folks, I think they a feel a good guy is direct threat to their own position.<p>The net result is more and more less risks projects are taken by Indian IT giants there days. Most of them in just bench testing and infrastructure management like IT support. And some times the managers are so inefficient they can't execute those projects properly.<p>Now coming to actually talented folks, we are terribly frustrated crowd. As self taught programmers(From other branches of engineering) and despite our hard work and merit we can neither go to companies like Google, because they treat non-CS and non-IIT folks like 'mud blood muggles' nor work for start ups. Start ups are mostly from MBA types who believe some how idea is all that matters and programmers are like typists whom they can just use and throw.<p>There is no easy way out of this problem. At least with the current social set up in India. Sometimes I feel I must immigrate to the US( Like Russians did frustrated with the system there.).<p>But no, this is my country. I will stay here and fight the system. And will do everything I can to make my country a better place and have genuinely good guys get what they deserve.",1303703270.0

16,2480366,comment,2479865.0,2480343.0,23,0,jerf,,,"It may be worth pointing out that legal justice is really a <i>post facto</i> affair. The question is not whether bad things sometimes happen in the US, but how the legal system reacts to it after the fact.<p>In both the cases you've cited, the book is far from closed on the incidents. It's hardly even opened.<p>To establish anecdotal evidence of real injustice, you need to cite cases where the legal system failed to provide any sort of redress. Which with more effort you certainly could; I'm not claiming otherwise, nor am I claiming that you can't build a more comprehensive fact-based case against the US on some grounds. My point is simply that the implicit standard you are using by citing two things that haven't been through the system can't be used to score points for or against the system yet. The question is less ""can you be put in jail"" than ""can you be <i>kept</i> in jail"", and the corresponding second-order effects that has on society.<p>I am not entirely satisfied with the US; I am simultaneously not aware of any place that strikes me as obviously better, or even obviously on a better long-term trajectory.

Now that it is ready, i can get back to work.<p>I find Blogger and the other online wysiwyg style systems to be too much of a hazzle to work with. I wasn't aware of github pages, but it looks really nice. I will probably find some inspiration there. From what i can tell github pages lets you create an arbitrary website structure with arbitrary styling, whereas the goal with gcp.com is ease of use and a nice standard layout (sort of like latex). That is also why i haven't added header and footer support, but i should probably make some minimal customaization available, like name and tagline.<p>.textile is sort of a convention for files with textile markup.

An Edge in the Kitchen is the solution, an intelligent and delightful debunking of the mysteries of kitchen knives once and for all.
