14,539582,comment,539105.0,539534.0,0,0,jerf,,,"The fair use analysis for citing an advertising slogan is very different than it is for a tweet. You're not affecting the slogan's value the way that republishing a tweet against the author's will can, and the purpose test is more in your favor since you're probably mentioning it to be critical of it in some way.<p>Based on my experience, at this point I expect someone to start jumping in and trying to slice and dice their way between these standards. So let me try to preempt that a bit by reminding you that you have to be taken to court for copyright infringement before you can make a fair-use defense and that an intrinsic part of the process is the judgment of the court. The judge would laugh M&M Mars out of court if they claimed my citing ""Taste the Rainbow"" as a trite slogan was a copyright violation, but republishing a person's tweet is a radically different thing, and the question is not ""can I weave and dance and obfuscate and blur the question on the internet?"", but ""can I weave and dance and obfuscate the question in front of a judge?"" There is a professionally-trained human hairsplitter in the decision loop, by design.<p>Mind you, I might still be wrong in my analysis; I'm not saying I can't be wrong, my point is that pulling the whole dodge, weave, and obfuscate move to try to show that I'm being hypocritical or that I somehow disagree with myself is not valid.",1238471170.0

I don't know how extensive that encyclopedia was, but if it's at all comprehensive, probably a fair amount of work went into it. Hence, ""quick buck"" might be an unfair characterization of that work. And since they did not have access to Rowling's notes, why should they have to pay her anything for the work they put in?
