29,2902147,comment,2900878.0,2900878.0,7,0,pilif,,,"UTF16 gives you the worst of both worlds: it wastes a lot of memory for ASCII-like languages (mostly ASCII plus some special characters), you have to deal with byte ordering and you still don't get the advantages of directly addressing a specific character without parsing the whole string up to the character you want.<p>But.<p>If you widen the character even more, you'd probably still want it to be somewhat word-aligned so you'd use 32bit per character which would have enough storage to store all of Unicode plus some. The cost though is obvious: you waste memory.<p>Depending on the language, you even waste a lot of memory: think ASCII or ASCII-like (the middle european languages). In UHF-8 those need - depending on language - barely more than one byte up to two bytes per character. Representing these languages with 4 bytes per character makes you use nearly 4 times the memory reasonably needed.<p>This changes the farther east you move. Representing Chinese (no ASCII, many character points high up in the set) in utf-8, you begin wasting a lot of memory due to the ASCII compatibility. As encoding a Unicode code point in utf-8 uses around one byte more than if you would just store the code point as an integer.<p>So on international software running on potentially limited memory while targeting the eastern languages, you will again be better off using utf-16 as it requires less storage for characters really high up in the Unicode plane.<p>Also, if you know that you are just extended ASCII, you can optimize and access characters directly without parsing the whole string, giving you another speed advantage.<p>I don't know what's the best way to go. 32 bits is wasteful, utf-16 is sometimes wasteful, has endianness issues and still needs parsing (but is less wasteful than 32bits in most realistic cases) and utf-8 is really wasteful for high code points and always requires parsing but doesn't have the endianness issues.<p>I guess as always these are just tools and you have to pick what works in your situation. Developers have to adapt to what was picked.",1313725682.0

You cannot be sure that every machine on your network that has access to that file share has the same, running, correctly configured, up to date, active antivirus application running.<p>You also can't be sure your UNIX system sharing files to Windows machines (or other NAS) wasn't compromised and used to seed infected files into shares used by those Windows machines.  \nIf you simply don't use UNIX or NAS systems to run file shares for Windows domains, you can put AV on the Windows server sharing the files and have <i>it</i> scan on access, and avoid that 'whole system' scan issue.<p>There's a huge difference between 'root' and 'elevated privileges'.  Especially in a Windows environment (which most are these days) - 'Power Users' or other users granted <i>elevated privileges</i> to do things like 'installing their own printer drivers', don't have administrative control over the machine or the domain, but have elevated privileges that can be used to exploit the attack vector.  Such privilege is widely used in large corporate environments, and so it shouldn't be discounted.<p>I'm mixed on the topic of fire-walling off known attacker addresses.  Sure, it won't stop anybody willing to put in even tiny effort.  It will, however, stop you from getting nailed because someone forgot to update that wordpress system they forgot to tell you they were running.  \nIf you have perfect CM (hah), sure, go ahead and ignore the junk scanners on the interwebs.

Most revolutions lead to bad outcomes not good, but most revolutions are also inevitable. The British ubersurveillance police state experiment has gone too far and there are no signs of abating. This is not the only issue, there are others. It's pretty unlikely reform will come in time. It's not a wild pronouncement to note that the revolution has begun, it's just an observation of what is going on.<p>The day the Rodney King verdict was announced I took part in one of hundreds of peaceful protest marches, which were interrupted by fascist police who tried to round up participants for legally exercising their right to protest. The next day I had to make a delivery in LA and saw the riots. I got out of there as soon as I realized what was going on but I saw enough to know the city was being burned to the ground by a populace outraged over injustice, not a thugs looking for free TVs. I never said ""Wow this sucks, look at those undisciplined animals rioting"". Instead I said, ""Wow, this sucks, look at what happens if you don't value justice in a society.""<p>The sentence of 4 years in prison of this kid for posting on Facebook some nonsense he deleted a couple hours later inviting people to join him at McDonalds for a riot meetup that never happened is not justice. Nor is throwing a mother in prison because her flatmate brought home some looted clothes and she accepted a pair of shorts. That is the reign of terror.

40,2902136,comment,2900878.0,2901970.0,7,0,klodolph,,,"The oft-stated advantage of UTF-32/UCS4 is that you can do random access.  But random character access is almost entirely useless for real text processing tasks.  (You can still do random byte access for UTF-8 text, and if your regexp engine spits out byte offsets, you're fine.)<p>Even when you're doing something ""simple"" like upcasing/downcasing, the advantages of UTF-32 are not great.  You are still converting variable length sequences to other variable length sequences -- e.g., eszett upcases to SS.<p>Now the final piece to this is that for some language implementations, compilation times are dominated by lexical analysis.  Sometimes, significant <i>speed</i> gains can be had by dealing with UTF-8 directly rather than UTF-32 because memory and disk representation are identical, and memory bandwidth affects parsing performance.  This doesn't matter for most people, but it matters to the Clang developers, for example.  Additional system speed gains are had from reducing memory pressure.<p>Sure, we have plenty of memory and processor power these days.
