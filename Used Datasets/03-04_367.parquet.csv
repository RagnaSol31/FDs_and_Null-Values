A mathematician, physicist or engineer will spend most of his working life scribbling on paper, so it makes a lot of sense to interview that way.<p>There are plenty of other fields that don't work quite that way.<p>You wouldn't interview a baseball player by asking him to describe hitting a curve ball on paper, or a nurse by asking him to draw stiches on a piece of paper.  Every field has its own medium of expression.  For many fields, that's paper.  For programming, it's a text editor.",1287287994.0

13,1799604,comment,1799366.0,1799560.0,0,0,colinsidoti,,,"Interesting, I would actually take the opposite approach.  When it comes to startups, I don't think rockstar programming is really enough to set a company apart.  While the company is small some bad code shouldn't send it to the grave.  Code is invisible; the users will never see it and as long as it works it shouldn't matter if it's elegant object-oriented programming or unorganized ""spaghetti"" code.  If a programmer is truly committed to the project, they will make it work and that should be all that matters.<p>The user experience however, needs to be excellent from the start.  A startup may pick up some early, tech-savvy adopters if there is a very cool technology, but with a poor user experience the general population will never adopt the new technology.<p>That said, your point about the UX needing to evolve is well-taken.

The algorithm starts with the set of all possible (x, y) pairs, and switches between the Bob and Alice stages.<p>In Bob's stage, eliminate pairs that give a unique value for x^2 + y^2. If such a unique value matches the value Bob was given, then obviously you know x, y for sure.\nOtherwise, switch to Alice's stage, which operates on the remaining pairs from Bob's stage, and eliminates all pairs that give a unique value for x + y.<p>The weirdness in the question is both Alice and Bob are performing the exact same algorithm, but (to use CSP parlance) there is a channel from Bob to Alice in Bob's stage, and vice versa, due to the different information given to both parties.

That's BS - it's because without refrigeration, <i>the oils in the bran go rancid</i> . Readily available whole grain bread is actually a modern luxury, thanks to transportation infrastructure and pervasive refrigeration.

There are many fields that are more obscure.<p>But perhaps part of the answer is sitting there in your question. Younger tech is more exciting tech, and though <i>Hackers</i> is an awesome book, it is also a historical document from thirty years ago, when personal gaming systems were in their infancy. Now it is thirty years later. Programmers have been exploring games for almost fifty years by now. (Spacewar will celebrate its fiftieth birthday in February 2012.) Computer games, as traditionally defined, are a relatively mature field.<p>By comparison, the web is a youngster, only in its teens. Social networking on the scale of Facebook is a handful of years old. The era of ubiquitous omnipresent wearable mobile networked computers -- we call them <i>smartphones</i> for the moment -- is less than five years old, even if it can be said to have truly arrived yet. These things are <i>very</i> exciting, because we have no idea how they will turn out, and because you can walk down the street and see opportunity <i>everywhere</i>. There are so many ground floors to get in on.<p>And, of course, many of the new opportunities will be games. But they may not all be <i>called</i> games, at least not at first. For example, my understanding is that game critics are having quite the existential crisis about Zynga's work. Farmville certainly looks like a game, and it is sold like a game, but it isn't like the games that have come before. Which brings me back to my first point: Game genres which are decades old may not get as much press, but people talk about Zynga on HN all the time. Because they are new and different.",1287285917.0
