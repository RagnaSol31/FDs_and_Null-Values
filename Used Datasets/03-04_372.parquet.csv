1,3661913,story,,,1,0,diwup,Ask HN: How Apps Get Localized for the Chinese Market?,,"I think I've read plenty of posts on TechCrunch by all those guest contributors from China boasting ""The Chinese mobile market is exploding! You really need to make your apps ready for them! We're here to help!"". Like this one. http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/03/china-next-mobile-boom/<p>But still, I'm confused and I have a few thoughts and questions.<p>(Background: I'm a native Chinese)<p>1. I noticed that big name apps usually have done the localization pretty well. Such as Angry Birds, Flipboard, Infinity Blade, Instagram. Besides, what they have done is pretty thorough. Not only have they changed the texts into Chinese, they also have replaced all those social sharing options with their Chinese counterparts. Such as Twitter replaced by Sina Weibo. Facebook by Renren. I guess they must have thrown some big money and have built their own Chinese marketing department for such and such. Or, they must have outsourced the localization tasks to some US or China based firms.<p>2. But they do have mistakes now and then. And since they're rooted in the foreign language level. Those mistakes are usually persistent, and by saying persistent I mean If I saw them in v1.1. Chances are that I will find them again in v2.0.<p>3. An example: Instagram has introduced the Chinese language localization months ago. But even in their v2.2.0 update you'll find this funny translation mistake. Description: when you navigate to a stranger's profile page, there would be some texts saying, ""You are not following this user"". This saying is totally correct in English. But in the Chinese localized version, what Chinese users actually see is """", which actually means, ""You have un-followed this user"", which is weird and is obviously a mistake. But as I mentioned just now, this mistake is persistent and is not noticed by the developer even after months.<p>My questions:<p>4. When you guys (be it big names or small indie developers) considering localize your apps for the Chinese markets, what would you actually do? Hire someone who speaks Chinese in your town? Look for some Chinese users to volunteer? Outsource the translation to a Chinese firm?<p>5. Since it's a foreign language, developers in the western world would typically have problems noticing those minor defects in the localization. What's worse, the Chinese users will complain about and low-star your apps and will do them only in Chinese. You won't have a clue if you don't understand them in the first place. What would you guys gonna do about this?<p>Discuss. :D",1330833590.0

But the concern remains that a single ""central authority"", namely hypothes.is, gets to maintain a huge database that links online pseudonyms to verified real-world identities.

Meanwhile you'll need to convince people that they should trust you with that information.<p>Sure, any large online identity provider that possesses enough data to link online identities to real-world identities (such as Facebook) will face the same problem.

I think what makes them fun to drive is their responsiveness and power.<p>By responsiveness, I mean it takes only a light touch on the steering wheel to move it at low speeds, and a light touch on the throttle to get an impressive feeling of power.<p>They have a lot of steering lock, which means that you can turn the wheels pretty far to the left or right, allowing the car to be very maneuverable for it's size.<p>As for power - well, my daily driver is a 76 Toyota Corona. The Corona has the same smooth, comfortable ride as a Benz, but boy does it ever take a while to get moving, and it's very hard to maneuver at low speeds, like in parking lots.<p>My other vehicle is an 83 Kawasaki GPZ 305 - a very small displacement motorbike. It's very torquey, and from a standing start it can get up to highway speed very fast.<p>But once you're at highway speed, that's about as fast as it's going to go. If you find yourself riding abreast of an erratic driver in the lane beside you, with someone else behind you, you might want to accelerate away from them. As quick as the motorbike is at low speeds, it will take more seconds that you would like to drop the car beside you at highway speed.<p>In the benz, you can tap the pedal and pass like the other cars are standing still. And it still gets going from a standing start faster than most other cars on the road.<p>For the record, the car I'm thinking of when I say ""the benz""  is a current C300, or maybe a C63.",1330831464.0
