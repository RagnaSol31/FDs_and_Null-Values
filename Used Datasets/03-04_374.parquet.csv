You're right in asserting that this isn't happening in practice with JSON. I allege the reason for this is that XML isn't really used for these kinds of operations either. Sure, the XML working group put out a stunning amount of ""standards"" that prescribe these conventions, but in practice NONE of it actually works across vendors without heavy intervention and some pretty shocking compromises in application code. Most complex XML products are not actually that interoperable, they mostly just work because one or more communication endpoints are basically faking compliance of their interfaces.",1290052765.0

Going to community college for a year or two to burn through their math classes (high probability of transfer, and 4 year University math classes are often effectively taught by grad students anyway!) and you'll probably save in the neighborhood of 10-20k. Computer classes in those places tend to be more vocational and rarely transfer. Most states have a way to determine what would transfer ahead of time and guaranteed admission for Community college graduates above a certain grade point average.<p>So if you go that route you can do your last two years at the best state school in your state with most of your prerequisites done and well on the way to a math major. If they offer lectures to their CS classes online and you can test out of the classes, read through those and do so for the first year's worth (just introductory stuff anyway).<p>You can save a lot of money this way, and if you do well in community college, think college is your thing, you could always try to transfer to a more prestigious (expensive!) school.<p>The thing is, if your state has a good school and you go the community college route, you'll have as good a resume as anyone who did the whole four year haul there, but at almost half the cost.<p>If it turns out that you are one of nearly half who don't complete school, finding this out at community college costs doesn't sting very much at all.",1290052374.0

Which is why I suggested client certs need to be managed in some portable manner.  Since browsers have started using OS services for certificate management, the portability may be easier.<p>The logging in from your girlfriend's PC is a valid use case, but that's the price you pay for not having to remember passwords.  Alternatively, you have an account on your girlfriend's PC that has your certificate store in it.<p>I don't envision the UI for this being any different than for a password manager.  In fact, you don't even need more than one certificate, the same cert can be given to every website.  Self-signed certs could be used as long as the website only allows login with a single certificate, the server could cache the certificate information as part of the ""account"" information and only ever allow a single certificate, in the same way ssh keys work (if ssh keys are secure enough is beyond the scope of this discussion).  Or for the use-your-girlfriend's-pc scenario, you can bind multiple certificates, stored on different computers, with your account.  Account recovery, in the event you need to change the certificate you use, would work just like password recovery, you assert you can't login, the site emails you a link to a page where you can tell it about your new certificate.  This is no more or less secure than account recovery with passwords (where access to the email account is proof enough that you are who you are), but the main goal here is to assert to the website your authentication so you don't need to remember different passwords all over the place.<p>I don't think we have a ""dead simple"" key/cert generation/store right now that would make this work for Joe User, but I think the backend technology is already there.",1290050622.0

Credit was offered by merchants and stores, but not to the extent it is used now.<p>Then gamification of credit card debt and other debt through ""credit card points"" and ""credit rating"" was introduced, and everyone was told that you had to have to have a credit card and a mortgage or you wouldn't have the credit rating to allow you to borrow more money for the car, the new furniture set, etc.<p>However, if the USD loses significant value (hyper-inflation) and the credit industry tanks, people will have to start saving again, just like the great depression.<p>We can't print our way out of debt, obviously. The more money is printed, the higher the eventual inflation.<p>Stocks from companies could fall if their business model relies on buying goods and services from countries whose currency increases in relative value and who sell products and services primarily to countries whose currency decreases in value. When inflation hits, and these companies' stocks fall, it would be a great time for people to invest, however those companies would have to layoff quite a few people, so only the rich and the people from other countries in the world would be able to afford to buy those stocks. When they buy those stocks and they go up, the rich get richer and other countries start buying these companies.<p>So basically, by the government printing more money like this, they will eventually:<p>- Raise unemployment.<p>- Raise the wealth divide between the rich and poor.<p>- Cause the country to have to convert from becoming a consumer to being a provider, during which there are many failures and many required changes in lifestyle and government. (Instead of bankers, accountants, and lawyers, you have more farmers, miners, and factory workers.)<p>The wealth divide if significant enough will cause the country to go one of three ways:<p>1. In a country where the citizens are less aggressive but feel a sense of entitlement (like the U.S.), it may lead to a revolt in the form of Socialism or Communism by the disenfranchised. (Socialism or Communism are bad ideas, but Russia and France are good examples of countries that embraced Communism and Socialism due to wealth divide, so it could certainly happen.) This in turn may kill off any chance that the country will be economically successful in the near future, because there is little incentive to work extremely hard to have an even poorer quality of life than before the change.<p>2. In countries where the people are more aggressive, a dictator may arise military rule will be established. This is much harder to escape from over time as it leads to a vicious cycle of dictatorships and coups.<p>3. In countries where the lower-class had already been mostly established (perhaps not to the same degree) and there is less sense of entitlement or aggression, there is a possibility that the country could perhaps convert from a more taxing Socialist government to a more Capitalistic society. Although this transition would not necessarily be smooth while government run services are privatized, eventually the country could become wildly successful due to the superior work-ethic of its citizens.",1290049532.0
