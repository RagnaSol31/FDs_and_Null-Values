The Torque Engine was just released with a permissive free license, which is good, but it will probably take a really good engine being released as GPL to get people to really start embracing the development of games in a community-driven way, rather than being stuck in the ivory tower like most games are now. There really isn't any other meaningful way for us to oppose these abusive ""app stores"" rather than shunning them so that we can turn to more community-driven efforts.",1367553405.0

However, after you decide to remove them, their will be 2 versions of the block-chain until yours becomes longer than the original again.

Assume you do have a filtering mechanism. It seems obvious that at any point in the block chain, there is at least 2 legal, non-suspisious, transactions. Using just this, Alice can encode 1 bit of information by saying that the first legal transaction is a '0', and the second legal transaction is a '1'. Transactions can be ordered in a deterministic way (for example, look at them as a giant binary number and sort numerically).\nThe psuedo-anonomous nature of bitcoin means that attempting to filter spamming by the source would not work, as you cannot differentiate a new account that is part of a spam attack from a new account that spent at a bad time.",1367553075.0
