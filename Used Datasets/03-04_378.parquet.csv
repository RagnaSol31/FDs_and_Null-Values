That'll hopefully change as more of us get older though :)<p>My one other thought - way too late to the game here - is that many/most developers seem to choose their 'respect' in the form of free sodas, air hockey tables, nerf gun fights, flex time and other similarly frivolous/trivial 'perks'.  It's not how I would choose to be respected, but it seems that's what enough developers seem to gravitate towards that it's set the perception of developers in the marketplace.<p>This is now how software developers are courted - ""hey, this place has free sodas!  and you can play ping pong!""  Nothing wrong with those, but I'd rather take more cash.  I a talked to a company about a position, and postponed, then came to them about 9 months later, and was offered $30k less than what we'd talked about before.  I inquired about this rather massive discrepancy, and was told ""we have free gym memberships, and all the free soda you can drink!"".  Tell you what... I'll buy my own sodas, drink fewer of them, not need the gym as much, and buy my own gym membership closer to my home with the extra $30k, thank you very much.<p>I'd also rather be able to come in, have people respect what I say, take my ideas seriously, and not have to deal with a load of internal politics on a daily basis.  That tends to be the life of a contractor/consultant, and it suits me better.",1314244704.0

41,2923681,comment,2922336.0,2923535.0,1,0,lotharbot,,,"The whole point of distinguishing some forms as ""indeterminate"" is to work around the fact that you're trying to conduct operations on the real numbers that are not defined under the field axioms of the real numbers (or the axioms of the extended reals [-inf,inf]).  That's where its essence is rooted; that's why this whole affair exists -- the fact that 0/0, 0^0, 0xinf, inf-inf, etc. are <i>not well defined by our axioms</i>.<p>This actually relates to all three examples I've presented where the 0^0=1 convention fails.  It should be treated as an indeterminate form in limits <i>because</i> it's not well-defined by the axioms of the real numbers; it's also not well-defined by the axioms of the hyperreals, but division of infinitesimals <i>is</i> well-defined in the hyperreals, which gives us an alternate method of computing limits that avoids the ""indeterminate form"" entirely.<p>Let me reiterate: 0^0 is not defined under the field axioms of the real numbers.  The choice to define it as 1 is a <i>convention</i> which makes certain math easier, in certain areas of mathematics.  It is by no means a <i>universal convention</i>; it is by no means the one and only correct definition of 0^0.  You continue to argue for the convention, but miss the larger point that it is a <i>convention</i> which is chosen for convenience, and which is not always appropriate.",1314243594.0

In fact, the software industry is a perfect one to be in if you want to enjoy life without having to make noise and conform to social norms. And while I personally like to have diversified relationships, the industry as a whole has a rich enough culture for us to be comfortable on our own.<p>In comparision, I love Mathematics, but the field is too narrow. I have heard stories about how investment bankers hate their crowds. And lawyers are always in stiff competition with one another. Looking from this perspective, the software community is similar to the designers' community. We share a lot and we genuinely like each other. Well, maybe that's a problem itself. We tend to form into cults and we are too ignorant with what else is going on in the world, hence we tend to be more socially awkward. But that's an internal problem and not an external one. We have to fix that individually.<p>However, while I don't think we should strive for more publicity and social status, not having enough cash can hurt. This is a real issue. In my country, on average, a programmer gets paid as much as an accountant, if not less.
