The plural of anecdote isn't data, but thats a lot of anecdotes from lots of people and places.  In fact, the only awkward gender situation I've encountered was a time when a woman asked me to stop using the leg press I was using, and remove the weight, so she could use it.  On it's face this seems simple enough, but I had 600lbs on the machine at the time, and taking it off and getting it back on is a workout in itself.  I started moving the weights after I explained that I only had one more set, when a trainer came over and told me to finish up, and explained to her it was too much to move, just impractical when I would be done in a minute.  I'm sure she views that as some kind of demeaning situation, but the trainer and I both saw it as her being unreasonably demanding, probably without realizing it herself.",1286251116.0

6,1758539,story,,,3,3,DamonOehlman,Ask HN: Building a business and supporting an Open-Source Library,,"Hey Guys,<p>This has been playing around in my head for sometime now, and it's not something I can come up with a clear answer to one way or another.<p>Basically, I've built an Open-Source HTML5 mapping library (http://tile5.org/) and it's gotten some good exposure on Twitter recently which has been great. I never really intended on trying to build a business around an Open-Source product, but it's kind of the way things have just turned out.  I did intend to start a software development company (which has been going pretty well) but I'm now wondering if I have to change my focus.<p>So the question is, if I do decide to change focus what are the best ways to go about doing that, i.e. professional services developing solutions based on the library, training for the library, engaging sponsors?<p>In terms of things that are important to me the following must be true:<p>- licensing of Tile5 should remain liberal (i.e. MIT or similar) to ensure that developers with more tenacity than cash can create commercial apps.  Not a fan of dual licensing models...<p>- Community should be adequately supported with either people working for me or somewhere else engaging developers on building solution for no - low cost.  Similar to the way Google have developer relations people.  Funding for this area of the business comes from Robin Hood like revenue generation.<p>- I need to be able to feed and house my family, in a similar fashion to what I did working for a larger company.  No flash cars required, just food and shelter.<p>So with all that in mind, I'd love some feedback, advice, etc.  Other than of course, that there is no future in building an open-source HTML5 mapping library ;)",1286250852.0

My method of choice in this regard is loud DnB music while driving at night on a freeway. Windows down, bass turned up...<p>Step 2: Never, ever use this song (or those songs) in a work playlist. I explicitly used Immersion by Pendulum for this, and never had it on any coding-related playlist that would come up while I was working.<p>Step 3: Remove distractions. Coders, don't forget your 15-minute rule-- if you're expecting to get a call, have someone come to your door, whatever, then you may want to wait. Make sure you've got an uninterrupted window of potential productivity. For me personally, if I'm having a hard time of it, I'll drop the screen session with IRC open, close out Gtalk, close out my email, turn off my phone, turn off my second monitor and fullscreen Vim. No distractions.<p>Step 4: Trigger your anchor. Put the anchored song on, feel the adrenaline start to flow, and get to work.<p>The more you trigger the anchor, the less effective it's going to be, so you'll want to make sure to keep your triggers up to date, either by continuing to use that song in your active-activities, or by rotating other, newer songs into it.",1286249583.0

The terrain of sexual politics is difficult to negotiate, and it is possible to criticize intellectually-challenged unsympathetic writers even for trying to aestheticize in film the negotiation of that terrain. The fact that Sorkin has established his authority to write sensitively and intelligently about complicated subjects about which everyone seems to have intensely entrenched opinions means for me that we should avoid the knee-jerk response to the appearance in his writing of unimpressive female characters and misogyny towards them and at least consider that something more meaningful is going on than the banal intrusion into the film of the author's own supposed sexism.",1286249552.0

Existing employee who made it through the transition landed a retention bonus, and the founders (some of who were no longer at Oblix) picked up a ""consulting"" bonus to make sure the deal went through and they didn't block it.<p>A few lessons learned from all these experiences:<p>o At the end of the Day, you really are at the mercy of the Majority Shareholders, regardless of what equity you think you may have - unless you are prepared to go to war in court.<p>o Always be aware of how much leverage you have with Founders Stock.  When a final sale is going through, you may not have enough voting stock to defeat the deal, but you may have a large enough block to mount a legal challenge - it might be easier, and cheaper, and certainly less risky to simply buy you off.  Protect your position.<p>o Stay close and friendly to the CEO, VCs, and Board Members driving the financial structure (typically the ones selected by the VCs)  They will be the ones who can re-up you when the dilutive rounds hit the company, or hand out ""retention"" bonuses after a sale - and they are the only ones who really have a clue as to what machinations are taking place.<p>o Probably most importantly - bring unique value to the table that the company requires to succeed, and continue to succeed after a sale.  I remember walking out of ""The Social Network"" wondering how on earth Eduardo manage to walk away with 7%.  The way I watched the movie, Facebook succeeded despite his efforts to slam it with Ads too early, and his inability to pull in Angels like Thiel.  And how he wasn't sitting right beside Mark night and day, is beyond me.  And seriously, how could he claim to be the ""CFO"" and not be intimately familiar with each and every clause of the stock events that were taking place.  It was liked he'd totally checked out and was just showing up now and then to see what was happening at the company.    The movie was very unsympathetic to him.  Now I have go read ""The Facebook Effect"" and ""The accidental Billionaires""just to see if they portrayed Eduardo in a more sympathetic light.<p>The movie portrayed Sean Parker as playing a much, much larger role in Facebook's success than Eduardo - yet they ended up with similar amounts of equity, which befuddles me.",1286249026.0

It is NOT a commentary on the state of gender relations in the social areas of either college or the tech community at large.

Maybe those roles are just the only ones available for women to fill in a movie about a Harvard computer hacker, his Harvard computer hacker buddies, and the tech company they founded together. Or does Sorkin need to manufacture a prominent female character who's smart, comes up with lots of fantastic ideas, actually happens to be the best computer hacker on campus, would never stoop to wearing slutty clothing to attract men, sometimes wears slutty clothing but lambasts every man who compliments her attire by asking why you don't compliment Joey on his rugby shirt because you're a sexist that's why, would never have an abortion because of her earth-shattering instinct for motherhood no matter what society says about the appropriate time and place to have a family, would definitely have an abortion if she wanted to because it's her choice anyway not that dumb jock's and who cares what her dad says anyway he's just a cog in the Patriarchy.",1286248978.0

IOW, viewed under ""normal"" optics, they would appear transparent.<p>On the other hand it was noticed that these objects do cause the <i>phase</i> of light to shift as it passes through the specimens. The basic idea is that you create a system that has light passing through the specimen in two paths. The major light path is dimmed and accelerated by half a wavelength. This gives us a situation of theoretically perfect destructive interference at the point of observation. When the reference light waves pass through a phase object, it changes the phase of the light and introduces perturbances to the completely destructive interference which results in an observable image of the specimen.<p>The reason these glasses remind me of phase contrast is the concentric circles milled to specific depths and widths (which is one of two important pieces of a phase contrast microscope, the objective). Also, the article describes the effects based in terms of phase:<p><pre><code>    The rings shift the phase of the light waves passing\n    through the lens, leading to patterns of both \n    constructive and destructive interference. Using a\n    computer model to calculate how changes in the diameter\n    and position of the rings alter the pattern, Zalevsky\n    came up with a design that creates a channel of \n    constructive interference perpendicular to the lens \n    through each of the 25 structures. Within these \n    channels, light from both near and distant objects is\n    in perfect focus.\n</code></pre>\nI never took the optics courses in school so I'm not able to connect how the phase properties are leveraged for focus. The only thing that comes to mind is that they're using phase differences to selectively destruct out of focus rays and reinforcing in focus rays (hand wavy factor: 8.6 of 10).<p>[ed: speling]",1286247609.0
