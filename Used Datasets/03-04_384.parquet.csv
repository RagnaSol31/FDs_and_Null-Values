The original case for Medicare was driven by the realities of life in the 50's and early sixties when medicine started advancing.<p>Middle class people found themselves in situations where they were forced to make choices that were either morally questionable or difficult to bear. What do you do when your parents lose their faculties and require care?<p>Before Medicare and Medicaid, you had three basic choices: pay for nursing care at great expense and impact you ability to provide for your kids, care for them yourself to the degree that you can (ie, cramming the kids into one bedroom and doing what you can, probably destroying your marriage in the process), or essentially discard them and allow them to die, which is morally reprehensible and hard in the soul.<p>Forget about the bunkum of modern politics. Do you think it is ethically or morally sound to cut off access to healthcare to the elderly?

You can do a simple sniff test on these numbers.  Simply call up a CRO that runs clinical trials and ask ""What will it cost me to run a Phase III clinical trial?""  I did this recently for a project I was working on.  They will freely give the numbers about since they are all in competition with each other.<p>This is what a recent survey of CROs found[1]:\n""As for the average per-patient trial costs across all therapeutic areas, in Phase I, costs rose from $15,023 in 2008 to $21,883 in 2011. In Phase II, the cost rose from $21,009 to $36,070. In Phase IIIa, the cost increased from $25,280 to $47,523 and in Phase IIIb, cost jumped from $25,707 to $47,095. Finally, Phase IV expenses rose from $13,011 to $17.042.""<p>Let's do some simple calculations.  1000 patients, 1 year trial.  You need to complete two Phase III trials to keep the FDA happy.<p>1000 patients * $47,000 * 2 = $94M<p>And that's only for phase III trials.  Add in the cost of discovery, pre-clinical work, formulation, Phase I, Phase II, all the paperwork with the FDA.<p>OK, great, now you're approved, you still need to actually <i>make</i> the drug which includes scale-up, testing, FDA certification of the manufacturing process, packing and distribution.<p>When I was working at a big pharma company, I heard about a new manufacturing site they had built in anticipation of a really big drug being approved.  The cost? Several hundred million dollars.  What happen when the drug got rejected by the FDA?  The manufacturing site was written off (couldn't really be used to make anything else).<p>That's why your drugs cost so much.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.pharmalot.com/2011/07/clinical-trial-costs-for-each-patient-rose-rapidly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pharmalot.com/2011/07/clinical-trial-costs-for-ea...</a>",1348974824
