If they interviewed him, and he still refused to return, then that would be a textbook case of a justification for having him charged in absentia.<p>Secondly, he claims that he will be extradited to the US if he is brought to Sweden. How exactly would he suddenly become more likely to try to flee if they decide to charge him? He is already claiming that going to Sweden means a risk of facing the death penalty in the US.<p>In that context it seems ludicrous to think that interviewing him and then charging him would somehow increase his resolve try to avoid extradition, or that this has been the case for a very long time.<p>It is not like he would have considered voluntarily setting foot on Swedish soil from any point over the past year or more. A charge would not have made that more or less likely.<p>Meanwhile, a formal charge would remove at least some reason to question the motivations of the Swedish prosecutor, and it would make it much harder for Ecuador to justify asylum given that they have publicly used this as part of their process for determining whether or not to give asylum.<p>As for that. At the moment he is holed up in a small embassy, while the Metropolitan police is outside, waiting for a chance to grab him.<p>Yet the Swedish police still refuse to interview him, while making up bogus excuses for why they don't. They could have stated the reason you suggest: That if they make the decision to charge him, they want to be able to take him into custody immediately under the circumstances. That reason is still a poor excuse, but they've not even tried to use even that.<p>If he is a flight risk in his current location, he is a flight risk whether or not they interview or charge him - his only realistic means of escape is if he gets asylum from Ecuador and Ecuador finds a way of getting him on a plane, whether smuggling him in an oversized diplomatic pouch or convincing the UK to give him free passage. Either way, this doesn't become any harder or easier depending on whether or not Swedish authorities interview him.<p>The Swedish might not be the <i>only ones</i> acting irrationally. But if they're not acting irrationally, it would imply they have a hidden agenda. If their agenda is what they claim it is, then yes, they are acting irrationally.

Sometimes it's just all about influential/powerful people and their ego [1]. Yes, the apps have to look good (but Apple makes it easier than Android to make apps look good - remember the bar keeps going up and up).<p>As a sub-contractor, we would handle everything from the initial Apple developer account (for the company) to TestFlight betas to code/content updates. Complete outsourcing. The customers never know (or care) that XYZ company/national non-profit or Fortune 500 brand isn't writing their own apps - they just see ""XYZ Brand, updated 08-Mar-2012' in iTunes.<p>[1] I recall a conversation once with a museum marketing person. They were basically like 'Well, did you look at the MoMa's app?'. I tried to remind them that MoMa has a basically unlimited marketing budget to spend on slick, polished apps - but they all want to bragging rights - for the museum president to be able to show his/her peers (other museum presidents, board members) the app. Really.",1345087677.0

The electronic disk ejection mechanism was very cool. The battery life was unheard of. The was a button for every function, and every function could be messed with. I remember keeping the language in Japanese and the eerie blue backlight on the remote permanently turned on so that it looked cool.<p>But at the time it was released Apple had released the iPod. Basically a tiny HDD and audio decoder hidden under a simple user interface and simple human-machine-interface. All it did was play music, and it could store a lot of it for a little over half the price of the MZ-N10. Instead of being encrusted with a myriad of buttons, it relegated the functionality to the user interface. Simplicity through clever software.<p>Since then every Japanese gadget I've purchased has suffered from the same problem - excellent engineering but poor user-interface. The one exception being my Canon image stabilised binoculars which have exactly one button and a focus ring.
