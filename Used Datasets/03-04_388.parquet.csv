It is a textbook case of distorting a metric by relying on it.<p>Traffic to (and engagement on) a site seems to be a much better signal, for the many sites that use Google Analytics, at least. But not everyone uses GA though...<p>Backpedalling now, PageRank is about weighted links. Link farms should have no weight to give, and links from the user generated parts of pages (which are easy to detect on most blog platforms)  should be easy enough to weight fairly too. So it is hard to see why Googlebot gets fooled by any blackhat link techniques that Google humans are aware of, except maybe the case of selling links (influence peddling), but one can argue that is a social /legal issue, not a technical problem.",1332043062.0

Similarly, few recent mathematical advances have started with formalizations and axioms.  Calculus wasn't put on a rigorous basis until Lebesgue's time, hundreds of years after Newton and Leibniz.  Category theory needed quite some work before it was formalizable.  Differential geometry wasn't that rigorous until the twenties or so.  Complex analysis was developed using many, many unnecessary assumptions because the formalities weren't there.  I'm not picking-and-choosing math fields here; these are just the ones I'm familiar ones.  It turns out, axiomatization and theory-building are two separate jobs rarely performed by the same mathematician.  Usually, the theory-building makes the mathematician famous, and the axiomatization does not, but this is in many ways a tragedy.  In any case, to the outsider of mathematics, it seems that axioms come first.  This is false -- axioms come much later, because the work of axiomatizing isn't worth it before the theory proves itself useful.  Axioms come first in a formal way, in the same way classes come first in a formal way.  But the interesting thing isn't the class -- it's the instance.  And in the same way, the axioms aren't interesting -- it's the resulting theories.  I found the analogy very insightful.",1332043057.0
4,3719052,comment,3717715.0,3718926.0,7,0,tfb,,,"I'm glad to see this discussion on HN, because I've always wondered if there was something I was really missing regarding OO programming and whether or not coding in that style exclusively would make me a better programmer.  Obviously it's all subjective and somewhat dependent on the task at hand, but my concern is probably more with whether that ""style"" of thinking is beneficial.<p>Then, fairly recently, I dabbled in some OO programming when I was making a mod for Unreal Tournament (I've also coded in C++ in the past, but not extensively); and I realized that I had already been using the same line of thinking with my functional programming in the way I was using structs, tuples, etc.  When you really get down to it, it's really all just syntax and semantics.<p>For whatever reason, my brain has always naturally leaned towards the functional style; and it's just my opinion (of which gruseom seems to agree) and my opinion is probably only the result of how my brain works, but something about OO programming always seemed unnecessary <i>for me</i>.  It seems to me like it's just another way for people with different thought processes than my own to represent their program logic.  To me it seems a little too verbose and entirely too repetitive, and I always felt like the overhead required to ""classify"" everything wasn't worth it; but it's all in how you look at it, how your brain works or what you're used to.  So what seems unnecessary to me (and makes it harder for me <i>personally</i> to trace the program's logic) might be perfectly comprehensible code for someone else; and some of the relatively minimalistic code I attempt to write might seem perfect to me, while an OO-minded programmer might feel like it's scattered about and hard to understand.<p>Good code is good code, regardless of the paradigm.",1332042987.0

12,3719044,comment,3717903.0,3718744.0,3,0,tolmasky,,,"Let me begin by saying that I don't think books aren't the right approach for every programmer - simply true beginners.<p>In my experience beginner programmers get stuck very quickly on very small and frustrating bugs, such as not understanding how to put together the syntax. If they can't overcome this quickly, you may completely lose them. This is where the book completely fails as it can provide no further assistance. Even if the answer is  provided in the printed text, the individual may not ""see"" the difference between what they've typed and what the book has printed (it may take a while to get used to the computer-level of exactness you need when comparing code, and to overcome some punctuation blindness they may have developed from normal reading, etc.).<p>Similarly, I believe it is bad to read too much before doing anything, because as you read you believe you are following along: ""uh huh, that makes sense, sure, got it..."", then a whole chapter in you may actually start coding and notice you don't really know what's going on (or again, simply think you don't due to some simple syntax mistake). Now the individual will feel overwhelmed as they have an entire chapter's worth of material that they may or may not understand. Even if there are exercises in the middle, people often say ""oh thats easy and makes sense"" and skip it since its a ""waste of time"" (which is bad, because its very easy to think you understand something when they don't).<p>Having seen a few people use codeacademy, I now believe that it may need to be taken a step further: I think for the first few exercises the code should actually be ghosted so that the user is literally ""tracing"" over it (as opposed to the current technique of saying ""now type this in the console""). For example, as I described in a previous comment, one person got completely stuck because it said ""Now type variable.length."". The user didn't notice that the last period wasn't part of the code and unfortunately the error isn't very beginner-friendly: ""Expected an identifier but found '}' instead"" -- ""what, I didn't type a }? And what's an identifier?"". I believe ghosting the text and beeping when you type a character that doesn't match can give you a feel for the code -- its kind of how rewriting notes really helps it sink in vs. just reading them. Then, slowly take the training wheels off.",1332042633.0

The sirens are great, and they do mostly work. Meteorologists do a fantastic job of predicting storms and their velocity, but getting that information out is <i>hard</i>.\nIf I'm asleep and I hear the sirens, that acts as a general warning. I can dive into a basement or tornado shelter, but then getting further information is difficult. Yes, you can buy self powered radios, but you know that many people simply don't. But everyone will cling the to their phones like they're made of gold, so we should make use of that.<p>Second is getting information back out. An upcoming feature is to report back to places like Facebook, Twitter, and other networks that you're close to a tornado. This lets your friends and family know what is going on, and to many people this is important too.<p>Third is more information. Laura Myers at Mississippi State University has conducted interviews with several thousand people regarding their behaviour during a tornado watch. The striking thing is that everyone wants confirmation before they act. Sirens alone aren't enough for most people, they want more information. They want to know they're <i>directly</i> in the path of real tornados.  This app is here to help bridge that gap. If the sirens go off and people around are reporting that real tornados are touching down, I hope this helps give those people even more motivation to get moving to their safe spot. The sirens SHOULD be enough, but we all know they're not and human behaviour doesn't work like that :-)<p>So, at the end of the day, if this helps save even a single life, I think it's worth it.

54,3719001,comment,3717715.0,3718896.0,2,0,hackinthebochs,,,"OO enterprisey mess is strictly better than global state ridden spaghetti code. The hard part with enterprisey code is that the code performing the action is hidden under layers of abstraction. The bootstrapping cost is much higher here because you have to put more abstractions in your head before you can understand a particular bit of functionality. This is a different sort of complexity than the global state spaghetti.<p>With the global state code you have to understand the entire codebase to be sure who exactly is modifying a particular bit of state. This is far more fragile because the ""interaction space"" of a bit of code is much greater. The dangerous part is that while you must understand the whole codebase, the code itself doesn't enforce this. You're free to cowboy-edit a particular function and feel smug that this was much easier than the enterprisey code. But you can't be sure you didn't introduce a subtle bug in doing so.<p>The enterprisey code is better because it forces you to understand exactly what you need to before you can modify the program. Plus the layered abstractions provide strong type safety to help against introducing bugs. Enterprisey code has its flaws, but I think its a flaw of organization of the code rather than the abstractions themselves.

Or is the strategy here to just poll if the queue is empty? (Either is a usable strategy.)<p>* Sometimes you will have particular queue items that cause the processor to die, because of some weird bug. It can be helpful to stick those into a separate ""holding area"" after a few failures, and send out warning emails to someone who can fix the problem.<p>* How do you monitor the number of jobs queued and in progress? You could get all the items in the list with LRANGE and look at their timestamps (if any), but if the items are large and there are a few million of them, this could be irritatingly slow. Monitoring is super-important!<p>That said, Redis can be really useful for writing queues. At Greplin we're pushing so much data through a Redis-based queue system that we actually managed to max out the operations-per-second on EC2 Large instances, and had to shard across a few servers. The basic idea is that we encode everything as protocol buffers, LPUSH it into a waiting queue, and have the processor do something similar to this:<p>1. RPOPLPUSH moves the item at the head of the waiting queue into a one-element in-progress queue. The name of the queue includes a counter for how many unsuccessful processing attempts have been made (starting at 0).<p>2. Process the item.<p>3. LPUSH the output into zero or more waiting queues for the next processing stage, and delete the in-progress queue. Unless there was an error, in which case things get complicated. :-(<p>There are a surprising number of complicated little issues that come up when making queueing systems for heavy production use! For example, how do we coordinate the topology, and which servers to connect to? If one of our EC2 instances goes down and takes a Redis master with it, how do we seamlessly switch over to the slave? How do we shunt aside ""killer"" items for later processing after we've fixed the bugs that they were causing? What happens when there's a load spike and queue length goes through the roof, and the Redis servers start using up all their memory?<p>These problems all have solutions -- for example, you can build most of the coordination and rate-limiting stuff with Zookeeper -- and for the most part I've been very happy with Redis. It's been very solid and reliable, with convenient operations, easy administration, and great speed! I just think that queueing systems are an area ripe for improvement.",1332040281.0
