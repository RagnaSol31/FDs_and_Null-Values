A single version of the truth etc.<p>SQL's ""CREATE VIEW"" does this already (note: not all views can support CRUD, e.g. if you changed an aggregate column, like COUNT, there is no clear meaning for the affect on the underlying tables.

11,3406514,comment,3406345.0,3406345.0,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"So, I just spent a few minutes trying to answer the following question: If I were uncomfortable about buying and installing my own RAM, and I went to Google to find a local store that would install RAM for me, what could I find?<p>I see Geek Squad trucks driving around all the time, and I happen to know (via other more extensive Google searches) that Geek Squad will install RAM for $50, if I miraculously manage to buy the RAM and bring it in to them with the computer. Awesome! Presumably they can also help me find the RAM in their Best Buy store and buy it.<p>But when I search ""geek squad install mac memory"" do I get a nice landing page? Nope, I get a generic ad leading to a <i>generic</i> landing page that doesn't mention memory but offers to sell me a $99/year support subscription that includes such helpful stuff as ""antivirus"". Given that I've just bought an Apple device and - however naive I am - probably understand that this comes with free Genius Bar support, I'm going to click away from that page and never return.<p>Now, I happen to live in a town with a Micro Center, so I Google up ""micro center mac memory"", and do I get my landing page? Nope. Top result is an ad directly from Apple for their $400 RAM. Below that is an ad from Crucial that leads to a page which requires me to read words like ""DDR"" and know that my machine is a ""2.2 GHz early-2011"" model. Then there's a similar ad from ""MacMemory.com"" that leads to a page that makes Crucial's look like a model of UX design. And finally there's a bunch of links to Micro Center, several of which lead to <i>computers</i> but not RAM, a few of which lead to catalog entries for RAM complete with the DDRs and the GHz and the scary photos of green circuit boards, but none of which suggest the known fact that <i>Micro Center has a tech shop in house</i> and <i>that shop will install RAM for you</i>.<p>Even typing ""Boston mac memory upgrade"" only gives me one local store link on the SERP:<p><a href=""http://www.macintoshdr.com/Mac_Doctor/Upgrades.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macintoshdr.com/Mac_Doctor/Upgrades.html</a><p>... and that's not a great landing page. Nothing specific to my problem. Most particularly: No price. But they do offer to ask me lots and lots of questions as they get to know me and my very personal problems with my personal computer. Techies: as a non-techie I probably don't yearn to open a <i>dialogue</i> with you, partly because I know I'll be <i>mortally embarrassed</i> by the conversation, and partly out of fear that you will <i>try to convince me to spend hundreds of dollars using words which I cannot understand or rebut.</i> Whereas I know that if I pay the nice Apple guy four hundred bucks my computer will vanish for fifteen minutes, magically reappear with more memory, and that's it.<p>So my answer is: Apparently Apple gets to charge their prices because nobody else in the league knows how to play this game.",1325217246.0

It's not that the info is completely useless, but a stronger analysis would have been nice.<p>What's the point of including the speculation about the download numbers of the top three apps? Even if the top three publishers didn't want to share, maybe the author of the post could have gotten some more data from other top 30 publishers to make a more educated guess. The stats for one app can't magically result in the number 70,000. What are the other ""observations"" that are mentioned?<p>The author specifically talks about the big spike in downloads on Christmas day, but only the screenshot of the graph at the end shows the numbers after Christmas. They're dropping fast. When are those numbers going to level off? It would have been nice if the author waited a week before posting. At least then we could make better predictions about how well apps will do when everyone returns to their normal routine in the new year.<p>Finally, I wish that the post had included some data about paid apps. Was the spike on Christmas as dramatic for paid apps? We know that Android users are less likely to pay for apps overall than iOS users. Do Amazon Appstore users have the same behavior? If so, did the Kindle Fire Christmas gifts bring in new type of Android user that is more willing to fork over money for apps?",1325216450.0
