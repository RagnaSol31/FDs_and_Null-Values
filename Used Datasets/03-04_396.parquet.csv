Even on a big project, there should only ever be ""enough programmers"", just enough to get the job done under budget (hopefully) and on time. It's easy to put the burden on the programmer to <i>carry on soldier!</i> But a lot of the burden of productivity is often on the managers themselves. Mangement needs to manage, not cause strife and yet that's what some do.<p>Erik Lukas seems like a guy who's had his act together from very early on and whether he read up or not, he knew how to manage his people. That's a key skill.<p>There's also been a complete cultural overhaul in the community. Programemrs have been spoiled, for better for worse, and maybe we're expecting too much.

Now bitcoiners have 2 choices : use the modified code that specifically allows this transfer/money creation, or go to jail.<p>What do you think big players will do ?<p>Bitcoin is actually extra bad for this since it publishes a full financial record. To anyone with a sufficiently large source of identified transactions your accounts are an open book, if they can find just one transaction they're sure was done by you (say, paying your taxes). They don't have to contact 20 banks to find out where your funds went and who was involved, that information is public record. There is no way to pass through a bank in Saudi Arabia or some other bastard country to obscure and/or delay investigations.<p>Besides, having undeclared money in bitcoin is money laundering. Just having it. Penalty : up to 10 years jail time (Western Europe, and 50 km from here it's up to life in jail, gotta love the dutch). For the moment nobody's been found guilty, but that's mostly because it's only just starting to surface.<p>And frankly, this is exactly what we want. We may not like governments printing money and abusing it, but anybody who studied the great financial crises of the end of the 19th beginning of the 20th century, it is plainly obvious that the current situation (regularly ""big financial scandal, you're probably overpaying your insurance $10"") is better than what happened with the gold standard (regularly ""surprise !

57,5234076,comment,5233907.0,5233907.0,5,0,dlss,,,"This is a peculiar essay. I think if you're going to debunk an old saying, you first have to have an appreciation for why existed in the first place. What was running through the mind of the person that originally came up with it.<p>So, before I reply to the essay, I'd like to share what I think ""it's not what you know, it's who you know"" is trying to say. I think similar to the old IBM quote, ""nothing happens until a sale is made""  maybe something like ""it's pretty hard to do something meaningful on your own.""<p>Now, I agree the strongest form of these statement is no longer valid. Before the Internet, someone stranded in the middle of nowhere who knew a lot of math would have no way of knowing about the great areas she could apply her skill. These days that is less true, although I do think that being surrounded by other bright people facing similar problems (as the author is in the case of Harvard and the Theil fellowship) is probably better than just having an Internet connection.<p>For a more personal example, I be willing to bet that the vast majority of people reading this found their current profession via word-of-mouth. A friend, family member, or teacher showed you programming long before you were making connections via open application. (This is almost surely true in for OPs case).<p>Even in the case of open applications, who you know is still very important. Something like 80% of all hires come from networking.<p>So I think the point the author is trying to make is a very limited one: in markets that are dying for talent, talent can sometimes trump connections.<p>(Though with the big caveat that if you have very few connections you would almost certainly earn far more, and do far more good, if you spent some time making connections)<p>On second thought, maybe all the author is trying to say is that once you have connections, it feels like connections don't matter.",1361071766.0

Any kind of legal action from the government - from throwing someone in jail for possession of marijuana to suing banks over financial crimes - has negative economic consequences. If we send someone to jail for drug possession, we spend a lot of money investigating and prosecuting them, we pay to keep them locked up, we happily give up their productivity and any taxes they would have paid, and we reduce their long-term value to society by hanging a public arrest record on them. So, where do we stop using economic consequences as a reason for not enforcing laws?<p>I'm somewhat highly-compensated and I contribute a lot back to the economy, though consumption and taxes. Should the government prosecute me and someone who only earns minimum wage differently, since prosecuting me and throwing me in jail will have a substantially higher negative impact on the economy? Maybe I get 2 or 3 free misdemeanors per year, your average millionaire gets a free felony, and if you are on Fortune's top 100 list you get 3 free felonies?<p>I'm seeing more and more justification of not going after big companies and powerful executives due to the economic impact, and I think that is getting awfully close to codifying different legal systems for rich people and poor people.

But when I tried to explain it to people who are not in love with math, I just get blank stares: they would understand it, be able to use it, but would never have tears in their eyes when trying to explain it to someone else.
