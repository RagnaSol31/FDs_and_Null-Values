You might have seen this while working with the programming language you have mastered. If there is syntax error, you generally don't read the entire error message. You just ideally read the template and the 'fill-ups' in the template and the line number. You go straight without bothering much and fix it.<p>Same with an editor. There are some things that you do so frequently, its actually better and efficient if the editor enables muscle-memory use cases than Apple product's kinda UI design.<p>Its precisely this 'problems matched to solution patterns' thing that will some day enable us to do drag and drop programming.<p>There will ready templates for each problem each of which will match a solution pattern. We will just parameterize the templates. To an extent this is already there auto-complete, macros, template driven programming etc. But in future we may see full scale stuff like this.",1321761410.0

This lead to the rise of the class of ""professional managers"", whose interests are intrinsically short-term. In the times when American wealth was created, the owners called the companies with their own names: Boeing, Ford, and MBAs did not exist. Their interests were to pass the earned wealth to their children.

A friend with a much ""better"" MBA than me (his from Harvard) once remarked, ""Modeling is a great way to determine if a business idea is awful, but it's not going to tell you if you have a good one.""  I might argue even further that modeling can lead one to dismiss profound ideas through the erroneous presumption of a static future.  It was said that the original business justification for Xerox counted the number of typists in America and multiplied by the number of mimeograph copies produced from each document.  Obviously, the copy machine found many more purposes once introduced into offices -- a much more dynamic effect than most could even imagine.<p>Perhaps Dell's artificially static future was the presumption that shipping a laptop or desktop with a pre-installed OS would continue to be a viable business model?  What if Steve Jobs had been forced at gunpoint fifteen years ago to lead Dell?  What would the outcome have been?  He likely would have spoken harshly about the elephant in the room -- Dell produces a commodity, and its future depends on Microsoft's continued prowess.  With such an admission out in the open, what actions could have been taken which would have been nearly impossible to quantify via traditional B-School modeling techniques?",1321761255.0

It requires mastery to understand the potential and power that lies in it. The inclusion of emacs lisp is amazing, but seriously? Have you programmed a separate application in emacs lisp? You haven't? What? You used Scheme or Common Lisp instead? Than why the fuck are you defending emacs lisp?<p>And that is the biggest flaw. The flaw no one likes to talk about. How many people have picked up emacs and quit? I certainly have. Numerous times. How big do you think the population of people who have tried emacs is to the number of current users? Seriously, in terms of a conversion rate, it's absolutely terrible. And you think that's a good thing? Don't give me that bullshit about how only ""smart"" people will put the effort in. It isn't about fucking effort. It's about giving people the confidence to learn more about your software. And emacs almost definitely fails there.<p>And that's the whole fucking point of computer science. It's not writing the ""greatest"" programs. It's sharing. Sharing techniques, skills, libraries and ideas. And emacs is an artificial barrier. And worse than that, the most elite people in CS continue to protect it and cannot comprehend that their elitism is to the detriment to CS as a whole. It's complicated, arbitrary and designed in a terrible manner. I don't care if it makes sense to you. What matters is that you should be able to easily defend any design decision. And you can't.<p>We need more people to start programming. We need better editors. Why is it that CS has some of the oldest, most decrepit tools with the most adamant defenders? Why?<p>Seriously, we deal with fucking computers all day. The most arbitrary representation of knowledge possible. And all people do is whine about how things are ""good enough"" or ""no, someone made this decision a long time ago, and now a lot of people make the same choice, so don't be stupid and choose that.""<p>The number of new computer languages being invented is almost fucking SLOWING down. WTF? Computer science is about the drive to find better ways to express and share knowledge, and that means trying new things. Usually, they will suck. But jesus, we have to keep trying. And whatever we do, we have to help a). more people try programming, and stick to it b). support people following their own loony ideas.<p>I mean seriously, it's fucking sad how slow shit happens. Common lisp, one of the more powerful languages ever invented, got a wonderful tool called quicklisp last year. 15 FUCKING YEARS AFTER CPAN CAME OUT. Why the fuck is shit so fucked up, I mean jesus, it's fucking inexcusable. Our descendants are going to mock us to our faces til we fucking hara-kiri.",1321759553.0

The project's goal is to have an all-in-one, visually appealing platform to teach and explain different concepts in AI. It was started as a closed-source collaboration with a games company and has since been rewritten as an open source project. I've been contributing to the codebase for the last few months, so I have some experience here.<p>First off, teaching <i>anything</i> non-trivial is difficult. By non-trivial, I mean formal knowledge that requires you to actually have a deep understanding of the material, as opposed to rote learning or reusable strategies like most games involve. I haven't played Skyrim, so if there is some actual expertise you acquire through playing it, I'd be happy to hear about it.<p>Imagine you're trying to teach statistics. You start out with some gambling game to teach basic odds and probabilities, and that's great. Now how does that transition to Gaussian distributions and standard deviations, one of the most fundamental and comparatively simple concepts in statistics, without simply being boring? It's not so clear.<p>Second, is there any real money in it? I suppose if you can get lots of schools to use your game, then great. But of course we know how long those sales cycles are, and you can't really expect your game to look all that awesome in 3 years after you've finally worked your way up the organizational ladder and closed. So you probably need to either sell your game directly to consumers or give it away.<p>If you're going to sell it to consumers, you have to compete with other games in your market. This is tough because a game that requires little critical thinking will likely be more appealing to a broad audience. Again, maybe Skyrim requires truly critical thinking along the lines of understanding derivatives and integrals, and if it does please correct me, but I doubt it. Most people buy videogames to play in their downtime, so they want to relax. This means your market will be very niche and I just do not see the long-term potential.<p>The other option, giving it away, puts you in a similar situation to what we're doing at UT. If you are giving it away, you probably need to find people who will work for cheap because grants do not end up paying much for this sort of thing, enter students. Our situation is such that we have had literally dozens of people adding, changing, and branching the code with varying degrees of quality in commits (looking at you, undergrads), creating lots of technical debt. We also are not experts in game development, so the graphics and mechanics are a little rough. That said, it's a pretty decent platform for teaching and demoing different concepts in AI. But is it as awesome, polished, and fun as Skyrim looks? Of course not-- you get what you pay for.<p>I guess my main point is that there are plenty of legitimate reasons that such teaching environments are not pervasive in modern education. It's one of those ideas that is easy on the surface but quickly breaks down in practice. When it works, it makes for neat demos, but to make it work at the same scale as a commercially successful video game just seems infeasible in today's market.<p>[1] <a href=""http://opennero.googlecode.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opennero.googlecode.com</a>",1321758861.0
