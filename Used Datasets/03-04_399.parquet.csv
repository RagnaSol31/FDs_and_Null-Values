The Android app is so janky that it may as well not exist.  It's been three years and I still can't receive picture messages.  Text messages get dropped 20% of the time, and you have to choose between having them forwarded to your cell phone with contact names inexplicably prepended to every message (often resulting in long texts being split up into 3 or more parts that get delivered in the wrong order) or having them delivered via pull notification on the Android app, which <i>might</i> notify you of new texts within 24 hours.  Sometimes, calls will instantly disconnect when I pick them up.  There is no support.  There is no hope.  There is only Google, the Fortress of Customer Solitude.",1295495908.0

But they never should have been paying for traffic with a final destination in Comcast's network (peering traffic).<p>As a Tier 1 ISP, Level3 does not require Comcast to carry any transit traffic for it.  If Level3 has to pay to deliver traffic that Comcast's customers themselves have requested, Comcast is clearly charging Level3 (and by extension, Netflix) for access to the customers on their network.  If Comcast broke off its peering agreement with Level3, all that traffic would instead be going through a different transit provider.  Comcast would then likely have to pay to receive that traffic.<p>Comcast is in a position to charge for access to their customers because they have a monopoly on access to those customers. Those customers may not even have other choices for broadband internet access, because infrastructure has such high barriers to entry.<p>Because the consumer broadband market has high barriers to entry,[1] there is little competition.[2]  That lack of competition in infrastructure is now distorting the market for internet applications, possibly the closest thing to perfectly competitive market that has ever existed,[3] by raising both the barrier to entry and transaction costs.<p>Yes, regulation would distort the market.
