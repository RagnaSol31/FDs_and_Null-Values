I spent a lot of my time attending friends lectures as well because you could just walk in and join the discussion without enrolling in the course. At university I would talk to people (students, academics, university staffers and researchers, hangers on) who specialised in an amazing array of topics. I would get interested in the practicalities of structural engineering for abstract architecture or plant sucrose transport channel manipulation simply by finding someone and talking to them about it.<p>If a school doesn't offer an entire history program, the chances of meeting someone really interested and specialised in history go down dramatically. A program isn't cut in isolation, courses are dropped, academics are fired, research programs are ended and opportunities are lost. Some universities have cut back to only offering first year courses in humanities (which you could probably learn everything from such courses with wikipedia, Khan Academy and an understocked library). You are unlikely to find people with more than a passing interest in a field if it isn't available for research at a university. Cut enough programs (or only offer a few to start with) and the school is a degree mill.<p>Highly specialised universities are often dead ends socially. They aren't fun places to visit, people are only there for that piece of paper that gets them a job. I've worked in a technical campus that was completely silent at night. The students would go across town to another university because ""the music was better"" or ""it's more fun there"". If there are no bands forming in an Engineering department there is something seriously wrong with the creative environment of the school or with the people who attend it. If you really want to find out why this is such a terrible idea go somewhere that has already done it.",1322193457.0

It's the process of exploring new niches and becoming ""best fit"" for a niche. So, humans have explored more niches in biological evolution, but all the while bacteria have instead continually adapted to become better and better fit for their niche.<p>Ultimately, the consequence of this is that it would be much easier for humans to be evicted from their niche, or for that niche to move just far enough for humans to no longer be able to cope.
