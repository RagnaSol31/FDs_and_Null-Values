Not sure if it's a joke or if it represents the opinions of cat-v.<p>But the first link is on the money.  I would not call it ""odd"" as that seems to carry a negative connotation.  Rather, it's sensible, albeit irreverent, thinking to question dynamic linking (as the Plan 9 people have) and alas the mainstream of software development has a difficult time thinking sensibly and prefers to ""follow the herd"".<p>Dynamic linking is anything but a clear ""win"", using the silly web lingo of today.  It's one of those many engineering trade offs we continue to live with even though the original rationale for its adoption no longer exists.<p>Here's the problem as I see it.<p>You link to a library of n functions where, e.g., n > 10.  But your program only uses 1 or 2 of those functions.<p>There is no accounting method for keeping track of which functions each of those ""4000"" different binaries uses.  How easy is it to tell me what functions each of those ""4000"" binaries uses, and which libraries they reside in?  I have to resort to binutils hackery to extract this info, but it seems like basic information that should be easily available... because it should be used in making decisions.<p>Why link to a library with, e.g., > 10 functions when your program only uses, e.g., 2 of them?<p>How many functions in those libraries that your program links to are not used by your program?<p>No big deal you say.  And that's true.  Because of dynamic linking.<p>Dynamic linking to some degree makes us disregard this wasteful ""black box"" approach to use of library functions.<p>But what if we started static linking?  Then maybe we start to think more about those functions that are in the linked library but are not used.  We might even question the whole idea of libraries.<p>What if we took an accounting of all the unused functions?  How much space would they account for?<p>Why package functions together in libraries?  Whatever the original reasons were for adopting this practice, do they still exist today?<p>How many libraries do you have installed on your system that are only used by one or a few programs?  Is there a threshhold for how many programs need to use a group of functions before it justifies creating a library tobe shared?<p>If we really want to have functions that are to be shared among many disparate programs, and we have ""4000"" programs (cf. the no. of programs on a system in the 1980's) then it makes less sense to place them in arbitrary libraries (how many people know the location of every C fucntion purely based on library names intuition?) that have to be linked to as a unit.  We perpetuate a black box.  It makes more sense to have each function available on its own, and each program can select only those functions that it needs.<p>This is if we were static linking.<p>I do a lot of static linking because I move programs from system to system.  It works very well.<p>Another thing that I sometimes think about is the sticky bit.  We try to achieve the same effect with caching.  You call a program for the first time, it take some time to load.  You call it a second time and hopefully it's all in the cache, and it is much more ""responsive"".  But what if it cannot fit in the cache?  What if another program displace it?  Why can't we conscisouly keep a program in a ""cache""?  We give control to the OS, and we hope everything works as intended.<p>Dynamic linking reminds me very much of package management systems, particularly those that build form source.  It's extremely difficult to tell what a particular install procedure consists of.  You type ""make"" and what happens next is in many respects a black box.  Only so much information can be reliably extracted from the system.  For example, if you wanted to know all the possible Makefile variables in the package management system, it's virtually impossible to get a list.  You can get most, but not all.<p>The way thse systems work is a lot like shared libraries.  The mainatiners err on the side of overinclusion of dependencies, some of which may not actually be needed, in order to keep the black box working reliably.",1342323626.0

41,4246018,comment,4245737.0,4245737.0,40,0,nessus42,,,"I've been watching some talks online recently by Rich Hickey of Clojure fame, and he's a very interesting and convincing speaker. He basically makes the same argument that Armstrong makes here.<p>I'm not clear, however, how the pro-FP, anti-OO crowd address the Law of Demeter, which is often summarized as ""One dot: good. Two dots: bad."" The canonical example where the Law of Demeter serves us well comes from some of the original Demeter papers, which I actually read a long time ago when they were current. This canonical example is that of an object to represent a book.<p>One of the initial selling points of OO was that if you encapsulate the representation of an object from its interface, this ends up giving you a lot more flexibility. For the case of representing a book, pre-Demeter, a typical OO organization would have been to provide a method to give you chapters of the book as Chapter objects, and from there you could get Section objects, from which you could get Paragraph objects, from which you could get Sentence objects, from which you could extract the words as strings.<p>The Demeter proponents correctly argued that this OO organization of the Book rather defeats the goal of encapsulation, since with this organization you cannot restructure the internals of the Book object without breaking the API. E.g., if you decide to insert Subsections between Sections and Paragraphs, your API for extracting all the sentences of a book will change, and consequently, much of the client code will have to change.<p>The Demeter folks argued that instead of having to explicitly navigate to sentences, you should just be able to call a method on the Book object directly to get all the sentences. Without special tools, however, this is hard for the implementers of Book, since now they have to write tons of little delegation methods. I take it that people who are serious about following the Law of Demeter <i>do</i> do this, however. In the original Demeter system, Demeter would do this automatically for you. The problem with the original Demeter system is that few people actually ever used it, and it was rather complicated for Demeter to provide this automatic navigation.<p>So, back to FP: Rich Hickey argues to forgo damned objects and to just let the data be <i>data</i>. So if I follow Hickey's advice, how am I supposed to represent a book? As a vector of vectors of vectors of vectors of strings? If so, then how do I prevent a change in the representation of the Book from breaking client code? If I had followed the Law of Demeter with OO, then everything would be golden.<p>Sure, with this naive FP approach, I could also provide a zillion functions to fetch different sub-structures out of the book. E.g., I could have a function to return all the sections in a specified chapter, and another to return all of the sentences in the book. This, however, would end up being little different from the OO approach following the Law of Demeter, with the further downside that if you change the representation of the book, you don't know that you haven't broken the client code, because you have no guarantee that the client code isn't accessing the representation directly.<p>Please advise.",1342323118.0

If the atmospheric concentration shifts, the ocean will release the CO2 it's absorbed and its pH will go up.<p>Granted, that's a pretty tall order.  Ideally, we would reduce the atmospheric CO2 from ~400ppm (where it's out now) to 200ppm (where it was before the whole industrial revolution began).  At the very least, we probably want to reverse the current trend of +2.0ppm / year to (say) -2.0ppm / year, so hopefully we skim under whatever the wire is.<p>Some researches claim that the Little Ice Age was caused by the reforestation of the Americas after Europeans accidentally killed all of the Americans who were keeping the content pretty clear of trees. [1]  It is estimated that reforesting the Americas sucked about 6ppm to 10ppm of CO2 out of the atmosphere.<p>So one way to suck CO2 out of the atmosphere is to grow a <i>lot</i> of trees (or other plant life).  And then do that every year for about a century; it's not enough to simply reforest even the entire world once, because that would probably only suck (say) 20ppm of CO2 out of the atmosphere, a mere tenth of the target.  So after you grow your primordial forest, you need to chop it all down, bury it (or do anything else with the wood that doesn't release its carbon back into the atmosphere), and then plant a new forest, and keep doing it over and over again for however long it takes to get the atmospheric CO2 levels to where you want them to be.<p>So it's <i>possible</i> to counter ocean acidification, and maybe not even that hard (hell, you're even creating a bit of a ""wood rush"", since you're going to have lumber coming out of your ears by the time you've regrown enough trees to cover the world ten times over), but I don't really see it happening.<p>ETA: Based on the figures for tree productivity [2] it looks like you'd need to add about 90 million square km (5% of the Earth's land area) of forests operating at peak productivity to go from +2ppm to -2ppm atmospheric CO2.<p>[1] <a href=""http://phys.org/news/2011-10-team-european-ice-age-due.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phys.org/news/2011-10-team-european-ice-age-due.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.safnet.org/answer/kids_corner.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.safnet.org/answer/kids_corner.cfm</a>",1342321459.0
