I only stopped following that rule on HN as HN itself got increasingly sillier.<p>And really, your VC example, in reverse, is in full display on HN. There are always articles complaining about unfair shit that VC's pull, and VC's probably talk about unfair shit founders pull. The proper response, assuming you're a VC that doesn't pull unfair shit, is to say ""yeah, I hate that shit and I never do that."" Look at how Peroni (a recruiter) contributes to the perennial complaining-about-recruiters threads.<p>The OP is about using indirect, passive-aggressive communication techniques to close sales. I think it's fair game to complain about indirect, passive-aggressive communication techniques and the people who use them, and if someone observes that it tends to be women more often than men, so be it. If you're a woman who doesn't use indirect, passive-aggressive communication techniques, you come into this thread in the same position that Peroni comes into the multitude of threads about how useless recruiters are.",1323921573.0

For example, a simple model that could work quite well is to optimize for (read: minimize) the average time any passenger would wait for an elevator to arrive. But to do this, we need to model how frequently people request an elevator on each floor over the course of the day.<p>Modeling elevator requests\n- We can assume that the number of people who request the elevator on each floor is a Poisson process with a mean of n. On a representative day (i.e. for an office building, choose a weekday), we can observe the number of people who arrive at the elevator each hour. This data would drop in as the n in our Poisson arrival processes.<p>Computing optimal solutions\n- Using a statistical library, we can start generating simulated arrival data and apply integer optimization algorithms to determine which floor the elevator should rest on when there are no elevator requests, for each hour of the day.",1323921339.0

If you mean that they're two different approaches that can coexist, then yes. But I don't think they target orthogonal classes of bugs. In both cases, the goal is to employ some algorithmic, decidable method at compile-time to predict whether a given piece of code is ""correct"" or ""incorrect"", trading off the possibility of a false positive or false negative. Each approach does better or worse in different cases, but I think in a manner that either isn't orthogonal, or at least isn't obviously orthogonal (if ""orthogonal"" is meant in any strong sense, rather than just ""two different approaches""). And I think for any one, we can at least in principle ask whether the other one could've done it: e.g., if we're noticing a lot of bugs of a certain sort, could the type-checker have caught that? The <i>ambition</i>, at least, of static type systems is to render accurate bug-prediction impossible, because every bug statically predictable at compile-time will be a type error.",1323920377.0

Whilst these are important, music they do not make.  This demo is at the level of the very early computer music, some forty years ago.<p>I think what you fail to capture is emotion of the music. This can not be gained through a mechanically accurate replay of note values, in fact in a lot of cases, it is the inaccuracy or the movement in the timing of notes that can lead to emotion... Add to that the variances in dynamics (loudness), tonal quality and you start to gain some of the difference between a simple performance of tone and timing and start to see some of the complexity of a master performance.
