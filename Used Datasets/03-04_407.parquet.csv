The power wielded by the State is huge, and <i>directly</i> affects hundreds of millions of people a day. Facebook may have become a staple in some peoples lives but they [as a company] are not responsible for keeping citizens safe, regulating commerce, building infrastructure, waging war or brokering peace.<p>Facebook is a company that finds better ways to <i>serve up advertising</i>. That's not all they do, but that's how they make money.<p>Plantir is in a unique position to change an increasingly inefficient/ineffective system. US politics suck right now. We can all agree on that. But a company like Plantir operates on a different level than the fork-tongued politicians.<p>You say: <i>network with people in the startup industry</i> and <i>create my own startup</i> which tells me (and I might be wrong, please correct if so) that you enjoy the idea of disrupting the status quo.

That seems like a feature from the usability point of view - or at least I always assumed it was a feature.<p><i>BUT</i>, it turns out that if you are famous you don't want random people's names and comments attached to your own.<p>On Twitter, Oprah can say something and no one else sees the millions of people who doubtlessly beg her for giveaways. Government departments can tweet and not have to deal with the politics of approving/disapproving comments on their posts, etc etc.<p>Buzz etc promote interaction, but it turns out the the grief associated with interaction simply isn't worth it after a certain point.<p>I'd note that almost all the Twitter leadership group use it continuously. OTOH, while there are assorted (great) Google developers and PMs using Buzz I haven't seen any senior leadership using it - let along interacting on it (OTOH, most of the FriendFeed leadership did use it - maybe that's what kept it going).<p>I'd also note that this problem applies to Facebook, too. I think that in many cases Facebook pages are run by professional marketing people, so that pushes back the critical level of grief somewhat<p>I'd love if there was a better explanation for this. If this theory is true then I'm not sure what Google can do to fix Buzz - attaching a broadcast-only mode would be a difficult change to make.",1288669944.0
