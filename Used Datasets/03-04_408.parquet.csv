The important thing is functions aren't special, they can be passed around (i.e. the are 1st class objects).<p>I actually can't fathom having to code in a language in which you can't pass functions around.<p>Call backs is my biggest use of function passing.  This is really, really huge.<p>Currying, decorating/wrapping functions<p>Replacing methods/functions at run time. Great for testing.<p>Putting them in data structures. Often dictionaries. Often to create more dynamic switch like logic.  dict[key] = func_that_handles_key, etc.  then later, dict[key](key)<p>Lots of data is code stuff.<p>Closures just make the passed functions more powerful / convenient as they capture their scope.  Which is often used (at least by me in Python) to create function factories that return custom functions.<p>A contrived example but a pattern I use often.  Logging object with warn, debug, error functions.  You could hardcode / boilerplate each of those functions but that is boring, tedious, and nonDRY.  So instead you create a function factory and use it to return anonymous functions, like so.  Python.<p><pre><code>  def log_func_factory(level):\n    def closure(msg):\n      print level, msg\n    return closure\n  \n  class logging(object):\n    debug = log_func_factory('debug')  \n    warn = log_func_factory('warn')  \n    error = log_func_factory('error')  \n</code></pre>\nWith real code I'd not repeat those assignments and instead use a loop driven by data.<p><pre><code>  for level in ('debug', 'warn', 'error'):\n    setattr(logger, level) = log_func_factory(level)\n</code></pre>\nBam, data driven code.

All known associates of an individual would be linked together in a giant social network. An algorithm would flag conflicts of interest. This should make it easy to see problems with connections a step away from a public official rather than just high profile associates or close family members.<p>Automated alerts would trigger when individuals within a public official's group are arrested, convicted of a crime, etc. Much like Google's algorithm identifies ""bad neighborhoods"" of web site links, you could instantly see if a particular public official was surrounded by questionable or explicitly corrupt characters.<p>Most importantly this could be used to generate an easy to understand corruption score, making it simple for the public at large to understand how corrupt the individual is. Once a particular politician or official scored past a certain point they may become an outcast, finding potential campaign fundraisers and advocates avoiding them.<p>The migration of eyeballs away from television and old media is going to have a profound impact on the democratic political space.
