The guy who shot the TwitPic-seen-around-the-world (Flight 1549 on the Hudson) seems to siphon off some HN links and pass them off as his own 'deep web' finds. In his defense, he doesn't change the title - so he's not trying to hide it (totally).<p>I guess I'm a little annoyed that he is using HN as a tool to generate authority links (e.g. feed interesting articles to his twitter followers that will increase his twitter ""network""), without participating in the conversation at all (maybe he is anonymous). Also, he is running the link through Adjix to track his referral count. Yes, there are many lurkers on HN (I used to be one).<p>On the other hand, by ambiguation of the source (HN), he is protecting us from an onslaught of News.YC new readers.<p>What do you think? I bring this up because I think the top Twitterers feel obligated to supply interesting links to content to their followers. As a full disclosure, my highest-point submission ever - 'Best Paper Airplane' was from a Guy Kawasaki tweet (I don't follow him - it came up in Summize).<p>Really, maybe I'm making much ado about tweets here.

45,484022,comment,483724.0,484004.0,0,0,mattobrien,,,"A few things. First, this is a global recession. I would not expect unemployment in the US to be as bad now as it was during the Great Depression simply because the US occupies a different place in the global economy today. In 1929, the US was the manufacturer and creditor of the world - a position China occupies today. I would expect the urban unemployment rate in China to reach the high teens, maybe higher. China is likely already technically in a recession (their 6.8% 4th quarter GDP growth is a mirage. It is calculated year-on-year, rather than annualized, seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter. Hence, their 4th quarter was more likely zero or negative, and the first quarter of this year will be worse). Japan's economy is falling off a cliff at -13%. And Europe is in awful shape too; Germany's exports have died, and Eastern Europe is already in a depression scenario with 10% contraction nearly across the board. The question is where is the demand going to come from? No one can export their way out of this mess. Many sovereign states could default as well - small European countries with large banking sectors relative to GDP are at huge risk - and social unrest will likely only get worse. This is bad.<p>Second, Japan achieved roughly 1% growth annually during its lost decade, and that was with spending hundreds of billions on stimulus programs. Without that spending, Japan likely would have had years of negative growth. That is not a hopeful model of where our economy is headed.",1234840486.0

Now I understand what they're talking about.<p>Beacuse Eric Sink is a smart guy, but he doesn't understand git yet. He's still following the Subversion workflow. The secret is that ""git commit"" is <i>not a sacred act</i>. Don't be fooled by the words. When you do an ""svn commit"", the result is written in stone in some centralized repository where it can break everyone else's builds, now and forever. When you do a ""git commit"" the result sits on your machine. It goes nowhere. This is <i>distributed</i> version control -- a commit just changes your local repo, and if it doesn't work you just undo it. (Or, alternatively, make seven more commits in your efforts to fix it, then use the mighty ""git rebase --interactive"" to smash all of them together into a single, perfect commit. Then you pretend that it was correct all along. Nobody else will be the wiser. You'll look like a genius!)<p>So, if you want to pull half the hunks out of a previous commit, make a branch (you can make branches more easily than blinking -- <i>this is git</i>), pull out half the hunks, commit the result. <i>Then</i> compile and test. (If you like, you can probably use a post-commit hook to compile and test automatically.) If the tests pass, merge your experimental branch back into your development branch, then do the ""git push"" to the central repository. It is that push -- not any of your commits -- that is the point where you have to be sure that you're not breaking anything. And you can't use git's index to <i>push</i> files that have never been visible to your compiler and your tests.<p>UPDATE: I have yet to actually use them, but another one of Sink's commenters reminds me that git has pre-commit hooks that seem to solve his specific problem. Here's something I googled up on that subject:<p><a href=""http://www.nabble.com/git-pre-commit-hook--best-place-to-make-available--td20907299.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nabble.com/git-pre-commit-hook--best-place-to-mak...</a><p>Again, I don't use such a thing, because I think it's kind of silly to insist that every local commit pass all tests. That's a recipe for failing to make enough local commits. I've been finding that it's better to make a commit every time you make <i>any</i> change that can be described in an English sentence. Then you have a little log of everything that you've done that you can rearrange with ""git rebase -i"" and turn into your final, pushable commits.",1234840216.0

It means you can focus on the quality of the OS, while fresh user tools can be <i>easily</i> backported from bleeding edge distros like Fedora.<p>I'm runing production servers which are 64-bit FC10 based systems onder the Xen 3.3 with kernels from CentOS.<p>Resent Fedora lacks support of 64bit dom0, but CentOS has it. xen-hypervisor I'm using is from FC11.<p>So, I have fresh developer tools along with latest Xen and very stable and well-tested kernel. It works pretty good.<p>Linux is like Lego, not like Windows.",1234839938.0

We see reports that show that newspapers' customer base is literally dying off. The younger generations don't have the same place in their lives for dead-tree news.<p>The economic downturn and advertising nosedive will decrease the available time window for newspapers to evolve. I think many will not make it. This could be a good thing. If there is a need for their services, something will appear to take their place (and eventually something with a viable business model). Startups will lead the way in innovation, and the smart newspapers that survived will learn to rapidly adopt what works (and hopefully cultivate a spirit of innovation themselves).<p>To be fair, I know a number of ""traditional"" journalists that have made the leap to Twitter, Digg, StumbleUpon, etc and have embraced these new forms to build flow, readership and conversation. I expect these folks to adapt and provide the professional expertise required for in-depth investigative journalism.",1234839746.0
