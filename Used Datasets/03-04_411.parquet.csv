(which is saying a lot, since I generally disdain PR people).  Commenting on a problem you've caused people without actually apologizing is kind of a dick move.  Even the US military does a better job when it accidentally kills people!<p>The statements should come from the top, but should probably only be written by founders if they're actually good at this kind of thing.<p>There are a lot of companies who are relatively good at crisis communications with affected parties.  Network carriers are often good (at least when talking to other networking professionals), although they often try to restrict the spread of information via NDA.<p>There are some reasons to limit disclosure immediately after an incident (if you think the vulnerability still exists and might put you at risk, especially for a security threat and not a regular outage).  You absolutely want to include ""why this won't happen again"" in your message (which Arash kind of did this time), but you also want to accept blame at an emotional level -- you can do this in ways which make you look perfectionist and hyper-professional, vs. weak.<p>I don't actually care that much about Dropbox security myself, but if anyone in the cloud computing space fucks up badly enough and frequently enough to make users distrustful of cloud resources, it makes life harder for everyone else in the space.

20,2677350,comment,2677188.0,2677291.0,24,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I wish these articles were more useful. However, I will beat my usual drum and point out that a major reason we cannot tell one such article from another is that <i>the original articles are behind a thirty-two-dollar-per-article paywall</i>.<p>I worked as a cancer researcher for a few years, and I assure you that the details can be quite interesting if you can <i>see</i> them. But from this writeup I can't see a thing. They delivered DNA to a mouse with cancer. Did the mouse have mouse cancer or transplanted human cancer? If the mouse had mouse cancer, how did it get that cancer? Did they administer carcinogens, or use mutant mice with cancer-prone prostates? If the mouse had human prostate cancer transplants (a typical technique) and those were cured by mouse anti-human antibodies formed in response to virus-borne human prostate DNA... does this have any relevance to human treatment at all, given that humans don't routinely come down with cancers that were transplanted from other mammals? And, crucially, what happened to the prostates of the mice? Did they get attacked by the antibodies that attacked the cancer? If not, why not? If so, are we really prepared to attack, say, stomach cancer by inducing an autoimmune response that might also attack the stomach itself? That doesn't sound so great!<p>These aren't even very sophisticated questions. (I was never a very <i>good</i> cancer researcher.) Anyone with a freshman education in bio could ask these basic but enlightening questions. And maybe someone with a <i>Nature Medicine</i> subscription would be kind enough to answer them. Because this popular-press rehash of a press release sure doesn't help much. As you say, such rehashes all sound the same. The devil is in the details, and the details are always missing.<p>EDIT: in my eagerness to give examples of basic questions I realize that I'm being a little too cartoonishly obtuse. In fact, we can deduce from the fact that the mice apparently <i>can</i> form antibodies that they are immunocompetent, which implies that they probably do have mouse cancer, because it's hard to transplant human cancer into a mouse with a functioning immune system. They reject it. But I shouldn't have to guess this stuff. It's all right there in <i>Nature Medicine</i>. Somewhere. Pity that the karma I'd earn for this comment isn't worth thirty-two dollars to me.",1308628259.0

27,2677343,comment,2676739.0,2676739.0,2,0,TikiTDO,,,"I feel this article is guilty of exactly what it argues against. Many of the views he writes off as ridiculous may be the results of countless thought processes working in any number of contexts. Instead of accepting this, he simplified each view that contradicts his own down to an obviously ridiculous claim, then makes use of what is effectively a traditional straw man argument. Sure, it's true that if your views are rationalized the way he expects them to be then you have no logical let to stand on. On the other hand should you have any sort of more complex and rational approach to the matter it appears that he will still gladly lump you with the lunatics.<p>That said, I do agree that the issue he is trying to point out is of vital importance. The fact is that most of the people that believe in mysticism, religions, UFOs, psychic powers, and other things to that effect are completely disconnected from the physical reality that they inhabit. However, I do not think the solution is to tell these people that their views are ridiculous, before quoting scientific facts the implications of which you might not even understand yourself. You would be better off establishing a rapport, and gradually introducing more and more facts that do not agree with their interpretation of the world.

And if using X, why not use apps that have desktop update functionality (where that is important)?</i><p>Not sure what you're asking here. I use X but switch between a fullscreen terminal running tmux and fullscreen Chrome. With tmux, you can multiplex a bunch of terminal windows, monitoring some of them for activity. For instance, if new mail arrives, mutt will repaint and its window will be flagged as active in the status bar at bottom.<p>I also use this as an ad-hoc notifications system: for example, kick off a long build, redirecting output to a file, and monitor its tmux window. When the process exits your shell prompt is printed again (activity!) and voila, you get a ""build is complete"" notification.<p><i>Is it just for the ability to use these programs on a remote server? Or do they improve workflow even on a local machine?</i><p>YMMV of course, but...<p>I use both remote and local tmux sessions. Reattaching to remote sessions and picking up where you left off is obviously useful, but it also comes in handy locally if X crashes, or if you need to remote in from a different machine. I build up a fair amount of ""working state"" inside a tmux session: an editor with tens or hundreds of files open, sql prompts, chat logs, shells with important history, etc. With suspend / resume you can go for months without having to tear down and rebuild that state. If I entrusted all that state to a gui, it certainly wouldn't live as long.<p>As for workflow, the world of text and text manipulation really has advantages once you get comfortable in it. Random access to programs is O(1) fast: in my setup, ""^A 0"" for editor, ""^A 4"" for mail, etc and it's obvious what number to hit for other ones. Compare to Alt-Tab style switching which is more like O(n) as you cycle through the list. I find the fine-grain motor control of mouse-based copy and paste cognitively wasteful and annoying. Keyboard-based selection of text lets you use your favorite editor bindings to jump to word boundaries, end of sentence, end of line etc and is much more pleasant. Searching <i>any</i> terminal output via ""/"" or ""?"" is handy.<p>You get the drift. ;)",1308627645.0
