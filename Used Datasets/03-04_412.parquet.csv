When I am coding I am often exploring, I want to try new things, and then after a while I settle with code that I am pleased with. But before that happens I can go through several iterations of changes. Writing tests before writing code is one thing, but adjusting the tests afterwards to accomodate the changes (which may be big) is a hurdle and slows down progress. In addition in a case such as mine where I am doing all the work alone and thus I know every corner of the code written so far gives little benefits.<p>I can imagine of course that TDD is a great tool when there's an assignment for a client with specific tasks to accomplish, but in other cases 'get something working first' is better I guess.",1298173367.0

How do you even begin to write a test for that?<p>On a micro-level, sure, maybe you're working on a single component.  And TDD would help you come up with the interface.  But if you don't even know if the answer is a genetic algo, or simulated annealing, or using mechanical turk, or whatever, there's really no point in even trying to freeze the interface.  Which is what TDD really does as much or even more than it verifies the resulting code.  It defines the interface ahead of time.  It's a way to trick developers into writing specifications without using that nasty imprecise context-sensitive language know as english.<p>But then again, right now we're rewriting a pretty critical piece of code.  We've thought a lot about how it works.  We had a few meetings about the new approach.  Wrote up a quick email with a basic API.  And doing pairing and TDD from there, well that's actually working out pretty well.  And I'm confident we're getting better code quicker because of the approach.<p>Ultimately it gets back to the statement that real developers ship.  In some cases, BDD and pairing will help you ship higher quality software quicker.  In other cases it won't, and it'll end up wasting money and time.

Is it realistic to think that anyone would hire a 19 year old, unproven college drop out?""<p>Realistic, yes.  But is it realistic to think you'll get paid a salary worth mentioning?  Not so much.<p>It sounds like you want to get in on something early, and most things early just don't have much money in them.  My advice: find a start up you love and go for it.  If you're really gung ho about a specific startup and are willing to share the founders' vision, I have a hard time believing they would reject you're help.  Expecting a decent salary though, is probably too much.<p>I was in the same situation as you 2 months ago.  I couldn't find a startup I loved so I started my own.  Now, I'm developing a product out of my old bedroom in my parents house (free housing ftw).  When the product's done, I'll move out west.<p>The one thing I would stress is to always have a backup plan.  Things will not go according to plan as much as you'd like, so be ready. I'm living with my parents now, but if they kick me out I know exactly where else I can get free/cheap housing while I develop.  If I run out of money and realize my startup won't make it, I can most likely go back to school.  If I can't get back in school, I know I would have an absolute blast being a bartender on a cruise ship.  After I save up some money I'll start over.",1298171176.0

These aren't usually directly related. For example, if I wanted to build a YouTube killer, the TDD process isn't relevant to the high level ""problems"" I want to solve (which, as you say, one might not know of yet).<p>TDD comes to play (from a developer POV) when I actually start to write some code that, say, transcodes a video or provides an authentication system. In those areas, the problem is obvious and contained and TDD can work well.<p><i>That means that odds are that you will never see this code again. You'd be a fool to spend any more time on it than absolutely necessary.</i><p>Which does not necessarily mean TDD is ""a waste of time"". If practicing TDD in a particular situation will result in <i>fewer hours</i> spent developing a feature, the upfront ""cost"" of those hours is not a waste of time if you spend more hours debugging your way through building a non-tested equivalent.<p>A developer should have a feel for which way works for them.
