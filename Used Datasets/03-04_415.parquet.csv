Another key requirement is for the data formats and systems development to be continuous and agile.<p>Part of the problem is the belief in, and acceptance of, not only deadly force but a monopoly on force, in the form of centralized government.  Common data formats are a critical missing component which should be agreed upon, but governments currently bear too much resemblance to large criminal organizations to expect them to really facilitate innovation.<p>I believe we need to iterate on the core of our social institutions, starting by reexamining basic premises.

We fail it.<p>If you want to go from New York to Los Angeles, you have a sub-5% chance of paying a fair price. Most often, you'll find yourself paying a ridiculously high price because you booked your ticket to close to the date, too far away from it, on the wrong day of the week, or in the wrong season. Then you get shitty service the whole way, including 40-minute security lines and $25 baggage-check fees. If you spring for business class (domestic first) you get service that was almost as good as what coach offered 30 years ago, when flying wasn't horrible.<p>Trains aren't even an option for mid-distance travel, due to the infrequent schedules, equally absurd fares, and slow speeds (comparable to cars, except on Acela, a ""high speed"" service that goes 120 mph).<p>We have good highways in the U.S., and people drive a lot in this country because it's the only mode of transportation that actually works (for a family of four, it's cheaper than air and rail, which is just fucking absurd) but it's just not safe to drive them faster than 80-90 mph average speed, and legally you can't even go that fast.<p>New York is the only city with ""decent"" (by American standards) public transit, and that's still not enough to slash housing prices to where they'd be with an extensive transit network.

I got an Asus Transformer Prime (so not the low end) at the end of last month and like it a great deal.  Being able to ""tear the screen off the laptop I'm using""... I didn't realize I've been wanting to do that for years now, until I could.<p>But I guess I could answer the questions posed by the piece nonetheless, who I, an android tablet buyer, am and what I use it for.  I'm an average Ph.D. student in a technical discipline. So I've only very little disposable income for fun gadgets, which I can augment a bit when I have a belief that they will also be useful.  Thus why I waited till android tablets got better enough and went for one designed to work very well with a keyboard.<p>What I use it for... well, what people I know seem to use their iPads for... email, light browsing online, and reading books/pdfs offline. Games... well, I'm hooked on Spirit right now, so maybe I should say playing one game over and over. :-)  Other coffeehouse computing sort of stuff... drawing diagrams and typing up what I need to on the go.  The touch-to-sound delay seems to preclude good musical instruments, but I've always been more of a drum machines, synths, and sequencers kind of guy, so I've been playing with those.  I keep meaning to put a python interpreter on here, but that darn dissertation work and all.<p>I had kinda hoped to make this my main computing machine.

33,3521238,comment,3518086.0,3518086.0,5,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... What I really would like to know is how book stores will look in 20 years? ...""</i> @sunnysideup ~ <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3518193"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3518193</a><p>This is really the most insightful question here. What would a book store look like?  I'll have a stab.<p>Eighteen years ago the Internet existed but the Web was just being born. I come from Melbourne. Melbourne really is a book city with bookshops catering for different interests. Those who liked comics, science fiction or books on artwork gravitated towards Minotaur in Swanston St, classics or first editions One Tree Hill on Collins, old books and out of print first editions a small shop at the top of Swanston St. The general public might go to a chain bookshop like ""Collins"" or ""Angus or Robinsons"". But if it was anything technical, you turned to McGills.<p>McGills was a second home to people needed fast access to very specific information. You would probably buy the source of the information if you needed it in a hurry or read it if out of interest. Remember the Web was in its infancy. To gain access to technical information to build things (software) there was no other choice. McGills was a hub for nerds. You'd find programmers, engineers and scientists who would pop in, look for a particular reference book at lunch time. As the afternoon wore on it would fill up with students too poor to buy monthly subscriptions to Wired, Game programmer or the latest Dr.Dobbs. The era at this time was disconnected but strangely connected.<p>Now we have seen what's happened in the last 20 years. The publishing industry is changing their distribution technology from print to electronic displays. The demise of the bookshop and books. Even so, the prices are similiar.<p>What might happen in the next 20?<p>Discoverability<p><pre><code>    Everyone has a little Nancy Drew in them.  Stock \n    up on the mysteries. \n\n    It is both true and sad that some people do in fact \n    buy books based on the color of the binding.\n</code></pre>\nWe used to go to book shops to find books but the next 20 years is going to get more frustrating when choosing. Twiddling your thumbs over the ""next"" button is the new walking down the isle looking for one particular book. You want the google equivalent of book finding. It might be by colour, author, a quote, a film reference, music or voice of a character that played it on the successor of Hollywood. Companies are still working on this hard problem. How to see the product readers want from millions of titles on one small device.<p>Location<p><pre><code>    If you open a store in a college town, and maybe even \n    if you don't, you will find yourself as the main human \n    contact for some strange and very socially awkward men \n    who were science and math majors way back when.  Be nice \n    and talk to them, and ignore that their fly is open.\n</code></pre>\nBooks have a social element. Instead of going to a bookshop you now go to your favourite cafe who have installed a new WIFI gadget. It's only found in particular cafe's catering for the intersection of coffee lovers and technical book readers. It has all the latest Open Source manuals, blog articles collected into books. We dropped the ePub or electronic reference to books years ago. This place is ""hacker friendly"" so you can chat to other hackers. Specialist WIFI gadgets are appearing all around the place in food outlets catering for particular audiences. The social aspect of books hasn't disappeared, just morphed.<p>Sharing<p><pre><code>    If you put free books outside, cookbooks will be gone \n    in the first hour\n</code></pre>\nSharing is now a problem. There are free books and restricted books. If you can't afford a book you can book it at the library to download it. It ceremoniously burns on your machine when the time to hand it back has passed. Another person can now borrow a digital copy. The concept of digital ownership becomes a political one. Book owners don't take up the ""Cloud"" concept after the great cloud hack in 2028. Millions of books are electronically burnt on owners devices as rouge elements of ""Anonymous"" take their ""Library of Alexandria"" action too far. All in the name of freer access to live news feeds. We still hook up to bookshops; glorified websites with sparse text and images of book titles and a google like search engines with predictive analysis software. Sharing of books is difficult. The hardware detects who is using the book. Sharing is not impossible but difficult and risky. Hacks for reader devices are there, if you want to risk being detected and black banned from device sellers. There is always the black market. One of the unintended consequences in ownership restrictions, is if you move from one area to another your book becomes locked and you can't read it unless you pay a regional fee.<p>Information<p><pre><code>    No one buys  self help books in a store where there's \n    a high likelihood of  personal interaction when paying.\n</code></pre>\nThe price of certain types of ""information of value"" skyrockets. Value is dependent on information usage in the market. There are market indexes for everything. Even childrens books like Dr.Suess. Censorship is rife but regional. You can't access certain types of information in books in certain areas. Old printed books that contain this information go up in price if they can be found. Information is bought and sold on ones ability to locate valuable information in private libraries. Enterprising companies that use software to mine old or cheap information and repackaging it as specialist books thrive. Software companies specialising in producing software to extract the essence of book classics like Shakespeare and write alternative scripts for media-vision networks. There's the Chinese version of ""Macbeth"" portraying the past regime and a portrayal of the Steinbeck classic, ""Grapes of Wrath"". Recast to the present show the migration of Californians moving east to escape the water crisis bought on by severe temperatures and drought. New publishing empires are formed.<p>Cost<p><pre><code>    You will have no trouble getting books, the problem is \n    selling them.\n\n    There's also no need to perpetuate the myth by pricing \n    your signed Patricia Cornwell higher than the non-signed \n    one. \n</code></pre>\nThe economics of book production change. The cost is now reflected in popularity, the sophistication of the language, translation, region and censorship restrictions. Books that have been simplified are now more expensive than complicated books. The cost of books fluctuates as the numbers of people who buy it increases or decreases. Books that are popular in certain areas of restricted information become expensive. Some people set up companies to monitor the costs and allow customers to purchase books at their lowest cost.<p>Display<p><pre><code>    People are getting rid of bookshelves.\n</code></pre>\nThe display is the new bookshelf. People spend lots of money to purchase the latest hardware. When at home, bookshelves are projected on the TV screen to show what you might want to read. The constraint of the reader is size. Large screens solve this problem scanning personal readers and the network feed then showing a physical representation of the book on the screen for users to see and pick.<p>Psychologists work out that humans are still optomised to scan for titles laid out in physical space. Humans can't interface directly with the reading devices yet. That invention happens 10 years in the future.",1327721621.0

The model stops being advertisement-riding-on-content, and instead is a message sent directly to you (or that you request).<p>Well, I guess it must be somewhat possible, because overture/goto did it... (they aren't around any more because Yahoo acquired them, and their technique was adopted by  Google - but no one else has done it, so maybe it's not workable any more. Perhaps because Google does it (i.e. it's a feature of Google search - just turn off adblock and ignore the search results - and Google has better access to users (eyeballs), so advertisers would prefer it.))<p>What I'm saying is that it doesn't really need eyeballs, but what eyeballs bring: access to you. There are other ways to gain that access (that aren't as good so far). It does need to know you intimately, so content probably helps (is crucial?).  And you need to trust it. (Which you would do, if it turned out really to be fantastically helpful.) It also needs fantastic AI to predict your needs before you do...<p>My understanding is that getting info about users was the business model behind (the failed) Color.

That's not saying that it's good or bad, but I believe a lot of it is just how your brain is configured.  It's as innate as the ability to shoot baskets, or throw a football, or as innate as gaining energy when interacting with people (extrovert) vs losing energy when interacting with people (introvert).<p>Case in point: there are some people who are extremely smart, but don't have the ability to visualize things like a map in their head.  I know someone who loves cars, has been into cars since he was a teenager, and loves driving.  However, for the life of him, he can't read a map.  He's not dumb at all, he's very intelligent and excellent with computers.  But he has no ability to visualize things in his head and spin them around.  So when he's given instructions on where to go, he needs landmarks, ie. ""Turn left at the McDonald's and turn right when you get to the 4th traffic light.""  He can't process ""Go north on Main Street, and then head East along Central Ave.""<p>I believe programming is the same way.  There's a type of inner mental gymnastics that you need to do in order to program well, because a lot of the things are very cerebral.  Some people just can't do it.  I'm not saying that they can't be taught how to program to an adequate level, but the fact that it so goes against the mesh of how their thought process works, it just won't be enjoyable to them.  They will never be better than adequate.<p>Of course, most of us here probably can't picture that, so many of you might think I'm wrong.  But put it in another perspective.  We can all be taught to throw a football perfectly.  But does that mean we'll be any good at it?  Probably not.  If we don't have the physical ability to throw a football more than 10-15 yards (like me), will it be fun for us?  Probably not.  But if you were a football player, hanging out with a bunch of other football players, you wouldn't understand why everyone can't throw a football more than 40 yards.<p>The same goes for Sales.  I've come to learn from my friends who are salesmen that the sales cycle is largely algorithmic.  So it can be taught.  But getting out in front of customers every day, chit-chatting, engaging them, etc, is something that many of us simply aren't built to do.  It takes a certain personality type to actually enjoy this.  And there are plenty of them that do enjoy this and make vast sums of money.  But if I were put in that position, I would hate every second, and would likely get fired.<p>So yes, programming can be taught, but I truly believe that there is an innate mental configuration that determines whether or not you can digest and learn the information and whether you'll be good at it, and more importantly whether or not you'll actually enjoy it.",1327719990.0
