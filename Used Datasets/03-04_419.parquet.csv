Once the iPhone gets a multi-core processor, much faster GPU, and 4G what else is really left for a yearly update? I doubt we'll see an octo-core iPhone 6 with 4 cameras, 2K display and 5G radios in 2013. The possible delay for the iPhone 5 seems more about re-aligning the product release schedule. It doesn't really matter when the iPhone is released. Most people only buy a new phone with they are eligible for a subsidized upgrade. The iPad, and iPod Touch, are the items that need a big back-to-school/x-mas production push. It must be difficult (or at least expensive) for Apple to release the iPhone mid-year and 2 months later gear up for the iPad/iPod rush. I think we'll probably see the iPad 2 get an extended shelf life too. The rumors of an iPad release in September were probably correct they just got the year wrong -- it'll be 2012. The last piece of this is they may move to more frequent, but minor, OS updates. This has already started to happen with 4.x where each release brought some significant features. Perhaps all the bundled apps will be updated through the App Store instead of OS updates as part of this.",1301543580.0

Tried a lot of stuff (diet, exercise, shrink etc.)  Nothing quite seemed to do the trick (though the exercise helps a ton with daily stress but will not fix depression).<p>Although I obviously can't recommend it to everyone, I dropped out and started working.  Now I had been freelancing and doing internships since I was about 15 so I had a solid shot at an entry level position at a startup.  I can't tell you how much happier it made me.<p>You may not be able to just drop out, but I bet if you find an internship or something that involves you in the ""real world"" in a way that's somewhat meaningful to you (ie: not getting coffee) you'll get a lot more satisfaction out of life.<p>Remember you're young, you're not exactly supposed to have it all figured out yet.  Even old people don't have life figured out yet, no one ever does.  You also sound pretty introverted, and self reflective.  This is a really great trait, but it can be crippling if you don't know how to manage it.
