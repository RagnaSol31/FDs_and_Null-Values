It is whether people will and do USE it. I have not seen that as the case for Guile or Scheme in general.</i>""<p>I don't know anybody anywhere who has even tried to use Guile. I don't even know if anybody I know have ever looked at it. I don't know how many people even know it exists.<p>I personally love Scheme as a language, but I honestly can't see myself ever investing enough time into Guile to be able to write program extensions in it. I don't see my friends (some of whom I believe would write extensions to popular open source software if they could do so in a language that is sufficiently similar to one they already know - I certainly would be a lot more likely to do so and I'm not even Lisp averse) doing so either.<p>""<i>First of all, what does it mean to have a GNU system based on a non-GNU technology? What would be left of GNU?</i>""<p>So pick a non-GNU language and create a GNU implementation.<p>Personally, I think the best choice would be Lua. Its mature, a lot of people already use it as an extension language and its very similar to a lot of popular languages, so resistance for people to learn it is low (it is reasonably similar to Javascript and to a lesser extent, Ruby and Python; also, as has been proven by the game industry, it is easy to learn for C, C++ and Java programmers.

Software which has high international demand but is region-locked to specific countries will be pirated because of the DRM at rates that sometimes dwarf ""freeloading"" pirates.<p>I agree that Gabe is pretty much just pandering, but in the end, DRM doesn't really help piracy rates. Maybe for an immediate period after release, which is desirable in some circumstances as a matter of convenience, but that's it.<p>The real question is whether the piracy rate is indicative of the loss of sales due to piracy, which is clearly contested in some situations. Would Mojang profit more if Minecraft piracy was -- hypothetically speaking -- impossible? Probably a little bit, but a lot of users will look for something else to pirate, not roll their eyes and say ""ugh well I guess I have to buy it now"".",1322279630.0

65,3278949,story,,,5,2,Posthuman,What are some creative ways to ask readers to share a newsletter with friends?,,"I run a newsletter dedicated to providing my readers short and relevant startup links around daily news, stories, jobs and events called The Posthuman Startup (http://t.co/QQiziS5F).<p>I've read that there are ways to engage early adapters in the growth process of a young community, however I always feel like I am being too ""selly"" when asking my readers to ""share us with your friends.""  I've seen positive reactions to sharing how large the community is while involving them in the growth process (i.e. telling them I will offer some sort of reward if we hit a certain number of readers), but I'm afraid that revealing the numbers might result in a negative reaction because of the relatively small size of the newsletter (I just started it this week).<p>What is a good approach? I'm open to all ideas while trying to stay away from the generic ""add a share button.""<p>Thanks for your help everyone!

Steam is almost infinitely preferable to a pirate torrent, lacking only a sane download manager. But otherwise I consistently get faster downloads with less annoyance and I get nice integration with multiplayer and my friends' gaming.",1322276996.0

But as your career progresses, don't underestimate how small the industry is -- especially Silicon Valley.<p>All I'm saying is that if your first instinct in every situation is to say ""How can I lie and get the best of this?"" you're not going to be as successful as you think.  People aren't dumb.<p>Also, with that attitude, you'll tend to attract others looking to take shortcuts and rip you off as well.  Those people will also be smarter than you.<p>Software is a great field because it's not a zero-sum game.  You don't have to rip someone else off to get ahead.  These days software people are tripping over jobs on the way to work, so I'm not sure where the desire to micro-optimize comes from.  Just apply to jobs that seem interesting, and accept only the offers where you would actually want to work.<p>Life is unpredictable so sometimes you might have to back out.  But I wouldn't make a habit of it.<p>The original article is good reminder to push back when you see shady behavior.

72,3278942,comment,3278606.0,3278925.0,12,0,pkamb,,,Steam used to be an additional thing you had to install/run in order to play the game you already bought on DVD from the local game store. Now it's a service you use to buy games (often at ridiculously low prices) and automatically download them. That's what changed popular opinion of Steam.,1322276587.0
