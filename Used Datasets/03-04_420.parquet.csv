Neither should anyone else.</i><p>I am not sure, But if I'm using Java or C++ or another equivalent say even Clojure. Then the glue language for the rest is going to be Perl/Bash not Python. The reason is Perl does the scripting far too well than Python.<p>Python is more fashionable today courtesy Django, Twisted and other frameworks.<p>And I think that's the problem here. Python is trying to be half serious in both the Java and Perl worlds. Java and Perl have nearly orthogonal goals. If you try to do half work in both the worlds. You end up pleasing neither.

These are highly regulated services in the US that have terrible performance compared to the rest of the developed world, even only examining major cities.<p>Tokyo is one of the world's highest density places, with an average city block completely composed of an endless sea of highrise buildings that are made of very thick reinforced concrete.  Radio waves cannot possibly travel very far in this place.  Yet two of the main three carriers provide rock solid service.  The third suffers from poor spectrum allocation (no spectrum in a range that penetrates thick material well).  Recent regulatory changes have forced NTT (one of the two that has rock solid network everywhere) to resell access to its network to MVNOs at rates that are disclosed to the public, making an opening for tiny alternative carriers that are trying new service and pricing models.<p>Probably very difficult to dig up even a few feet of ground to lay new fiber, too, yet 100megabit ADSL and 100megabit fiber are available just about everywhere, in head to head competition.  To improve competition the fiber pipe and network service provider are split (you pay NTT for the fiber, and one of about 10 different ISPs to push data down the pipe).  AU is even pushing GIGABIT to select customers.  Average 100megabit consumer pricing about $50 a month.  Not to mention there is stiff competition for all this from wireless broadband from more providers than I can count (WiMax 40+ megabit, EMobile, Softbank, ...)<p>Japan's mobile phone pricing remains shockingly high, but the level of quality and competition in broadband service shows that the US could do much much better.",1324352580.0

49,3372192,comment,3371738.0,3371738.0,3,0,bgalbraith,,,"When talking about EEG-based ""mind reading"", there are three primary methods currently under study (when looking at locked-in patients at least):<p>1) P300 - This refers to a predictable change in the EEG signal that happens around 300 milliseconds after something you were expecting happens. For example, if I am looking for a particular letter to flash amongst a grid of letters all randomly flashing, a P300 will be triggered when the letter I want flashes.<p>2) SSVEP - This stands for steady state visually evoked potential. This approach uses EEG signals recorded from over the visual cortex, which responds to constantly flickering stimuli. Given a few seconds, the power of the frequency of the attended stimulus increases in the EEG, which can then be detected and used to make a decision.<p>3) SMR - This stands for sensorimotor rhythms, and is an approach that looks for changes in EEG activity over the motor cortex. Successful approaches have been able to identify when you imagine clenching your left or right fists, or pushing down on your foot. Unlike the other two, this does not require external stimuli.<p>SMR is the most like what we consider mind reading, as the user is initiating the signal while the other two infer what a person is looking at. It is limited to only 2-3 degrees of freedom at the moment, however, and is the hardest signal to work with. It is susceptible to external factors such as the current environment and mental state, and not everyone seems to be able to generate the needed signals. SSVEP, while lacking the wow factor of SMR, is much easier to work with and is a much more stable signal.<p>Disclosure: I work in this area.

Startup ideas are a dime a dozen and, for instance, Facebook wasn't the first secret social network. Think they obsessed over whether or not to release numbers when they were small?<p>If you have the mindset that everyone is going to fuck you over, then yes, hold your cards close and never say anything.

The worst thing I could do is toil away in obscurity and not say anything to anyone. Instead, I want to tell as many of my friends as I know everything about it. I want to hear about what sounds right and what doesn't. And if an investor wants to know numbers (when I actually <i>get</i> numbers), then I'll tell him flat out. Whatever, let him try to clone it. I bet he couldn't hire a team as passionate and on track as mine to do a better job.

OTOH, they're way overkill for other situations.  About three years ago some colleagues and I wrote an asynchat-based server to coordinate certain administrative actions on a 1000-node system.

I'll gladly defer to you on what JS is ultimately capable of, it was never the point of my post.
