10,4415970,comment,4415135.0,4415493.0,5,0,verisimilidude,,,"Too right.<p>Oddly enough, the ebook publishing ecosystem has encouraged newer genre authors to go back to the serial-style storytelling of those old Golden Age magazines. Many of the most promising new sci-fi writers, like Hugh Howey or Matthew Mather, are publishing their stories piecemeal as short-form ebooks. Howey's ""Wool"" series, in particular, might be the best body of science fiction I've read in years.<p>When you follow these new authors, you definitely notice how much they grow as writers and thinkers as they release new works every month or two. Contrast this to the old model, in which an author would agonize over a single manuscript for years and years, hoping against hope to get a bite from a publisher. I think the new incentives for serial publishing are helping these new players rapidly perfect their craftjust like the classic sci-fi authors of the Golden Age. Thanks to ebooks, we may be getting a new crop of authors to match some of those old giants.",1345607693.0

My sole concern in that area would be geared towards wanting a free one. Personally, I wouldn't buy one I wouldn't be happy to pay the full price for, and of course my brain sees it as very unlikely that this would be the least popular. Also, it seems a poor gamble to go for one I like less on the hope that I might get another free. So if i picked the least popular, my reaction would just be 'bonus, free tee!' (i wouldn't have any feeling of 'special unique little flower', either).<p>As for the language specifically, firstly, 'least popular' is functional. It tells me exactly what you are talking about. If i read 'most unique' i would have no idea how you were measuring that, and would probably feel uneasy about it-- like you were using the phrase as cover to pick whatever you wanted to. (Which is funny, since 'least popular' is already the best financial option for yous!). Secondly, it doesn't seem too negative to me (compare 'least awesome' vs 'worst'). That is for the landing page (and if any commiseration email), anyway. As far as congratulatory email, I would probably agree to frame it as 'most unique'.<p>Hope that helps!..

Imagine a more general contest: build my company a tool that increases our market value by X%; we'll give the winners $Y and a job interview. The expected value of participating is $Y/n, where n is the number of participants.<p>It's like the opposite of a professional organization. I suppose the libertarians approve. It drives down the cost of labor and therefore might make the market more efficient. Yet I'm suspicious.<p>I'd like to propose a counter-organization. Analysts can band together and offer a contest. We collaborate to create a tool that gives your company an X% increase in value. Companies bid for the rights to that tool. I'd expect that the value to the laborer would be greater than $Y/n. I guess that just described a consulting company.<p>Perhaps the situation is not so unique. Art also provides much value in the act of production and many organizations hold art contests similar in design to Kaggle competitions. Open-source software often doesn't even have a competition sponsor.<p>It'd be ludicrous to imagine holding a contest to offer the best legal advice or diagnosis.

People leave companies for all sorts of reasons, many of them dumb. They do not need to have made a lifelong personal commitment to their manager to find those reasons.

It's similar to previous social news sites, but different in a couple key ways.[1] Reddit was originally called a ""del.icio.us clone"" but now we call things reddit clones. There's some ick-factor from the way that content is copied from reddit and elsewhere, but that really goes both ways.<p>2) It's pretty clear how 9gag makes money: paid placements. Unlike reddit it doesn't appear to have a strong anti-commercial taboo. If it can grow big enough, it will make money.  Remember: Facebook is already quite profitable (by the billions!) just not profitable enough to justify at $100 billion valuation yet. So this objection makes no sense to me.<p>3) Facebook was a HUGE success from the point of view of pretty much every investor except people who bought for the ""pop"" right after the IPO. Every VC investor in Facebook did great. Maybe they IPO'd above their true value, but it's still a $40 billion company. That's larger than 99.99% of all companies that get started.

A long time ago when Georgia Tech was flying GPS guided helicopters in the UAV contests I wondered just how much it would cost to build a drug mule like that. Should be pretty trivial, drop via GPS and you don't need human pilots. Of course if you get spotted a human can abort back over the border but a robot will lead the follower to the drop point.",1345604559.0

Every time you go to 9gag (AFAIK, can't say i've visited much) there is new content.<p>It preys on the 'seeker' human behaviour (like reddit, minecraft, even HN). Maybe next visit there will be something hilarious?<p>A lower volume of higher quality wouldn't invoke the same response.. visits would often have no new content, and users wouldn't regularly visit.",1345604550.0
