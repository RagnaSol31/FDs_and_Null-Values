Growing up, I was really good at math.  Good enough that I demolished the SAT at the age of 12 (getting a 770 I think), and got into college as a 13 year old.  I did well at it for two years and then set it aside to be a normal high school student and try to become more well rounded.<p>In the end, the one subject I really, <i>really</i> sucked at was foreign languages.  And yet, when I did finally go back to college, I had no motivation for working at or even attending math classes; I graduated as a Japanese major.  Then I moved to Taiwan to learn Chinese with <i>traditional</i> characters, not simplified.  I learned Chinese, and I can read.  But I'm certainly not one of those foreigners with incredible language skills they put on TV for everyone to oooh and ahhh at.  Similarly with sports, I had a natural aptitude for co-ordination based ones like bowling, fencing, etc... so I put myself through absurd training on top of the regular team training to become an okay distance runner.<p>Looking back on it now, in many ways I was an idiot.  I could have done so much more, <i>been</i> so much more if I'd focused more on my strengths... which is why I'm back in the US doing everything I can to get my foot in the door at a tech company where I can return to the kind of work that's more of a natural fit.<p>That said, I think there's a clear separation between things which should be improved if they're weak and things that aren't worth the time:<p>Improve the weaknesses that will hurt the rest of your life!<p>If you're in terrible cardio-vascular shape, that's worth improving.  It will affect your health, your energy and even your brain.  If you have terrible social skills, that's worth improving.  They affect your work life, your personal life, your happiness and even your health in the long run.  If you are terrible with money, that's worth improving.  Poverty also affects the social, physical spheres.<p>However, if you're just not that good at stringed instruments, sticking with the piano is probably good for you.  If you can't code, it's fine to become a lawyer instead and focus on your verbal skills.<p>Many skills really can be overlooked in favor of a substitute that's a better fit.  Others are universal and worth the time to bring up to at least a 3 or 4 out of 10.",1341115124.0

I think that means that the buildings are close enough to have super low latency connections to each other.

Site negotiations, design, procurement, networking, operations, and maintenance are expensive in dollars and time.<p>It's called planning ahead of time. If not, then here's a suggestion: Use EC2 until you set it up and migrate, if you cannot wait that is.<p>All in all I don't mind whether people use EC2 for whatever reason. Just stating my opinion. I agree of course that in terms of ""convenience"" is has the upper hand. Not having to wait for boxes to be added to data centers, being able to spin up boxes in multiple regions through a single company/console. Maybe your use case does justify using EC2. Many other people <i></i>clearly<i></i> do not (hence all the whining because of all the downtime, which they wouldn't have had if they deployed to multiple AZs/Regions).",1341115033.0

It is in the best interest of an OpenStack provider to differentiate their offering rather than compete on price through the common platform. Just like how there are power users who want to configure, build and have full control of their mobile device, there's a huge class of people that just want a working stack from one provider. I consider Rackspace to be relatively far along in implementing the OpenStack vision and they're still a far way behind in the offerings AWS has. Google is in a similar position with their new cloud initiative.<p>Like with HTML5 I'd like to see all of the main datacenters implement full stacks and then have OpenStack be a 'codify what works' project. We need 4 or 5 providers who have the depth and breadth of what AWS has.",1341115024.0

11,4183779,comment,4183413.0,4183413.0,2,0,daenz,,,"This article was very confusing.  They go on to praise the great developers, and how much companies need them, etc, but then they end with this:<p>>If after you interview a candidate you find that you arent completely sure about them, dont hire them. If you cant tell if they are good or not, dont hire them. If 2 out of 6 people on the interview loop are either no or maybe, dont hire them. The consequence of letting a bad developer in the door is far greater than maybe missing a good one.<p>This is exactly what people do, and it's the exact reason why finding great developers is hard.  And ironically, this tip is posted under the section ""Were Awful At Distinguishing Great Developers.""<p>Great developers are difficult to spot because they can look like bad developers.  Great developers are often honest about what they know and don't know.  If you ask if they know mysql, their answer might be that they're very familiar with it, but there's a lot about it they don't know.  Great developers can often lack the confidence that average developers exude to make up for their lack of skill.  If you ask how to do something, they might express that their way may not be the best.  Great developers can be nervous, because they can believe that they may not be as qualified as a company is seeking.<p>All these signals make people doing the hiring uncertain.  To put a filter of ""unless 1000% certain, do not hire"" just ensures you get someone of, at absolute best, your skill level, and at worst, a fantastic bullshitter.",1341114940.0

The reason even our poorest citizens are able to afford toilets that flush and cellular phones is because of off-shoring. And no, off-shoring isn't simply done to increase margins, although it does in the short term - it's done also to undercut competitors prices, which is exactly the kind of ""race to the bottom"" that makes lives so good for American consumers.

And if you're one too, upvote!""<p>For one thing, the problem is that it's not a simple dichotomy of great developers vs. average developers. I have nothing to back it up, but I'm guessing it's a fairly typical normal distribution of talent Then, where does ""greatness"" start? 20x sounds fantastic, but what's the difference between a great developer and a developer that just a bit less good? Will I get a 2x at least?<p>The other thing that bothers me is that it's a very selfish and elitist idea. I'm pretty sure that most of the great developers didn't start as such. To become ""great"", they worked and learned from others who were better than them. And they certainly did so by working in teams that accepted a ""not-great"" developer amongst them.

This is pretty nice to work with given its declarative nature, but we have to put up with long, long startup/initialization times for new instances.

From what I've seen on wikipedia and elsewhere, there's simply a strong bias against it being right, and many people react vocally and vehemently, suppressing research of group selection. For example, E. O. Wilson writes a book and all of a sudden he gets a barrage of angry correspondence and rebuttals.<p>I would say stuff like that discourages exploration in science, and pushes an echo-chamber agenda.<p>To me it's rather clear that groups dominate individuals. Let's look at the level of groups of complete organisms. The individual is dominated from early childhood and is taught learned behaviors which may actually impede its reproductive success. For example, non-alpha-males in many species simply don't reproduce. That may be ascribed to kin selection, but the mechanism is not kin-related: if a wolf is adopted, the same mechanism applies.<p>In humans this can be summed up by one word: CULTURE. All the morality, etc. is taught from a young age, and the kids are dominated by the culture, and as they grow up they don't think of doing it any other way. If the culture told you that you can't have more than one wife, then that's what most men will approximately end up with. The man isn't going to go out and get a harem because modern society has basically trained this man that a shitload of problems await him should he try to do it. In other societies, however, the  harem is fine.<p>So basically, the individual behavior is dominated by the group. Selection is a byproduct of that. In men, it typically selects for those traits which the most prolific (reproductively) men possessed. Genghis Khan is one of the ultimate examples.",1341112881.0

Unfortunately, in the AWS context those of us who confidently planned to react to trouble in zone US-EAST-X by launching a new cluster in US-EAST-Y have often been frustrated by failures in Amazon's control plane. When one zone goes down hard, instances in other zones generally stay running - though the anecdotal evidence is not perfectly clear - but the ability to <i>spin up</i> new instances or drives in other zones often breaks.<p>What I don't remember seeing is a case where a failure spanned regions. Which does not mean that can't happen; perhaps a catastrophic latent bug in Amazon's control software could kick it off. But it is far less likely. So planning to spin up in a distant region is a workable plan, and then your point is back to being correct. But spanning regions takes a bit more work and planning.<p>And, needless to say, everyone's RTO is different. When people talk casually about ""100% uptime"" I tend to think ""30 seconds"", in which case redundant running instances is the solution, but obviously you do have to specify it.
