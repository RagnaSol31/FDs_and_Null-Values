Some of them make it intentionally hard (practically impossible for the non-techie user) to uninstall the adware, or downloading additional adware without user consent (drive-by). Other shady practices include the use of malvertising (e.g. ad that mimic flash, acrobat or OS update) and the most extreme one, which is rare but exists, is exploit kits.<p>b. Monetization<p>Done mainly with advertising and information harvesting. Common practices (aka &quot;revenue models&quot;): ad injection (banners, pop-up\under, etc), affiliate fraud (&quot;price comparison widgets&quot;, or just forcefully redirect user through affiliate link) , lead generation (e.g. scraping insurance details), social networks spam (Selling views, likes, followers, etc - works because google\fb\etc eliminates fake bot account fairly efficiently, but adware just impersonate real authenticated sessions) and selling cheap traffic.",1425095516.0
