13,2621247,comment,2619760.0,2619760.0,1,0,benaltieri,,,"Working hard on something you are passionate about is  a lot like running in a race. The minute you ease back on the throttle, you better hope that your competition doesn't pounce.  You better have a big enough lead on your competition to allow yourself to relax.  That relaxation time needs to be earned.  Too much relaxation breeds complacency.  And if you are not in an environment in which you are competing with someone, you really aren't working toward a worth while goal, but just spinning your wheels. You are either living off the spoils of some prior success or inheritance.  Work like you are about to be attacked by a pack of rabid dogs or seek out such an environment. Don't get it? Go watch a horse race.  Every split second counts.  That winning rush of adrenaline is like no other.  Should everyone seek out such an environment?  No, not everybody all the time.  But to never have done so is cowardly.  Nobody is successful by working 100% smarter than everyone else 100% of the time.  Those that say they do are liars.  To do so is like saying they never had a failure, and everything came easy for them.  Achieving success is a complete bitch.  Those that have the energy and stamina to succeed in the end are the ones who earn the right to slack off.  Execution is everything.",1307245876.0

Except when you type a single space character the app enters into an infinite loop making it very difficult to do anything else in the browser (Chrome).  Even navigating the window to a different page is impossible.<p>[Edit] Scratch that.  Typing anything followed by a space character tends to make things crash.  Why would this happen?  I find this bug interesting.  Let me know what the problem was when you fix it.<p>[Edit2] Okay looks like the problem may be with anything that needs to be url encoded.<p>[Edit3] I think the problem comes down to your call to encodeURIComponent in your search function and the behavior when the hash changes.  Basically, we enter the search function when the hash changes.  But then you call encodeURIComponent and assign the result to the hash.  If the query contains characters that need to be escaped then the new value is different (meaning the hash changes), which means that your search function is going to get called ad infinitum.<p>In order to fix this I think you need to do two things.  1) Keep track of the in flight request unencoded and 2) if your search function is triggered by a hash change decode the query and compare it to your in flight request.  If they are the same then you can bail out of the search function early.  Otherwise you should cancel the in flight request and launch a new one.",1307245716.0

24,2621236,comment,2620280.0,2621118.0,1,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Okay, your plan sounds decent, and good luck to you.<p>But now that I've learned that you are studying CS (it's a good guess, around here, but one hates to assume) I'll go out on a limb and offer some further advice: Stop. Change majors. Find something that's actually interesting or challenging for you.<p>Yes, you're obviously way into programming. That's great, every subject is now all about programming. Any other major will absolutely love you. You may start having to lie, telling them that you don't really know what Python is, just so that you don't end up programming all day and all night.<p>You might even be into CS, in theory, if you found the right program and the right teacher. But you need to remember two crucial facts:<p>A) Programming bears the same relationship to CS as the management of a professional NASCAR pit crew does to solving the Navier-Stokes equations. It usually doesn't hurt a programmer to have a solid grounding in CS, just as it wouldn't hurt a NASCAR mechanic to have a solid grounding in fluid mechanics, but it's unnecessary, and just because you love engines doesn't mean you'll love Carnot engines.<p>You can program quite successfully with almost no formal CS training at all, or so my customers and employers have assured me. Moreover, even the best CS program will teach you very little of what you actually need to know day-to-day when you're building software for customers. You will learn all that on your own, or perhaps you will learn it in classes that have nothing to do with CS. (Or, if your little summer project is any guide, you know a bunch of it already and will soon learn the rest through experience.)<p>B) Even if CS really is right for you and vice versa, that doesn't mean your <i>school's</i> ""CS"" is. Too many CS classes and programs are apparently designed to provide occupational certifications to future mid-level corporate Java programmers. If majoring in CS seems significantly easier than majoring in math, something is wrong. Go study something else. Math, for example.<p>I have a Ph.D. (Physics/EE) and I even did a postdoc once so I'm obviously stupidly in love with school at some level. So maybe it's just me. But I can't see any excuse for being bored in college. Colleges are full of interesting things, many of which are so marginally profitable that you'll never find time and money to do them anywhere else, even though they are <i>awesome</i>. Find them. Major in music and jam with some great musicians. (Two of the best software engineers I know started out as classical musicians.) Major in anthropological linguistics and learn to do fieldwork with disappearing language families. Study geology and do all your summer internships in a tent.<p>Major in ancient languages. (Another of my colleagues dropped out of physics, studied old Norse, bootstrapped his own way into the MMORPG industry after graduation and is now a programmer.) Study chemistry or (ahem) physics. Take some statistics. Neglect not your molecular biology. My usual advice: Study a laboratory science. You can spend the rest of your life sitting around typing for the price of a laptop, a chair, and a coffeemaker, and you don't even need a computer to enjoy a CS book, but after you leave school you will never again see anything like a university science lab unless you have tens of thousands of dollars, a big basement and one hell of a lot of spare time.",1307245649.0

None would have for me at (what I'm guessing is) your age. I dropped out of high school weeks before what would have been my graduation, and it took a long time to untangle just what had gone wrong with <i>it</i> and what had gone wrong with <i>me</i>, and which of those things I actually had any influence on.<p>On the one hand, you'll want to hear that you're right, and that school is pointless. Well, that's kind of true. Public education is a grand human enterprise, and like all grand human enterprises it is a mixture of hubris and groupthink seasoned liberally with ineptitude and half-baked in a fiery furnace of failure. (Served on politics and garnished with voodoo.)<p>There are certainly motives involved, and results obtained, but you'll never find a precise mapping of one to the other that doesn't break down at some scale. It continues to go on not because it has a singular <i>point</i> to it but because it is a means for many different people to achieve many different ends. It's an ecosystem, and as such it spans every biome from desolate failure to flourishing success. Taking your own experience as highly representative is apt to lead you astray.<p>That is not to say that your experience somehow doesn't count, only that in order to look at the bigger picture you have to see yourself as a smaller part of it.<p>(A particularly pernicious variation of this comes with the way you judge the success of your peers. How you feel about their lives might be important to you, but that's a very different thing from how they feel about their lives.)<p>On the other hand, you'll want to hear that you're wrong, and that you didn't waste several years of your life in school. Well, that's kind of true, too. You may have spent those years in school, but whether it was a <i>waste</i> is entirely the perception you choose to ascribe retroactively to that time. You can turn that off. The fact is that nothing changes either way. Wasted or not, it's gone.<p>You probably spent more time finger-painting as a child than you can reasonably justify today. Do you consider that time a waste, or just history? Why not cultivate a similar attitude towards your schooling?<p>I think this gets easier with age, or more accurately, with distance (in time). You start getting insight into how unreliable your perception of what is or isn't important is at the time. This is a heuristic for judging the value of time that I think can only be trained by experiencing the opportunity cost (i.e. by ""wasting time"" and recognizing it.) The thing you gain from this is never compensation for lost time, but the ability to waste less time making better mistakes on more interesting problems.<p>There is a lot to be said about other questions you raise (e.g. Q:Why do many people in shit jobs miss high school? A:Because it was structure without responsibility.) but I'm going on at length about this for the (admittedly presumptuous) reason that I think it's very easy to confuse thinking about the hard problem of public education with wishful thinking about the impossible problem of what you might have done with a few extra years of free time. That's the same kind of thinking that leads people to waste time trying to ""hack their sleep"" so that they'll have ""more time"". But you don't get more time. Ever.",1307244731.0

Like, crazy amounts. \nAnd why wouldn't there be? It's a great field to be in right now.<p>But thanks to things like the Mythical Man-Month[0], engineering is a field where people would rather have 1 incredible engineer than 10 mediocre engineers for the same price. So for someone with talent and the right reputation, there's arguably no better field to be in than engineering.<p>So basically, if you're good at what you do, engineering is one of the hottest job markets in the country. (In NY, the hotness is particularly exaggerated, because the startups there are the companies most likely to want to keep their teams small, and hire the best - and they have to compete with the financial sector, which provides large numbers of engineers a steady job with high pay.)<p>If you're not good at what you do (or even if you just want to get better at what you do), don't assume the hotness of the market will get you a job. The market is hot for engineers, but I'd say it's only hot for <i>good</i> engineers, again, due to the Mythical Man-Month effect.<p>But don't be discouraged. Just by being proactive getting internships and participating on Hacker News, you're probably better than 80% of the applicants your age out there.

Skipping Craigslist, for many companies, acts as a low-pass filter - the bet being that you'll ignore more noise than you will signal. After all, the good employer probably only needs one good employee, not 100 mediocre ones (<i>especially</i> in engineering.)<p>For employees, a similar phenomenon occurs. Once you've been burned once or twice in your career, you start to notice that managers at worse jobs tend to rely heavily on Craigslist, Monster and the like. These companies know that technology is HOTHOTHOT, but they not be savvy (or even care about technology) enough to go to meetups and post jobs in ways that engage the tech community.  So again, many of the best employees will only use craigslist as a last resort, because they don't want to deal with the poor postings. Ignoring it is a low-pass filter for employees as well - after all, they only need one job.<p>There are plenty of more tech-specific sites with ""elite"" job boards, where the sheer knowledge of knowing <i>about</i> the job posting site - and understanding the technologies and discussions around them - is enough of a filter to encourage both good employees and good employers to show up. (Hint: check out HN user whoshiring.) But at the end of the day, the best jobs are almost always filled the old fashioned way - by word of mouth. And that's why it makes sense to get out there and meet people early and often.<p>(In a happy coincidence, it also turns out you'll learn a lot more in general by meeting and talking to people and frequenting tech sites instead of sitting in front of Craigslist.)<p>Obviously this stuff is wild generalization - and as with any low-pass filter, you take a risk by ignoring Craigslist.

I completely understand how it is to hop from hobby to hobby, trying to find the next new novelty.<p>In high school I spent a lot of time learning tools but never really made anything with them.  I must have started 50 games, but would always throw them away at 300 lines of code because they were not interesting anymore.  One time I got the idea to make a Flash cartoon website like HomestarRunner.com.  I learned the Flash IDE, and the time that I started to get good at it was when I started losing interest.<p>In college I discovered that there are better tools out there than the ones I had been using.  I traded Windows and Gamemaker for Linux and Python.  I still never finished anything, because I kept finding new and better languages.  For a while there I tried out almost every popular language there is, including Haskell and Erlang.<p>Once my friends and I decided to make a game, and as the ""lead programmer"" on the team, I wanted to use the best language there is for making games.  I started on Python, then switched to Perl (yes, Perl for games!), then C (because the others were ""too slow"") and finally back to Python because C was too hard.<p>Some things that I have noticed include:<p>-Perfectionism is a nasty beast.  Are you a perfectionist too?  I will go back and forth between things because I want to find The Optimal Way (TM), but after a certain point you can't really find a better way that helps more than the cost of changing.  My dad, a mathmatician, once told me, ""Life is not an optimization problem.""  I am coming to see that he is right.<p>-You mention that you do well in college even if you can't stay focused on your own projects.  I have found that true for myself as well.  I think the structure helps to keep us on track.  Personal projects and side hobbies have no inherent structure, and all it takes to give up is to just stop working on them.  I have found success when my hobbies and side projects intersect with each other.  I finished a Flash animation when it was for a class project.  I actually did learn a Haskell for Great Good when I made my senior research project ""An Investigation of Lesser-Known Programming Languages.""  Then learning Haskell was not just a thing that might be cool but rather a school project that I had to finish.  I recently finished a three year long programming project with a professor advising me.  I wanted to quit several times, even though it was a great project, but my advisor half convinced/half forced me to stick with it, and I am glad that he did now that it is done.  If something like school motivates you, then use that to your advantage!<p>-The biggest thing that gives me motivation to do anything is the people who will benefit from it.  After thinking long and hard about the meaning of life, I have come to decide that love is what is most important.  As such, I can turn away from the most interesting project in the world if I am just working on it for myself, but if I know that people are really going to benefit from it, that provides motivation.  I think of all of the times that I have failed to complete a side project like a game or Flash website, I failed because they weren't really helping anyone, and as such they weren't really worth doing to me.<p>So, I suggest that once you leave college, find a lean startup that fulfills a need you care about.  Maybe you wouldn't do well founding a startup, but you could work as an employee at one.  Then you have structure similar to what you have in school, only this time with an employer, but you don't waste away at $BIG-CO.  (I too have this dread of $BIG-CO!)<p>Do note that knowing a lot about a little does give you some unique advantages.  If you ever do need to really learn something for a job or school project, it will be much easier than if you knew nothing about a subject.  You are also more aware of what tools are available for various projects, and you can select the right tool for the right job.<p>As a final thought, I notice that you have been registered for 250 days or so and have 5 karma.  That is almost the same as me.  I usually don't say anything because I don't feel like I have anything to add, but I've been trying to comment more recently.  Lurking allows me to just be a passive observer, but I take in less when I'm actually invested enough to comment.<p>If you'd like to talk, send me an email.
