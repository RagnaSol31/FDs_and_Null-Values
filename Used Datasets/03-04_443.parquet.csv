I sat down for dinner on the patio at La Strada, a nice Italian restaurant on University Avenue a few doors down from the Palo Alto Apple store, and there were Steve and his daughter at the next table. After dinner they took a stroll down University Avenue, just the two of them. I imagine they were probably going to get some frozen yogurt. I thought to myself, ""Doesn't he have some security? A bodyguard? <i>Something</i>?""<p>There are a lot of Silicon Valley executives who I'd recognize if I saw them.

21,3176295,comment,3175575.0,3175836.0,20,0,andolanra,,,"I am in the unique position of actually having taught/tutored/TA'ed several intro courses in several different languages, which included Python, Java, and Scheme. I would actually say that I had an easier time teaching elementary concepts to people in Scheme, but that the transition from elementary concepts to general-purpose or practical programming was easier for people who started with Python. Overall, I'd argue that Scheme is a better language for introducing <i>computer science</i>, but that Python is a better language for introducing <i>programming and development</i>.<p>I think one of the biggest problems with advocating Python as a teaching language is that programmers don't understand what the hard parts of Python <i>are</i>. Python is great because it's sort of a lingua franca for people who are well-versed in conventional, Algol-based imperative programmingit boils it down to its essence and omits anything unnecessaryso to a person who was versed in Java/C/C++/Perl/PHP/&c previously, moving to Python feels like everything unnecessary has dropped away. Consequently, it feels <i>easy</i>, and you look at it and think, ""Oh, wow, this would be <i>no big deal</i> to teach someone, even a non-programmer.""<p>In reality, though, you'd be surprised at the concepts people struggle with. Assignment poses a huge problem to beginners, and I have spent hours and hours of my life trying to explain the concept to baffled undergrads. Not that Scheme concepts are necessarily easier (e.g. recursionalthough loops are not necessarily easier to a beginner) but that Scheme makes a point to have far fewer of those concepts to begin with. Keep in mind that in an introductory class, every new feature, no matter how small, can mean another week of instruction, which is why an intro class in C++ could mean almost no projects at all, but an intro class in Scheme could very easily give way to writing object systems, programming languages, and adventure games, as my first computer science classusing Schemedid.",1320033216.0

You might like your friends, then probably, your friends <i>are</i> bettering themselves, and so are you.

What exactly is there to do?<<<<<p>Well, we could start by not living in armed camps right on the edge of killing each other.  Then a few disruptions won't have us escalating to death.<p>In Hobbes' state of nature life is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. We can stay away from that by living peacefully and cooperatively and respecting the rights of others. Social pressure, a reasonable set of laws with clear and reliable enforcement, and a code of polite consideration often suffices.<p>What is going on with the cartels is that organized crime has broken the delicate balance and the state of nature is returning. Organized crime isn't the only thing that can break the balance; famine or war are just as effective.<p>In this case, western society is suffering from a self-imposed wound. Those cartels are thriving on revenue from supplying people who want mostly benign consciousness-modifying substances. Usually that's a modestly profitable business (tobacco and beer companies make nice money) but not profitable enough to run a worldwide crime network.<p>Prohibition is a violation of the balance of peaceful society. A few people in society are demanding to control the mind and mental state of the rest by controlling chemicals. When they control the legal apparatus, the users of those chemicals need to buy them from a guerilla army that can evade the police. Prices rise enough to support a guerilla army of organized crime.<p>What exactly is there to do? Simple. Stop trying to control what substances people use to manage their consciousness.<p>Then we can end the violence, kidnapping, extorsion, and other side effects of guerilla conflict easily and move far away from the state of nature.",1320031385.0

One of the things I've always liked about SuSE/openSUSE is that it's actually very friendly to people who want to configure at different levels of hands-on versus GUI: the three layers of config files, /etc/sysconfig shell-style configs, and GUI interfaces in Yast are aimed at not stomping on your manual changes (unlike Ubuntu, say) and allowing you to mix & match.<p>The way it works is that config files are checksummed and if the file has changed from stock (or the last version the system touched) it'll disable GUI alterations (which mostly just changes sysconfig and runs the SuSEconfig program to apply changes).  The exception to this is when it's a very simple file format (/etc/hosts, say) that has been marked as safe to parse & alter, then it reads in your changed version and presents that as the base.  If I want to hack on my postfix configs I can a) use the Yast mail module which'll tweak /etc/sysconfig/{mail,postfix} and automatically run SuSEconfig (and thus /sbin/conf.d/SuSEconfig.postfix).  There's no difference here between using the mail or sysconfig GUIs and using emacs on sysconfig files, then running it from the command line.  If I then choose to go in and edit /etc/postfix by hand Yast will avoid stomping on my changes with its now-outdated version, but there are backups if I really mess things up and want to revert.  For the same reason network config gives you the option to swap from NetworkManager to the old, familiar and entirely happy (for me!) config files in /etc.  There are a small number of exceptions, but openSUSE is in my experience about the least aggressive of the Ubuntu/Fedora/openSUSE trio in config lossage while having the widest coverage of default config tools.<p>All this aside and despite having Ubuntu, Debian and openSUSE chroots on my HP TouchPad...

I don't think it was a 'choice' at the time, as in 'I don't want my details online' but rather 'I can't be bothered, there's nothing in it for me'.  But now, having got this far, they now don't get caught up in the endless indexing and data sharing that happens without consent.",1320030196.0

I was half expecting some of the characters to reappear when Cryptonomicon came out (didn't happen but Cryptonomicon has some linkage to the Baroque chronicles),1320030141.0

Maintaining the same level of quality would be unprecedented, even if you had the exact same people they would change over time.<p>Also the minimalist computer science inspired upvote/downvote sorting system is a bit of a mismatch to human communication. Someone has to try a more complicated paradigm. I think tags on posts and comments would work better. Have a menu/autocomplete thing for common tags like [agree, troll, disagree, interesting, this, politics, hostile] and weigh submissions and comments through them. Should also be able to combine multiple tags and have a rating option for each tag. Label severity of disagreement, politics or suspected trolling.<p>This way when you need to tune the knobs you have more data to work with than just upvote/downvote, total karma and average karma. I don't expect pg to do these kinds of experiments though, he has minimalist tastes and limited time.<p>Also many times when communities fall apart, we have limited data to work with to see where things started to go wrong. Was it too many n00bs that chased experts away? Was it hostility? Did too many new people start voting on new submissions? I've seen some attempts at analysis of HN but don't remember them making clear conclusions.",1320030065.0
