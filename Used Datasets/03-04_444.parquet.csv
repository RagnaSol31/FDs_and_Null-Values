If a tenant has the capacity to pay (e.g.) $2000 for an apartment, but now can get an additional (e.g.) $300 a month, the tenant’s capacity to pay is now $2300.<p>A savvy landlord or condo association would want to capture this. Because it’s new, it’s seen as a disturbance. A little bit of thinking would reveal that there is now $XXX new money coming in the door (due to better utilization of the property).<p>It’s in the owners’ ultimate interest to figure out how to either a) accommodate this explicitly and safely, and capture some of the new revenue or b) prohibit it because the tenants prefer it, but know that the price of a “non-shared” building will carry a premium.<p>One way a condo association might adopt the idea is to point out that Airbnb’ers $$ might be used for building upgrades or to reduce condo fees.",1403319876.0
