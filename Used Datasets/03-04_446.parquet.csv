Neither Roth, nor Oliver, has even a smidgen of compassion for the other party's point of view.<p>Philip Roth clearly doesn't ""get"" the fact that anyone can sign up and try to edit Wikipedia claiming to be God if they want, and those edits must be rejected because well they really could be anybody.<p>Oliver clearly doesn't ""get"" the fact that some people are so used to being who they are, and so untainted by the deeper deceptions and pranks of the Internet, that they clearly think that simply corresponding should be sufficient. Certainly it was when written letters were taken why not now?<p>And when two proud people with orthogonal world views disagree, well it just gets ugly and stays ugly sadly.<p>Wikipedia could do with a way for 'primary sources' to provide them with information that they can both verify and use, so perhaps Philip could write them a letter in his own hand and sign it and they could digitize that and store it as the referenced source.

17,4678905,comment,4678352.0,4678780.0,10,0,FreakLegion,,,"<i>> What part of it did you not find compelling?</i><p>The parts where it was 1. unnecessarily vitriolic, 2. self-important, and where it 3. prioritized strict, literal interpretation over common sense. I'll take these in order, although the most important point is probably the last one.<p>1. Philip Roth is going on 80 years old. It's not reasonable to expect him, or anyone else really, to fully grasp the ins and outs of Wikipedia. And let's face it, there's plenty about Wikipedia to criticize, as HNers often do. You don't get to institute byzantine editorial policies and then condemn people who work around them. There's more than a hint of the Kafkaesque to Wikipedia's ""official channels.""<p>2. Wikipedia is cool, and the veracity problem is a hard one, but there's no excuse for punting on it. He's ""not convinced that theres a solution to this problem""[1]? I don't care. Try anyway. People get way too defensive about this stuff when they should be channeling their inner Josiah Bartlet: ""we can do better, and we must do better, and we will do better, and we will start this moment today.""<p>3. Finally -- and a better example of <i>le mot juste</i> I've not seen in a while -- a central plot element of <i>The Human Stain</i> is the power of <i>allegation</i>, even when false. The line Roth objected to was about the <i>alleged</i> inspiration for his character. Note, as Andreas Kolbe does in the first comment to Oliver's blog, that this comment was filed under Roth's bio page, where it really had no place, and not, as Oliver's blog examines, the page of <i>The Human Stain</i> itself, where a broader overview of critical reaction to the book makes sense. So if we're picking nits, Roth was actually right, and Oliver was shifting the goalposts, a common informal fallacy.<p>[1] That's from his follow-up post: <a href=""http://quominus.org/archives/981"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quominus.org/archives/981</a>",1350791283.0

20,4678902,comment,4678352.0,4678530.0,7,0,droithomme,,,"Interesting. His argument is that the article was only claiming that some other people thought Broyard's life was similar and he gives a link to a specific edit on Wikipedia, claiming the state of the article when Roth encountered it was only to say that some people thought the stories were similar, not that Roth was actually inspired:<p>> False. There was absolutely no misstatement in the article. What the article claimed at the time he wrote this open letter was that <i>Kakutani and other critics were struck by the parallels to the life of Anatole Broyard, a writer and the New York Times literary critic in the 1950s and 1960s who was of Louisiana Creole mixed-race descent and passed for white.</i><p>He uses this edit to claim Roth is either mentally incompetent (""aggrieved and confused ramblings"") or lying (""a malicious act"").<p>However, this claim by quominus/Oliver is a misdirection. Looking through the edit history, that cited edit clearly happened <i>after</i> Roth's biographer attempted to correct the article, a fact which Oliver certainly was aware. The article when Roth saw it read:<p>> Salon.com critic Charles Taylor argues that Roth had to have been at least partly inspired by the case of Anatole Broyard, a literary critic who, like the protagonist of ''The Human Stain'', was a man identified as Creole who spent his entire professional life more-or-less as white. Roth states there is no connection, as he did not know Broyard had any black ancestry until an article published months after he had started writing his novel.<p>This citation is very different. Here, saying ""Roth had to have been at least partly inspired"" clearly puts for the supposition that Roth did partly base the novel on Broyard, whereas the later edit only says that some people saw parallels.",1350791190.0

It's really a miniature world in itself.<p>What's even more interesting is adding arbitrary game mechanics on top of it. I've built a couple PHP webgames when I was in college, and while none of them became quite big, fascinating patterns emerged. \nIn most of them, I would, by design, let as many elements as possible be up to the players; and you end up with micro-societies that tend to show the same basic behavioral patterns as our own, just on a smaller scale.<p>For example in one of them instead of just collecting resources and spending them to build weapons like most games of the genre do, the game would force you to join a coalition where a player-elected leader would decide how to spend resources collected by the players. Players could plot to overthrow the leader, or re-elect him if they felt he was fair, but also smuggle resources to enemy coalitions, etc. In some coalitions, the leader tried to be fair and just, but that would ultimately lead to his demise; in some others, leaders would be dictators that the other players actually appreciated and supported; and in some others, the leaders would plot like crazy with some players while pretending to be honest publicly.<p>Yeah, these experiments are fun and humans are fascinating :)",1350790766.0

They represent chastity and modesty, and showing off your bodily features definitely doesn't fall into those categories. The concept of sending a message to people by fashion is very simple actually, and I personally think that reacting to such a message does not represent ignorance. Take the scarf off and let your face and hair be visible - people will look at you. Cover yourself in wraps - people will turn their looks away, and that is exactly the intended effect. It might seem strange to a white girl in a western society, but that doesn't change the fact.<p>As far as terrorism reference goes, that's a perfect example of generalization, another thing the whole humanity exercises daily simply because that is the way our reasoning works. Unfortunate it might be, but people generalize everywhere and about everything, and especially so when they are frightened.",1350788503.0
