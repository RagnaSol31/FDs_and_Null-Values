The hate that 8 got was somewhat warranted. There are very strange design decisions in 8.

Then, in the name of improving performance, they do all kinds of things that bring down their productivity and increase the complexity of their code (choosing C++ as the programming language is one of those things), but they never verify if any of those things really made enough of a difference, if any, to create value.<p>Another thing I noticed is that of those people who do have serious performance requirements (OS kernel etc.), many choose C over C++.

I think  &quot;compile to Lua&quot; would be a superior alternative in many cases.<p>One should point out that this way you get an incremental garbage collector for free, one whose behavior can easily be controlled at runtime i.e. good for soft real-time applications (e.g. games).<p>Also both Lua and LuaJIT are very lightweight which means you can simply bundle the complete language implementation when creating standalone binaries.

It means a single risk that has a 1 in 500 thousand chance of killing you. Similarly, it would be absurd to define 1 mort as the combination of 1 million separate risks, each of which has a 1 in 1 million chance of killing you. Whether 1 mort is guaranteed death or 1 - 1/e chance of death (my previous mention of it being 1/e was mistaken) is a property of how we define the unit to work, not a property of how correlated 1 million separate risks happen to be. Definitions that give answers other than 1 - 1/e or 1 don&",
