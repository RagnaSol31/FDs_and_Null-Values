I'm hoping that's for 15+ hours per week of classroom time (a.k.a 5 3-credit courses), counting only time with a faculty member, not TAs.  Plus some bonus lab/TA time, maybe, depending.  Based on a little website, let's look at a few Real Schools (a few in your city, a few in mine).  UOttawa says they charge $2,710.65 for Fall 2011 (again, presumably for 15 hours of classroom time a week, plus labs).  Carleton astonished me at $6k+, that's freaky high (PS you US people, I'm not talking about the U.S.).  At my end of the country, SFU charges $163.80 per credit (i.e. multiply by 15 for a full load, getting $2500).  UBC is marginally cheaper.  None of those places is MIT or Waterloo, but at least UBC and SFU are _fine_ schools.<p>Last year, you were working as a junior dev with no edumacation, presumably no serious prior experience, but you know enough to ask ""what distribution"", so probably you're useful.  Making what, gotta be more than $10k a semester pre-tax ($30k a year)?  Gotta be at least that much, although I dunno what Ottawa rates are like.  Can you do that job while going to school?  Do you want to?  Your real cost of going to school is that you lost access to that $10k-$15k for the semester.  The difference between $1k tuition and $3k tuition just became kinda dinky, eh?<p>The point is, the difference in tuition between Algonquin and UOttawa should be ignorable.  You've already forfeited $10k+ in salary, and $1k in tuition, PER SEMESTER, so $1k extra is kinda icing on the cake.  Optimize correctly!  Don't waste your life at the wrong school over such a small difference!  (I admit Carleton's apparently $6k makes me hesitate a little).<p>Now, teaching quality.<p>Teaching quality MIGHT be great at a college, I can't say.  I went to Capilano College (now University) for 2 years, and I got some really really great instructors.  But if that's not what you're getting, why are you wasting money, and more importantly time?  Bad GPA you need to fix?<p>And listen, if the program has great teaching (not that you'd know at two weeks in), then it'll be a viable foundation to build on at a bigger/better school.  But if you're getting half-assed teaching, then you're wasting time, not getting something under your belt.  (If they teach badly but you already know it, you're wasting time.  If you don't know it now and they don't teach it, wasting time!)<p>And now to your original point about peers.  Yeah, a community college is gonna attract a lot of marginal students.  I met a few awesome and very smart people at Capilano College (smarter than me), but I gotta admit, they were a lot fewer and farther between than what I got to meet at SFU.  Partly that's just the size of the pool of potential peers, partly it's that larger schools have better structures in place to help you FIND those peers (more societies, etc).<p>Half the point of going to school is to meet awesome peers who mutually inspire you, who you can have great experiences with, etc.<p>I guess what I'm saying is, if the kids are driving you batshit, you should see how fast you can get your ass into a better group of kids.  Of course, the problem could just be you.  ;)",1316144757.0

We all know about the little gems that are a big part of the world's future but with so little to enhance their present lives. By mere chance we came across a Govt. High School in Sreekariyam Trivandrum, where 80% of the students come from very poor background. With the little we have, we proposed to sponsor a great sadya (kerala lunch with lots of dishes), sweets for these kids. To be honest we wernt selfless to offer that, it was selfish enough reason. Spending an afternoon with them, many of whom had no idea why the celebrations, was a walk back to our past. The innocent side of ours which is slowly fading away, Everyone who was there was reminded of that beautiful time in lives where the soul is so pure and you can wish no evil - childhood.<p>The food, sweets did cost us a little, but spending time with those kids and seeing them smile and have a great time was priceless. =D",1316144716.0

Its VPN-like qualities also make it good for circumventing blocklists that work via banned destination site lists.<p>It does this by routing all(1) of your traffic through a series of constantly shifting peers that don't keep records or logs and don't use standard http ports.<p>Instead of YOU->ISP->Yahoo your traffic looks like YOU(encryption)->BOB->ALICE->STEVE(decryption)->Yahoo. Your ISP (and therefore your rotten government) only sees you make an encrypted connection to Bob, not a web request to yahoo. The chain is long enough that its really tough for anyone in the chain to figure out who you are and what your final destination is.<p>(1) Tor can be tricky to set up and know its working properly for the uninitiated. It can... <i>leak</i> if set up wrong, and certain protocols (like all UDP) are not well supported.",1316142104.0

For example, if a client's budget is low I might grab a RAD tool to get the job done (while letting the client know that this decision might hinder flexibility in the future.).<p>""You want a database on the web, that you can customize yourself, for $600? Great, let's grab a copy of FileMaker Pro, or sign up for Quickbase.com and get going"" Yes, those solutions may limit potential of the app down the line, but they might actually be the right fit.<p>I'm another hourly-rate-all-the-way guy, but if I can extract the budget out of the client, then I can decide (essentially), ""Given the client's other requirements, will a RAD/off-the-shelf/OSS-package-with-a-custom-theme work for this project... or do I just politely tell the potential client to get bent?""",1316142033.0
