4,224718,story,,,27,30,PStamatiou,Ask HN: Critique my startup,,"I am the co-founder of Skribit.com along with another developer and we also have substantial help from an active news.yc member and a business advisor. It started out from Atlanta Startup Weekend back in November from my frustration about finding original content to blog about. Skribit aims to help bloggers cure writer's block by allowing their readers (through a variety of ways) to suggest things for them write about. The most common way is a widget. We are doing ~4M pageviews/month including ~1300 widgets. Analyze that how you like, we realize counting widget loads as pviews is odd.. need to find another way to show our growth. We have been trying to lay low until we have a core set of features out, so users don't try us for a week, leave and never come back.<p>Fairly simple in concept, but we plan to do some advanced data analysis/etc and find related blogs/users and automatically suggest suggestions for bloggers - particularly useful if your blog doesn't have many readers. I've also pitched it as a ""tomorrow's news"" idea. Down the line we will be more of a portal highlighting today's hot suggestions in various groups/categories which could be tomorrow's news, or what have you.<p>So I'm here to ask what you guys think - of the idea, our implementation, feature requests, and so on. We are all developers so we are quite aware we'll need design help in the next few months. In the last few weeks we have been meeting with local investors to get advice on what we should do to take the next step and in result we have been hashing out a product roadmap and are beginning to think about market analysis. Financial model is three-fold with freemium being the core. I don't think I can talk about the other two yet, but we have a prov patent on one.<p>For those wondering, it's a rails & nginx app on an ubuntu box at (mt).<p>thanks<p>http://skribit.com<p>on an unrelated note, I find Satisfaction to be _great_ for getting user feedback. http://getsatisfaction.com/skribit<p>update: and people are already poking around for XSS exploits. :-P",1214193458.0

The teacher is more important than the subject matter, almost every time.<p>Useful values of X: statistics, biology (esp. molecular biology), linguistics, statistics (I mention it twice because it's twice as important), economics, first-year chemistry, physics. Skip organic chemistry unless you want to be an M.D.<p>Keep practicing the essay writing. If you can get good at that, or at least <i>comfortable</i> with it, it's <i>better</i> than a second major.<p>Which brings me to my radical suggestion: Drop the double major. Double majors are a waste of valuable time: You could be taking a sprinkling of intro and second-year classes in a bunch of different fields -- including at least one class from every <i>excellent</i> prof on campus -- but instead you're spending time taking boring classes from bad lecturers just to check off boxes for your second major, which <i>will not matter to anyone, ever</i>. [1]<p>(My school made me have a minor. I minored in history, which was a nice change of pace from physics, and was enjoyable, and made me practice all that writing, and I found an excellent history prof and took three of her classes. All of which was good. And yet... if I hadn't been forced to take the <i>fourth</i> history class, which was required of all history minors, I could have done the econ class instead, from the <i>really good</i> econ professor who was recommended to me. I regret missing that econ class to this day.)<p>Make a choice: e.g. if you like to program, are leaning toward startups, are aceing CS classes, and are not feeling ""clever enough for pure math"", major in CS -- that's where the marketability is, anyway. Then dump the math major -- just add math classes to taste. Then, add <i>other</i> classes to taste. If, as you say, you're ""quite bored"", you need to try something different. Mix it up a little. Archaeology. Japanese. Music Theory 101. Accounting. <i>Something</i>.<p>[1] There are only two times that double majors make any sense. One is if you're a premed. Another is if you're so hopelessly fascinated by the classes in your second field that as a senior you discover that you've accidentally come within two credits of your second major -- might as well finish it off.",1214192525.0

That's really far from the truth. Any organization, no matter how small, needs to get together and re-hash what's going on within the company. You can't just expect to work telepathically.",1214190871.0

Screen on a stable UNIX machine provides persistence, IRC provides real time ability.  37signals campfire provides the same functionality (real time, but also persistent chat) for less technical people.",1214190652.0

Of course I tend to overdo things--how do you think I dorked up my wrists in the first place so I can't say this is necessarily recommended practice:<p>a. Fill one pitcher with cold water and a tray or two of ice cubes, leaving room for you to immerse you hand and wrist without overflowing.<p>b. Fill another pitcher with scalding hot water, again leaving room for as much of your hand and wrist will fit into pitcher without bending your wrist at some weird angle.<p>c. Stick affected hand in ice water. Scream in agony until the numbing takes the edge off. Leave in for 1-4 minutes.<p>d. Move affected hand to hot water. If you timed it just right the water has cooled just enough that you avoid parboiling your hand. Leave in for 1 minute. Move your fingers around some.<p>e. Go to c until you get bored or the water in both pitchers has gone tepid.<p>I also periodically freshen up the hot water by filling a mug from the hot-water pitcher and microwaving it for a minute while I'm soaking in the cold water and then putting it back in the hot pitcher when I'm ready to switch. But I'm pretty weird.<p>-Peter""<p>Or you could just get a reasonable keyboard. I've been lusting after a Kinesis Contour for some time now ...",1214190333.0
