I lived on a cul-de-sac with limited traffic. We didn't even have a mailman driving into the cul-de-sac because we had locked mailboxes at the entrance to the cul-de-sac.

A second authentication that is much weaker than the first (prone to social engineering or even googling like the endemic first name of your favorite uncle questions) can be worse than just having one strong authentication. For some reason many companies think that building a bridge out of very many weak components makes a strong bridge. That is not true though, you have a weak bridge in the end.",1339559819.0

This typically meant going into possibly tangential details to avoid sending someone off to another resource.  (Though if the other resources was another Wrox book then allowances we made.)<p>For example, in a book about XML (Pro VB 6 & XML[0]) there was a need to go through the XML specification.  A whole chapter.  I ended up using this as an opportunity to explain the spec and build some helper libraries that would make interacting with a DOM easier later on, so not a total loss, but it had a feeling of busy-work to me.<p>That was sort of a best-case scenario; two authors splitting book.  I also worked on assorted individual chapters for other books and there I had an incentive to bolster the word count because in some cases it affected the pay.<p>In my experience writing a single chapter meant either a flat amount or a per-word rate.  Writing multiple chapters opened up the option of royalties instead. I took royalties on the VB book and did OK.  Sadly this gave me a false impression of tech writing as a profession.<p>Many Wrox books were more a collection of padded chapters than coherent, well-planned, guides.  OTOH I think many people plunked down $40-50 just to get specific chapters that would get them past some problem.<p>[0]: As the Velvet Underground sang, ""Those were different times."" :)",1339559422.0

And then you have Ralph Vaughan Williams, who went back to the time before harmony by creating new modal music.<p>Popular music and art music have coexisted for a long time. There are a lot of trends happening at once in music, and you've hardly made a case that Schoenberg and Cage are strongly connected to the rise of rock. I don't see why your reasoning can't be used to argue that the overwhelming complexity of the Romantics destroyed art music and handed control over to Jazz.<p>(And, no, John Williams is just an acknowledgement that anyone I call a descendant of Beethoven is going to sound a bit like Beethoven. I can think of several names innovating in the big orchestral space, all of which sound quite a bit different, and most of which you've never heard of.)",1339556488.0

You simply <i>can not</i> with a straight face say that the only insanely great technology business ideas come out of four places (Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley) and basically nowhere else. For example, two cities that have the highest concentrations of baccalaureate degree holders in the US are Seattle, WA and Raleigh, NC. Now pop quiz: Name a YCombinator company in either of those cities.<p>Oh, I know, it doesn't really mean anything. I just find it interesting that two otherwise academically talented areas are burgeoning hotbeds of neither startups nor even talent for said startups. I guess we can further break down what <i>kind</i> of degrees the citizens of these two Rodney Dangerfield of academic and tech hubs have. I mean, for all we know, they could be in philosophy or advanced basket weaving or, worse, <i></i>gasp<i></i>, English.<p>But the rise of crowdfunding couldn't come at a better time, in my opinion. It's high time the silo gets drained for a more swampy, organic, bubbling ooze sort of scattershot approach of crowdfunding. It'll be spendy, it'll be risky, it'll make outside observers think it's all <i>at best</i> a big gamble and at worst a big liberal boondoggle that will further weaken our country like everything else democrats come up with that dilutes and distributes power into the hands of ""the masses"".<p>Further, it'll make professional VCs cringe when successes actually start coming out of these crowdsourced ventures, as they talk of ""amateur hour"" money crowding out their world of term sheets and share dilution calculations over tapas in Menlo off Sand Hill Rd.<p>Whatever is going to happen, things like kickstarter and indiegogo and JOBS et al. are going to shake the status quo up big time. In my neohippie indie-and-proud idealistic head, it's not only exciting, it's necessary.",1339556446.0
