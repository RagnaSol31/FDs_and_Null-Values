And to that end, a rational angle will be to not act in a way, that damages value.<p>I told him to let his displeasure be known and leave but with his calm intact. And whatever, he had to do, meditate, jog, or whatever, to bring a calm mind to the table, he should do it.<p>He resigned, told the team that he built, that his initial pitch about the company doing interesting things are still true (which he truly believed), but he was leaving.<p>Fast forward a year and half, the company got sold for two-digits (Million USD), and he got a handsome payout, and the founders apologized.<p>He still wonders if the outcome would have been the same if he had acted in a way that damages the company.<p>Your first responsibility is to your peace and calm.
