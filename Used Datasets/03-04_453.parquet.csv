The answer in this case is no. I have a relatively new 1080P TV which works just fine. It cost me less than $500. I don't think there's anything Apple could do that would entice me to replace it. This coming from someone who owns a wide variety of Apple hardware. If they can't convince me to buy one then we've got some serious problems.<p>I'm really starting to think the TV rumors are just total misdirection. I think Apple is happy to let everyone assume they are slaving away to compete with Samsung, Vizio, LG, etc when in reality they are preparing to compete with Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. This won't just be a software update for the AppleTV. Has anyone else noticed the Mac Mini is absent in the rumors of updated Macs? Wouldn't surprise me if it's redesigned, renamed, and becomes the new iTV device running iOS6 with an entirely new TV UI to ship late this year. This will give Apple the horse power to really compete with high end console games in a box that is still quiet and small enough to be in your living room. In the short term there will be lots of iOS ports but by this time next year I think you'll start seeing some serious high end console games appear. (the existing AppleTV sticks around as basically an accessory to the iTV and iOS devices)",1339040800.0

The landlord gets paid more, which in turn covers his  slightly higher (or possible the same) landlords insurance and then some.  The landlord lets his tenant do what he's good at (maintain a sterling Airbnb profile and choose good renters) and the landlord takes a larger cut.  Worst case scenario, his tenant doesn't take the deal and the landlord proceeds to kick the tenant out for breech of contract (could possibly lead to a court battle, but breech of contract is a pretty cut and dry phenomenon and the contract most likely has breech of contract clauses built into it) and do was he was going to do anyway (rent it out through Airbnb or otherwise).<p>As it stands the landlord will be throwing money at lawyers (possibly covered by landlords insurance, but could effect the premiums later), which may not turn out favorably for the landlord in court, to ultimately do something that is outside his area of expertise (act as an Airbnb hotel himself).<p>That's what I think at least.",1339040792.0

[1]<p>Of course I'm kidding because these are valid critiques. Django's code base has a bad case of introducing really hard to debug interactions. But, to be fair, those are fairly rare.<p>However, as a Django lover I must say that Flask is missing a lot of what I love about Django: sane <i>pre-built</i> options for getting you to 90% functionality quickly. That last 10% can be difficult, but that is better than a more difficult 90%.<p>One thing that is rather annoying with Django is the learning curve (there's a lot in there), but the docs are so good that it isn't that bad (and one could argue that Flask is harder to learn because it means learning SQLAlchemy, Werkzueg, etc... too).<p>As he mentions in the slide, best tool for the job. Flask is certainly more Pythonic (IMO) and beats Django very handily for simple apps, but the ability to skip reinventing the wheel will keep a lot of people in the Django camp for the foreseeable future.<p>[1] <a href=""http://3rdaverad.io/shows/django-podcast/episodes/deployment-for-humans-with-kenneth-reitz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://3rdaverad.io/shows/django-podcast/episodes/deployment...</a>",1339039513.0

132,4077402,comment,4073362.0,4074089.0,9,0,ahoyhere,,,"OP, I'm always glad to hear when my words and my story inspire. And I realize there's no point in me telling you ""Don't quit your job!"" because obviously that horse has left the barn.<p>But what Patrick says is right: consulting is a GREAT opportunity right now for iOS devs.<p>However, where I disagree with him is this pivotal phrase: ""Should there ever be a gap"" No no no!<p>Don't wait for there to be a gap. The absolute worst time to be prospecting for client work is when you need it.<p>I'm all for throwing your energy into growing your existing revenues, but there's no way I would have ever done what you did and I have no kids and no mortgage. We consulted while we built up our app -- and it was stressful as hell but those big fat checks were a godsend. I can't even imagine trying to squeak by on $3k pre-tax with a spouse much less kids. Or with non-subscription income.<p>If you read the other things I write, you'll know I'm anti-magical thinking and rainbow gum drops and fairy dust. You know, unicorns, like the one being impaled by Mr Pointy the Narwhal of Truth on my blog header (<a href=""http://unicornfree.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unicornfree.com</a>).<p>Well, this is unicorns in action, dude. The deep down, heartfelt <i>belief</i> that if we just throw yourself at something hard enough, we must succeed, is a horrible thing we internalize from movies and TV shows. It makes great television but it's not the truth.<p>If you fail to protect yourself & your family, income-wise, all the joy from working on your own thing will be worthless. You will feel so terrible, and be in such stress, that you will long for the days of your boring, unrewarding job. True money stress (not ""I can't afford this luxury and I want it now!"" but REAL stress) is worse than almost any career dissatisfaction. Worrying about your basic needs is way more time consuming and soul-sucking than a crummy job.<p>So:<p>Bust ass to pick up consulting gigs now. Make the transition as seamless as possible. Build up a client base and you can charge more and more for better and better clients and fewer and fewer hours. It'll still be consulting, it'll still be working for somebody else, but for a while, getting paid double and triple the amount is novel enough that you'll cope.<p>You'll thank me later.",1339038220.0
