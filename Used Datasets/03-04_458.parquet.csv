To survive in the internet age, retail would need to morph into basically a manufacturer showroom, with very knowledgeable staff and where most goods were ordered in-store or online and just drop-shipped.<p>Why? Because the retail industry had devolved into essentially a real estate business; manufacturers bought shelf space from retailers. Manufacturers had essentially no control over the person-to-person sales/education experience for their own goods. Manufacturers hated it, especially new entrants, since it was so hard to introduce a new and actually better product.<p>It's taken about 20 years, but this is finally starting to happen at scale. Companies like Sony and Dell tried it, but they didn't really invest in the right floor salespeople or retail experience to make it anything other than a Sony store vs a Best Buy. Apple is really the first company to nail it, and it's paying off big time. It is really cool to see, as I think it's such a move in the right direction for both manufacturers and customers.",1333079824.0

47,3774395,comment,3774113.0,3774113.0,0,0,rodly,,,"This is an interesting example of how disruptive technology is. E-commerce is just too powerful a force and the low costs and ease of use will soon demolish our conceptions of what a retail store should be. With rising gas prices, no one wants to drive to a store, spend time searching for products, and be subject to annoying taxes and price hikes that B&M need to have to profit. It's an interesting but scary proposition because as more stores close down and jobs are displaced to programmers/web developers/etc, you get a pool of uneducated workers who saturate the employment pool with good work experience. This leads to lower and lower wages due to obvious excess supply and, well, you know how that goes. This is truly a scary transition that will become more commonplace in the coming years. There will be an uptick in jobs for people like us, but most people, even college students now, have no idea how to do much more than load memes in a ""internet explorer thingy firefox"". An even scarier question is when will E-commerce no longer need an abundance of highly paid programmers to build their infrastructure? I fear Amazon has nailed the proper way to shop online and their template is just that, a template. Wordpress killed the idea of a unique blog. Everyone can have a wonderful looking site and have no clue how anything works. When everyone can be extraordinary and stand out, no one stands out.",1333079006.0
