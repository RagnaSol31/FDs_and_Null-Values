Im trying to put statistical software on the web (almost all stat software is desktop). The first page is a document management module (similar to the one on Google Docs)-you can drag items into folders, share folders with other users, trash them, etc. Double clicking on a data set takes you to the data analysis module, where you can do statistical analysis. Right now I have only a simple bivariate regression module up - I want to keep it simple for the demo/proof of concept.<p>I dont expect to be accepted by YC but still want some feed back from the YC community.

8,1108885,comment,1108171.0,1108171.0,0,0,dkarl,,,"This is a cultural difference that, at least according to one theory, actually reflects an authoritarian culture rather than an egalitarian one.  It comes down to why people follow orders.  In egalitarian societies, people see the ability of one person to tell another person what to do as role-based, purely for the sake of efficiency.  In authoritarian societies, people see it as based on the personal superiority or privilege of the person giving the order.<p>This can cause friction when two people from different cultures step on each other's sensibilities.  A person with an egalitarian mentality working in a corporation in a less egalitarian country may be shocked at the way his ""superiors"" speak to him -- as if they were any better than him!  A person from an authoritarian country may be offended when someone who is not his ""superior"" tries to ""order him around,"" because ""giving orders"" presumes a hierarchical relationship between the two.<p>From my point of view, it's quite convenient that I feel free to tell other people what to do, or do what other people tell me, without worrying about whether that implies a power relationship between us (+).  But then, I would feel that way about my own culture, wouldn't I?<p>For one analysis, see this book, which is oriented towards management and business communications:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cultures-Organizations-Software-Geert-Hofstede/dp/0071439595/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1265599541&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cultures-Organizations-Software-Geert-...</a><p>The author identified five dimensions that he thinks are the most informative about national cultural differences.

You need to tweak the server a whole lot if you want to close down what your users can do and from where they can do it; it becomes complex to synchronize all the data from the backend of the site: who ignores who, privacy settings, friend lists, etc.<p>Another problem that I had encountered was about BOSH. From what I had read in the RFCs, the BOSH session is based on random seed that you hash over and over in SHA (say 200 times). The server then just has to SHA your message to find the hash of the previous message. This, coupled with the basic session identifiers effectively makes it relatively complex to have the chat working over multiple windows or tabs.<p>There might be other reasons, but those are the obvious ones to me.",1265600920.0

As gte910h points out it's next to worthless to sell because Apple has shown it will target companies that try to exploit it's trademarks.<p>2.  You can't just resell iPads you have to be an Apple reseller and the chances of you getting the nod from Apple are slim (in fact you run the chance of getting sued just by putting yourself on their radar)<p>3.  Apple gives resellers virtually no controls over pricing ($20 or less) so it isn't worth it to pay a site to partner with.<p>So if it were me I'd set Google Alerts to tell me every mention of the iPad and create a directory of reviews/media stories/etc...

If no one is in charge and decisions are made by consensus / bureaucracy, then the result will be as bad as the worst persons taste.\nThe test for whether you really have final cut is whether you'd get to release something that is crazy and no one else agrees with. Ex. the ending of the Sopranos.\nHis advice is that if you don't have official final cut, but you know that you're right about something, you can ""take"" final cut by making your way the only viable option.

After the gold was converted to paper money they took the official price from around $20 an ounce to $35 an ounce thereby reducing the purchasing power of the paper (you needed $35 to buy what once cost you $20 just a few months earlier). Since Treasury notes then were essentially gold certificates promising to pay the bearer in the dollar value of gold, the US defaulted because they wouldn't honor the conversion. US Citizens were not allowed to own gold outside of jewelry again until 1974.<p>In 1971 Nixon closed the gold window for international holders of dollars. Foreign countries with dollars would no longer be allowed to convert their dollars for gold at the agreed to rate of $35 per ounce. So this too is a default as the terms of the agreement were not followed and we left foreign holders with dollars that were declining in value rapidly due to our inflation.<p>I'm not expecting the US to default any time soon, but there are ways for it to happen that technically aren't a ""default"" but achieve the same outcome. High inflation is the most likely way they'd do this if it came down to it.",1265600338.0

Either way, I think I prefer to remain unconscious during the procedure.<p>Really though, even if it's not a good solution for serious dental problems, if it can provide a pain-free, fear-free (that drill just terrifies a lot of people, honestly), quick means of dealing with minor tooth decay, then perhaps more people will seek treatment earlier, before things get out of hand.<p>I still think the number one factor in individuals not seeking proper dental care, however, is cost and the fact that it's just so hard to get good, affordable dental insurance (or any dental insurance at all). We could go on for hours about the flaws in our healthcare system in the US and about how hard it is for many people to get insurance, but getting dental insurance is even more difficult in a lot of cases.<p>Sadly, I don't think adding plasma and lasers is going to drive the cost down any, at least not for several years. Not that this, in any way, means I think we should stop innovating, because innovation is going to lead to better care and, hopefully, eventually, more affordable care.",1265600324.0
37,1108855,comment,1108655.0,1108655.0,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"Law and medicine are perhaps worse because these professions impose relatively rigid career tracks upon their members.  It's well and good to work 80+ hours/week at a ""white shoe"" law firm when you're in your late 20's without children.  But, even the time off required to push out a baby and recover will have a negative impact on your billable quota.  A couple years ago, a friend's firm adopted some new, supposedly mommy-friendly policies in hope of keeping more women on partner track.  A few months later, they did a round of lay-offs which included her.  She had been working part-time post-child after having received glowing reviews pre-pregnancy.  Other firms have done better by offering non-partner track roles which paid less, but offered 40-hour work weeks -- a realistic option taken by a couple of women I know.  Perhaps the whole up-or-out partner track model of traditional law firms must change.  It's clearly from an era where the rising star was expected to have a stay-at-home wife to take care of things.  It can't be the only model by which law can be practiced successfully.  This model also adversely affects those opting into law as a second career.<p>Physicians finish residency around age 30 -- about the average age for college-educated women to have a first child.  A friend of ours had to delay residency by two years because a pregnancy required bed rest at the time she was supposed to be finishing up her internship year.  The next year's match class was already full.  So, after a MD/PhD and fellowship, she will have her first real job at age 37.  Maybe the traditional model of ""lots and lots of school"" followed by being a full-fledged doctor could be replaced by some sort of stepping-stone model which where one could opt out of the rat race for a couple of years in the middle.  I'm imagining a path that allows on to practice as doctor-lite (like a nurse practitioner) and later become a full-fledged doctor.<p>I don't think one can ""have it all"" -- meaning that a parent can't compete successfully with those willing to sacrifice their lives to work and still show up at the after-school soccer games.  Society will have to figure out alternatives for those models of success built-up in the era where it would have been redundant to prepend ""stay-at-home"" to ""wife.""<p>I'm not suggesting that there's anything morally/ethically wrong with the way law firms work today.  If a private business wants to limit the available work force through an incentive system that's not fully utilizable by 50% of the population, that's its right.  I'm not so comfortable with making a similar statement about medicine because the rites of passage are implicitly set by government regulation rather than market forces.  It's not as if I can start-up a certification program for high-end health professionals which will compete with the AMA's MD designations.",1265600322.0
