The teams do reasonably similar things, and I think they actually interact on occasion, despite the fact that this is a pretty large company.  This means that A) I can't really make a decision based on the actual work, since it's pretty similar; and B) I may end up interacting with the team I decline.<p>I think I know which team I'm going to go with.  One of the teams' managers got in touch with me right away, he seems to have a good attitude and sense of humor, and he put me in touch with a former intern who sent me a long and extremely positive e-mail about the team.  The other team's manager didn't get in touch with me for a couple days, and when he did I just didn't get the impression that he was excited about his work.  He didn't seem like he'd be as pleasant a boss as the first team's manager.<p>So my question is this: How do I present what is basically a personal decsion without it seeming...well, personal?",1233460202

Maybe the governments response to deflation (print money!) can cause inflation, but the destruction of value and the reduction of the money supply cannot cause the overvaluation of assets or an expansion in the money supply, except through government action.<p>Of course, it is true that hyper-inflation, if it happens, will happen quickly. People will be, as you say, hoarding their cash because of uncertainty. But when they become confident enough to borrow from the banks again, and the large reserves they have been stockpiling hit the fan, it is quite possible that people will quickly notice the change in money supply, and react by trying to get rid of their money too.

52,460438,comment,459961.0,460209.0,0,0,shader,,,"There are several major problems with inflation (meaning a vast expansion of the money supply through government spending, resulting in a rise in prices, and a fall in the value of the dollar):<p>1) That purchasing power went somewhere. Instead of going to what people wanted, though, it will have gone to what the politicians want, which is most likely a waste of resources. At the very best, the investments will be mostly harmless.<p>2) It doesn't just cause the exodus of capital, it practically <i>is</i> the exodus of capital: by printing money, they devalue all of the cash investments in the United States, thus reducing the amount of investable funds. While the foreign capital may be able to buy more dollars worth of goods per euro, there would be far less local capital to be invested.<p>3) While in theory the lower value of the dollar would make purchasing American goods more attractive to foreigners, that is often not the case. Just because a currency is cheap doesn't mean that items denominated in that currency are cheap. One example of this which I have experienced recently is the East Carribean Union dollar, which is worth much less than a US$, but where all of the items cost as much or more than they do here. Just because the currency is low in value doesn't mean that goods are actually cheap. Prices can rise to make up the difference, and often do.<p>However, if the dollar becomes cheaper not due to inflation, but because of our continued trade imbalance then yes, your description of increased exports would be quite accurate. Trade imbalances aren't bad, and they can't last forever. What goes in must come out or accumulate. And in the case of dollars, accumulation causes a relative change in value. Supply and demand and whatnot.<p>4) Extreme inflation can cause instability, and reduce investor interest. No one wants to invest in Zimbabwe, because they are financially (and in other ways as well) unstable. Inflation is bad because it throws the future into question, and makes people less likely to lend money. If they do it is often at a higher interest rate.<p>Also, deflation is not nearly as bad as many people think. Yes, dramatic and sudden deflation is just as bad for an economy as dramatic and sudden inflation. But an economy can get used to deflation just as well as it can adjust to inflation. In fact, it is almost a bonus, because it encourages saving, and thus investment and growth. I'm not saying that we should intentionally cause deflation, just that it's not a guaranteed cause of a death-spiral. The United States had a long deflationary period in the 1800s, and it was also one of the longer periods of high sustained growth. This will not always be the case, but there is little reason to be more afraid of deflation than inflation.",1233457655

I simply can't afford to shell out $50 dollars for every intriguing and intellectually interesting book that is out there.

Jamming wireless signals in a small area may be a good idea. Jamming an entire city, for instance, would arguably be a blatant example of abuse of power.<p>On the other hand, it seems that all that potential terrorists would have to do would be to use spread spectrum techniques and operate on frequency bands not used by commercial devices. There's a lot of room for everyone in the EM spectrum.",1233457502
