On the extreme left you have people whose sole experience with programming is just getting the damn computer to do what they want with as little effort as possible: copy and paste some code that seems like it fixes the problem, run it, and tweak as necessary. On the far right you have people who fell into programming as kids and took to it like a moth to a flame.

32,8338901,comment,8335010.0,8335010.0,3,0,DEADB17,,,"I think that contrasting OOP with FP brings too many implicit assumptions to the discussion.\nThe value of immutability, for example, seems to be orthogonal to the technique used to structure a computation and is more closely related to the problem to be solved.<p>In my opinion OO languages popularized the idea of having separate internal and external representations by providing language constructs that made it practical. But they also promoted the coupling of data with the methods to manipulate it -- this is not a necessary characteristic of OO but it is common in popular implementations. This association of data and methods turned out to be a limiting factor in the face of changing (maybe unknown) requirements. The flexibility of more dynamic run-times that allow to mutate this relationship during execution (monkey patching) was not a satisfactory solution as it inhibits static analysis. In my experience this is generally the main motivation when looking into alternatives.<p>Modeling computations as dynamic data threaded through a series of statically defined transformation seems like a sensible solution to the issue. It also brings additional benefits (e.g.: easier unit testing) and makes some constructs unnecessary (e.g.: implementation inheritance). This approach is commonly used in FP languages and I think is the main reason why they are contrasted as alternatives.<p>Since it&",

For older military hardware like this unless you declare you are planning to import into some war-torn region of Africa there is unlikely to be any problems exiting the country with it. You might have to pay someone a small bribe if you&,
