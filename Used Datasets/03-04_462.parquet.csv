Most monitors seem to come set by default to maximum or near-maximum eye-watering brightness and contrast, which is great for in-store displays in an environment containing lots of other high-brightness lighting, but horrible for actual use.

I find the evolution fascinating. Oh and I had a comms processor (terminal server to a modem bank) which turned out to just be a MicroVAX 3 runing VAXELN. The CPU was some what &quot;cut down&quot; (I think optimized was the word they used) to make it more cost effective. VMS would not boot on it.,1430103958.0
