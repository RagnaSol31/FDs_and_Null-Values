Their earnings also suffered: through age thirty, men who started school later earned less.&quot;<p>From the abstract of the paper it references [1]:<p>&quot;We find evidence for a small positive effect of starting school younger on IQ scores measured at age 18. In contrast, we find evidence of much larger positive effects of age at test, and these results are very robust. [...] There appears to be a short-run positive effect on earnings of beginning school at a younger age; however, this effect has essentially disappeared by age 30.&quot;<p>Not quite as sensationalist as the summary in the article!  Students starting school younger had slightly higher test scores at age 18.  However, the age when taking the test had a greater effect, so students starting older would still presumably have an advantage in tests taken at graduation (given that they would still be older).  Students starting younger earned more, but only slightly and only until age 30.<p>I expect the real conclusion to be drawn is that it&",
