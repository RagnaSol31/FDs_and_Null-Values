The subtext of that, which she talks about in the text, is that even for a developer with no design sense it doesn't take much effort to make Bootstrap not look like Bootstrap.<p>She ended up with something that didn't look like Bootstrap at the end, with minimal effort and allowing the developer to focus on coding. <i>That was the entire point.</i> And you know what? I wouldn't have picked that particular font, but the end result did not look that bad.<p>There are a lot of developers working on MVPs here that have absolutely no design sense nor the budget to hire a designer that might find this useful.

The wikipedia estimate is likely wrong, but I don't think by an order of magnitude.<p>I agree with you on the Linux kernel.  I even noted that about half only contributed one patch.<p>I suspect that I disagree with you about what Dijkstra's point was.  When you're programming, there is nowhere to hide from the fact of your code not running.  By contrast in pure math, a surprising amount of sloppiness can be hidden in the fact that minor papers do not always get completely rigorous view.  Therefore if you're inclined to that form of sloppiness, you're better off in pure math.

I was thinking that all particles are interchangeable at sufficiently high temperatures (i.e. they can switch from one particle to another so long as energy is conserved).  I overlooked the fact that stars don't get hot enough.<p>> Or why can't it be the case that the crushing process doesn't take matter through the infinitely strong configuration on the way to black hole configuration?<p>If the ""infinitely strong"" configuration got crushed into a black hole, it wasn't infinitely strong.<p>> For example, why can't it be the case that there are two kinds of matter, one that can be used to build infinitely strong wire, and one that can't, with stars being made of the latter?<p>How would the infinitely strong wire be held together?  Electromagnetic force?  Strong force?  Weak force?  Those forces (which are the only ones we know about apart from gravity) travel at c.  If part of the wire is in, while part is out, we will necessarily break the bonds holding the material together if we attempt to pull the wire clear.  If nothing else, this breaking will occur because those bonds rely on force carriers traveling at c, and so somewhere along the wire those force carriers will not see the items they are supposed to bind together.<p>Let us say we hold the wire so that a portion of it is past the event horizon.  The bit of the wire at the event horizon, if held stationary, is traveling at c because light is also stationary there.  Whatever bond existed at that point is no more; the force carriers can't make it to the particles they're supposed to bind together.",1355629675.0

This  includes ""et. al"", from which I have assumed best practice of APA Style Guidelines, indicating at least 6 authors. I also could have counted more using [2], but I believe this is sufficient.<p>I feel that the statement that ""only 100"" mathematicians worked on the classification of finite groups is disingenuous. There is clearly a disparity between contributing a kernel patch and dedicating your entire life to researching a mathematical topic.<p>As for the Linux kernel, I would like to point out that the original paper [3] states that 7,944 developers have contributed since 2.6.11 (which is more than your estimate, but important regardless). A paragraph later on is a little more telling:<p>>[D]espite the large number of individual developers, there is still a relatively small number who are doing the majority of the work. In any given development cycle, approximately 1/3 of the developers involved contribute exactly one patch. Over the past 5.5 years, the top 10 individual developers have contributed 9% of the total changes and the top 30 developers have contributed just over 20% of the total.<p>That is to say, 30 developers have made 20% of Linux. This is not unlike the classification of finite groups, where a small amount of people have done a large majority of the work. It would be insane to say only 100 people have ever looked at finite groups. Indeed, proving something is exponentially harder than learning it. Similarly, you would not say that 7000 people use Linux, because 7000 have hacked on the kernel.<p>As for your last comment regarding about how you did not choose the topic, I agree. But I think that this entire debate is silly: neither side is more important than the other, more difficult than the other, mutually exclusive, or so on. I do not agree with Dijkstra on this point, and I feel that his fame is no reason to excuse him from it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2001-38-03/S0273-0979-01-00909-0/S0273-0979-01-00909-0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2001-38-03/S0273-0979-01-00...</a><p>[2] A History of Finite Simple Groups, by FCC Doherty.<p>[3] <a href=""http://go.linuxfoundation.org/who-writes-linux-2012"" rel=""nofollow"">http://go.linuxfoundation.org/who-writes-linux-2012</a>",1355627752.0

What makes this is essentially different from just a common app is that interviews and work you do for any of these companies on this list may be shared with the entire community/portfolio, and there will be opportunities to move to a place to a better fit or position after establishing yourself (I have seen this done before, an acquaintance of mine worked for a startup in SF this summer, and at the end of the summer he was offered a full-time position at a different company in the same portfolio after hearing about his prowess as a web developer/designer).<p>Secondly, this is a beautifully put together application. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, but the questions give a lot of hints to the applicant about what qualities a startup is looking for in a future worker.
