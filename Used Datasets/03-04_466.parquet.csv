You can depend on modules freely and not worry about making it harder for users of your module to install it.</i><p>That statement is true in theory, as long as everyone follows semantic versioning and dependencies never have unexpected interactions because of bugs.<p>Unfortunately, in the real world, neither of these conditions holds perfectly. The moment you depend on any module in your package.json that directly or indirectly depends on any other module where any version is not precisely fixed, you are immediately running uncontrolled and probably untested (by you) code. Moreover, if anything does go wrong, you may also have considerable difficulty identifying and reproducing the exact combination of versions of everything that caused the failure.<p>I have spent far too many days over the past few months tracking down exactly these kinds of issues, sometimes in some of the best known and most popular modules available via npm. For example, as the article itself mentions, what you wind up with in your node_modules directory can depend on install order under the new scheme. I don&",

Resource minimization, indeed even resource maximization, is not expressible in the Bitcoin consensus protocol as a rule. Instead I was talking about the idea that Bitcoin resource requirements can be minimized. By minimizing the resource requirements, you make Bitcoin more cheap and easily accessible, and you can accrue benefits of tech development to process and handle the existing Bitcoin system on ever-cheapening computer hardware.<p>> and current requirements are nowhere close to being beyond the reach of a typical user<p>I guess that depends on what you consider a typical user. A lot of those &quot;typical users&quot; are complaining about the mere possibility of $20 Bitcoin transaction fees in the future, so it sounds like a $20/year node cost might not be compatible with the &quot;typical Bitcoin user&quot;. In general to encourage adoption we should not cut off users from their nodes participating in the Bitcoin network.<p>> The alternative to a hard limit on block size is to have no limit<p>You mean the &quot;transaction fee market without a block size as long as selfish mining doesn&",

I did not try to qualify either machine learners and statisticians as bad or good, just pointing out a difference in their approaches to problems.<p>I do not know enough about statistics to make a (negative) quality statement about it. I know a bit more about machine learning though, and there I also see things like: Picking the most favorable cross-validation evaluation metric, comparing to &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; while ignoring the real SotA, generating your own data sets instead of using real-life data, improving performance by &quot;reverse engineering&quot; the data sets, reporting only on problems where your algo works, and other such tricks. I believe you when you say much the same is happening for statisticians.<p>Maybe it was my choice of words (careful, sober).
