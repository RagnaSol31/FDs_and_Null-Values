Most cable news networks don't easily distinguish between news and opinion reporting since both are regularly done by the same people.<p>- I've noted a few articles in the previous comment that make the assertion that nothing new was released by Wikileaks in the article headlines. Most people don't really read beyond those anyway.<p>- Again we're focusing on Julian Assange. While there is a story to be written about him, that story is easy and lazy. The far harder story is to actually investigate the cables. Since the cables were transmitted to Wikileaks, vetted by select media partners, and released, no one has accused him of either fabricating or falsifying anything contained in these leaks. The rape accusations against him (while serious and perhaps true) do not change the information contained therein. The source doesn't actually taint the leaked information.<p>It'd be like me writing:<p>Former illegal cocaine and marijuana user, President Barack Obama, took a trip to Hawaii for Christmas break. Since he had been known to get a speeding ticket, it's interesting that he's asked to speed up the time table for implementing the repeal of ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"".<p>True, but irrelevant.",1293508667.0

This tells me that their website is irrelevant to their sales.<p>If this is so why don't you create an awesome landing page that converts really well for tazo tea, get some SEO going, open up an account at shopify and then sell tazo tea on the internet?

There are more than 5000 local newspapers in this country (where most people get their information), cable tv, and radio. It's become a widely spread idea that this past round of Wikileaks contained nothing new. The Obama Administration has asserted this as fact and it was widely reported by CBS, BBC, The Huffington Post and more. However, these articles are widely syndicated and a quick search on Google brings this up:<p>WikiLeaks Classified Diplomatic Cable Release Yields No Surprises ... - Daily Finance<p>No surprises seen in WikiLeaks Iraq war data: Pentagon - Reuters (which is widely syndicated)<p>WikiLeaks shocker? In Kabul, Pakistan support for Taliban is no surprise - Christian Science Monitor<p>WikiLeaks torture cables no surprise - Yahoo News<p>Heck, even a letter to the editor at the Pantagraph newspaper in Bloomington, IL confirms my suspicion that many/most people don't believe there was anything new in the WikiLeaks dump at all:<p><a href=""http://www.pantagraph.com/news/opinion/mailbag/article_ab85fa5a-0ee8-11e0-b0e8-001cc4c03286.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pantagraph.com/news/opinion/mailbag/article_ab85f...</a><p>""It wasn’t anything we didn’t know and it will all be forgotten, even by the media, except by the dumb military guy who gave them access to the Internet connections and will probably be tried for treason and left in jail.""<p>The perception has been created.

Apple's one-model approach for mobile devices (with a small set of possible hardware configurations) has and will continue to pay off big for development purposes and will allow for more advanced features to be integrated thoroughly and simply across the platform more quickly (examples - GPS & gyro now & touch sensitive back & NFC technologies in the future).<p>The bottom line is that I would expect Android to continue to push the industry forward on many specification style features like high quality cameras, speedy hardware, and storage space while the iPhone will have more ""leapfrogging"" features like the examples listed above.

ReachLocal has something like 80% churn,not retention, fucking churn.<p>Here's how I'd go about this for months 1-9.  Crack the nut of an easy to use system (point b) and find distribution channels that already exist (point c) such as local newspapers, print shops, and others with a foot into the local market.  You'd also need to have a system of people to crank out onboarding in a very cost efficient and systematic manner.",1293505462.0

Ecosystems of sellers usually develop around the characteristics of buyers. Restauranteurs are (as a general rule) terrible buyers and terrible clients.<p>You might look at a site and think ""that'll take x hours to do,"" but you need to factor in the time that it takes to get the client there. In my experience, that's several times x. Just making the sale could be several times x.<p>You need to realize you are starting from scratch and that from where you stand, it's hard to know where scratch is. You will need to convince them why flash is bad (even though everyone they ask thinks it looks great). This is just one example. They will not be able to evaluate the site from the perspective of the user, that kind of thinking takes practice.<p>Then crisis strikes when your offer which includes some little mini-app to do that thing they want with the menus (already done) and a custom design (hired a mid range designer) costs more than the other offer which is largely auto-generated.<p>The reasons are similar for large companies having bad software, they are bad buyers.",1293505374.0

Each function definition is preceded by documentation of its purpose and side effects.  Unfortunately the modules tend not to be quite as clean.  The development community is dwindling but exceedingly polite and helpful.<p>The one gripe I have is that the tuning parameters are not well documented (especially post 4.5.0).  You have to study the source in order to dig out all the parameters you need to tweak in order to really make the server sing.,1293505373.0
