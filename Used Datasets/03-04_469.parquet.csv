HTML5 adds lots of complexity in the browser, and yet don't address most of the fundamental problems of HTML: security, complexity. Web SQL was another step in the wrong direction.<p>Local storage wont go away. I hope Web SQL will be replaced by something ""better"" and more straightforward, A simple key-value database would be great.",1290135685.0

TSA is clearly ignoring the will of Congress, which voted in 2009 to block the scanners.  They are also certainly violating the 4th Amendment limit on government searches.  Both the Congress and the courts may yet have their say on the matter of the porno-scanners.  Not to mention that the states should play a role-- already local DA's are challenging potential TSA violations of sexual assault laws, and state legislatures and even city governments are looking at banning the scanners.<p>The genius of the American system is the separation of powers, both at the federal level and the states.  Ninety years of progressivism has greatly centralized power in Washington and atrophied the Framers' design, but there's life in the old federalist system yet...",1290135617.0
