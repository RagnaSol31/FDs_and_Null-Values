I keep trying to ask people who support banning all foreign labour, what they think will happen when everywhere else bans UK labour from their countries in return and all those UK expat workers, with their wealth of experience, come flooding back in greater numbers than the foreign workers that have just been kicked out, so leading to even greater unemployment, while at the same time guaranteeing that nobody would really want to trade with us anymore.

And what metrics?  You just listed a ton of caveats and then said that it's ""worthy"" based on unnamed metrics.<p>No, the iPhone doesn't ""stack up"", nor should it.  It's a camera phone compared to a very high-end DSLR.  It falls far short of the DSLR in image quality metrics.  The images are noisy.  They aren't sharp.  There's glare galore.  And that's okay, because it's a camera phone, and the primary use case is snapping photos of friends to upload to Facebook or show other friends at the bar.<p>The fact that it meets your needs doesn't mean it ""stacks up"", though, any more than a Honda Civic ""stacks up"" against a Ferrari.

Anytime you use software to buy or sell securities, people assume it is technical trading, or worse, high-frequency trading. The truth is there aren't enough people working on making algorithms that invest rather than trade, because the ROI for trading is more apparent.<p>I work at Quantopian, and our goal is to make it possible for more people to explore algorithmic investing. I agree the social utility of from increasing liquidity from current levels is at best diminishing returns, but algorithms could bring the same drop in costs and increase in quality for money management that it brought to trading. That's a benefit to individuals, pension funds, charitable endowments, and anyone else that has to save and plan for the future. Financial professions couldn't have a worse rap these days, much of it deserved, but there are real social problems that require financial solutions. People need to save for retirement, plan for the kids' college tuition, and take on mortgages.<p>I think it is really good for society to have smart people work on investment management. Especially if they are automating, collaborating, and discussing their work openly - the opposite of today's Wall Street. I like that QuantBlock did something original, and I love that they are striving for really broad access.<p>We think the key to advancing algorithmic investment is to create more access so smart hackers can tinker with investment strategies. Those folks should be able to explore and test ideas/algos without spending a few years building a backtester, or a few years' of salary on data. That's why our backtester is free to use at quantopian.com, and why the source code will be released at PyData NYC (<a href=""http://blog.quantopian.com/pydatanyc-here-we-come/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.quantopian.com/pydatanyc-here-we-come/</a>).<p>I wrote more about where we want Quantopian to go, and where I think finance needs to go on our blog: <a href=""http://blog.quantopian.com/quantopian-manifesto/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.quantopian.com/quantopian-manifesto/</a>",1348284869.0

As a user of a language and not a developer of a parser, the first doesn't concern me and the second should be trumped by long-term concerns. Using significant whitespace to eliminate syntax is elegant in its own way as well.<p>Again, maybe this is just because I'm not a lisper, but keeping implicit parens that follow a well-established pattern should be a trivial mental task for a developer.

Part of designing a startup business model is organizing growth so that you are unconstrained, so that more input produces greater output, earlier -- whether it's capital, users, employees, or support. All it takes is for one component of your business to not scale and you won't hit your growth numbers despite the brilliance of every other part.<p>Capital is just one of the areas you have to look at. Amazon is a decent example. Bezos chose books because it was (a) accessible (catalogs existed), and (b) he got 6 months to pay back booksellers, which meant he could afford to grow the more he sold, by using the money owed to the booksellers as float.<p>Startups would do well to evaluate all possible constraints on growth, capital and otherwise. Many times small tweaks to how you sell your product (or what product you sell) can produce large variations in the amount and timing of capital needed.<p>Here's an example: do you have customers pay for the first 30 days up front, with an option to cancel within that time? Or do you charge your customers <i>after</i> the first 30 days are up?<p>Now, you'd think the latter would always be better for ""growth"", because it involves a weaker commitment -- no money changes hands early.<p>But it also has a huge capital cost differential, if the service costs a substantial amount of money to deliver. In order to grow the latter model, you'll have to obtain more and more capital over time as you grow.<p>But if you do the former, you can ""fund"" your company's growth <i>off of</i> its earlier growth. Although this might impact growth negatively, by turning away customers that ""won't pay"" for the first 30 days up front, but who would have become customers the other way.<p>So which is better? It really depends. If your growth rate is already 7% with the pay-up-front model, that's better IMO than getting, say, an 8% growth rate with the pay-after model. The latter will require raising increasingly greater amounts of capital, despite the fact that it's growing ""faster"" initially, ultimately <i>hurting</i> your growth or wiping out your equity, or both.<p>Both approaches will still have their ""S"" curves end up at the same place (the market size doesn't change), but let's be blunt here: no company can catches up to 7% growth, so wasting your equity on 8% growth just makes you poorer, and the VCs richer.<p>Sustainable growth is just as important, and treating capital as something you ""have to"" raise is exactly what VCs want you to think, since, hey, that's what they sell. Venture  capital is a financial <i>tool</i>, not the only (real) way to capitalize a startup during and after growth.",1348283276.0
