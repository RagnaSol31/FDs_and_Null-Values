So for example, the strongest brands tend to be in markets like soda, foods, and cigarettes, because you're putting this stuff in your body and yet you can't tell what went into it.  Branded medicine can fetch prices several times higher than generics, despite being exactly the same stuff.  Things like software - Microsoft and Google - have middle-ground brand power, where quality is important (but not all-important) and you have few indications for overall software quality at purchase time.  Things like airlines have virtually no branding power, because the trip is over in 5 hours, you've gotten to your destination, and you quickly forget about just how unpleasant the flight over was.<p>Following this, there are two ways to cut brand power of entrenched competitor:<p>1.) Make consumers care less about product quality.  Cunard and White Star were done in by the airline industry, because by cutting trip duration from 5 days to 5 hours, they made consumers ambivalent about trip quality.<p>2.) Give consumers better information about the actual quality of the product.  Google destroyed branded directory sites like Yahoo because they showed everyone just how many websites the directories were missing, and let them evaluate for themselves the quality of the sites.<p>To achieve ",

I guess to prevent a lawsuit.<p>* you can collect unemployment, which you can't do if you quit.<p>* few people hiring really care if you got fired. nobody even asked me what happened. I had competing job offers in days.<p>* this happens all the time, even moreso in the upper ranks of management. in fact, it seems the higher up you are, the better deal it is to get fired. often times when a C level exec gets fired, they get a severence package which allows them to not work for a year or so.<p>* the person who is probably going to be most bummed is your mom.<p>The main lesson I learned though, is that it's another one of the long standing bullshit lines about things that will destroy your life that simply aren't true.

Chapters 9-35 are a NIGHTMARE for newbies.\n    - Book uses new terms many times without defining them\n        - Better know what a File's Owner is, or else Chap 9 will confuse you, etc\n    - For one of the code examples the author wrote ""I don't really expect you to \n      understand every line of that code now, but browse through the method and try\n      to get the gist.""\n    - Book must be read sequentially, and code examples must be done sequentially. \n      Code examples in later chapters can reference code 5 chapters back. There's \n      no skipping around in this book, even for unrelated topics. Very annoying as\n      a reference book.\n    - For non-newbies, gives a ""taste"" of some of Cocoa's popular API's. You'll \n      have to read Apple's docs to really learn how to use them.\n    - Reading this book after getting some Cocoa experience was much easier.\n    \n    Bottom Line: Very good intro to Cocoa's API's, but NOT for newbies coming \n                 straight from an Objective-C book. Read another Cocoa book \n                 first, program in Cocoa for 3-6 months, and then get this book.\n</code></pre>\nCocoa Programming for Mac OS X for Dummies (2nd ed), by Erick Tejkowski<p><pre><code>    - THIS is the best ""newbie"" Cocoa book I've read. Very easy to understand \n      and follow.\n    - Hand-holds you the entire way.\n    - Many ""minor"" errors in the book and code examples, which is its only \n      downfall. However I managed to figure them all out and get every example \n      working.\n    \n    Bottom Line: Recommended for newbies. Only caveat is there are a lot of minor\n                 errors in the book, but I managed to figure them all out without\n                 much sweat.\n\n</code></pre>\nDave Mark has also written a new Cocoa book which I haven't read:  Learn Cocoa on the Mac, by Jack Nutting, David Mark, Jeff LaMarche.  If it's anything like Mr. Mark's C book, it's probably pretty good. Check reviews on Amazon, etc...<p>--------------------<p>Also of note, Apple announced Xcode 4 in June 2010, which will replace Xcode 3.x ""sometime in the future"". Currently it's in beta. It has a very different user interface than Xcode 3.x, meaning just about every Mac programming book will become dated the moment Xcode 4 comes out. Both 3 & 4 appear ""similar"", but different enough to confuse new programmers.",1289617305.0
