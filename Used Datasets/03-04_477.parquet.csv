There was a time when it must have seemed highly improbable that machines should learn to make their wants known by sound, even through the ears of man; may we not conceive, then, that a day will come when those ears will be no longer needed, and the hearing will be done by the delicacy of the machine’s own construction? — when its language shall have been developed from the cry of animals to a speech as intricate as our own?</i><p><i>“It is possible that by that time children will learn the differential calculus — as they learn now to speak — from their mothers and nurses, or that they may talk in the hypothetical language, and work rule of three sums, as soon as they are born; but this is not probable; we cannot calculate on any corresponding advance in man’s intellectual or physical powers which shall be a set-off against the far greater development which seems in store for the machines. Some people may say that man’s moral influence will suffice to rule them; but I cannot think it will ever be safe to repose much trust in the moral sense of any machine.</i><p><i>“Again, might not the glory of the machines consist in their being without this same boasted gift of language? ‘Silence,’ it has been said by one writer, ‘is a virtue which renders us agreeable to our fellow-creatures.’”</i><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/butler-samuel/1872/erewhon/ch23.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/butler-samuel/187...</a>",1438227423.0

The example given only is only a few binary places from zero [2], so is indeed one of the smallest numbers an fpu can operate on.<p>One of the things that happens when you enable &quot;unsafe&quot; options is that it sets a flag in the SSE control register to set subnormal numbers to zero. Because subnormal numbers slow things down considerably, making them not happen is one of the unsafe ways to speed up code. Importing that library will run initialization code that sets the control register to get the extra, precision-losing, speed, and as a consequence, set all those tiny numbers to zero, hence the results you see.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal_number"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal_number</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.binaryconvert.com/result_double.html?decimal=052046055052051048051048050048048048056101045051050050"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.binaryconvert.com/result_double.html?decimal=0520...</a>",1438226339.0

[…] what the end of this mighty movement is to be. In what direction is it tending?<p>[…]<p>What sort of creature man’s next successor in the supremacy of the earth is likely to be. We have often heard this debated; but it appears to us that we are ourselves creating our own successors; we are daily adding to the beauty and delicacy of their physical organisation; we are daily giving them greater power and supplying by all sorts of ingenious contrivances that self-regulating, self-acting power which will be to them what intellect has been to the human race. In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race.<p>[…]<p>We take it that when the state of things shall have arrived which we have been above attempting to describe, man will have become to the machine what the horse and the dog are to man.<p>[…]<p>Our opinion is that war to the death should be instantly proclaimed against them.

So these agent instances were being continually created and destroyed, and the GC lag absolutely killed performance and made the game totally unplayable. It was unplayable even on a Galaxy S2 - a reasonably high-performance phone at the time. Once I implemented object pooling to handle the creation and destruction of these agents, the game ran very smoothly on an S2, and I could even run the smaller simulations on an old HTC Magic I had lying around.
