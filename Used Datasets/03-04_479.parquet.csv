If you find yourself in the early stages, paper prototyping is very powerful, easy and dirt cheap. By keeping it as simple as possible, you don't get so emotionally invested in your designs and you signal to your users that major changes are perfectly ok (with hi-fi prototyping users often make fewer and smaller change requests). There's a method to it but  it's as lightweight as you'd imagine. Carolyn Snyder has written THE book on paper prototyping\n<a href=""http://www.paperprototyping.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paperprototyping.com/</a><p>I mostly use Balsamiq Mockups. It's a lo-fi prototyping tool (software based) but it makes prototyping much faster. Prototypes, or mockups as they are called, are actually rendered as hand drawn sketches so you don't bother with pixel perfection. It's actually quite fun to use and becomes somewhat addictive. One drawback is that prototyping GUI changes and interactivity is difficult.\n<a href=""http://balsamiq.com/products/mockups"" rel=""nofollow"">http://balsamiq.com/products/mockups</a><p>I've also used Pencil, a prototyping plugin for firefox. It's not as polished as the other Balsamiq Mockups but it's free and covers the basics.\n<a href=""http://pencil.evolus.vn/en-US/Home.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pencil.evolus.vn/en-US/Home.aspx</a>",1314331150.0

Here are some of my thoughts...<p>> ""Give the team autonomy / ie. a virtual startup within Yahoo. Maybe split off a team or an Open Source startup ?""<p>Everyone involved with the project, from upper management on down, are all engineers, and by having Yahoo entirely fund the YUI project it allows each of us to focus on nothing but building things for our community.  If we were spun off, then we have to worry about making money, and well... I'd rather be coding.  Even as a spin-off, if Yahoo (and others?) funded us 100%, I don't think much would change compared to how we currently operate.  In my opinion, Yahoo is the best customer (and parent) a JavaScript library could ask for.<p>> ""Demand all Yahoo use latest YUI by religious edict from on high""<p>When you hear the execs publicly talk about replacing old infrastructure components, upgrading everyone from YUI2 to YUI3 was one of those things we've been working on heavily.  Flickr, Mail, and the Homepage are all on YUI 3.3.0+.  By the end of 2011, all Y! Media properties will be on a recent version as well.  That means the vast majority of the 80+ billion pageviews/month will be using a current YUI3 release.  Maybe not bleeding edge, but close enough.  YUI2 is deprecated and will only be receiving security fixes, if any ever arise.<p>> ""Consider mobile?""<p>It's very much on our minds.  It currently works great in mobile because of the efficient codebase, modular architecture, and the combohandler, but we're working on filling in some of the missing pieces. Stay tuned.<p>> ""One Unified example, or a framework / app-designer as the canonical YUI demo""<p>We had a long-discussion about that very topic today.  Now that we're on a new, self-hosted website, it opens up many possibilities for what we can do to really show off the library.",1314330640.0

124,2927205,comment,2926649.0,2926989.0,2,0,bitops,,,"It has to do with how quickly you can iterate on your production software and what the distance is (in terms of time) between a developer committing a change and that change making it out in front of an end-user.<p>In traditional enterprise software (e.g. insurance) the deployment cycles are long because the organization are large, heavily layered, and extremely resistant to change. There are many reasons for this, some sensible and some not. (And then some that are legislated - they fall into both categories).<p>For a startup that is trying to build a service, or a mid-sized corporation, particularly in the ecommerce space, the faster you can change a deployed solution, the better off you are.<p>Say you're running a large ecommerce website and a bug is discovered on the user account page. It's a ""P1 issue"" that needs immediate attention, i.e. as long as the bug exists, revenue is impacted.<p>In a situation like this, you want to be able to identify a fix, commit it, and ship it to production ASAP. This becomes an issue in traditional organizations where the ""developers"" are different from ""the network people"" who themselves are subdivided into database/network/sysadmin/etc. These groups are change-averse and tend to gate releases into maintenance windows. Which makes sense, but can hinder rapid deployment.<p>If you don't have a traditional Ops team, there's no stakeholder who feels you're impinging on their fiefdom when you wantonly hit the deploy button. (Though I don't mean to imply that you shouldn't have discipline around releases).<p>The question you're asking is very relevant for teams making the transition to processes like Agile and infrastructures like Cloud. Because these things are disruptive, they lead to change and break-down of traditional org structures. A dedicated QA department always seems to be one of the first things targeted. (Though I don't necessarily think that's a good idea).",1314327907.0

We made a slightly different mechanism for rating on the personalize page (the list of places you saw when you first came to the app allowing you to quickly rate).  Either a user can skip a place manually by clicking the X, or can scroll down to the bottom and skip all the places that you don't like.
