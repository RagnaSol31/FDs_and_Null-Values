And that use exploded thanks to any number of consumption-focused technologies along the way.<p>The use of the internet is deeply intertwined with its form -- television could never, even if we worked incredibly hard at it, have been used in the same way. The message is the medium, and the form of the technology we adapt does, in fact, matter significantly.<p>Example: we would absolutely not be having this little debate if we only had iPads. :)<p>(And not to start a side debate, but I'm deeply sceptical of the app store being all that revolutionary; almost everything I've seen is a usability-tweaked version of software that already existed on the desktop or web.

Actually, when I started reading your post I thought to myself, ""seems like this guy just finished his chapter on Perfect Competition"".<p>Even though there are benefits and differences to high capital vs low capital requirement markets, you have to look at the human aspect of it. There are failures on both sides, and probably a higher failure rate for web startups. But the  main difference is that regular people have the opportunity to actually strike it rich. High capital requirements tend to mean you need social connections to people with money. In society, this means political, industry, venture capital, and business connections. If you're the wrong race, sex, religion, or just don't fit the profile of someone who tends to be able to have access to money, you won't get it.<p>Low capital requirement markets means anyone can play; everything is more competitive, all products are higher quality. The discriminator is the market, and thats fair for all. If you take these into consideration, than you see low capital requirement markets are in fact a blessing, regardless of the economic returns of high capital markets. They are two completely different beasts.",1271214513.0

That's a pretty crummy rule; hope your business plan doesn't depend on it.<p>4) You're missing half the perspective.
