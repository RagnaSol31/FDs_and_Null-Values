How many characters would you need to uniquely identify over a million objects? log_64(1,000,000) is about 3.3. With 4 characters, you could represent over 16 million objects. If you just store all of the objects that you need to reference along with an incrementing primary key, you wouldn't have to use more than 4 characters until you had more than 16 million objects in your database.<p>Have a billion objects? That's just five characters. Still not enough? With 7 characters, you could index more than 4 trillion.<p>But let's say that you can't actually keep a single database, with an incrementing primary key. You have multiple independent processes or people generating objects that need identifiers that will always be stable, you can't rely on manually picked names, and so on. So just use a secure hash: a SHA-2 or SHA-3 hash of the objects. If you use a 256 bit secure hash (44 characters in Base64, including the padding), and had 500 octillion items in your set, you would have about one in a quintillion chance of having an accidental collision. I'll give you a hint; you are never going to have that many items in your data set.<p>Now, you might object ""what if SHA-2 is broken"". Well, that may happen, though it's fairly unlikely. Most of the ways of breaking a secure hash involve making it a few orders of magnitude easier to compute a collision. But at 256 bits, you have a substantial safety margin; it would have to be pretty thoroughly broken before anyone would be able to find meaningful collisions. Heck, Git uses SHA-1 still, which uses 160 bit hashes, and is much closer to being broken.<p>Anyhow, the point of all of this is that a URL is supposed to be an identifier. It doesn't take that many characters to create an identifier that could uniquely identify each quark in the whole universe. You absolutely don't <i>need</i> long URLs to guarantee uniqueness; if your URLs are long, it's because you're including a lot of redundant information in the URL, or you are actually trying to store a description of the object in the URL, rather than an identifier.",1357617382.0

And things are better today than they have ever been in the past for introverts: much more collaboration is done remotely.<p>> The problem with extraverts  not all of them, I grant you, but many, so many  is a lack of imagination.<p>This is ""the"" problem?  I think it more accurate to say that the author's problem with extroverts (see below) is that they want to socialize with him.  Socialization is mentally good for most people, including most introverts.<p>Honestly, the three paragraphs starting here make me wonder if he has something deeper than simple introversion.  I mean, it's fine to prefer to be alone, but it's less fine to feel fear about standard social interactions.  If he does the latter, that's kind of a problem to my mind.<p>(A problem, by the way, that I deal with.  I force myself to go to get-togethers with more than about five people.  I'll be upset about it as the get-together looms, but I almost always enjoy it once I'm there.)<p>> So, extraverts of the world, I invite you to make a New Years resolution: Refrain from organizing stuff.<p>Oof.  He's asking the majority of the people of the world to change their (generally healthy) habits for his benefit.<p>Humans are built for socialization.  Socialization is a mentally positive activity for most people, and most people crave it.<p>> extrovert is common but wrong, because extra- is the proper Latin prefix.<p>extra- being the proper Latin prefix does not imply ""extrovert"" is wrong.

76,5024720,comment,5024632.0,5024632.0,4,0,FreeKill,,,"Interesting article. One of the biggest benefits I noticed, when I first started doing contract work remotely, was that I absolutely did not miss meetings. Previously, I had been working for a fairly large corporation and I switched to contracting to do my old job. Without the forced meetings, I was much more productive overall. 99% of the time, the outcome of a meeting was just as easily accomplished via a well thought out email or a quick chat session.<p>Even better, I noticed that meetings forced people to change their behaviour. They would ""work to the meetings"" meaning they would orient their efforts in order to be able to contribute in the meeting. Sometimes that meant holding back good ideas till the meeting and other times it meant working specifically on an area just to show it off in a meeting. I think this has a lot to do with the extrovert/introvert argument. The introverts in the office were already worried about the meeting itself so they had to over prepare in order to not be anxious about it. This was a totally foreign concept to the more extroverted in the office.<p>I personally think the majority of meetings helped management types feel more connected with what's going on, especially if they were mostly disconnected the rest of the time, and for the people involved they ended up being almost always just a waste of time.",1357615778.0

The thread is dead effectively for a while anyway now.<p>The way i see it, a minimum expectation (for 'universal' coverage scenarios) is: windows, iOS, android. Perhaps OSX too. There are cross platform solutions for the desktop, but that would still require 2 extra versions to cover the minimum standard. Soon you might be able to do iOS with Eto, but until it gets android support that would mean you still need to implement the mobile UI twice and port the backend code at least once (a feat that i thought was harder when i started than i do now; but maintenance would still be hell).<p>So you might lead to the idea of doing a cross-desktop app and a webapp with phonegap etc for mobile. This allows you to support more platforms (WP7/8, FFOS, BBx, ubuntuPhone?). Tablets are going to want a more in-depth UI than a phone, so then you have 2 layouts.<p>By the time you have a flexible layout system, adding a third may even sound preferable to porting everything to .NET, even if you are familiar with it! Yes you want extra features such as keyboard/mouse support, and more in-depth editing etc, but you <i>do</i> get the nice bonus that your android app will have those too (benefiting stuff like the transformer prime), as well as keeping all touch function on the desktop where touchscreens are taking off-- that probably wouldn't seem worth adding if it were a separate desktop app (same for smaller window-sizes). It's very reassuring to know that almost any feature implemented should work across all platforms. You could even extend a basic version for PS3, wii, TVs, chromeOS etc without too much trouble.<p>There are definitely shortfalls; lack of code privacy, still some browser issues on the mobile side (scrolling?), the DOM sucks, localStorage is tiny, etc! Phone processing improvements are fast whittling away at performance as an issue for many types of basic app though. IMO neither method (HTML vs 'native') are there yet, and different apps will suit each approach. To me cross-mobile/desktop apps are the future, although i concede that it isn't practical (or possible) for a lot of use cases today.",1357614760.0

To make things more entertaining, Prof. Daniel Jackson asked Guy Steele to get up and talk about the new features in Java 1.4, and discuss when generics in java.util would be fully supported.

We're putting together a couple graphical summaries to try for profiles, as well as exposing keywords on search results soon. I think you're absolutely right about result trustworthiness and backing up why something is relevant in a meaningful way.<p>I'd love to include results from philosophy and related fields, but we just don't have data sources for them yet. Right now, I think we need to do a better job hammering in that the data we've indexed is in the computer and information science arena. We don't have the resources of all the other players in the field, so I think a niche strategy is important. Are there any particularly great repositories for bibliographic or full-text data in philosophy?<p>On Judea Pearl- you're right, we messed up! Do consider, though, that he's claimed his Google Scholar Citations profile. We've done all of our profile inference automatically. Sometimes that leads to a bunch of author pages that need to be merged, like in Pearl's case- we have all his papers, but didn't know they were written by the same real-world person, so they're fragmented (<a href=""http://scholr.ly/results/?q=judea+pearl&x=0&y=0&page=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholr.ly/results/?q=judea+pearl&x=0&y=0&...</a>). Other times, we have more complete profiles than Google, because many academics don't claim their Google Scholar Citations profiles.<p>It's an ongoing concern, so we'll be spending a bunch of time on this problem (called entity disambiguation in the lit) as well as upgrading venues, publishers, etc to clickable first-class citizens before our next major release.<p>Thanks so much for your feedback- hopefully I'll be able to post again soon with improvements.",1357614432.0

134,5024661,story,,,6,3,runeks,How long will it take for MRAM to be used instead of DRAM?,,"So after Everspin has successfully produced MRAM on a standard 90 nm process, I'm starting to wonder how long it will take for it to decline enough in price for it to be a viable replacement for/addition to DRAM. I found this[1] chart on the price of flash storage, and according to this chart a 100-fold decrease in price took place in about 5 years. According to this guy from Everspin[2] the current cost of their MRAM is 100 times higher than DRAM.<p>Do you think it's realistic that it will happen this fast - or faster - with MRAM?<p>I'm pretty excited about MRAM. I mean, think about how awesome it is to not worry about a machine losing its RAM content after being turned off. It's especially useful in mobile devices, since they don't need to refresh RAM content in standby mode.<p>[1] https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bTMlHXSMEJHhgkUksSCTu1uupNMVZkgl-5C2vOg-8dsX5oX2Tc2WdPeozlUdWKmQpMZ7xX5sBbw8FDn_kZq42NtzO-E7Gwjj065JRXC3ZH-cCsjmOt8\n[2] http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=qjp9cC9dao0",
