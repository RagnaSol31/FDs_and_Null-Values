The integrals you describe are remarkably similar to a large variety of solutions we employ for area estimation and integration in general. For example, in a path-tracing paradigm, I would (naively probably) consider radiation beam collimation similar to what we call the &quot;cone-angle&quot; of a particular integration method, particularly WRT calculating illumination response for a given surface, etc. Can you describe in more detail what kind of calculations your treatment planning software does? It sounds fascinatingly similar to the advanced physically based rendering algorithms that are in common use in computer graphics these days. For example, I am guessing that radiation &quot;fields&quot; are akin to &quot;light sources&quot;? If so, I would guess that your planning software is doing all sorts of importance sampling of all these sources across a given domain. Anyway, I was an art major so all my jargon is probably off, but nevertheless I find your post fascinating.",1432870618.0

It is exactly the same thing, replace await with yield/yield-star.
