No other language has that, you can not even rely on a recent version of your runtime being available on a given platform.

42,4897385,comment,4876226.0,4881728.0,1,0,hatcravat,,,"Well, you're right: It is 2012, and there are (at the time of writing) all of 6 supercharger stations, which can fill a battery at up to 120 kW.  The current incarnation (heh) of the Tesla S battery limits the rate to about 80 kW for the first 50%, or so.<p>However, there are probably more places to plug in than you'd expect.  For example, there are tons of RV parks all around the country, many of which have NEMA 14-50 sockets for grandma and grandpa to plug their big camper into.  Those sockets can deliver about 10 kW.  Then there are electric clothes dryers, found in many homes: They typically use a 240V, 30A circuit, which can deliver about 5 kW continuously.<p>That last option isn't really practical on the freeway, but how far do you plan to drive to hang out with friends for half an hour?  Let's say you drive a couple hours and stay for the afternoon: Their dryer socket will refill almost half of a Tesla's battery for the grand sum of $5--that'll be enough to get you home (there are practical problems with the approach, but it's not a bad 0th-order approximation).  Are your friends so worried about electricity that they wouldn't accept a 6-pack of their favorite brew in exchange for a power outlet?<p>Electric car owners who frequent online forums report that hotels are very reasonable about charging, and some even install free-to-use chargers as a value-add to attract customers.  In the long term, if electric car adoption increases, hotels will obviously either need to add a surcharge or raise room rates.  But, even if a hotel did sell electricity at a 100% markup, the customer's energy cost for driving a mile on electricity would still be less than half the cost on gasoline.<p>Certainly, electric cars won't work for all trips, and the infrastructure needed to move electrons from the grid to the car is missing in many places.  On the other hand, equipment for 10 kW charging (that's a charge rate of about 30 miles per hour) can be installed almost anywhere in the continental United States for between a few hundred and couple thousand dollars (and in many places it already exists).  For new construction, before landscaping is installed and where a right-size breaker panel can be installed in the first place, the cost of installing 240V, 50A service in the garage is almost inconsequential.",1355111093.0

I certainly would not have ever thought it to be perceived lower than many african countries. Is it really that much crazier there then other south/central american countries?,1355108904.0
