It looks to me like the list of sections that survive the termination of the agreement doesn't include section 3, which is the actual cross-licensing section. I'm not a lawyer, though, so please point me to the section that has that effect.<p>Even if the agreement <i>does</i> stipulate that AMD's patent license to Intel becomes perpetual upon termination due to change of control, I really doubt that it is legal in the US, since it basically means that a third party can't buy their way in to the market unless they bribe both AMD and Intel to weaken the duopoly.

There are a bunch of probably-apocryphal stories about Thales; for example, it's said that he once was gazing so intently at the stars that he failed to look where he was walking, and fell into a well.<p>For this and other similar incidents, Thales was ridiculed by some of his fellow Milesians, who felt he never did anything productive. So, using his observations of the weather as a guide, he predicted an unusually good season and bought up all of the island's olive presses, making a fortune when the harvest came. Having proved his point, he went back to the things which actually interested him.",1287719803.0

For reasons good and bad, Academia can't keep up with Moore's Law.<p>First, you don't want to build a major for every new technology; the half life of most technologies is very short. Second, sifting the cruft from the stuff that will outlive the specific technology (think personal updates vs. friendster -> myspace -> facebook -> twitter) is difficult.<p>So you end up with a compromise: A school of thought that teaches (or tries to) timeless principles of interaction. This is an incredible advancement in education, but unfortunately means less to someone looking for employment right out of college.<p>The problem is that UI and UX are a mix of science -- something taught at universities and colleges -- and what is traditionally relegated to vocational schools. It's not an applied science; it's more like being a mechanic or someone who makes those really fancy import cars even fancier.<p>The solution, I think, is going to be a long way off; universities will have to hire people that teach more about the history of design, what people are accustomed to and expect, what interfaces work and why and how to design for people whose aesthetic changes once every couple years. Art schools will have to hire hardcore CS people to teach rock solid foundations of logic, how languages work, etc etc...",1287719789.0

12,1818511,comment,1818341.0,1818341.0,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"This was a good article, but only covered the more superficial best practices concerning formatting. The more important best practices include things like, you don't need to save an object to test its validity. I see this a lot:<p><pre><code>  it ""returns no errors for a valid object"" do\n    @object.save\n    @object.errors.size.should == 0\n  end\n</code></pre>\nThis doesn't scale well and will cause your specs to run painfully slow when your project gets bigger, as the spec will hit the database every time it's run. Instead, do this:<p><pre><code>  it ""returns no errors for a valid object"" do\n    @object.valid?\n    @object.errors.size.should == 0\n  end\n</code></pre>\nOr even better:<p><pre><code>  it ""returns no errors for a valid object"" do\n    @object.should be_valid\n  end\n</code></pre>\nNeither of these actually hit the database, so the entire thing is run in-memory. And this is just one example of functional RSpec best practices. Don't get me wrong, the formatting stuff definitely helps readability across the team, but if your specs are testing the wrong thing, or running slowly, the formatting doesn't matter.",1287719643.0

Regarding links to the systems- the only one that was ever publicly accessible was for a Facebook app that I wrote some years back that was let researchers post links to their publications on their profiles, and also featured a recommendation system to find other users of the app that had ""similar"" publications. It's unfortunately fallen into a pretty sorry state of disrepair, as I haven't had any time to devote to maintenance in more than two years and Facebook's APIs have changed quite a bit since then. I described the underlying system a little bit in a conference paper: <a href=""http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18999247"" rel=""nofollow"">http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18999247</a><p>The other systems I've used the approach for have all been along either bibliometric/bibliographic lines, or have been relating to content-based image retrieval.

SIAM Review (1995) vol. 37 (4) pp. 573-595<p>The SVD approach falls in the same family as Latent Semantic Analysis, which is a whole black art unto itself- I'd actually suggest going back to the early papers by Landauer, Dumais, etc. if you're really interested- those guys did a great job writing up what was at the time really novel stuff.<p>My contact info should be in my profile, drop me an email if you have any more questions (or to let me know what you end up doing!).",1287719202.0

It's an entrepreneurial myth that there is a mighty ""launch"" that sets the tone of your business. When was Twitter ""launched""? When was Carbonmade ""launched""? When was Balsamiq ""launched""? Or SquareSpace, MailChimp, or Fog Creek? Sure, they ""launched"", but who cared?<p>You are building a business. It does not spring from your forehead like Athena, or get pooped out of your pet Nibbler like Dark Matter on Futurama. Listen to what everyone else here has to say. Sure, pick something with favorable long-tail SEO dynamics. Sure, pick something with a viral loop. Sure, build yourself a tribe.<p>But then, for god's sake, pick something you can stick with, nurture, protect, and grow over the long run. That thing you don't have, that you keep calling ""a fucking great idea""? Most of us call it ""a winning lottery ticket"". Stop thinking about playing the lottery. Get back to work.",1287716572.0
