The rest of the city is about as clean as any big city in the US. There's nothing particularly dirty about the Sunset, Richmond, Pac Heights, Cole Valley, Parnassus, Diamond Heights, West Portal, Forrest Hill, Russian Hill, Glen Park, or the other neighborhoods that make up most of San Francisco.<p>In contrast, I now live in NYC and while there are no distinct ""human poo"" neighborhoods as there are in SF, the entire city is covered with a layer of grime and garbage from Manhattan all the way out to the furthest stops in Brooklyn and Queens. This was simply not the case where I lived in SF, on top of 17th street.<p>The same applies to the weather. Anyone who thinks SF has great weather has never spent much time west of Twin Peaks. It is foggy and cold most of the time.",1288843086.0

I've visited SF and the valley many times, and moved to Boulder from the midwest 4 years ago.<p>A couple of his cons are way out of left field though:<p>The weather: Its never been 10 below in the 4 years I've been here, and only been below zero or single digits at night. Only about one or two days in each of the winter months is it cold, and there's as many winter days with highs in the 60s as there are days below freezing. It's very rarely cold more than a couple days in a row, unlike the midwest winters I'm used to where it won't get above 40 for a month. It'll snow 20"" here, and be completely melted 3 days later.

Sometimes a person's value to the team is less quantifiable on paper than someone else's, but that doesn't mean it's intangible. It's usually quite tangible, and if everyone notices it (or the reverse), that's usually a good sign of the person's value-add. Not everyone is going to be the tireless codebot on the team, but that doesn't mean everyone isn't playing a critical role (Joel Spolsky obviously goes on at great lengths about this). Consensus-style reviews would probably arrive at a fair assessment of such value a lot more readily than individual writeups would.<p>Also, a lot of people make critical contributions that just don't get noticed by the team lead because those contributions -- moral support, culture, taking time away from one's own work to assist others -- aren't boss-facing.

That way, you minimize the time from you are first in line until you are checked out.<p>Consider the problem of optimizing the response time of a set of servers. Load balancing - keeping the hardware busy - will keep the request queues at roughly equal and therefore minimize the maximum queue length. That ensures that the hardware is as busy as possible, but you can improve on that.<p>When a new request arrives, you can either add all of that request to <i>one</i> queue, or you can split it into pieces and distribute those across all the queues. Distributing the request, assuming perfect load balancing, means the latency for that request will be <i>k</i> + 1/<i>n</i> instead of <i>k + 1</i>, where <i>k</i> is the length of the queue.<p>In other words: Parallelizing gets you a <i>substantial</i> improvement in response time without additional hardware, and without making the code run any faster. I didn't realize the implications of this until recently.",1288839790.0

I'd be interested in seeing the effect of the (to me intuitively superior) one line, many cashiers setup, like at Fry's.  I realize supermarkets make a boatload of cash from the geegaws sold in line that you hounded your parents into buying you as a kid, but I can't help but think that the many lines/many cashiers setup is less an optimal setup and more an artifact of some Lionel Hutz type who sold the cabal of Evil Grocery Barons a bag of magic beans in the 1960's.<p>As usual, I am too lazy to go look it up for myself.

Say school has no vacations so they used to get 52 sales a year, in which of course the clubs with a precedent of needing more money took precedence. Now say they now get 104, or hell... 156 sales a year because of the change in rules. Let's say that clubs that needed money took 80% of the days (this not changing in the worst case scenario), leaving 10 or 11 days for the rest of the clubs before, the remaining sales for this other clubs increases to 21 or 32 respectively.<p>The only way that the chess club was going to take away sales from the other clubs is if their percentage of sales increases, and even then it would have to increase beyond a threshold where it started eating up the extra days beyond the original sales the other clubs where having.<p>Sure it could be the case that other clubs where missing out, but it is <i>very much</i> more probable that everyone was benefiting from the chess club 'hack'.<p>Besides, you could argue that if your club does nothing to take at least some advantage of the relaxed rules it's the other clubs' fault, not the chess club's. In the end the clubs profited, the members profited, and the businesses that provided the food profited. This is a good compromise if X club didn't get much benefits after all.",1288839663.0

Relatedly, does the grocery store care about deadweight loss for the customer?<p>If every grocery store in town has the same expected line length, then the entire cost of line length is borne by the consumer---since the line lengths are in equilibrium, none of the stores feel economic pressure to reduce their line length, and the line length is a fixed cost of food shopping (unless latency becomes comparable with the length of time a store is open during the day, in which case it's actually limiting the number of customers they can process per day, but I find this highly unlikely).<p>Granted, a store might try to differentiate itself by reducing its average line length, but there are many other (perhaps more important) factors that go into a consumer's choice regarding grocery stores, e.g., Wal-Mart mega-food-store competes on prices, Whole Foods competes on its customers' self-satisfaction (I kid, I love Whole Foods).<p>Intuitively, it feels like grocery store line length is in the noise when considering the decision process for most consumers, especially since I can get zero line length at almost any store by going during off-hours. If it's in the noise, there's no selection pressure to improve it.",1288839621.0
