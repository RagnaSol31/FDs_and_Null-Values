Suggestion:  \nGet a board of advisors who \nhave had a lot of experience \nmanaging research, and let them\noccasionally advise you on\nopportunities and pit falls.<p>I got an applied math Ph.D.,\njust to improve the good\ncareer I already had going in\napplied math and computing,\nhad no intention of being a\nprofessor, but for a while,\nhaving to do with my wife in\nher long illness, I was a professor.<p>The biggest problem I had in research\nwas just getting the mathematical\nword processing done.  The typing\nwas much more difficult than the\nresearch!  I published some papers\nin some good journals and never\nhad a paper rejected or needing\nsignificant revision.  I could\nhave done a lot more in research,\nbut I was really interested just\nin making money.<p>For research in academics, that is,\nthe STEM fields, I have long \nhad a suggestion:  Borrow from \nresearch in medicine!<p>Why, how,\nin what respects?  Sure:  Research\nin medicine also has a clinical\nside, and a lot of the research,\napplied research intended to \nconnect with applications, very\nmuch needs the clinical side.<p>E.g., instead of all the seminars\nbeing professors and students presenting\nsolutions still looking for \napplications, have about half the\nseminars with people \nfrom the <i>real world</i> outside\nacademics present problems\nlooking for solutions.\nHave professors\nwith their students attack such\nproblems.  That way could\nget some problems to work on,\nsimple, medium, and really \ndifficult and important, e.g.,\nP versus NP just from \napplications of optimization\nto, say, vehicle scheduling\nor communications network\ndesign.  E.g., I was working\non something applied and\nrediscovered k-D trees --\na few years earlier and I\nwould have been the inventor\nof k-D trees.  And there are\nother examples of starting\nwith a real problem from the\nreal world and getting good\nresults for that problem,\ngetting a good research problem,\nand getting some good research\nprogress.<p>Besides, such research already\nhas one application and, thus,\nis much more likely to have\ntwo or many more than two.<p>Have an expectation that a professor\npursuing applications is a \nprofessional and needs to practice\ntheir profession.  And the students\nneed to be there also as apprentices.<p>Also, have codes of ethics,\nstandards on how revenue is to\nbe distributed, and professional\npeer review of the clinical\npractice.<p>For more, it would help if the\nventure capital community were\nready, willing, and able to\nevaluate original research\nintended as the crucial core\nof startups.",1444276626.0
