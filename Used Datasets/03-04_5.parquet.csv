I personally don't use that for anything but very major searches(google, ebay, occasionally wikipedia). what if you  used that bar to point to a sales special or something that can drive revenue or would be really appealing to users.",1194580438.0

4,77794,comment,77679.0,77679.0,0,0,natrius,,,"Instead of having that huge arrow to get people to install the OpenSearch plugin (or at least in addition to the arrow), you should use OpenSearch autodiscovery. When you go to a site with autodiscovery implemented, the logo box of the search bar glows blue. Go to Wikipedia and look at your search bar to get an idea of what happens.<p>Most users probably either don't notice or don't know what the blue glow means, so I can understand keeping the arrow, but you might as well add the autodiscovery too. Someone might do something nifty someday by crawling the web and scraping those autodiscovery links to build some sort of meta-search engine... that still wouldn't be as useful as Google, but it'd still be nifty.<p><a href=""http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1",

7,77790,comment,77651.0,77668.0,0,0,mrtron,,,"I find most of my general theories from when I was young were generally quite good, but slightly naive.  My father was a mechanic, and I always wondered why cars didn't have generators used for braking.  Regenerative braking became a great idea for cars powered by an electric motor, not so useful for gasoline powered cars.  I thought about what it would be like to live forever, and I figured you would go through every possibility of an ever growing world.  This is not so different from what I later learned about quantum physics.",1194579684.0

I'm currently working on a startup similar to this, based around the groups who were not accepted by ycombinator. A place to demo your startup, get feedback, and find co-founders. Also to find a place to stay if the group is planning on moving to SV, or anywhere for that matter. There are a few other features I'm currently implementing also. Overall, its just a place to keep each other motivated and help one another out. Nothing putting down ycombinator, but just a place to connect and share. I was going to have it up and running this week, however, I've been low on time lately. I should have something within the next week or two though.",1194579606.0

10,77787,comment,77651.0,77651.0,0,0,queensnake,,,"There are two books on this, the better one was 'The Wisdom Paradox' (my bad! correction from earlier version of this comment), the less good, slower, less medical + informative was 'The Mature Mind'. IIRC from reviews (I only got 1/4 way through the first book), the theory is, that the right brain starts being used more (and it's been fed longer, now) so that, as you age, while you're maybe less 'whip smart', you have 10,000 shortcuts and indeed as you say, you see the bigger picture better. <p>Ugh - actually I couldn't swear the one that impressed me as 'sharper' was the first, I believe so though. I could use some of my old 'whip smarts', such as they were :(. ",1194579334.0
11,77786,comment,77679.0,77763.0,0,0,tjic,,,"Pretty much.<p>SmartFlix is profitable, but it has debt.<p>All of the salaries, rent, startup inventory, consultant fees, trademark fees, legal fees, etc. for HeavyInk were payed for by profits from SmartFlix.<p>That said, SmartFlix itself has debt.  Why?  Because it's really capital intensive.  If a given DVD rents out once every 60 days, and we make $4 in profit on a rental, and the DVD costs $60, then an upfront investment of $60 breaks even two years later.  So: SmartFlix has incurred a bit of debt (half of it real debt owed to banks and other small lendors, and half of it paper debt, in the form of promissory notes to engineers who were on half salary for six months, etc.).<p>The capital intensive nature of SmartFlix was fine, but it means that it's hard to grow past a certain size - in the absence of VCs rushing to give us $1 or $5 million (and, frankly, they're right not to - SmartFlix isn't going to have the return that they're looking for), then growth slows to the rate at which we can purchase inventory with profits.<p>...which is one of the reasons that we looked for a second startup idea that leveraged a lot of our core competencies (ecommerce, fulfillment, datamining, etc.) but did not require nearly as much cash tied up in inventory.",1194578865.0

17,77780,comment,77679.0,77679.0,0,0,ALee,,,"You're in a pretty cool area. Like I said from a previous post though, I would suggest that you either talk to the guys from ComicVine (to see what they did wrong- they're now working on a another startup even though ComicVine is doing fabulously well) or figure out a way to beat them (I would suggest cribbing the stuff you like from them and then just making it better).. <p>As someone who read too many comic books when young, the digital comic phenomenon is really gaining serious steam. If you could let people upload their fan drawings and do licensing with the major publishers, you could really get a better in. Comicvine did not have that and as a result was never approached by Marvel or DC to acquire (the two companies just were pissed).",1194578203.0

Under the second subheading they say,<p>""Salesforce was born in March 1999 in cramped, adjoining apartments atop San Francisco's picturesque Telegraph Hill. Benioff, still employed at Oracle, lived in a condo. Fellow co-founders Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff and Frank Dominguez set up shop next door. Computer cables ran between the apartments through windows. 'It was the Gold Rush era for tech start-ups then,' Harris recalls.""<p>And if you Google on Parker Harris at least, you can find him described as a co-founder.<p>By the way, SAIC is an interesting one.  The main guy founded it with ""a handful of scientists"" and one page describes someone as a ""Vice Co-Founder"" of SAIC.  ""Vice co-founder!""  That's harsh.",1194577866.0
