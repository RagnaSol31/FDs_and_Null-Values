Arms race is a good analogy for virus-makers and antivirus software, since their goals are exact opposites.<p>The goal of analytics sites like KISSmetrics is to measure and understand the behavior of their customers as a group, not as specific individuals.  The goal of people who wish to remain untracked is to avoid having personally identifiable information about them stored without their consent.

At the time, I thought it was to be so.</i><p>No, whether you like to <i>hear</i> it or not (which you clearly are a person who does not want to hear it) you lied.[1]  There is no other noun/verb in the English language to describe the act of telling a false statement.<p>Naturally, telling a false statement with intention to deceive is morally unethical, whereas just being the bringer of false statements is not.  I think that's where you and everyone else gets hung up on the word ""lie"" because you firmly attach the notion of intent to the word.  That is not the case with every lie, and if I need to reference the dictionary to show that you are wrong then so be it.  It is just often the case that a lie said with intent to deceive, but it by no means is the rule.<p>If people would work as hard to remove the negative connotation around the word rather than trying to do mental gymnastics to get out of being labelled with it we would all be more honest and better off.  We all lie sometime, after all, but what we can always avoid is intention of deceit.  Doing some mental gymnastics to try and avoid being labelled a liar actually, in itself, makes you deceitful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lie</a>",1311997574

Your metaphor doesn't seem particularly solid to me; it would be more accurate to say that DNA is source code, proteins (and hence enzymes) are object code, and mRNA is code that has been pulled out from disk (the genome), had its comments (introns, as you point out) removed, but is not yet compiled. The computing metaphor obviously breaks down; the best way to characterize cDNA I can think of is as code that's been intercepted on its way to the compiler and placed back into storage - for it to be reverse-engineered object code, it would need to be derived from proteins, which it is not.",1311997380
