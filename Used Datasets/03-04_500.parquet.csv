There are other other photo editing programs (gimp has actually gotten pretty good at this point), however there is a significant cost to re-learn how to use the new program. This cost to learn effectivly creates a lock-in effect, where the cost of Photoshop is cheaper than the cost of learning something different.<p>Additionally, Photoshop does not have ongoing costs with pirates. Whereas a web service needs to maintain the servers for the free users. And because Photoshop is pirated, the do not have an expectation of customer support.",1372564629.0

Some time after that my postgres database exceded the free tier limit and the only option was to pay $20/mo for a shared postgres DB that was way beyond my needs.<p>I went from an extremely modest website costing nothing, to an extremely modest website costing over $20 per month.<p>I switched all of my projects over to an EC2 instance and pay about 15 bucks with no arbitrary limitations.<p>I hope the new CEO understands that building a healthy customer base means giving people a sensible path for growth.",1372564287.0
