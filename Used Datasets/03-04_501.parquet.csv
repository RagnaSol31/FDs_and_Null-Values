I'd love to see some performance benchmarks.<p>As for Objective-C, whether the language in and of itself is the source of the slowness I was talking about is somewhat beside the point, IMHO.  I'm aware that laying out views in Cocoa involves a lot of overhead, and that it's as much to do with the complexity of what's going on under the hood as anything.  The fact of the matter remains though that you take a performance hit when laying out non-trivial views that need to be updated as fast as possible (e.g. when a table view scrolls by even one pixel and all the views have to be redrawn).  You could probably convince me that Objective-C isn't the reason this is the case, but in any event, when you find the need to drop down into direct drawing API calls in order to get the performance you need, the ""not much"" overhead you're talking about can become much more noticeable.  In a tight loop, a factor of 2 can make a huge difference, even though ""2x slower than C"" would be an enviable benchmark for many languages.<p>Again, I'm certainly not denigrating Ruby or other languages, but to me, that aspect of iOS development is a reminder that one needs to choose tools carefully for the job at hand.  Hence my hesitation at the announcement of alternative toolkits for iOS apps, the vast majority of which I have yet to see any stellar examples of.  Here's hoping this will break the mold.",1336103922.0

When one takes into consideration that the low-end, but current-generation iPhone and a new Android phone cost about the same it adds insult to injury.<p>I bought a Nexus One (this is an HTC phone, to be clear), and liked where things were going.  Just shy of two years later, support was dropped.  Then, my power button encountered a common fault, and I would have to mail the  thing in to fix it, paying some indeterminate amount of money (but probably around $50, I gather), as well as being out a phone for a couple of weeks.<p>It so happens I managed to acquire a Nexus S, but I would never have paid market rate, and the direction and velocity the both the built-in applications and the greater ecosystem has taken since then have left me with a very sour impression, even though there are features on Android that I very much like.<p>Basically, I can't justify paying more than $300 for a current-gen Android device, or roughly half that of an iPhone.  After all, in all but the most rare cases, your length of support from the manufacturer is less than half as long...<p>All told, I've been an Android user for three or four years  on the flagship devices starting with a G1, and since about a year ago I would have to say that my pessimism is basically monotonically increasing.",1336103357.0

If I see the source code for an application and then write my own application that doesn't share code, but does share the overall structure and makes the same design choices, there's an argument that I plagiarised the original software just as much as if I took a novel and rewrote the same story in my own words.<p>That doesn't seem to be true of an API. A program is the embodiment of an idea, ie an expression - the same program can usually be written in a myriad of ways.

An API may require significant design, but design is usually protected by patent law rather than copyright law.<p>So really the case hinges on whether an API is an expression or merely an idea.

The trouble with scoring based on Levenshtein distance in that case is that it improperly penalizes phrases that are significantly different in length but similar in content.<p>For example, let's say I was searching a database of countries for ""North Korea"". In my list I have:<p>South Africa (LD: 6)\nCongo (LD: 9)\nRepublic of Korea (LD: 11)\n...\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea (LD: 28)<p>The actual answer (DPRK) will be pushed far to the bottom based on a naive ranking that uses LD.<p>The hack that's worked best for me? Rank based on the number of common two-character substrings between the source and target. It's simple, easy to build an index for, and has surprisingly great results. Its ideal use case is if you don't need to return a single absolute best result and can, say, present the three best to a human being and let them pick the match.<p>For the above search I'd get the following results using the two-character method:<p>Republic of Korea: 4\nDPRK: 4\nSouth Africa: 1\nCongo: 0",1336100631.0

The volume buttons are still directly opposite the power button (and thus far too easy to accidentally press). No ringer switch. The bezel is a bit smaller, but not enough so to be interesting, and the screen is PenTile. No Cortex A15 CPU.<p>Bright spots seem to be a GPU that can finally compete with what Apple's shipping, and some imagination put into hardware/software features like the eye tracking and proximity-sensor-triggered calling, though TouchWiz is probably still a net loss.",1336100615.0

However I can't help but feel the much less impressive other answer ""Use Levenshtein distance, here is the link."" (paraphrased) is the better answer.<p>The long-winded answer goes in to a huge amount of details on really interesting pattern matching problems... but not really the specific problem mentioned by the question asker.<p>I'm glad for a world with Stack Overflow and other similar resources, because I find the long answer fascinating but if I were asking the question I'd much prefer also having access to the shorter, succinct, and also-correct answer beneath it.",1336100544.0
