People delay writing up their research (so we hear!), repeatedly declare they will start their diets tomorrow, or postpone until next week doing odd jobs around the house. Yet people also sometimes attempt to control their procrastination by setting deadlines for themselves. In this article, we pose three questions: (a) Are people willing to self-impose meaningful (i.e., costly) deadlines to overcome procrastination? (b) Are self-imposed deadlines effective in improving task performance? (c) When self-imposing deadlines, do people set them optimally, for maximum performance enhancement? A set of studies examined these issues experimentally, showing that the answer is yes to the first two questions, and nO' to the third. People have self-control problems, they recognize them, and they try to control them by self-imposing costly deadlines. <i>These deadlines help people control procrastination, but they are not as effective as some externally imposed deadlines in improving task performance.</i>",1350532077.0

So if we accept that, then it seems unlikely he would intentionally allow the team to spread falsehood knowingly (especially if it's so easily refuted).<p>FWIW, I think Meteor is cool for certain camps and projects, but I also really like the 'pick and choose' NPM-friendly style of node development (in fact my personal preference at the moment is for an open modular ecosystem vs a monolithic framework with plenty of magic), so it's not like I have any particular emotional investment in saying this, other than to correct the record.<p>So in conclusion, this does not seem like a totally fair assessment of the author.<p>(And yes I realized you mentioned no-one by name, but a project website cannot 'lie'.
