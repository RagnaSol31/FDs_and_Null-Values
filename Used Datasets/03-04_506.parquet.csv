I <i>very</i> frequently find myself drawing on knowledge that I ran across during internet time-wasting, whether it was a relevant article I found on HN, or a Wikipedia article I found in one of those random-walk-through-link sessions (or the journal articles I found via the Wikipedia articles...). On the other hand, I also spend a lot of time ""keeping up with the internet"", so it's not free. But it's certainly shown up in papers I've published in my day job.<p>It's an interesting tradeoff; I'd say I'm less concentrated and diligent than most of my colleagues on what I'm ""supposed to be doing"", but I'm also more broadly aware of what's going on outside of our little academic bubble. They get more done on their main projects, but I'm the person to come to if you want to be pointed to relevant articles/libraries/demos/posts on $topic_foo.

The unofficial mobile browsers have great JavaScript too.

The point is that Salman Rushdie is a highly controversial figure and I bet this is not the first time someone has tried to create an account with that name. If FB didn't block folks from doing this, Rushdie would be complaining how FB never checks on reals vs. fakes. The point is, FB is trying to maintain the integrity of it's data, and people like Rushdie are often attacked for their opinions and are a target of those who disagree with them.",1321326224.0
