Experienced ones don't care about php, they have commercial projects in there.<p>> Plus, a lot of designers are already spending their time working for free anyway. If you dont believe me, just look at the number of Instagram redesigns or iTunes icons on Dribbble.<p>Hey, let's try to find a programmer who will code your website for free. Lots of them do stuff for free anyway, just look on github and bitbucket.<p>Now seriously (I am aware there are a lot of generalizations in there, but I think they are not far from the most common):<p>The thing is, just like coders publish opensource, designers publish icons and redux because it's their cause, their branch, their market. And just like you wouldn't code a random designer's project while publishing lots of libraries for other programmers, he won't design yours while publishing fonts and icons elswhere to prove something.<p>Second, while programming in commitee works (in general), webdesign by commitee doesn't and always results in crap. And experienced designers have the 'my way or the highway' approach anyway.<p>Third, most designers just don't get opensource quite well, while most opensource gurus just don't get design quite well. The former ones don't feel why they should do it, the latter ones don't feel the need to make use of the ones who would even if they are there.<p>If a designer finds a programmer who will work for free, 99% chance he's very unexperienced. The same comes to getting a designer for free.<p>ps. let's see how the Django redesign works out <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups",

Keyless operations are more of a gray area of policy rather than security. For example, should hashing require TLS? I think not, since there are non-crypto-but-still-useful applications of cryptographic hashes and random numbers (eg: name-based or PRNG-based UUIDs as described in RFC 4122). However, splitting the interface into TLS and HTTP segments is something that has its own issues.<p>It's possible that a compromise might be the ""Secure Cookie"" equivalent of specifying policy (HTTPS-only) when creating or importing keys, but I hope it doesn't come to that.<p>That said, I'm also a big proponent of requiring some sort of sane CSP settings to also narrow the scope of the API usage ( <a href=""http://www.w3.org/2012/webcrypto/track/issues/21"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/2012/webcrypto/track/issues/21</a> ), but that remains an open issue.",1348199199.0

Just because Greenspan finds Facebook distasteful, does that mean Mark Zuckerberg and those who work at Facebook are wrong to do so, or wrong to find pleasure and satisfaction in their work - or that those who use and enjoy the site and its services are fools? Facebook breaks no laws, and the terms of our society clearly stipulate that, provided we recognise the law, we are free to choose what we value and the paths we follow. We all have our own definitions of value, and clearly many people find Facebook both useful and a source of pleasure in their lives.

If they are accidentally exposed, it's likely that the key is also exposed, so you gain little. You can't hide the key because you need to use it to e.g. authenticate people logging in.<p>It's a bit like a business keeping all of their cash in a safe to protect it, but because they have so many people who need to access the safe, they basically have to write the combination on the door.<p>Hashing passwords is like a sealed black box where you can go up to it and say, ""Bob is here and claims his password is X, is that right?"" and the box will give you a yes or no, but it's extremely difficult to crack it open and get at the actual passwords. Much more secure than the safe, which really does little in this case.",1348197067.0
