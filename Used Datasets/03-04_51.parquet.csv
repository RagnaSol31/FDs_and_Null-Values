Therefore somehow science is a kind of foundation.<p>In reality the relation is quiet symbiotic... Both fields depend on each other and stretch human ingenuity to the limits.<p>Engineers and inventors start applying knowledge way before scientists understand how things work.\n1) Edison did not keep reading journals about photons, electrons, chemistry of filaments and so on... he starts off with what he knows and uses clever strategies(sometimes even brute force or groping in the dark) to minimize the effect of the unknowns.\n2) The wright brothers did not wait for the emergence of the theory of fluid dynamics to make plane fly... they observed birds and kites and what not. Created a wind tunnel using tools they could easily afford, and basically figured out how to iterate like crazy... something like what a modern startup would.",1299383915.0

I may pick up maintainership for the project to do just that.<p>Think about that a moment: one feature enhancement requested in have a decade, merely an extension of an already existing feature, and it's something entirely new to window managers as far as I'm aware.

Of course, there was a statistics lesson at the end to be learned from it.<p>Even though it appears to be that you both have an equal chance to win (both of you have 33%), why would someone offer you an equal game unless he had some sort of advantage that you aren't aware of?<p>The trick was to look at the opponents hand while it was still going down. If you're throwing rock or scissors, your hand will be clenched the whole way down. If you were throwing paper, you will probably open your hand halfway down your throw.<p>So when he sees you opening your hand, midway he will change his to scissors.

""Classical liberalism"" [1] basically won, but it won a long time ago. If you stick to ""classical liberalism"" you're basically being a conservative in the stick-to-the-old-stuff-that-works sense. (Because you should never use the words ""conservative"" or ""liberal"" without being clear about exactly which meaning you are using. Leave them adrift and they are worthless.) What we call liberals today is not where the term started; call it ""progressivism"" if you like. But absolutely there is a way in which an older meaning of ""liberal"" matches up with the modern meaning of ""conservative"", without contradiction.<p>I wouldn't say it is correct to say conservatives have ""claimed"" liberal ideas; conservatives are (broadly) the ones who, for better or worse, never let go of them in their classical liberal form, while the term ""liberal"" moved on over the years and turned into something totally unrecognizable by the original meaning of the term. (I do not mean that as any sort of moral judgment. It is simply an observation that language shifts over time.)<p>[1]: In this sense: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberal</a>",1299383036.0

There has been a growth in knowledge based jobs precisely because of growth in population plus growth in productivity in the output of manual labor jobs. In a world where production costs are near zero because its fully automated, there is still the built-in costs of the materials themselves. This puts a cap at how cheap a product can become.

This left a significant percentage of projects with descriptions of the author's intent, but no actual code.

It will be some other product feature, like weight, or battery life, or cost, that will be the axis that you see competition focused on.<p>Marketing folks would love to have consumer focus on a metrics like performance that constantly keeps growing and outdating old products. Other metrics, like price and customer experience, are often just as important to buyers.<p>To give a parallel example, I don't think most HDTV owners are going to replace their set at this point for higher resolution.
