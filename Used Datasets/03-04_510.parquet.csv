If their day job involves really interesting programming challenges which are interesting and require creativity to solve, a programmer's passion and creativity can be invested in that.<p>If, however, a programmer's day job is maintaining a legacy system that doesn't involve a lot of creativity then there's a greater likelihood that they have untapped passion which will express itself in a side project... and ultimately with them finding a new job that does require creativity.<p>Judging someone based on their side projects is the wrong approach -- judge them on their creativity and passion.  Some are fortunate to have a job which gives them the ability to be creative and passionate during work hours.  Others aren't as fortunate and need to express their creativity and passion outside of work hours.  The big red flag to not hire is when someone has neither creativity nor passion inside or outside of work hours.",1301457350.0

I'm sure part of it is driven by the result (I didn't get past the phone screens.) My main complaints are<p>- Every step of the process involved a new person. Overall, I had to be handed off through 4 different people, each one wanting a bit more information or a filled out form, until I was scheduled for the phone interviews. This was especially confusing when I had a recruiter assigned to me, and I was being emailed by both her and someone with whom she worked with at the same point in the process.<p>- The first interviewer was apparently a fill-in for the intended one, which is unfortunate, because he and I were a complete mismatch. He seemed to be a C/C++ guy and I have more high-level language experience, and we ended up doing what I would consider advanced bit manipulation / number theory. (The second interview was much more reasonable, and it is my own fault if I did not pass it.)<p>- The amount of time time that it took from the ""Hi, we would like you to apply online"" email to the you are not ""a close enough match"" email was over a month, which is much too long for simple back-to-back phone interviews. Waiting for their responses was the most frustrating and nerve-racking part of the process. I am glad at least the OP had quick responses.<p>Should I go through the process again, I would strongly consider asking them to expedite it in one way or another.<p>On a more optimistic note, I do feel like the interviews do help highlight weaknesses in your programming skills and resume presentation skills.",1301457337.0

Our town even has a technical university which meant that graduates were always looking for jobs in a market that didn't have that much to offer. In the web world, developers mainly had the choice between working for an advertising agency or work at a very small shop with less than 5 people. Non-web devs would have to choose either IBM in Mainz or SAP in Walldorf as a matter of course. At least that's what it looked like from my perspective, I could be wrong.

16,2385720,comment,2385443.0,2385443.0,2,0,chc,,,"First of all, I'm going to burst your bubble a little bit: This is not generally considered plagiarism. Plagiarism has a specific meaning both in the law and in the field of journalism, and using facts gleaned from a source is not exactly the same thing, whether or not you cite that source.<p>Newspapers rip off facts all the time. That practice has been the bread and butter of news gathering since it became a real profession. Overhear a couple of city councilmen talking about ""the mayor's prostitute"" and then clam up when they see you? Take that fact, go find a willing source (we'll call him Bob) to tell you what you already know, and then publish a story saying Bob told you the mayor hired a prostitute. Where you originally heard the information silently disappears into the ether. You feel honest because you went through the trouble of uncovering the information  you were just helped along by the fact that you already knew it.<p>However, they are still being shady dicks here, and ripping off stories wholesale is a bit beyond the pale. You're generally expected to cite some source for your info, and you shouldn't deliberately hide sources unless you're protecting somebody. In this case, it is clear that they are intentionally hiding the fact that they ripped off your blog post  the stock photo bit pretty much cinches it (they don't know how to re-discover that bit of information!), and that's why they removed the paragraph.<p>There is no overriding body to report them to. That only really makes sense in a field where there is some authoritative group or groups  to publish a newspaper, the only place you need to get an OK from is your pocketbook. Think of it like a really expensive, environmentally unfriendly blog.<p>So what can you do? The same thing you'd do if a marginally famous blog ripped you off without attribution  make noise. Raise a stink in their peer group. Hopefully, some of them will enjoy beating up their competitor for lacking ethics and appreciate the chance to tout their own superiority.",1301457129.0

I don't believe that to be a tautology.<p>I don't think I said anything about calling back to the interpreter. I merely meant to imply that the efficiency might not be as good as that of a statically compiled language.<p>There is a large implementation difference between an interpreter and a compiler. It goes far beyond 'efficiency.'<p>In an interpreter, generally, you are interpreting a data-structure and dispatching based on the symbols in that data-structure to do various things. The advantage of the interpreter is that you don't have to compile (you just have to tokenize/parse). Every function call and value dereference requires interpretation of this parsed structure. This means that for every function call you have to do some sort of lookup, and your flow control constructs (like if) are done by manipulating your position in the data-structure.<p>In a compiler, you are operating at a much lower level, having already interpreted the data-structure, and transformed what you would have interpreted as a data-structure into a machine code representation of itself. Instead of manipulating a position in a data-structure to interpret the code, you use the program counter (machine code jmp instructions). In certain situations, you can prove things about the code that is being compiled, leading to more efficient code (similar to what one might do with a static compiler).<p>In the example above, the interpreter might look up the proper function by finding the correct class object in a hash table, and then finding the pointer to the function.<p>In a compiler, it might dynamically recompile a dispatch function (when you add an object that implements that method), and then simply dispatch based on a case statement of 'object type' (something more sophisticated is likely possible as well). The second way of handling it would likely be much more efficient, even in the face of dynamically changing classes.<p>If you allow type hints in your compiler, you can prove even more things about various pieces of your program, meaning that, for example, you might be able to do straight up integer math in machine code (add, imul, sub, ash, etc) rather than having to go through a 'generic math' dispatch.<p>There is a lot of interesting 1980s-early 1990s literature on efficient implementation of dynamically compiled languages.<p>There are number of smalltalk, scheme, and common lisp compilers that are good examples of this technique (and proof of my claims!)<p>It is a fascinating subject and I highly recommend reading about it. \n(The Henry Baker archives might be a good start).",1301454525.0

It's true but it doesn't say anything about how to solve the problem and it mixes up cause and effect""<p>I think you're really close to getting at the root of this problem right here.  Fundamentally, we're talking about a behavioral compulsion here - people are literally getting addicted to food.  Fructose is the substance that's hijacking the brain's reward system.  A particular individual's susceptibility to obesity is very likely set up by the same factors that function in other addictions, whether chemical (as in alcoholism) or behavioral (as in gambling) - namely, dysfunctional family systems, psychological trauma, stress, etc.  If this is, in fact, what's really going on then the solution is to (A) treat obesity as an addiction and (B) limit the proliferation of fructose in the food supply.",1301454256.0

Rightly or wrongly, US intelligence agencies seem to have a rather different set of rules these days than the rest of us are following, including most law enforcement.
