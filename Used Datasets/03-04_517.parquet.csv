Do four 10mph car crashes do the same damage as one 40mph crash? If it can be properly coordinated. If you can coordinate it, how much does the coordination cost? At worst you only have the power of one 10mph crash, often at best too.<p>Programming for multi-core can a hard problem but the problem doesn't always lie in our abilities, many times it's computationally impossible.<p>To play games and video is a must right? We want the most from our battery right? A fact of the situation is that high power activities are many times mutually exclusive from low power activities right? So what is awful, inelegant or stupid about the design? The asymmetry? There is asymmetry of the interaction? Should you cary around a dumb-phone, a gameboy, and a video player?

Python supports (limited) lambdas and some higher-order functions, but it really feels like the language tries to steer you away from too much functional programming.<p>The best time to learn about different paradigms is right when you're starting out; if you basically only learn how to program imperatively, you're liable to start believing that that's the only way to go. I know because this happened to me (I was self-taught and learned a different set of languages, but it had the same effect); ultimately it took me longer to come to and start using functional programming properly than it would have had I learned about it at the very beginning.",1319255917.0

But I had spent a lot of time programming before I started it, so I'm not sure if it really is the best text for CS 101, where some students maybe have never written a line of code.

There are some very smart and experienced people who have spent a lot of time thinking about this (see ""The Structure and Interpretation of the Computer Science Curriculum""), and I hesitate to put SICP on a pedestal where it can't be touched.<p>As I said, hopefully some (or many!) of the students taking this class at Berkley will be curious about the original book and will seek it out on their own.",1319255801.0

Some of them will likely be intrigued by the purple book their class name references. Looking at the schedule, it looks like it just covers the ""Structure"" and not the ""Interpretation"". My favorite parts of SICP are the 4th and 5th chapters, on metacircular evaluation, interpreters, lazy Scheme, Prolog, and compilation to byte code. I guess it's probably too much for CS 101 though.

I dunno what you are doing as your career after quitting your job\n3. You are in America, where getting gigs is no biggie\n4. You <i>ARE</i> an idiot for being depressed and contemplating suicide.<p>I had to make a similar decision myself, I am in a remote town, in a country where getting gigs is really difficult, I have mortgages to pay and lifestyle to manage (my lifestyle was quite lavish since I had a <i>high</i> paying job) I do not have my parents here with me to move back into, though a lot of people I know have suggested that I do and move back to a different country where living is cheaper. To add to that, I have had to take medications etc for my stress levels and am still consulting a couple of doctors. However, what surprises me is WHY <i>SUICIDE</i>, I mean if that is what I wanted, then my High Paying job was doing a good job of taking my life away.<p>If your friends tell you what an idiot you are, remember they are <i>NOT</i> really your friends, they want to feel better by comparing themselves to you and probably were jealous of your pay.<p>I have managed over a year and a half on my own, believe me this is not easy... However, now things have started to pick up, I am being approached by people and they want me to provide my services to them (mainly development)<p>I used the time that I had to learn, skill and re-skill myself, I was used to being a Manager, getting people to do things, i did mainly all the high level stuff, but now I am back to being a code monkey, nothing wrong with it, other than the fact that I cannot focus on that, but since my skills are good, I can manage to catch up in terms of deadlines, etc<p>The other piece of information that you have not posted is how old are you? That will also determine, what you call a HIGH Paying job. Let me say that I have given up a 100K type job and gone through hell, and hope that the journey is nearly over.<p>For anyone that is contemplating, you need to know a few things,<p>1. Do not quit your job on the pretext that you <i>might</i> just make it lucky\n2. Have a plan, I did not have the luxury of a plan, had to do it for health reasons and other personal reasons.\n3. Build contacts, spread the word about your work, it will take a year or two before you get to see results, the Economy is <i>slow</i> it is not just you or your luck\n4. At every stage project professionalism, meet people and discuss your services as if you are a flourishing business, this will instill confidence in you and also keep your mind off <i>depression</i> and feelings of being a loser. After all the <i>ONLY</i> person that can really call you a loser is <i>YOU</i> what any body else says does not matter...<p>If it helps, take up something in the meanwhile that could be anything that gets you going, I felt that I needed to <i>not</i> take up such temp employment and went on hard with self development instead.<p>Hope you can take something from this and work towards something positive and make it...<p>I have been a victim of office politics and went through the same...<p>Tim, Vic",1319253040.0

That said, there is no financial incentive to do a Ph.D. in the first place. My understanding is that the opportunity cost (salary you didn't earn while doing your Ph.D.) is larger than the total expected extra earnings over your lifetime. My understanding is that by contrast a Masters degree is a good investment.<p>There are other reasons to stay in academia --- mostly to do with lifestyle. You have a lot more freedom to work on whatever interests you than in many other career paths.",1319252963.0

Throughout the class harvey and the TA's emphasized that everything we were learning could be done in any language, and didn't actually require scheme or lisp (yes, we never got to macros).<p>I can understand why you it might seem strange to port SICP over to scheme if you read SICP with the intention of learning lisp, but at berkeley the point of using SICP was to iterate through many different programming paradigms and cover basic computer science. unless they've found a better manual for this, it makes a lot of sense to just translate SICP instead of starting from scratch.",1319252907.0

It puts the author out there so his or her biases and conflicts of interests are not protected.<p>The Economists shields its authors from scrutiny and lends its credibility to who knows who. How do I know if the writer of an article criticizing one industry doesn't have interests in its rival? Or is a person of one political party criticizing a political opponent? Is it ""The Economist"" criticizing the Democratic Party in this article or is it penned by the hand of Karl Rove?<p>Second and most importantly, like I said, even if you agree with free markets, it is one thing to agree with them. It is another thing to close yourself off from alternatives.<p>The truth is key. Remaining objective is key. If there is evidence of the free markets working, by all means report it. But don't glorify it. And if there is evidence of free markets failing, report that, too. Don't hide it. Don't apologize for it. Report the truth. Journalism isn't about believing in something. It's about reporting what happens. The Economist is about believing in free markets. Therefore it is bad journalism, but it is good propaganda. If The Economist was about objectively reporting on politics and economics and just happened to have positive articles about free markets because there really is positive evidence to report, I would forgive it. But that isn't the case, so I can't.<p>EDIT: I realize people are misinterpreting my criticism to be about <i>The Economist</i>'s ideology. It is not. My criticism is that it has an ideology. That's propaganda not journalism by most commonly understood definitions of propaganda and journalism.",1319252746.0
