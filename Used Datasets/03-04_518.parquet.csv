I suppose I took your comment ...<p><i>They clearly have absolutely no interest in serving me content or helping me do what I want to do</i><p>... too literally.  I believe the trouble of developing and offering a mobile app supplements their motivation to serve content, in a better way.<p>But your point was well stated, and it's clear you're not against a better mobile experience, but rather the manner in which it's advertised.  In which case I agree ... shoving a full screen ad down a user's throat is frustrating.",1356836911.0

So go through the expired ones and so long as you don't infringe on the newer patents then it is ok to use it royalty free. That is the whole point of the patent after all - once it expires, everyone can benefit from the invention, not just the inventor and his/her customers.",1356836773.0

The idea was to keep in touch with those acquaintances you lost contact with for one reason or another. Yet, it turned into a huge attention whoring platform because it slowly chipped away at any real-world interaction people ever had prior. So, what do you do when you do something cool or interesting? You let your Facebook ""friends"" know about it. It makes you feel better that someone read about the shit you did today. You feel like you're cool now. It's unbelievably sad what an immense psychological effect Facebook has on its users. I didn't even realize how addicted i was to Facebook until i closed my account and had frequent urges to reopen just to update my ""friends"" with something i did. Everyone on it is just feeding off of each other. It's a perpetual pat on the back that makes you feel cozy that you have 300 friends and hides the fact it's making you socially inept. It's been 4 months and i never looked back. Even had 2 of my close friends follow my lead. Get away from this shit and get your social interactions back.",1356836734.0

Often these mistakes are what catalyze growth and create the scar tissue that helps them (and organizations) to not repeat the same classes of mistakes. You don't fire people when they make mistakes like these, you ask them what they will do to make sure that nobody in the organization is likely to make a similar one. Seems like that is generally Amazon's reaction too.<p>That said, I understand it's pretty damn frustrating having downtime during peak periods :)",1356836492.0

On the other hand, there is a big drive to push traditional internet content into standalone apps, as this author outlines.
