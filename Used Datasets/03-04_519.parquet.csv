However, there is no need to make up the difference overnight, or really even to make up the entire difference.<p>If coal power costs $0.1/kWh, and solar/wind/whatever costs $0.15/kWh, then you would only need a $0.05/kWh equivalent carbon tax to shift investment in research and infrastructure. Or really even just the promise of such a tax in five years.
