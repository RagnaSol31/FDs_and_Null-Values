Further, the overall number of male elementary school teachers in the UK has fallen significantly in the last 30 years (2) - men have been ""bailing out of primary education"" for decades.<p>Are the majority of cases due to bullying or being ""forced"" out of the role? I doubt it. It's more likely to be related to opportunities and different types of people gravitating to what sort of jobs suit them best. I <i>suspect</i> if women are crashing out of IT, it might be because it's not a particularly appealing or novel <i>career</i> anymore (back in the 90s it was portrayed as super high paid and ""cool"" - far more appealing than the <i>very</i> sexist financial industry at the time) and women have better opportunities to do other things than ever before (e.g. finance, management, legal) whereas males in IT are probably there because they picked it from the start as a calling rather than a career.<p>Update: As one of the respondents says, yes, let's make IT more inclusive. But let's not 1) assume IT is a special case, or 2) go OTT by doling out blame or restricting the largely innocent (i.e. ""men"" as a group) by redefining acceptable behavior to be a tiny gamut of unnatural neutrality and inoffensiveness.<p>1: <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7838273.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7838273.stm</a>\n2: <a href=""http://www.askamum.co.uk/News/Search-Results/Current-news/Primary-schools-lack-male-teachers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.askamum.co.uk/News/Search-Results/Current-news/Pr...</a>",1277610971.0

Biologically speaking, men wants to inseminate as much women as he can. I also accept the author's point about freedom and different kind of experience that monogamy cannot give. But then the author would also have to agree, that monogamy may have the depth that any non-monogamous relationshop lack, so it might be a trade off. Then medically speaking, monogamy is safer. Psychologically, there are also trade offs: it's usually difficult enough to get along with one person - I believe issues multiply when you have many. For example, I don't see anything particularly scary about having multiple wives (western culture thinks it's some sort of barbaric behavior), but if you look at it closely, you would understand why it only works in traditional societies like muslim: because they have mechanisms for holding it all together. Men there have obviously more authority and thus they hold the power of getting it all together. In the western world  the task gets a lot more complicated because people are more independent and have more rights legally. One thing for sure, divorce cases with this model would be a legal hell.<p>Please note I have not made up my mind about the particular lifestyle so I'm totally neutral here. I'm not into any relationship right now, but when I think of it, I sometimes think about how would it be a monogamous ones and sometimes I feel more like I'd want to stick with some sort of polyamory.",1277610699.0

In about 90%+ of the cases where I've been in a meeting at work with programmers and a project manager, IF there were only 1 female in the room she was the project manager, not a programmer. So, extrapolating... assuming enough other males have experienced approximately the same thing in life, that could account for why they tend to expect any unknown new female they encounter in that situation to be, well, <i>not</i> a programmer, and very probably a manager or project assistant of some kind.<p>That said, yes, obviously there are female programmers, and yes it sucks if a man assumes a woman can't program solely because of a gender.

(I'm serious.)<p>I moved to China a few weeks ago and was amazed how this place is an ideal place for startups/freelancers. First, the cost of living is extremely low AND you get a similar (if not better) quality of life than what you can get in the US. I live in Shenzhen, a very young city with a booming economy and the world's capital of electronics manufacturing. The population density here is much higher than even the largest US cities, which means: a lot of 24/7 restaurants, night clubs full everyday of the week / hour of the night, convenience stores around every corner, cheap taxis (3$US can get you far), etc. There are very few foreigners but it can be a nice thing at the same time because when you see a fellow westerner, you are tempted to socialize very quickly and most of them have interesting stories to tell. Ah, I was about to forget: Chinese girls love westerners.<p>China is also ideal for startups. The economy here is growing very fast and the domestic market is huge. The software industry here seems to be lagging behind the US by a couple years. This means that people knowledgeable about the western market have a significant edge because they are able to foresee the trends that are likely to take place in China. That's why there are so many Chinese clones of popular western websites.<p>I could go on and on... Get in touch with me if you'd like to ask some questions.<p>EDIT: Some pictures from my apartment <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/50425387@N06/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/50425387@N06/</a>",1277608330.0

It is obviously something to do with making banner ads.<p>I do know that it has a silly name, which is a practice I find intensely annoying. Are you saying a big hello to some teenagers from the year 2000, selling radioactive yoghurt, or providing a dating service for the homosexual community?<p>I also know that your home page uses buzzwords like ""platform"" and spams me with things about Twitter and Facebook, which are practices I associate with marketroids who have nothing informative to say.<p>I noticed these things because your home page lacks any meaningful structure to guide a visitor through the basics: what you do, why they should be interested, and how they can take things further. There is no hierarchy or emphasis in the page elements. There is no useful indication of which elements do something useful when clicked. I overlooked several of the page elements initially, ironically due to banner blindness. I didn't get as far as finding the call to action on the bottom right until the third time I went back to look at your page while writing this.<p>Finally, I'm not sure who your market is. How many people are going to be interested in banner ads instead of using, say, Adwords, given that they would need something worth advertising yet presumably don't have either the basic graphic design skills necessary to create this sort of thing themselves or the business contacts to get it done for them?<p>Sorry to be so negative, but I don't think this is a serious venture yet. You need to develop a viable business plan, learn basic marketing principles, and then create a web site with much better usability based on those things (assuming you still think that your business plan has enough potential to pursue it further by that stage).",1277608223.0

Scour Twitter and search for user groups in your area, or start your own! In the OKC area you're bound to find some if you look hard enough.

I went to high school in Central Massachusetts - that area is <i>gorgeous</i> (bucolic farms, forests, fall foliage small country roads), and yet it's still only 45 minutes away from Boston/Cambridge if you want to go to events in the city.  There're a lot of towns like that in the Boston area - once you get outside of the 128 belt, the population drops off dramatically, and yet you're still fairly close to the city.<p>Only problem is property values - the prettier low-density towns that happen to be close to the city (Weston, Lexington, Carlisle, Concord, Bedford) now have houses that are going for $1M+.  If you're willing to live an hour or so outside of the city, though, you can still get some really affordable stuff in Groton, Pepperell, Bolton, Acton, Littleton, etc.<p>I'm kinda wondering if there's anything similar in other metropolitan areas.  The Bay Area is pretty much a lost cause: if you want forests, there's Portola or Woodside (for like $5M a house), Marin (ditto) or the Berkeley hills (tritto), while if you want something halfway affordable like Dublin or Pleasanton, it's suburban strip malls all around.<p>Portland, OR maybe?  I know there's an urban growth boundary, but are there any pretty wooded neighborhoods in the Portland area?  At least property values there haven't skyrocketed, last I heard.",1277607648.0
