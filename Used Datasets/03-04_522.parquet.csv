1,1977952,comment,1977526.0,1977712.0,0,0,redwood,,,"Right: how do they calculate the <$1/day rate. Its nearly inverse relationship with the GDP per capita graph implies that deep down in the data the basis for this $1/day rate could essentially be the GDP rate divided by population, or similar. I.e. without seeing where that data comes from this is a real possibility. However I would assume these folks are doing a rigorous analysis so this is probably unlikely.",1291694341.0

Pretty much they killed anything that you did not have to pay for. The worst part is they did not just withdraw paid positions from working on it. They alienated the volunteer members of the community until they resigned in protest.<p>Sun agreed to license the TCK to Apache under non-discriminatory terms an Agreement that Oracle is not, has not and will not living up to, because they don't want JDKs to exist that did not pay Oracle or more importantly they want them to licence it under the restrictive provising that they require e.g no use on servers and no use on Mobile. How many more items do they have to destroy until people start seeing the  serial and systematic behavior that is going on.<p>do you not find it funny that Apple gave the JVM back to Oracle and Oracle is doing everything in it's power to keep non-sanctioned VM's off of Mobile devices. That is what the Apache dispute is really about, Oracle does not want a non-oracle JVM in the mobile world and I can bet you dime to dollar that it has to do with a back room deal between Oracle and Apple. Why do they want to keep the non-sanctioned JVM's off of Mobile devices, well because a closed ecosystem is more lucrative for Apple and Oracle than one in which Apache and Google are giving stuff away for free.<p>There is a fundamental difference in world views between Apple / Oracle and Google / Apache. Apple and Oracle are vertical stack providers they want to provide the whole stack soup to nuts and don't want anyone playing in their ecosystem, it just so happens that Apple wants the consumer market and Oracle wants the Enterprise market so they make good bed fellows. They are about the only two tech companies left that are not at war with each other.<p>Google and Apache represent a threat to their world vision and they have declared war to stop them. Oracle is all about every piece of their vertical being a piece that is monetized you can rest assured that Java is no exception.<p>Like it or not Java and the JVM are pawns in a big game of who is going to own the mobile market. It is the future market and winner takes all, if Oracle backs Apple in wining the market, then Apple can ensure that Oracle is position to be the Enterprise infrastructure for the new Mobile market. Like it or not, Java is a sacrificial pawn in a bigger game now.<p>The developer in me does not care, quite honestly the return to verticals means the return to easy money for writing software for verticals but the consumer in me shudders at the though of the verticals winning. You think Apples platform is restrictive, now wait until they own 90% of the market. They will make the early 90's Microsoft look like a benevolent democracy and well Oracle will just become a technical tax to anyone wanting to do business.",1291694330.0

Eventually we decided that an open source project with a similar (enough) architecture to what we'd been building ourselves was preferable to maintaining a python library in-house.<p>So far we have no regrets.  We have had no production issues and we have an architecture that is built to handle a large amount of incoming data (every note and highlight you take in an Inkling book is synched to our servers).

75,1977875,comment,1976127.0,1977433.0,0,0,samdk,,,"Prolog's pattern matching actually isn't much like an if-then-else construct at all, and thinking about it like one will get you into a lot of trouble once you move beyond very very trivial Prolog programs. While it resembles the pattern matching done in Haskell and ML-like languages at first glance, what's actually happening in Prolog is very different.<p>A look at a simple (although very inefficient) Fibonacci program will illustrate the difference. In Haskell, it'd look something like this: (and work like you might expect)<p><pre><code>    fib 0 = 0\n    fib 1 = 1\n    fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)\n</code></pre>\nThe obvious direct translation to Prolog (I'm using SWI Prolog[0]) is something like this:<p><pre><code>    /* fib(N,X): X is the Nth fibonacci number */\n    fib(0,0).\n    fib(1,1).\n    fib(N,X) :-\n        N1 is N-1,N2 is N-2,\n        fib(N1,A),fib(N2,B),\n        X is A+B.\n</code></pre>\nThis, however, is going to cause problems if you actually try to run it, and the reason is that Prolog doesn't just do pattern matching: it attempts to unify the query term (the thing you give it) with the program terms (the things on the left in the program above), and instead of just using the first result that matches, it will (if you ask it to do so) return <i>every</i> possible result by doing a left-to-right depth-first search on the solution tree (using a process called SLD resolution[1]). The expected behavior of the above program is something like this:<p><pre><code>    ?- fib(0,X).\n    X = 0 ;\n    false. /* there are no more possible matches */\n</code></pre>\nWhat's actually going to happen though is this:<p><pre><code>    ?- fib(0,X).\n    X = 0 ;\n    /* runs forever */\n</code></pre>\nWhen you give it the query <i>fib(0,X)</i>, it first unifies that with <i>fib(0,0)</i>, and the first answer is what you expect: X = 0. The difference occurs when you ask it for another answer (which you do in the interpreter by typing a semicolon). What you <i>want</i> Prolog to say is that there are no other answers, because there's only one 0th Fibonacci number. What Prolog actually does though is it backtracks[1] and goes back up the resolution tree to see if there are any more program terms the query can be unified with. In this case there are: <i>fib(0,X)</i> can unify with <i>fib(N,X)</i> also. Prolog soon gets into negative numbers (and past the base cases), and so ends up running forever.<p>One possible corrected version is below:<p><pre><code>    fib(0,0).\n    fib(1,1).\n    fib(N,X) :-\n        N > 1,\n        N1 is N-1,N2 is N-2,\n        fib(N1,A),fib(N2,B),\n        X is A+B.\n</code></pre>\nHere, we ensure that we only unify with the third query when N is large enough that we don't match the first two, and so we get the output we'd expect.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.swi-prolog.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swi-prolog.org/</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLD_resolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLD_resolution</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking</a>",1291692147.0

It seems to me that either it is a worthy endeavor (which I think it is), or it isn't (ie, it should be scraped). But I don't understand scraping it and then revitalizing it soon after.
