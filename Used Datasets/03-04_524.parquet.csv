In my opinion advertising will cannabalize their business - they should be looking to sell analytics and insights - thats where their value is.  Yes its harder, less proven but they are just destroying themselves with their current strategy.  Im sure nobody wants to see ads on Twitter and I wouldn't be surprised if nobody really wants to serve ads in that Twitter is exceptionally noisy and the functionality is very streamlined.

45,5350592,comment,5350093.0,5350502.0,21,0,rayiner,,,"> For me, I'm not sure how productive all this gender hand-wringing really is.<p>It's potentially very productive. The culture of CS, ""judgmental introversion"" as you put it, is not anything intrinsic to CS. Indeed, software engineering is a profession that demands a high level of communication and cooperation. The ""lone hacker"" stereotype is in my opinion quite the opposite of the kind of people you want in software engineering (or engineering generally).<p>One of the things the whole ""affirmative action"" debate ignores, on both sides, is that cultures are self-perpetuating, but affirmative action can move cultures to new, self-sustaining equillibria. The lack of women is by itself something that creates a barrier to entry for women, and once the ratio is corrected through affirmative means, the new equilibrium becomes self-perpetuating.<p>I'll use as an example the profession of accounting. Accounting, like CS, has a perception of being introverted and nerdy. Yet, 45-50% of the employees at Big 4 accounting firms are women. Across the field, 20% of all partners are women, and more importantly, 43% of new partners are women (<a href=""http://suite101.com/article/accounting-is-becoming-a-womans-world-a224930"" rel=""nofollow"">http://suite101.com/article/accounting-is-becoming-a-womans-...</a>). But there is no affirmative action for women in accountancy. It's not easier to get a job at PWC or E&Y as a woman. The affirmative action is no longer necessary--because women aren't self-selecting out of the profession, firms don't need to dip down to get equally qualified candidates.<p>The legal field saw a similar shift as a result of affirmative action for women. In a field that used to be an ""old boy's club"" half of new associates are women and 30% of new partners are women (<a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/blog/2012/01/report-30-of-new-law-firm-partners.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/blog/2012/01/report-30-o...</a>). But at least at the associate level there is no affirmative action any longer--the new equilibrium is self-perpetuating. It's self-perpetuating because balancing the gender ratio changed the culture in a way that made the profession attractive to women. And you know what? The culture is better. It's modern and professional. There is nothing intrinsic about smoking and dirty jokes that made you better at the practice of law, and frankly there is nothing intrinsic about playing WoW in your spare time that makes you better at programming.<p>So your dichotomy about ""meritocracy"" is short-sighted. There is nothing ""meritocratic"" about indulging male culture to keep a field male-dominated.  Indeed, that's anti-meritocratic. Affirmative action, ironically, by balancing gender ratios can move the culture in a direction where you can have true meritocracy--where women don't self-select out of a profession because they don't want to be the minority, and where in the long run you don't have to dip down to get qualified women because the qualified women aren't turned away by the male-dominated culture.",1362886539.0

If someone else is doing the provisioning and packaging, and you are just writing Chef or Puppet configs, there is little difference. I pick the distro based on specific needs. If you run RHEL/CentOS you basically need the EPEL repository from the Fedora project.<p>The differences come out when you start dealing with lower level things. In those cases I find Red Hat's approaches are more pragmatic (work better in the real world) while Debian's approches seem to strive for theoretical perfection. RH is optimized for the 90% use case, Debian is optimized for nothing (or is optimized for the 10% use case). Some examples:<p><i>Kickstart vs Preseed:</i><p>For PXE boot automated installs Red Hat's installer (anaconda) uses Kickstart for the configurations. Debian (debian-installer) uses Preseed (it can actually use some Kickstart configurations, but not enough to eliminate Preseed).<p>Kickstart is easy, for example creating disk partitions and file systems can be done is a few human readable lines (zerombr, clearpart --all, part / --fstype=ext4 --grow).<p>Preseed makes bizarre choices. You are essentially automating the interactive installer, including having to confirm all those dialog boxes that say things like ""Are you sure you want you overwrite your data"", ""The previous configuration didn't use LVM and the new one does, are you sure you want LVM?"", ""This is your last chance, your data will be lost"". So along with the partition configuration which is more verbose (not really human readable), you need lines like (d-i partman/confirm_write_new_label boolean true, d-i partman/choose_partition select finish, d-i partman/confirm boolean true).<p>It makes no sense that an automated install is not automated, but some will argue it's more powerful.<p><i>Package init scripts:</i><p>Debian WTF?! Debian packages usually use a helper program called 'dh_installinit' to install and manage their init scripts. The defaults of dh_installinit are horrible, and most packages seem to stick to the defaults. It defaults to starting services when the packages are installed, which is rarely what you want to happen. Almost always you want to configure the service and then start it (optimizing for the 10% use case). When you upgrade a package it defaults to stopping the service before the upgrade and starting it again after. Very few services require that. I don't want my web server stopped are a few minutes while packages are upgraded. Conversely Red Hat actually have a hot binary restart option in their Nginx init script, so you can do a package upgrade and restart with the new binary with no downtime.<p>If you want to see how crazy it gets read line ",
