When the first thread [0] came up, I ignored it. However, as it slowly accumulated more votes on HN, I felt a desire to challenge myself to read it and see how it constructively discussed the issues around child pornography.<p>Sure enough, I found it a very well put together piece.<p>I think the same can be said for this follow up article.<p>The discussion reminds me of the discussion around the Australian artist Bill Henson [1], who got in strife for photographs of a 13 year old. I personally don't have strong opinions one way or the other as to the rightness or wrongness of this type of art, but it was interesting to have the debate blown so widely open in the mainstream media here. Having said that, the debate was more about ""Art"" vs ""Child pornograhy"" and didn't touch on the additional areas that Rick discussed.<p>I do think that one point Rick may want to touch on is also the slippery slope to do with your own young children. When they are one or two years old, it is fine to take photos of them playing in the yard naked for the family album. Hell, its even frowned upon if there aren't photos like this to embarrass a child at their 21st birthday. Just as this is ok, it is also not okay for a parent to take photos of their 17yo child naked for the family album.<p>It seems that it would be difficult to legislate the specific point at which it is no longer okay to partake in this type of photography, but it is interesting to consider these things.<p>[0] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4495914"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4495914</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Henson",

(Still no GPS, though)</i><p>Yeah, I'm most glad they upgraded the ipod touchI find the idea of an independent device which has some the neat features of the iphone without being tied to my phone contract, or incurring sometimes-scary phone charges, pretty appealing.  The old ipod touch was pretty nice, but had some big flaws, like the fairly lame camera.  The new one not only seems to have a decent camera, but despite having a larger screen, is actually <i>lighter</i> than the already-featherweight ipod touch 4!<p>Everybody I've mentioned this to has said ""oh they'll probably get rid of the touch anyway, they want everybody to buy the iphone instead"" which made me sadbut apparently it's not true! :]<p>Lack of GPS is a shame though.  Even cheapo phones have GPS these days, so it wouldn't appear to be a cost issue; I guess they <i>are</i> still trying to push the iphone...<p>[An android version might be even nicer, but as far as I've seen, Apple's the only one even attempting to address this niche...]",1347508457.0

30,4514690,comment,4513838.0,4514339.0,32,0,DanielKehoe,,,"The Milwaukee police department has an ugly history. Some of its excesses are the result of institutional traditions dating back a century, when it was seen as a bastion of civil order against anarchists and, later, political progressives. Milwaukee had Socialist mayors from 1910 to 1960; unlike most American cities, the state legislature had authority over the city police and appointed police chiefs who often were hostile to the city Socialists. The police department had a reputation for harassment and intimidation of the political left, gay people, and the counterculture. Police officers were linked to a firebombing of The Bugle-American alternative newspaper in the early 1970s. In January 1981 Milwaukee police officers arrested and beat Wendy O. Williams, lead singer of The Plasmatics, when the punk rockers visited the city on tour. Some of the police department's institutionalized prejudices are tragic, like the two police officers (one who later became head of the police officers' union) who found serial killer and cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer's victim 14-year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone nude on the street, and returned him to Dahmer, later laughing about how they had reunited two gay lovers (Dahmer killed and dismembered Sinthasomphone). It is also dangerous to be black in Milwaukee. In the 1970s, when I lived in Milwaukee, I remember repeated news stories about black men who were arrested and died in custody. I assumed by now that the police department's violent institutionalized racism had been cleaned up by improved training and diversity in hiring but I was surprised to learn that ""black man dies in police custody"" is still a common local news story (just google it: ""dies in custody milwaukee"").<p>Among US states, Wisconsin has a reputation for ""good government"" and efforts to eliminate cronyism and institutionalized corruption. The state is known for a history of Progressive politics from an era when Liberalism and Socialism were admired by many. At the same time, Milwaukee has long been one of the most racially divided cities in the US, more segregated than many cities in the South. The state has long been politically and culturally divided. Its divisions, fear and violence, reaction and repression are as much part of the state's history as is its reputation for liberalism, though not as well known.<p>What does this have to do with a website that promotes the Milwaukee Police Department? Maybe not much at all.",1347507780.0

How many other developers' weekends could you have saved, if only you were permitted to blog about the issue?<p>You can't write up examples of stuff using the new APIs, and post it on Github, or share at a local developer group meeting. So inexperienced developers can't learn from others.<p>It's not like the NDA is protecting things that would be truly damaging if disclosed, considering all it takes for them to pull aside the velvet rope is $100, and they've let both Google and Samsung in.  The real secret stuff clearly goes to the blessed developers who get advance notice of things like the taller screen or GPU capabilities.",1347505685.0

If bikeshedding can occur in the purchasing process and that is not a pleasant process to deal with.<p>If you're willing to put up with bullshit, then there is money to be made, but then again many entrepreneurs left a career in entreprise because they were sick of dealing with those problems.",1347505586.0
