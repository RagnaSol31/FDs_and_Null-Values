3,4625453,comment,4625202.0,4625423.0,4,0,numair,,,"Prior art is a very nuanced thing.  When I have a lot of money, I can have my talented legal staff persuasively argue that ""many of us were doing similar things in the field at the time of this invention, and other public disclosures did not provide proof of invention, but rather an interest in similar applications,"" or something of that nature.  Our new patent regime will be ""First Inventor To File,"" so you just have to convince the patent examiners that the genius engineers at your LargeCo were clearly thinking about the ideas and creating the same inventions as anything else a prior art search might turn up.<p>You made me think about something, however.  Maybe one of our solutions to this problem should be a very well organized, completely open source, ""open registry.""  One of the other changes -- a concession, really -- that will come into place along with the new patent system will be a much-expanded definition of prior art.  Now, as things currently stand it will become very easy to shoot down searches of discussion list postings and the sort as being relevant, but what if there was a true open, public registry of ideas/inventions?  And moreover, what if we as a collective community encouraged ideas to go in there through social incentive; i.e., if I add a new invention to the registry that is actually awesome, people vote it up and I gain cred in the industry -- and if it's already in existence or something, others can comment/explain I'm not the genius I thought I was.  You could also have some sort of a system whereby you could see inventions that are ""forks"" of others' ideas -- basically, a software version of the citations on a patent application.<p>Once we built this, and started using it, we could get the patent office (and patent offices around the world) to incorporate it into their workflow when evaluating applications.  This could really help us in cutting down bogus filings, while making their job easier (music to every government employee's ears).<p>I know people have been making moves in this area, but perhaps it's time we get really serious about it.  We seem to be better at coding things, than at lobbying, so maybe this is the way to go...",1349668554.0

They're based on the idea that it doesn't pay to invest in an invention if the fruits of that investment can be easily and cheaply copied by competitors, who can undercut the innovator because they don't have to recoup the investment.<p>The difference between certain software patents and chemical formulas is the level of investment required to develop the technology. If the level of investment is low, the free rider problem isn't nearly as relevant. If an invention is cheap, the cost can quickly be recouped just by being the first mover. This is especially true in the online space, where there are major network effects favoring the first mover.<p>Drug design is a completely different bag of cats. The initial investments are huge, in the hundreds of millions of dollars. There are no network effects and being the first mover brings almost no advantage.

I think it's clear that the change to first to file will result in the greatest threat to open innovation we have ever seen in our lives.<p>Think about it -- suddenly you will have swarms of lawyers and executives at pharmaceutical companies paying visits to research labs, and you'll have people from large software companies forwarding ideas posted on open source developer mailing lists to their legal departments.  It won't be safe to suggest ideas openly anymore.  It won't be safe to talk about ""what if"" or ""have you considered"" or ""someone should really.""   We are going to see a flood of really bad patents based on other people's ideas -- and that's exactly what our lawmakers have provided to their friends in large businesses.<p>Things are about to get a lot worse.  But you know, maybe that's what it's going to take -- maybe we have to suffer economically, suffer culturally, before we as a society realize we are building ourselves an intellectual prison for which there is no justification.<p>Yes, I know that patents are a temporary thing, only lasting 18 years or so; but really, do you think people such as the guy cited in this article are going to say to themselves, ""oh, you know, maybe I'll just return to coming up with innovative stuff in the voice recognition field in 18 years, after Nuance can't come after me anymore"" -- do you really think that will happen?  No, of course not.  We're going to see a lot of brilliant people forced to abandon brilliant projects and ideas, and we'll never know what might have been, what could have been done.<p>I don't think anyone is fighting this in a particularly constructive way -- the whole ""abolish all patents"" camp is going to get about as much of a serious audience as the ""abolish the Fed"" and ""abolish the labor union"" camps -- and perhaps that is exactly what our large-scale adversaries want.  We need to be more incremental, more nuanced; that's what they've done, and that's why they are getting everything they want.  You think sneaking first to file was something that happened over a chain of emails somewhere?  No -- if anything, I bet there is a protracted, multi-decade fight among a lot of very persistent corporate attorneys and executives that has lead to this ""win.""<p>In any case, I really hope people in our industry can stop the useless arguments of ""end all patents!"" for long enough to realize they should be rallying together to fight this simple yet very destructive change that is right over the horizon.  You sure as hell won't hear/read my thoughts on future technologies once this first to file thing goes into effect; and I am sure that savvy legal counsels everywhere will be telling their star engineers and employees to remain similarly silent.

I'm curious because I've coded in proportional fonts for ten years and haven't found that to be the case myself - with a couple of possible exceptions.<p>One is names_with_underscores. In a monospaced font, the underscore is the same width as every other character. In a proportional font, the underscore is one of the widest of characters, and <i>much</i> wider than a space.<p>For example, in the font I'm coding in right now, an underscore is 13 pixels wide, a parenthesis is 8 pixels, and a space is only 5 pixels!<p>So what happens is that the underscore in a way gives more visual separation in an expression than spaces or other punctuation.<p><pre><code>  var foo_bar = some_function(one_param, another_param);\n</code></pre>\nTo some degree, my eyes group that code this way:<p>var foo\nbar = some\nfunction(one\nparam, another\nparam);<p>My solution for this is simple: don't use names_with_underscores (except when language conventions require it, such as in Ruby), and do add spaces <i>inside</i> the parentheses:<p><pre><code>  var fooBar = someFunction( oneParam, anotherParam );\n</code></pre>\nWhy do the spaces go inside the parentheses and not outside? Well, you need a space in there <i>somewhere</i>, and this just doesn't work for me:<p><pre><code>  var fooBar = someFunction (oneParam, anotherParam);\n</code></pre>\nNor this (with no space at all):<p><pre><code>  var fooBar = someFunction(oneParam, anotherParam);\n</code></pre>\nTo me, the space belongs at the same place where I might put a line break if I had a too-long line. I would never break lines like this:<p><pre><code>  var fooBar = someFunction\n      (oneParam,\n       anotherParam);\n</code></pre>\nor like this:<p><pre><code>  var fooBar = someFunction(oneParam,\n      anotherParam);\n</code></pre>\nBut I do break lines like this:<p><pre><code>  var fooBar = someFunction(\n      oneParam,\n      anotherParam\n  );\n</code></pre>\nThis way the spacing goes in the same place regardless of whether it's a space or a linebreak.",1349667037.0

I'm glad to hear your comments and the others here.<p>I really enjoy reading text in proportional fonts much more than monospaced. That's true for program code as much as any other text.<p>Like you, it doesn't bother me to lose vertical alignment. The only vertical alignment that matters to me in code is the indentation, and that works fine in proportional fonts. (The one exception being that the popular two-space indents are really lousy in a proportional font. So I prefer tabs, or if spaces are a requirement, four-space indents.)<p>In fact, some time before I started using proportional fonts, I'd already changed my coding style to avoid vertical alignment other than the left margin. I used to write code something like this:<p><pre><code>  function someFunction(aParam,                   // This is the the main thing\n                        anotherParam,             // This is another thing\n                        aParamWithALongerName) {  // Remind me what this is for\n      firstStep();        // Here is a description\n      secondStep();       // of these three statements\n      thirdStepSortOf();  // that go together\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThat kind of code is the very reason for coding in monospaced fonts, but why? It is a pain to maintain and keep the spacing right, and in this (fairly realistic) example I find it extremely unhelpful to have all that whitespace separating ""aParam"" with its comment.<p>Instead, about ten years ago, I switched to a style more like this:<p><pre><code>  function someFunction(\n      aParam,  // This is the the main thing\n      anotherParam,  // This is another thing\n      aParamWithALongerName  // Remind me what this is for\n  ) {\n      // Here is a description of these three\n      // statements that go together\n      firstStep();\n      secondStep();\n      thirdStepSortOf();\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNow it may not be as ""pretty"" to have those comments on the parameters not all lined up as they were before, but it's a heck of a lot easier to maintain, and to my eyes it's easier to read too. The comments about the parameters are not related to <i>each other</i>, they are related to the parameter that each one applies to. With this style I can read:<p><pre><code>      aParam,  // This is the the main thing\n</code></pre>\nas pretty much a single unit, where the excessive whitespace in my previous style made it hard to match up each parameter with its comment.<p>Having made this change, some time later I discovered that the version of Visual Studio I was using at the time supported proportional fonts, gave it a whirl, and  like you, found I really liked it.<p>It is true that when I read other people's code who've used columnar alignment, the alignment doesn't work any more. But for the most part that just doesn't bother me. In the few cases where the alignment really makes a difference, I just switch to a monospaced font to read that file.<p>My favorite editor, Komodo IDE (or the free Komodo Edit), does a marvelous job of handling this. Like many editors, you can set up a customized theme of fonts and colors, but unlike any other editor I know of, each theme includes separate selections for a proportional font and a monospaced font. For some reason they don't provide a keyboard shortcut by default to switch between them, but I mapped Alt+O (on Windows) which is unused otherwise. I remember it by thinking ""prOpOrtiOnal"" and ""mOnOspaced"". :-) So I can switch between my favorite proportional and monospaced fonts easily, and it also remembers that setting for each file I've edited.<p>UltraEdit and UEStudio (Windows only) are not bad here either. They don't have an explicit way to select proportional vs. monospaced, but if you press Alt+C to go into column selection mode it switches to a monospaced font while in that mode. So that's a way to view a monospaced file. I wish more editors had this kind of flexibility.",1349665677.0

You may have just opened up a  chink in Kickstarter's armor.<p>If Kickstarter cracks down on product related projects maybe we will see a new crowdfunding platform emerge that is friendlier for those trying to fund and launch physical products. Kickstarter should be careful here or they may be creating an opportunity for a serious competitor to emerge.,1349665625.0
