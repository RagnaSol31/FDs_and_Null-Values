3,7952685,comment,7950102.0,7951031.0,2,0,ufo,,,"My personal opinions on templates, for Javascript and other languages are:<p>* Use something that is HTML-aware instead of something that treats HTML as text. Even if you have the template engine still spit out HTML strings in the end its going to be able to escape user data in a context-aware manner and get rid of useless whitespace.<p>* Logic in templates is fine and separation of concerns between view and model does not have to mean using different languages for them. My impression is that most &quot;logic-less&quot; templates eventually reinvent broken versions of variables, loops, conditionals and subroutines so I would rather use a real language from the start. An example I like is giving different classes to odd and even rows in a table. The solution is obvious if you use regular loops but can be quite tricky in many template engines.",1403841461.0

The article started with one topic and then wandered off into the other. I highly doubt people stayed together 70 years ago because they paid more attention to each other. I think it was just socially and economically harder to divorce.<p>In addition, the recommendations are good, however it takes two people to follow them. Having had a number of short term and long term girlfriends (the current one for over 8 years, she may be the last, who knows....), I have found there is such a thing as an attention vampire. People who have no respect for your space or focus. People who think your entire existence is to pay attention to them. And, I have found that there is no satisfying these people and they will move right on to someone else as you inevitabley become exhausted. So, I would speculate, in addition to the excellent points in the article, that successful couples have reasonable, respectful, and most importantly, compatible attention requirements.<p>Also, paradoxically, I found that paying too much attention to __some__ people causes them to place less value on your attention. When they no longer value your attention, they lose respect, and this causes a downhill slide in the relationship as well. The article is, I believe, written from a female point of view (can I say that? does it make me a bad sexist person?). It is a valuable and beautiful point of view. But like most things in life, balance and measure comes into play, and failing to recognize this leads to disaster as surely as ignoring your partners needs does.<p>Just my thoughts. I didn&",
