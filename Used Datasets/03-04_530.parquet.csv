Most of the people I know who use Gitorious.org did so so we could use an AGPL service to host our repositories. GitLab simply does not do this as it uses a lax permissive license. In addition to this they impose CLAs on any contributors :/ <i>sigh</i><p>It is really a shame that GitLab feels the need to remove the only AGPL service that fills this need. I do not know where I will be migrating my repositories, but it will not be GitLab unless they wish to offer the community an AGPL instance.",1425439227.0
