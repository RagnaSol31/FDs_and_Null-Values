The tech industry will simply become part of the problem, and politicians will become empowered — more suitors competing for their attention.<p>Instead, I believe the approach to GoDaddy is a better example: that bad policy will hurt politicians’ ability to maintain support.<p>The Internet, and thus the industry, has enormous reach with voters (and lobbyers like GoDaddy).

I worked on ads for Timeline.<p>The article's unsubstantiated premise is that Facebook releases products solely with its bottom line in mind. Based on my experience working on ads for Timeline, I'd say that this is antithetical to our nature. We optimized timeline for user experience (engagement) and released it not because of its impact to our bottom line but DESPITE that.<p>If you aren't convinced, look at the ads on Timeline, and compare to Profile. There were on average four ads per Profile page. Now there's two. People also click away a lot faster on Profile (because there's less content), but people now scroll around and navigate within Timeline. Photos are bigger, we show a lot more content. The resources to support these new products are expensive. If this doesn't illustrate our focus on engagement over our bottom line, color me surprised.<p>Just another point I wanted to clarify: Whenever money changed hands, even for organic content like sponsored stories, they are clearly labeled ""Sponsored."" If you don't see Sponsored, there was no optimization for revenue, because no money changed hands.<p>Ultimately, I think the author is exploiting a confusion between news feed and timeline. Sure, we will experiment with sponsoring organic content in news feed (max one), but they will be clearly labeled and things you can already see.<p>I just wanted to clarify a few issues that the author is either truly confused about, or is aware of but intentionally exploiting. I hope this helped.<p>If you have any questions I can answer, I'll be happy to clarify.",1324698360.0

I think he's saying there's a specific section of tech where there are different economic conditions at play - he seems perfectly well aware of how the rest of the world is.<p>And I agree with him. Talk to any startup about how hard it is to hire people and the insane sign-on bonuses/perks/referral bonuses some folks are having to resort to. Or look at the number of LinkedIn messages most people on HN probably get. It's a very small part of the 'big picture' but it definitely exists here in the SF Bay Area.,1324695906.0

I just spent four days designing, executing and analyzing experiments to see if our model was accurate and my implementation was correct. (Both are, which is nice.) But those experiments will never be published - experiments like them will, but not those. Those experiments are what I call ""guiding experiments"" - they're not rigorous enough to convince others that what we did works, but it's enough to convince me we're doing the right thing, and give me the confidence that things will work out as expected when we do the full, rigorous experiments.<p>So, yes, research has its own grunt work. And some of my code will make it into production.",1324695822.0

As a registrar, Google already has access to the root zone files, they can see what domains are being registered/dropped at every registrar. They already run public DNS servers too, so they don't need to get people to register domains with them and use them for DNS to see DNS activity.",1324695793.0
