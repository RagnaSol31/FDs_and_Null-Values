They tell themselves stories about eternal life, or they act like they have all the time in the world. When circumstances conspire to wake us to the transitory nature of life, it can be incredibly valuable.<p>I violently disagree with the notion that the heat death of the universe ""means that it really, really doesn't matter what you accomplish."" That's like saying it isn't worth cooking a beautiful meal because 48 hours later it will all be poop. That there's no point to love if the body will soon be dust.<p>Nothing lasts, but that doesn't mean that nothing matters.

Your GMail, Google Music (or Amazon for that matter), Photos (If you have G+ app installed), Contacts, App list, wallpaper, WiFi and other settings are all automatically backed up to the cloud and restored when you factory reset or get a new phone and sign in to your Google account.<p>For things such as SMS and full system backup - you have to take things in your own hand. SMS is easy with a 3rd party app, full system backup can be done using Titanium if your phone is rooted or by using command line scripts using adb. (adb supports encrypted backup to the desktop.) Also various OEMs provide their own Desktop sync program - like Samsung Kies - that make it easy to backup/restore using a PC. But it is fairly unnecessary to go to that length - default backup + SMS backup app works quite well for most.",1352087805.0

But how does the company square that with the sly offering of the opportunity to override the irrelevance or poor quality of a post with dollar bills?</i><p>I think Ars Technica is conflating reputation and quality with audience size. Number of Likes and Fans corresponds to 1 to 5 star ratings on Amazona measure of quality and reputation; Subscriptions (a relatively new Facebook feature) correspond to voluntary signups to a newsletter. Growth in the former doesn'tshouldn'thave anything to do with the later.<p>You don't buy away the problem of irrelevance or quality: the measure of that on Facebook is obvious. Lots of Likes = High Quality.<p>You are just buying a bigger audience. The ads are like buying more Subscriptions, targeted to people who are likely to Subscribe to your content anyway.<p><i>Dangerous Minds wrote about how it rose from 29,000 to 53,000 Facebook likes even as traffic to its site from shared Facebook posts went down by one half to two-thirds in the same time period.</i><p>Dangerous Minds doesn't get it. Just because you're high quality doesn't mean you automatically have a huge audience!<p>I think this is the right move for Facebook from a design point of view. Likes aren't Shares aren't Subscriptions. Separating the audience measure from the quality measure helps everyone get better information out of these numbers.",1352087804.0

Between apartment phase and some reasonable maturity point (20-50 people?), one could have a reasonably large building or set of nearby buildings that's subdivided from companies of various sizes. It would have the benefit of: Centralized food acquisition either with community eating or distribution to each unit; centralized administrative services; pre-furnished units which simplifies moving; and big company benefits such a onsite gym, dry cleaning, etc.<p>Presumably such a entity should also provide centralized arrangement of benefits, payroll, legal documents and other issues. An extreme form would be to have this management company run resource companies that make all hires on pass-through basis and submit a single consolidated bill to the main company each month.<p>Why wouldn't this work? I can think of only three reasons though I'm not convinced any of them are true: Insufficient supply of sufficiently homogenous companies (e.g. software startups); sufficient diversity of preferences for customization, particularly with regard to location to create insufficient density; or fear of poaching due to close proximity to other companies that require the same skillset",1352087499.0

23,4742162,comment,4741353.0,4741353.0,14,0,dizzystar,,,"I came to Clojure after learning Scheme. One would think going from lisp to lisp would be an easy task, but the languages are so different. Clojure is an incredibly rich language, which is why so many blogs talk about how after 6+ months, the team is still trying to grasp all it has to offer. I started by rolling my own over and over again, only to discover a data structure or technique that erases 50 LOC and opens up a whole new world of program reuse. I have zero idea how someone coming from Python, Java, or Ruby would handle the transition, but I imagine it would be very messy at first.<p>I'm not sure why the team used single-letter names. Using non-descriptive arg and function names (if he did that too?)  is about as anti-lisp as it gets.<p>I wonder if this blog, and other blogs like this, do a disservice to the growth of Clojure. Not only is it apparent that using a lisp and immutability is completely alien to the teams adapting it, they seem to take a very long time to ramp up into it, and the conclusion is always the same: they are still slipping and sliding, but at least they aren't breaking their noses anymore. At the same time, these blogs are informative of what companies are likely to get into and it should help stymie the surprises and perhaps keep the noise down for a while, so maybe it helps with growth by attracting those that are really willing to hack it. The author, as most are, is forthcoming with the early mistakes and surprises. This is most certainly to be expected when transitioning to any language, but it doesn't seem like there are many languages where bloggers feel inclined to dote on the initial shock outside of Clojure. It is a wonder that they don't complain about the lack of frameworks a'la RoR/Django and other things one would figure they'd want before diving in. Was it the lack of structure that made them go for it in the first place?",1352087375.0
24,4742161,comment,4740797.0,4742096.0,5,0,raganwald,,,"The word ""presumably"" is the kicker. To ""presume"" is to ""Take for granted in the absence of proof to the contrary."" So, if you don't have any proof that barring people who use a word like ""hoops"" is bad, you take it for granted that it's good.<p>Somebody else can also go ahead and presume that in a company that is in the business of converting human capital into money, diversity of culture can bring new perspectives and ideas that may lead to higher performance. In the absence of proof to the contrary, they'd be taking their own biases for granted as well.<p>In the end, I'm not particularly impressed by the idea that company culture trumps the ability to perform the job in an exemplary fashion. As a long-time manager, I pride myself on getting results from people who have the necessary baseline skills to perform.

Gcc would then compile itself, resulting in an almost certainly clean gcc. If the gcc were compiled by the go compiler, presumably that gcc would be functionally equivalent to any other gcc binary of the same version.

Probably 99+% of any functioning adult's thinking is ""inside-the-box"" (I realize that this is sort of a nebulous/meaningless statement, sorry).  Things that we don't even think about, like looking both ways before crossing the street or watching our step as we get off the bus are all examples of inside-the-box thinking.  But maybe a more interesting example of inside-the-box thinking (in the context of something you might want to actually test) is communicating effectively with other humans of a similar cultural background to your own.<p>So to get back to the portion of the article I quoted and maybe refine my point a bit, maybe it really isn't fair to say that any answer to questions like the farm animal one is more ""natural"" than another, but rather only <i>seems</i> more natural due to the biases of our own mental models that our evolution has optimized for survival rather than to achieve any measure of fundamental truth or purity.  That's perfectly okay to me, as long as the test makes no claim to measure intelligence in any ""fundamental"" sense, but rather in a particular sense of intelligence that arises only as a human being living on earth.  It's entirely a matter of opinion whether such a sense of intelligence is of any interest or relevance, though.  Personally I think it is.",1352084592.0

But I personally do not care about that argument. It is a stupid premise, and gnosis is picking an argument when one is not being forwarded. And he is doing it in a completely fallacious manner (overgeneralization, <i>tu quoque</i>), against what I clearly stated was an anecdote and life lesson.<p>Who does that?

It basically said ""When is it legal to enter the bike lane?"" There were three options, two of which were: ""Within 200 ft of turning right"" and ""When there are no bikes present""<p>I put the answer ""when there are no bikes present,"" which as a bicyclist makes a lot of sense. The correct answer was ""within 200 ft of turning right,"" which is complete and utter bullshit because I got hit by a car less than two weeks prior that entered the bicycle lane to turn right without signaling.<p>If I could get cars ticketed by taking video of violations I would buy a GoPro camera tomorrow.",1352084428.0
