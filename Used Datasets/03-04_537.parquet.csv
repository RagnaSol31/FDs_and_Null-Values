It is important to question why from time to time, so I will address your argument, and I will assume a number more realistic (<i>I don't know what a more realistic number would be, and I'm not going to do your work for you</i>).<p>So you clearly don't know what a realistic figure is, which means you obviously have no clue as to what an unrealistic figure is, yet you're highly critical of his ballpark analogy yet you can't even guesstimate to a figure within the city that the ballpark is in!<p>Perhaps you should ask <i>where</i> the original commenter is from. I grew up in the UK, the government paid for around 800GBP worth of education in night classes I took. I'm not even sure what the price tag on my 2-year certification course was but I'm sure it was a little more than a weekly Psychology and Sociology course.<p>As I've said before here, what pays my bills is using a hammer. At one point I was coding in HTML and PHP while I was 14 in high school, and I was pushed by every faculty member into going to university (I'm assuming to justify their own existence). I would have loved to go to university, I would have loved to have the opportunity to study psychology or ancient history, or some such... there's books for curiosity.<p>I use a hammer, and metal shears, and a drill. These are the basic of the basic, the most mundane objects in existence and I see dozens of intelligent, well educated people walk into a job and quit or get fired because they struggle to use them because of shitty education.<p>I have my woodwork and metalwork teachers to thank for a good education, one that anywhere in the world is guaranteed to pay my bills. Why is our education system set out to target self-actualization when it doesn't even teach us how to achieve our physiological needs.<p>First and foremost we should be teaching our children how to make money; how to work a job. Second, we should be teaching our children how to spend money; avoiding reliance on credit cards and debt traps. The aim is to improve peoples happiness, but without even teaching the basic steps on the hierarchy, it's a fruitless effort.<p>If more money out of my pocket would mean better education for the next generation, I'm happy to do it. I would actually love to see a generation of children told ""you know it's okay to want to do carpentry, or to become a mechanic"". If bashing the frivolity of higher education will get that, then I'll be happy to bash away to get a decent economy and a decent citizenry.",1287806057

Follow along in Python, Ruby, Lua, whatever.<p>Earlier today, somebody asked about parsing. There's much overlap with my answer to that (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1820858"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1820858</a>), though I would doubly recommend getting one of the Appel books.<p>I'm Not A Fan of the old Dragon book. I haven't read the new one or _Engineering a Compiler_ (yet), though.<p>I highly recommend _Essentials of Programming Languages_, though it focuses on interpreters rather than compilers. There's a chapter at the end of the <i>first</i> printing (they cut it from the second and third editions, <i>le sigh</i>) about taking a CPS-based interpreter and turning it into a compiler, too. Very cool.<p>_Lisp in Small Pieces_ has good content about compiling ""dynamic"" languages (with a Lisp-y flavor, of course). The Rabbit and Orbit papers at <a href=""http://library.readscheme.org/page8.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://library.readscheme.org/page8.html</a> are good, too.<p>Also, since you seem to have the same quirky, self-taught background I do - I found tinkering with low-level implementations of Forth to be <i>very</i> helpful in understanding virtual machines. Read the source to jonesforth (<a href=""http://www.annexia.org/forth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.annexia.org/forth</a>) and/or write a Forth in C, it will teach you quite a bit.

Perhaps I am a slow learner, but it took me roughly 6-10 years of writing software, learning programming languages, studying CS fundamentals, learning about libraries, APIs, network protocols, character encodings, security and too many other things to enumerate until I really felt comfortable in my ability as a programmer. The first programs I ever wrote were awful; I looked at them again for the first time in years a while back and was shocked at how bad they were. Even after picking up a programming language or two and learning just enough other stuff to be dangerous, my code was still crap, albeit better crap.

Probably 70% volume as compared to a Model M.<p>After about a month of using the Das Keyboard I started getting some RSI issue which led to me starting the process of switching over to a Kinesis Advantage (the initial learning curve for this keyboard sucks). I really really wish that the Kinesis had level of tactile feedback closer to that of a Model M or Das Keyboard.",1287803262

We also have a fairly robust security model that lets you restrict user/group access to datasets both vertically (filters records meeting criteria) and horizontally (restrict access to certain fields).
