Perhaps it might be related to the fact that babies' brains form new connections at a much faster rate than a thirty year old's whose brain form new connections at a much faster rate than an eighty year old's?<p>If you've played with machine learning, many machine learning algorithms are able to ""learn"" quickly initially but later on, it can less quickly adapt to changes. (Someone more knowledgeable may correct me here).<p>Consider the possibility that old people can have young bodies forever, but their brain / world view / whatever will not fundamentally change from when they were teenagers. i.e old people will continue to think outdated ideas and use outdated technologies, and <i>not die</i>.

I really like it because it crystallized in me the understanding that this is how you figure out systems for which there is no manual or documentation. Observe the working system, inject change in various ways, measure the effects of that change. Rinse and repeat and learn.<p>Once at NetApp there was a question about whether or not we were wasting all of our time randomly seeking the drives (drive seeks being of course the worst if you're looking to improve performance). But the code paths were very complex, asynchronous, and difficult to model. We figured it out by injecting random seeks which was pretty easy to do. You could flood the disk driver with random seeks and get the 'floor' of performance, then you could back off on the random seek injection to see where performance started to pick up. That told us that counter to our thinking we weren't actually being plagued by seeks, the performance issue was elsewhere in the system.<p>That the ants had, through natural selection, derived a congestion control system that is very close to the TCP one is a fun result because it suggests that the TCP one is probably close to optimal.

23,4434258,comment,4433991.0,4433991.0,2,0,squonk,,,"There are attributes of American society that enable the country to excel, and which have nothing to do with quality of public education. First, parents in general are less active in managing their kids' time than other countries. Kids have more leeway to determine what they do with their time. Many do slack off, or get into trouble, and sometimes it is serious. But many others find out what really interests them. They are not told they have to prepare to be a doctor, lawyer or engineer. They are more likely to be able to try everything and see where their mind returns to over and over. No cookie cutters or escalators.<p>Second, we have a different view of failure than many other nations. The relatively low social and legal consequence of failure allows Americans to stand back up, shake off the failure and try again. Think about how many restaurants there are and the number that will fail within a year or two. It is millions of failures annually.  In Germany, for example, if a business does not notify its creditors 30 days before running out of cash, the president can go to prison. In the US, a business has no requirement to ever notify their creditors at all. We seem to see failure as a consequence of taking a risk, not as a scarlet letter. To never fail, is to never try.<p>If you combine the two, we have a society where people not only have a better opportunity to discover their passions, they feel much less encumbered by the prospect of failure than in other countries. Passion drives innovation, creativity, persistence and the competitive spirit. Can you imagine Apple, Microsoft, Walmart, Amazon, MacDonald's or any other 'huge success' without a passionate, risk-taking founder? Even Subway has such a story.<p>The product of our education system may not do as well on tests as their peers from other countries, but when they get into college and choose a major, they are more likely to be passionate and self-motivated and excel in their chosen curriculum.<p>Our educational system needs help, there is no doubt. Since my grade school days, funding for the arts has completely disappeared. Schools are run down to the point of being shameful. But the key ingredients that produce greatness are still there.",1345953034.0

Remember that no one is compelled to go on the missions.  We don't know what we don't know.  Humans are naturally curious and natural explorers - look at what happened in the late 15th and 16th centuries.  The various voyages that are celebrated (eg Columbus) were definitely not made based on evidence!  There was a 90% mortality rate on the first British settlements in the US in that timeframe.  At the beginning of the 20th century we had mad dashes for the poles.  (They could and sometimes did fly over them which is ""better"" based on evidence.)  In the middle of the century some people got to the top of Mt Everest and came back again - again pointless about the evidence.  Lots of people died in these explorations.  I think it is just fine encouraging people to explore.  The only valid question is how much to subsidise it via tax payer's money.  To put it into perspective in the US:  ""The entire running budget of NASA since it's inception in 1958 adds up to $526.18 billion. That's about $173 billion less than the 2008 bank bailout.""<p>As for your pollution etc issues, it really is worth looking into the facts.  From Matt Ridley's Rational Optimist:  ""When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s, the future of the world was bleak. The population explosion was unstoppable. Global famine was inevitable. A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives. The acid rain was falling on the forests. The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year. The oil was running out, and a nuclear winter would finish us off. None of those things happened, (Laughter) and astonishingly, if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime, the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet, in real terms, adjusted for inflation, has tripled. Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime. Child mortality is down by two-thirds. Per-capita food production is up by a third. And all this at a time when the population has doubled.""<p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_ridley_when_ideas_have_sex.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_ridley_when_ideas_have_sex.htm...</a>",1345951564.0

If the average Joe thinks that the Toyota is the Ford, then I think it goes beyond the line of emulation.</i><p>Demonstrably false.  The foreman, for instance, is the owner of a patent for a variant of DVR (""Method and apparatus for recording and storing video information"").<p>>> <i>Old people there are even less respectful, they just don't care you exist.</i><p>Agree to disagree.<p>>> <i>Samsung even uses Apple icons as part of their wallpaper at their own ""white"" brick & mortar stores....I don't understand why Samsung would have to make their brick & mortar stores identical to Apple, and even have the same style of genius bar inside...In the countries where the name ""genius bar"" is not a registered trademark, Samsung actually uses that exact name. For the countries that have the registered trademark, they call them smart tutors. It's \ncrazy how deep the copying goes.</i><p>You seem to think that this judgment is ""fair"" because Samsung is a ""bad cloning company"".  That's fine, and you are entitled to your opinion.  Please understand that their evilness is not really central here.<p>I don't think anyone here is arguing that Samsung is a particularly innovative company.  However, their brick & mortar stores have very little bearing on whether or not UI elements in rows of 4 consist of an infringement on Apple's IP.  Routinely bringing up their company (or country's) culture as an example for how terrible they are is essentially an ad hominem attack.<p>The fact is that the court did come down <i>strongly</i> in Apple's favor, and ruled that <i>quite innocuous and non-obvious</i> elements of Samsung's design were an infringement of Apple's IP.  How anyone can think that this may not have far reaching implications for technological innovation is beyond me.",1345950369.0
