The site is straightforward. I see the reviews, but is there something more going on here that I'm not noticing? Why would someone want to use your site instead of Google?<p>I think an online course review site is nice, but there's a lot more that you could possibly do here.  Why not setup ""degree"" programs which are a curated selection of courses from across the net and lead people down a journey on a specific topic? Why not instructor profile pages that can track the quality of the sum of their materials online?<p>Maybe these points don't matter if this is just something you're doing for fun. But if this is for profit, I'm not sure where you business model is. (And I'd be happy to discuss the above ideas with you.)<p>Just my two cents.<p>PS: Would LOVE to see a way to delete my account afterward.",1341026148.0

Whether or not you liked it is irrelevant given that your judgements were based on an acquired understanding of Linux, and a terse at best understanding of Mac OS X.<p>Let's just take your git example:<p>> <i>More recently, I tried to install Git on OS X (without administrator access). It was a horrible pain, so now I only ever log on to the Linux servers at school</i><p>How exactly was it more difficult on Mac OS X? Did you try to ./configure && make && make install by hand, just like on Linux-sans-admin-access? Or did you try to use MacPorts' or homebrew's support for running without admin access, and simply tried '(port|brew) install git'?<p>Or, let's talk about Java:<p>> <i>I did use OS X for Java development for a whole year.</i><p>During that whole year, you never stumbled onto Apple Menu -> Software Update? It runs automatically, you don't even have to invoke it manually.<p>You never googled ""Mac"" and ""Java"" and determined that Apple provided the Mac port of Java? Assuming this was in the time period of the 1.5 release, you never found Soylatte using Google, and used that?<p>Or, your friend with the LaTeX problem:<p><pre><code>  port install texlive\n</code></pre>\nWorks fine.",1341025905.0

No patents issued - people just did it.<p>The fact that these programs were written tells us that software writers innovate regardless of whether patents are issued for their work or not.
