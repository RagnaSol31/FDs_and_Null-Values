My approach is:<p>1.  All code examples must lead to a working program, or can be easily integrated into a working program.  Preferably the program has trivial functionality.  Conceptual material must relate back to a working example.<p>2.  Avoid applying excessive cognitive load to the readers.  Human short term memory has a capacity of 72 items.  Your material must be pitched at a level where there is a maximum of five concepts in play at any one time (five being the maximum &quot;guaranteed&quot; short term memory for a healthy adult).  This is much easier to acheive with goal 1 as it the approach guides the writer as to which item needs to be explained next.<p>From that perspective, unix man  pages drive me nuts.
