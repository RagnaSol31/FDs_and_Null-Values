Your life is wrecked up by a mix of bad decisions and bad luck, and the solution is to:<p>• Don't panic;\n• Find a support group, even if it's just an informal group of friends;\n• Seek employment counseling when available;\n• Be professional in your job hunt;\n• Network with other professionals;\n• Take time to exercise during hard times;\n• Spend valuable time with your family.<p>Ah, good! I was about to panic, become a hermit, be unprofessional in my job hunt, and avoid my family.<p>Okay, some of that advice is mildly valuable, but without additional detail, ""Don't panic"" is totally vacuous. Yeah, you're not going to be wrong, but it's not insightful either. It's why I typically avoid mainstream TV/newspapers - lots of unqualified ""Don't panic"" and ""remember to exercise"" type advice.",1233201545.0

(Yes, some disks, especially the flash ones, support a lot more IOs/sec than others.)  If you're IOs bound, you either have spare disk space or can probably increase the amount of disk space at a sublinear price.  (1.5TB drives are <3x as expensive as 500GB.)<p>For some data transfers, AWS has a ""per operation"" charge in addition to a bandwidth charge.  The latter is proportional to file size but the former is not.<p>My application has a lot of processing costs.  Most of them are on metadata, not the images, so they don't grow with image size.  I also do a lot of stuff with ""thumbed"" images - producing them is a function of file size but storing them and moving them around isn't.<p>My model is different from yours in at least two ways.<p>(1) I'm estimating some things.<p>(2) I'm using AWS and GAE prices.  (I'm assuming the highest prices because if my app is getting enough use that I'm getting bulk discounts, I've got other problems.)<p>If I had a model that tracked my actual experience, I wouldn't listen to some bozo on a website....<p>FWIW, data in a db is significantly larger than the actual data.",1233200330.0

Unfortunately, I think they are getting harder and harder to do (and ergo fewer and fewer people have the skills necessary to do them (retraining at the local community college, just won't do)).<p>The other problem seems to be that they are longer term problems with much lower success rates.  Businesses, and I get the feeling VCs, are focused on the sure thing with a high return in a short time period.

No surprise there; people are less thoughtful when they don't have to put their identity behind their words.  The second phenomena is when someone tries to make a name for themselves by criticizing something or someone popular.  Again, no surprise; it's been shown to be an effective way to get attention.<p>I don't really have a solution for either of these problems, but I think it's important to make the distinction between these two cases.",1233198603.0

It's that if you gave them the choice between a forced stream, like the way Netflix streams movies, or a file that downloaded as quickly as possible, persisted, and could be viewed as it came in if your connection is good enough, they'll take the second one every time. The only way ""streaming"" wins is when it has something that isn't available that second way.
