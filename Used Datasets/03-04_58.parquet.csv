In other words, the cost per person might actually be significantly lower to provide services for 1million people than it would be to provide services for 20 million people. And maybe this isn't due to a government 'inefficiency' (mismanagement of funds), but rather an inefficiency that is inherent in the design of our cities and services (Meaning: Long term problem requiring redesign of many services in order to increase spending efficiency).<p>So really, I think it's far more important to question:\n1) How has the cost for these public services scaled with the population in the past?\n2) Based on that, how do I think the cost of the these public services scale with the population in the foreseeable future?\n3) Is this increase in expenditure due to wasteful mismanagement of funds, or a design problem in our cities and services?",1282708541.0

I plan to get an Italian pre-paid SIM card, since I'm told this is the most inexpensive way to use my phone for calls while there. My question is about using my phone for data. The whole point in taking my own phone is that I'd like to use the GPS, maps and so on. I'm not finding much info on getting data with these pre-paid SIM cards. Do they tend to include data? If not, do you have another suggestion?<p>Thanks.",1282705695.0

This representation is really cool, because it looks like what it represents (an isomorphism): you can ""see"" the level in a png editor, even though what you're seeing is not the actual level.<p>Another aspect of how the data representation drives the game, is that there are no explicit arcs between game screens - instead, the screen design allows your character to walk off-screen, then that point enables you to transition to the next screen. I guess it's the most obvious way to do it: it's as if you are zoomed into a particular section of the 10x10 maps, and then you can move to adjacent maps. Maybe it's just that I've spent too much time with nodes and arcs recently :-), expecting logical concepts to be explicitly specified, instead of implied by the design. Anyway, there is no sequential index to get to a particular screen; you have to follow the path. Or you can look at that png. eg, the final boss screen is at <i>xLevel=3</i>, <i>yLevel=10</i> (you can initialize those values in <i>GameScreen.java</i>; and you need to change the player start location too, because now it's not derived from the previous screen: change the last two args in the following <i>new Level</i> line, from 0,0 to 10,10).",1282705694.0

Here's some funding data for the UC system, which has a downward trend in per-student terms since around 1990, except for a brief upward blip during the dot-com boom, and is now lower than it's ever been (as far back as I can find data, anyway):<p><pre><code>  Year  State funding (2010 $)  Enrollment  Per-student funding (2010 $)\n  1965  $1.37 billion              59,000   $23,000\n  1970  $1.84b                     73,000   $25,000\n  1975  $2.31b                     84,000   $28,000\n  1980  $2.75b                     94,000   $29,000\n  1985  $3.23b                    108,740   $30,000\n  1990  $3.47b                    125,044   $28,000\n  1995  $2.68b                    123,948   $22,000\n  2000  $3.94b                    141,028   $28,000\n  2005  $3.09b                    158,933   $19,000\n  2010  $3.02b                    181,520   $17,000\n</code></pre>\nThat probably understates the decline somewhat, because the cost of living in California has grown faster than inflation, so funding should probably be adjusted against a wage index of some sort. Going by pure inflation-calculator adjustments like I used in the above table assumes that you can pay staff in 2010 the same salary as they would get 1965, adjusted only for inflation. That would mean getting professors for around $55,000, sysadmins for around $45,000, etc., which you aren't going to have much luck with.<p>Benefits outside this direct funding were much more generous in my parents' generation also--- my dad went to a <i>private</i> university in California with his tuition mostly paid by the state, courtesy of the Calgrants program, which used to pay for any California student with grades above a certain level and with financial need to attend any California university, public or private. So to some extent it is sort of annoying that a generation that benefited from those kinds of programs, getting their degree without incurring student-loan debt, <i>now</i> thinks that they need to be cut.",1282705396.0
