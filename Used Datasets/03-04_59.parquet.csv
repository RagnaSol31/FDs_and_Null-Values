This eliminates super's job of allowing programmers to differentiate between base classes with conflicting method implementations.<p>Without this, Go requires you to design your class hierarchy in a way that is cleaner, but the super concept is still not superfluous -- because you do sometimes need to reference an ancestor's implementation in Go.<p>You embed an interface and then explicitly reference the embedded interface by name. The Go interface<p><pre><code>  type ReaderWriter interface {\n    Reader\n    Writer\n  }\n</code></pre>\nis exactly like this Python<p><pre><code>  class ReaderWriter(Reader, Writer):\n    pass\n</code></pre>\nTo get at a particular superclass implementation, you pass the class to super, like so:<p><pre><code>  def read_and_write(self):\n    super(Reader).read()\n    super(Writer).write()\n</code></pre>\nwhich in Go is:<p><pre><code>  func (rw *ReaderWriter) ReadAndWrite() {\n    rw.Reader.read()\n    rw.Writer.write()\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nSo it's not superfluous -- there's an equivalent syntax to super which involves referencing embedded interfaces.",1306468730.0

That'd be around 46 million people.<p>Even if only 1% of PayPal's users were dissatisfied you'd have much more activity than a couple dozen forum posts a month spread across the web and an outdated PayPalSucks site. That'd be over 2 million people with a reason to vehemently complain. The level of chatter you hear makes it much more likely that significantly less than 1% of their user base has serious problems with the service.<p>No, I'm not using a different product than you. I've been using the plain-jane standard PayPal payment links and subscriptions since 2000. I'm not immune to their risk department either; someone called me just this month to express concern at my account's refund rate after I cancelled some suspicious looking orders.<p>I'm sure my account has enough notes on it that I'm a single mis-step away from being frozen myself through no fault of my own. But that's nothing less than I'd expect from any of my payment providers. This is business, I understand why their policies are what they are, and I'm prepared for the chance that they may choose to stop doing business with me at some point in time. A little bit of basic knowledge about the financial industry they operate in and you'd run your risk department the same way.<p>For a good read, get a copy of the book ""Founders at Work: Stories of Startups' Early Days"". One of the stories is that of the founding and early growth of PayPal. The only reason they are here today, where their great many competitors during the dot-com boom aren't, is that they figured out how to manage fraud risk. They were hemmorhaging tens of millions of dollars a month to fraud losses, but they held on long enough to build the risk management systems you need to provide payment processing to the masses.",1306467589.0

We quickly found it had serious negative impacts on site rankings. We spent considerable time working directly with Google and the other search engine crawl teams on a solution.

I'm not shy there just isn't enough time in the day to explain some things to everyone I meet, so I just don't want to open up some can of worms.  Still, I wrestle with this process where I seem to gradually be working on developing an online audience where the relationship is inherently lopsided:  Other people often know a great deal more about me than I know about them.

When my wife and I moved to Denver I got an old fashioned dead tree map out and put a pin where she worked and a pin where I worked. I then took a string that would be the longest commute that my wife would accept and did the same for myself. We then searched for apartments in that location. It was a good system but it didn't help us find the apartment we ultimatley choose. I didn't take in to consideration a major highway and the effect that would have on the commute time. An App that had an estimated drive time function would be great. Then create profiles for each person and the app could logarithmically show areas that would have least amount of commute for both parties. Incorporate a Apartment, Rental (house/condo), and real estate finder and you got yourself a killer App for people moving. Lots of marketing synergy and in App ad/purchasing possibilities too.",1306466154.0

I aim to do more and more of my production code in Fexl if possible.  The hedge fund accounting software I wrote in Perl is quite complex, managing a large amount of intricate state.  I chose to represent all that state as a completely flat key-value store in memory, where I write out the keys that changed at the end of each batch.<p>Naturally that approach seems at odds with a purely functional language such as Fexl, but I'm trying to overcome that apparent mismatch by just doing the key-value stuff in Fexl.<p>There are some fans of Fexl out there, myself included, who are not yet completely clear on how to use it for production code.  The jury's still out.  I hope that samples like this will help.",1306465910.0

77,2590306,comment,2589440.0,2590191.0,6,0,barrkel,,,"Prison: rehabilitation, punishment, deterrent, segregation. Punishment is largely about the victims, justice being seen to be done, etc.; it shouldn't affect crime rates in ways that don't also come under rehabilitation or deterrence. Segregation (keeping dangerous people apart from the main population) is not relevant to our discussion here, I think.<p>Is slave labour rehabilitating? More or less rehabilitating than productive labour? A net wash? I personally think education would be more rehabilitating. Perhaps that can be combined with labour? Probably not chain-gang type labour though.<p>Deterrence, I'm more skeptical of. I don't think prison time has a lot of net impact on crime. Someone on the point of committing a crime, but with their rational thinking cap on, may be evaluating their expected punishment; but that expected punishment will be moderated by their expected chances of getting caught. Obviously, if they expect to get caught, they would not rationally choose to commit a crime; therefore, very drastic changes in punishments need to be applied in order to stay significant after the criminal has taken into account the chances of being caught. (Yes, there's risk / reward calculations where very high rewards may justify taking higher risks so the expected punishment has higher effects, but I think big bank robberies etc. are not the majority of crime we need to be worried about, at least outside of white collar crime, which does need more focus.)<p>And that's all with the rational thinking cap on. Other crimes where rationality appears to be less evident - I'd guess most non-organized violence, for example - the punishment is very far from mind, if it's in mind at all.<p>I think if you're truly interested in reducing crime rates, what you have to focus on is increasing the probability of criminals getting caught and convicted, so that deterrence is credible. Reducing repeat offenders requires more focus on rehabilitation. Fiddling with the punishment in and of itself is, IMO, unlikely to have a large impact unless it's a disproportionate change, which would make it unjust.",1306465648.0
