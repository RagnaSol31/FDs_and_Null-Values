12,215617,comment,215112.0,215481.0,0,0,metajack,,,"For me it was not an issue of complexity.  We use trac internally and we contribute to other projects that have similar guidelines for contribution (namely Twisted Python).<p>But the Django trac is quite hostile.  Often your patch will be closed as a duplicate by a later patch.  Sometime that later patch addresses a related but different problem.  It's hard to get someone with ""responsibility"" to address the issue, even if the patch is fairly well done and rationale well documented.<p>When I say ""continually fight"" I mean that the bug is closed with some bogus explanation, and I have to go reopen it and provide yet more explanation, only to have it closed again.  Months later someone smacks their forehead and says ""Oh! Well in that case I'll commit this now"".  I feel like I've been treated like a child who just learned HTML and not a developer trying to make contributions to the project.<p>In comparison, Twisted bugs involve dialog, but the Twisted team doesn't go around closing bugs because they don't quite get what you're doing.  They have strict code guidelines and policies, but at least they treat you respectfully the whole way through.  It's not a fight.  They also recently went through and committed many changes that had been abandoned by their authors or that the authors did not have time to finish tests for.  This shows that they value their community's contributions a great deal.<p>Django is a great project in many ways, but it has a lot of room to improve with release and community management.",1213241555

22,215606,comment,214584.0,214856.0,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> W.B. actively goes out to seek and create value<p>I would dispute this.  Berkshire Hathaway is essentially an insurance company.  Look at revenues.  Buffet relies on the peculiar accounting tricks of global insurance and his special relationships in the industry to line up unusual access to ultra-cheap capital at opportune times to seize value opportunities.  Buffet is not just another billionaire investor with sharp analysis.  He has a bag of special tricks and special relationships.  He is just a speculator, not a value creator.<p>The main point I took away is that speculation is a zero sum game, which is practically a truism.  Getting returns above the general rate of growth requires outsmarting other investors and pocketing their losses.  Total returns are constrained to the general growth rate.  You are quite right that many people win at this zero sum game.<p>Buffet seems to endorse the fraudulent popular idea that everyone can fund retirement from the stock market by sharing in the general rate of return.  In reality the stock market has historically barely beat inflation and equities investing is really pretty much a straight-up zero sum game.",1213240304

25,215603,comment,215410.0,215410.0,0,0,art_wells,,,"Whether it's a blog or a network or a community tool addon thingy, what you need most is to let people know that their contributions are both need and likely not redundant to others.  Polls can get the ball rolling, but they are a gamble.  Nothing is sadder than a three-day-old poll with two votes.  Nothing is stopping you from boosting those numbers behind the scenes, though.<p>Don't expect people to chime in in a reaction to a specifically popular or unpopular opinion.  ""Me too"" and ""Screw you"", despite their popularity in popular spots, are no fun to write and won't be written, even if strongly felt, in an empty room.  Expressing a unique, rare, and non-antagonistic opinion, and then asking for others, is more likely to get reactions than ""I like music, do you like music?"" or ""Taxes suck, am I right?""<p>Also, invite pride.  If people have profiles or pages, let them create something that they can point others too.  Allow for long, weird contributions.",1213239840
