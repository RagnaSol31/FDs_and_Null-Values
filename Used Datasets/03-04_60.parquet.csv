In small companies, they're hard as hell and don't pay very well, especially when one considers the career risk. If you're CEO of a startup and it fails, you're going to have a hard time getting someone to fund you again. In large companies, they're easy and pay very well. So there's a bizarre discrepancy (an inverse relationship, in fact) between difficulty of the job and compensation.<p>In a small company, the CEO job is so hard that only 1 person in 20 (if that) has the ability to do it. Getting the CEO right is crucial. In a large company whose founders have already left, you're talking about smooth-running machines and who gets the top jobs generally comes down to social climbing more than anything else.",1314503605.0

How much more direct is a call sent to someone's cell phone, or a letter to their mailbox, than a tweet sent to their Twitter home page?<p>A letter shows up tangibly in your mailbox no matter what you do, and the same with a phone call. You can choose to ignore those, but they will show up and can still disturb you. A Tweet is a little more intangible, it's quiet until one to chooses to look at it.

Even most if people are just doing it as a workout, it seems like part of what draws people to it is that it gives them some vague feeling of connection with something in the collective unconscious, even if they never explicitly explore its history or its role as a spiritual tool. And even just that in and of itself seems to provide some spiritual benefit.<p>I have no doubt that people basically just want the benefits of some thousand year old tradition, but packaged in a way that reinforces their preexisting worldview. Which strikes me as absurd, but at least I can kind of understand it. But even still, I think the fact that it's something that people have been doing for thousands of years has to inherently change people's posture, no pun intended.",1314502872.0

49,2933193,comment,2933102.0,2933153.0,6,0,geuis,,,"I think there is a relatively well-defined, if somewhat broad, line that borders between free speech and harassment.<p>For example, suppose that I were to write a couple of articles saying what a bad, unreliable programmer you were. Any time someone asked me what I thought of your programming skills, I would tell them that they're lousy and no one should hire you. Further, I go on to Twitter, Google+, HN, and Facebook and make a few comments about what a bad experience I had working with you. Maybe some of the people I know also know you.<p>In my understanding, that scenario isn't harassment but it is free speech. I'm not making direct personal attacks against you and I'm not threatening you, although I'm not saying great things about you. There might be a case for civil libel there, but it would be a tough argument and would most likely need to be solved in court via lawsuit.<p>Now lets take that scenario further. I think you're a shitty, horrible human being. Not only do I write a couple of articles about what a bad programmer you are, I go on to talk about how anyone that knows you should kick you in the ass or push you in front of a car. I start finding out background info like where you live, who your family is, what your phone number is. I start giving out all of your personal information. I start calling your house at odd hours, breathing heavy, and hanging up. I do that 20x a night for weeks on end. You change your number. I find out what your new one is. On Twitter, I create hundreds of fake accounts and send you DM's and @'s with some really awful messages. I start dropping indirect hints that I think you deserve to die. I do the same thing anywhere I can find you online.<p>Now in that 2nd, really fucked up scenario, that's harassment. I get arrested and my lawyer claims that was my free speech. Total bullshit.<p>So when I say I believe there's a well-defined but broad line it encompasses those two extremes.<p>I believe the big defining difference is that if I say or do something <i>to</i> you, that's personal. If I say something <i>about</i> you, it leans towards public. There's of course all kinds of ways I can say stuff about you and have it be very personal though.<p>So I think that issues like this are going to often be on a case-by-case basis because it can cover a range of scenarios. I might say something about you that you feel is harassment while to any 3rd party observer its obviously free speech, and vice-versa.",1314501899.0

Nor is it like American-style corruption where every voter understands that money buys influence, except in the case of their own congressmen, whom they believe to be honest people who are forced to take corporate money so they can survive in Washington and do some good.  That kind of corruption flows both ways:  the corrupt congressman uses his power to reel in undeserved favors and unnecessary spending for his constituents.  It's a quid pro quo.  Americans are conflicted.  I'm sure Indians are similarly conflicted about the corruption that brings services or economic growth to their districts, but they are not conflicted about paying bribes or having public property appropriated by government officials.  They are also not conflicted about corrupt relationships between corporations and politicians where the politicians' constituents are the ones who get screwed.  This is not a problem of incentives.  This is a problem of investigation and enforcement.  Do you expect citizens to punish politicians themselves, vigilante-style, on the basis of rumors that have never been investigated?<p>The disruption to the constitutional balance of power is something I take seriously, but the accounts of what the Lokpal Bill actually does vary widely.  From my understanding, the Lokpal resembles a special prosecutor's office.  It has the power and resources to investigate, and it has the power to bring cases to the courts.  When it is said that various government offices are ""under the purview"" of the Lokpal, it just means they can be investigated and prosecuted, just like any official in the United States government can be investigated (and almost all of them can be prosecuted.)<p>Now, I could have been misled about what the Lokpal actually is, but I have to say that its supporters have been more specific about the limits of its powers, while the detractors have been very vague and hand-wavy.  They say it sets up a new branch of government and disrupts the separation of powers, but the same was said about the United States' independent counsel (the most famous of whom was Kenneth Starr:)<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Counsel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Counsel</a><p>I think we take it for granted in the United States that if an official is breaking the law (and not just enjoying legal corruption) that some agency, probably more than one, will have the authority, the resources, and an official mandate to investigate the crime.  As far as I know, that's all the Lokpal Bill is trying to accomplish.  I don't see what's wrong with that.",1314501219.0
