Simplicity will fall naturally out of the process of refining derivatives markets. Insurance is a derivative. Options are derivatives. Common Stock is actually arguably a derivative as well. Welcome to capitalism! \nComplexity is born of there being lots of people on Earth who trade goods and services. No way back except to wish calamity on us all?,1316318148.0

A tax affecting the lower end of the rich puts a barrier to entry into the ranks of the megarich. Lowering the cost of real estate, airplanes and businesses for him.<p>Can't we all just have a flat consumption tax and be done with it? 10% would benefit everyone (in particular retirees and savers), increase actual collections and be simpler to administrate (you get to fire a bunch of government employees). Increased revenue, reduced complexity, favouring savings.

Confidence in this instance is just trust that your assets won't suddenly become worthless or your standard of living won't drop drastically overnight. It is a GOOD thing that I have the choice to have or not have confidence in the Government. It means (a) I am not expected to have blind faith and (b) I have the right to assess the level of risk involved in trading and conduct my economic activities accordingly. I absolutely need the Government to restore consumer confidence in the housing market before I buy a new house.

With a revenue model so heavily dependent on pageviews, they need to keep their users engaged and on the site... and that doesn't appear to be the case over the long term.

It has for me and most everyone else I know who started using it when it was a shiny new toy exclusively for college students.<p>Facebook can't keep up the rate of new user acquisition it has enjoyed for the past couple of years forever - and as the userbase collectively ages, interest wanes, pageviews decline, and revenue drops off.

21,3009421,comment,3009350.0,3009350.0,6,0,byoung2,,,"The html5 geolocation API allows your browser to share your location using the most accurate source available.  On a smartphone, this is the GPS antenna (when it's on), cell tower triangulation, or WiFi geolocation.  The WiFi location works because you can register your location on sites such as Skyhook, and Google collects this data when they drive the street view cars around.  On a desktop or laptop, this is usually WiFi or IP address (keep in mind you don't have to actually join the network, just be in range of one, so it could be a neighbor's).  With IP addresses, you can very accurately determine the country, and a general region, since IP blocks are usually assigned to ISP's, so if you are a cable customer, you can be traced to the nearest hop from your house, which will be about a 50-100 mile radius in most of the US.  For a more accurate position, here's where the privacy concerns come in.  There are companies like MaxMind that gather data on individual IP addresses.  In their words:<p><i>MaxMind partners with various websites where users are asked to enter some form of geographical location information. The IP address and location data are forwarded to MaxMind after all personally identifiable information have been scrubbed to protect privacy concerns. MaxMind then runs millions of these IP location pairs through a series of algorithms and programs that identify, extract, and extrapolate relevant associations between IP address and geographical information.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.maxmind.com/app/ip-location-explained"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maxmind.com/app/ip-location-explained</a><p>So think about that the next time you fill out a form online.
