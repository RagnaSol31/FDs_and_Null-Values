It's things like thinking in terms of <i>repetition</i>, or <i>values</i> or <i>control flow</i> or <i>composition</i>, or even just <i>sequences</i> that I think are the fundamental literacy elements.

Writing prepares you like nothing else for that because it 'freezes' your thoughts to the point where you can analyze them.,1268625166

It reads like a cross between ""Chicken Soup"" and ""Dr. Seuss"".<p>Examples: the book is 288 pages but only 30,000 words; every other page is an illustration, and most pages are only 3/4 full; footnotes are rare, and usually reference some pop-biz online piece from Forbes or BusinessWeek.<p>The final chapter (on culture) was very good. It's a topic that doesn't require any rigor to be effective. But the rest of the book was actually one of the more disappointing reads of the last 12 months.<p>Edit: I'm sorry this is so negative.

To be honest, if you are not disciplined enough to moonlight and work on your startup and give away zero equity and actually earn the $6,000 it takes to live on for a few months to then quit your job and build your idea full time, you probably shouldn't start a startup in the first place.\nno, I have not made it yet; but I'm damn sure I'm right about the above.\nThanks for reading.

Also, as trains become more popular, they will eventually become subject to the same security hassles as air travel.<p>So I'm not directly contradicting you. Trains will always be more spacious and allow more freedom to move about and dine in comfort than planes. I think they have a definite role to fill (any trip between 100 miles and 600 miles in length assuming decent speeds of 150mph+). I'm just saying the future is going to be a heterogeneous mix of transportation options.<p>Of course, if someone builds a train that moves at jet speeds, all bets are off.",1268622088
