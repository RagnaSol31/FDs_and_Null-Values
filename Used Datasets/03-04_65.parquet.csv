My aforementioned cooperative multitasking hackery involved inheriting from a base ""coroutine-able"" class that, among other things, kept a per-instance execution stack that would be updated by the dispatching loop depending on the value yielded by the generator. The end result would look something like this:<p><pre><code>  def foo(self):\n      spam = 1\n      while True:\n          yield self.call(self.spam_and_eggs, spam)\n          spam += 1\n\n  def spam_and_eggs(self, spam):\n      print (""spam, "" * spam) + ""and eggs""\n      if spam >= 20:\n          yield self.halt()\n      else:\n          yield self.wait(2)\n      yield self.ret()\n</code></pre>\nWhich would print another item off the menu every other cycle of the dispatcher loop, until 20 ""spams"" at which point the ""thread"" would stop.<p>Other actions included a goto (clear the stack and jump to a new generator method), conditional waits (keep running the thread unless, say, 2 miliseconds have elapsed since it started this cycle), and ""message passing"" between threads (push something onto another instance's stack). The main <i>downside</i> was that stack traces from exceptions inside a faux-thread were singularly useless, though I was working on some debugging tools for code using it.<p>The guts of it amounted to maybe a few hundred lines of code, most of which is the dispatch loop and bookkeeping for message queues. One of these days I ought to clean it up and post the code on the web somewhere, but unfortunately I'm currently in a somewhat sticky spot and looking for work (and I fear that spending more time on things like building cooperative multitasking in Python than things to further my humdrum day-job career has not been a great help thus far).",1253591265

20,836196,comment,835919.0,835919.0,0,0,bokonist,,,"How is this different than typical multi-variable regressions with control variables?<p>The problem with social science is that it tries to be a science but in reality its closest relative is product management.  Using even the best statistical methods still runs into the keys/lamp post problem.  There are too many variables, the variables are not well defined, the variables may have strange interactions, there may be too much noise in the data, etc.  In almost all social science situations, you cannot find truth solely through regressions.<p>For instance, recently I was studying the issue of whether the crash in the stock market caused the fall in consumer spending, or the slow down in consumer spending caused the fall in the stock market.  If you run a straight regression you'll have a lot of problems because a) even if the stock market falls first, it could have been because of expectations of future consumption b) the data on expenditures is not collected frequently enough, and c) there are other potentially confounding variables.<p>But if you take the product management approach you can listen to what people say.  And when you listen, you find that people say stuff like, ""After the stock market fell, I had to cut back my plans to travel."" or ""Since the fall in our endowment, we have had to suspend spending on all new projects.""  By simply <i>asking people</i> you can figure out the causality.<p>Note that this is how every company in the world makes most of its decisions ( except perhaps Google,  because they actually enough controlled data to meaningfully do regressions).  When we're trying to figure out what features to build, we do customer interviews, follow-me-homes, surveys, feature requests, talk to customer support, etc.  We make very modest use of statistics, because we do not have large amounts of controlled data.  Did the customer not use this part of the app because it was not useful, or because we got the label wrong, or because of something else?  We could do a bunch of statistics, but what's the point?  It won't answer those questions.  Asking people may be subjective, but it's the only way (keys/lamppost).<p>The problem is that social scientists do not get promoted for making accurate judgments and being right.  A product manager does.  A social scientist/academic can only be judged by his methods.  Thus there is the preference within the professions for methods that can be objectively evaluated, and methods that only a select elite can perform.\n Being right is not part of the selection process for being an academic.",1253590532

Once an agency is reviewing business practices for compliance with political ideals, where does it stop?<p>We need no federal 'neutrality' rules for newspapers, magazines, or books; we shouldn't need them for electronic communications, either.

Right now, the only applications which are signed are ones which specifically benefit from being signed -- most often, ones which store passwords in the Keychain. (Signing such an application makes the Keychain treat it as still the ""same application"" after an upgrade, rather than requiring it to be reauthorized.) So, if Apple suddenly started requiring desktop apps to be signed, everything unsigned on the market (probably 90% of applications available) would stop working. This would be an incredibly stupid decision.<p>Moreover, almost all existing signed applications are signed with a key that isn't in any chain of trust (and there's no currently available system for setting up specially trusted keys), and there's no scheme for encrypting signed applications. So there's nothing keeping users from either removing a signature from an application or replacing it with a copy signed with their own key.<p>Conclusion? Code signing is not a sinister plot to take away your freedom. It does exactly what the documentation says. Here's the docs.

Everything online is free, so it's no differentiator any more and the few bands who could get a bit of press from it have gotten it now. But how can we actually <i>connect</i> with listeners online?<p>Services like thesixtyone.com are a good start. For those artists who want to put that effort in (and figure out how), they can connect with listeners as peers in a system. And that's a start.<p>The iTunes LP is another attempt at the online <i>experience</i> but we'll see whether that proves to actually provide a real experience people want. I'm hopeful myself.<p>So, what else? Virtual concerts? extras? ideas? :)",1253588837

This method actually bothers me, as it seems to spin ""counting on you not remembering to cancel"" as ""doing you a favor, so you don't have to get out your credit card to actually sign up down the road."" But maybe I'm being overly sensitive on that?<p>Have you tried multiple approaches? Has anyone done A/B testing on signup flows? I'd love anything you have ... anecdotes, data, whatever.<p>If it matters, the startup I'm working on at the moment has a freemium model, with a free (but feature-limited) version, and a paid (or multiple tiers of paid) version. The market is freelancers, self-employed people, and, to some extent, small businesses.",1253588757

I do not embed any JavaScript in the page rather, I grab any dom elements that I need via JavaScript so that way there is a clean separation between code and HTML. I tend to prefer Dojo as far as frameworks, so i will use dojo.byId or dijit.byId to grab references to my nodes in my page init function.<p>I intentionally make my controller file procedural and then I have a custom life-cycle event controller that fires off events for  page init, reload, load data, page unload, etc.. so my developers can just fill in the blanks. Any data access is done by calling methods on a service facade which again is purposefully procedural.  The service facade then calls any server side services we need (we don't do form posts any more, JSON is far more robust for submitting data). Finally, we use Dijit for any of our widget and any of our model / utility / OO needs.<p>I know it's no purely JavaScript best practices, and it is more related to project file layout and architecture, but I find it gives me the best architecture for my team size (100+). It helps me on-board people quickly and graduate their skill set while maintaining clean code and allowing advanced features.<p>I can start a junior on pure html layout, then we can train them to do controller modification, then to work on service facades and then when they have a good foundation in prototype base OO we can graduate them into building reusable widgets and subsystems for the controller and service facade developers. It works well and allows developers to work proficiently at their skill set without mucking up the whole system.<p>As well the service facades make it easy to contract out entire web projects while my internal team builds server side services to support the effort. This allows us to expand our work force, to a larger pool, without having to vet new developers to deep into business rules to get them up and running.",1253588400
