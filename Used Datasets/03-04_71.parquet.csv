I'll also simplify the math by assuming that a list of n numbers contains only values in the range [0 .. n] .<p>Let's further assume that we're only sorting positive integers, and that each job sleeps for x clock cycles (where x in the input number). We could sort a list in O(n) time.<p>Digging even deeper: Quicksort performs an integer comparison followed by a branch O(n lg n) times. Even if your processor can compare two integers in one clock cycle, a branch is probably going to screw up your processor's pipelining and take quite a few clock cycles to execute. So, we're possibly looking at a significant speed increase even before we consider the difference in order of growth.<p>So, assuming a predefined upper bound on the number of items in a list, this just might be a great way to perform hardware-assisted sorts.<p>Thoughts?",1308195210.0

In the 80s he tried to do books on floppy discs, but his big break came in the 90s when he launched a CD-ROM company that went public. The company didn't do too well, but that was more of a reflection of the CD-ROM market than Byron. After the failure of that company I recall that Byron tried to do e-books again, but it didn't quite work. The problem wasn't his content, but the fact that the technology wasn't quite there yet.

The argument isn't even necessarily about mousing vs. keyboarding, it could be about GUI vs. command line/hotkey. GUIs provide a discoverable profile of all actions (with the most common tasks optimized visually, hopefully). Hotkeys package the common actions to save time.<p>In any interface, there is a learning curve. Some users never progress beyond the most basic stages, and each time they interact with the software it's as if they are starting over. Other users develop further along the learning curve to the point that using a hotkey becomes cheaper. Many users bring overlap from other interfaces (which is what makes an interface intuitive it fits the user's expectations). As more hotkeys are defined they will be for less and less common actions, which fewer users will learn, remember, and use. People will also move up and down the curve depending on their frequency of use with the software.<p>A useful product should have both. The more complex a product gets, the more the user skill stratifies (from newbs to pros), the more necessary both a GUI and hotkey interface is. The GUI provides a scheme for organizing the myriad features and functions as a fallback interaction layer, while hotkeys allow the user to leap ahead.<p>HN users are overwhelmingly savvy, which is shown by the support of keyboard interactions.",1308194598.0
