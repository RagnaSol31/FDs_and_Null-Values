Hopefully, the future value of the customer is more than the loss on the initial deal.  I think that's what your getting at with your subsequent sentences.  I am not in the retail business so this is just conjecture but it seems to me that it's almost impossible to operate one of these deals at a profit.  Basically, you are renting Groupon's sales machine and hopefully you convert a big percentage of the customers the deal brings in.  I would also guess few retailers have the ability to present value the customers future revenue correctly and I'm sure Groupon will (if they haven't already) offer tools to measure that and justify the ROI of their deals.",1307159080

They know as much about security as one can pick from 'Hacking Exposed IV' kind of book from your local book store. Some of them are just fakes who just have the right connection within the agencies (many are just ex-employees, friends of friends, college buddies and cousins). Then they need to know how to navigate the red tape of proposals and  bids.  So this all amounts to a lot of waste, stupidity (at best) and down-right maliciousness (at worst). We saw some of this with HBGary and this Karim guy, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.<p>If you have the right connections and know how to handle the red-tape (you might have to hire a full-time professional for it), you can make quite a bit of money bullshitting the govt and selling them crap.",1307158842

35,2618809,story,,,6,7,thrwayss,"Ask HN: sick + not passionate, generally fucked up. thoughts?",,"I graduated from Stanford in 2005. Since then I have had a great run in founding a company, getting funded, and we are a profitable start-up with 11 employees. Our revenues are in the 11-12MM range and I own a very large percent of the company. I didn't really want to have a co-founder but I did recruit a friend early on with whom I built the product, but he owns 8% (not a lot), and other employees own 1% and some later employees own 0.5%. The VC that funded us is great friends with my dad(which helped, also my dad initially bankrolled some of the setup costs), and we were profitable before starting so it all worked out in my favor, and however selfish it may sound, we ran with good salaries after getting funded, and I had started alone, so I didn't want to split equally. Also my friend didn't mind as he was/is drawing a good salary.<p>I am a run of the mill person (financially secure childhood, went to a good school, went to a good college, and have a good company that is probably going to grow around 10-20% over every year) meaning that I never really felt that I decided anything for myself, and I guess I am having a midlife crisis? but really I am just sick of my life and I have no idea what I am doing. Over the last year or two I managed to take some extended 2-3 week long breaks because before that there was a lot to do, so I guess I tried remedying it using breaks where I would not be connected to tech and just go hang out at the beaches of south America. It definitely gives me a clear head, but I am unable to think and decide clearly.<p>Over the last year and a half I have thought a lot about killing myself and have decided that I am not brave enough to carry on with something like that, but I really have no passion and some of what Tony Hseish (Zappos Guy) talks about in Delivering Happiness (book) really resonates with me. But I have more problems. Also on the outside I think I appear extremely happy and perfect but I guess I am more insecure and have started having self-worth issues.<p>I had a really great & happy childhood. Was bullied some in high school & was also a bully (went to a boarding school and really it was part of life, and wasn't something major or life altering). I experimented a bit with my bisexual-ism with consent of-course but it was merely part of growing up in an all boys environment.  Anyway had a great college experience, blessed with 'good looks' genes, was in a popular fraternity, got laid a lot, and well experimented a lot with some random fantasies that I think I can somewhat attribute to an all boys boarding school upbringing. I don't drink much and have been smoking pot since 12 when I went to boarding school. I guess I turned out pretty well on the outside, but I think that I may be a rotten person. <i>I know this and yet I am unable to do anything about it</i>. I am generally not a good person I guess, I used to shoplift and still do on occasion, and  some years ago I figured that I may have kleptomania, but I haven't really been diagnosed with it. Also I have always cheated on tests/exams if possible. I am usually nice to people / girls but I haven't had a stable relationship ever despite having a sexual relationships with many. I possibly see a lot of myself in the max tucker? but I don't sound like a jerk or brag about stuff (despite of what i am doing here).<p>Growing up I had no idea what I wanted to be, I just knew that I wanted to be <i>extremely</i> rich, and have all the shebang that comes along with it. Now I have a company that is generating a significant amount of revenue and healthy profits too,  My parents were entrepreneurs and they are pretty wealthy but I wasn't aware of all that much at the point. I guess now I am not sure whether I want to be extremely wealthy (attainable in 7-9 years: 100MM, just an arbitrary figure I have, used to be much higher, but honestly that wasn't realistic) or just cash out now by trying to sell and settle for a lesser amount which would still be significant, plus hopefully inheritance later. This initial get rich scheme was fueled by all the ""Sydney Sheldon's"" that I read in high school and some other lewd literature, and at one point I seriously considered becoming a criminal. Growing up, 'The Godfather', 'Scarface', and of late 'American Gangster', 'Blow', 'Lord of War' have been my favorite movies. I have also read extensively about organized crime over the world.<p>Anyway I have these really sick fantasies which I also had as a child for some reason and I can't get the grip on how they started. Going to a small ""rules enforced"" all boys school and then being let loose on a college campus with good looking girls with whom I had little or no interaction growing up may have been a likely cause.<p>Anyways I guess I am just venting out to this community that I have been fortunate to learn about from about depression, and start-up stuff, and other random things. I shared some of my fantasies with a close friend like some months ago, and he said that he was disgusted and told me to see a therapist. Long story short, my first therapist was a female and we ended up having some adult fun, and then I went to see this other guy and he was like you should try and fulfill some of these and see how you feel after? so strike three, I went to this famous guy that wrote a book about hypnosis and has published papers about how that provides insight into childhood that may affect current behaviors and that also wasn't a really helpful session. The third guy did however say that I have a mild alternate personality. I don't want to go into much detail about what these feelings/fantasies are so as to not offend people, but just a fyi: they all involve adults and mostly female adults but are outright weird/ and to some extent sick and involve controlling? behavior and other dark stuff. I am sane enough to control these thoughts but there are times that my mind races and I enjoy having these thoughts and realizing in retrospect that they are not normal/acceptable/legal in some cases. Also, I fear that I might be slowly become the person that I am in my thoughts specially given the financial freedom that I am afforded by being lucky.<p><p>Idk why I am putting up this rant, but it just feels to get it off my chest? and hopefully I can get some advice? Also I am mildly on a marijuana high so sorry if some of this sounds incomprehensible.<p><p>temp email: xequalsxplusone@gmail.com / if you'd rather just email me. Thanks.",1307158173

On the other hand, you also ""want to guarantee that the program and any improvements made on it are available to anyone, proprietary or not, forever."" That requirement is much closer to the GPL (or even the AGPL): if someone distributes a modified version of the software, you want the source of those modifications to be released so other people can modify their application in the same way.

Check out the episode of Bullshit! on pyramid and ponzi schemes-- not so much for the content of the episode, but for the fact that they <i>avoided saying ""ponzi scheme""</i>.<p>Or, imagine this: The New York Times ran this piece, even in the opinion section. Does it seem like a libel case now? Keep in mind that <i>libel</i> and a <i>libel case</i> are entirely different. A company could very well bring a case to court and drain thousands from you in legal fees just to protect their reputation.<p>And they'd have a pretty good case too. Yeah, malice probably isn't there, but they could certainly argue a reckless disregard for whether or not this was actually true.",1307157718

50,2618792,story,2618181.0,,1,0,TikiTDO,,,"Judging how successful somethings is based on how popular their messaging service is seems a bit counter-intuitive. During my life I have seen IRC, then ICQ, then AIM, then MSN, then Facebook hold the top spot for IM client over period as low as 15 years. What more, at this moment all of my friends are reachable on gtalk simply due to the rising popularity of the Android platform, so who's to say how things will change going forward.<p>When it comes to communication people simply use what's most convenient, and has the bigger percentage of their friends. Obviously this will shift and change as services gain and lose popularity, and I think the past couple of decades have illustrated beyond a shadow of a doubt that eventually everything loses popularity on the internet (save perhaps trolling). Facebook is already a gigantic corporation with thousands of employees, millions of line of code written to support their model, and an ever growing turnaround time for new features. Obviously that can be very useful for company with such a large size and scope, but it is not without problems.<p>All it would take to drown Facebook would be for a new service to come along with some sort of game-changing idea; at that point the monolithic structure of Facebook will prevent them from adapting quickly enough and they will begin to lose their early adopter crowd, and with them more and more of their newcomers. Sure, they will keep much of the mainstream crowd they managed to attract over the years, much like myspace still holds a huge share of their original market segment, but that will be inertia more than anything.<p>This is not some wild speculation either. We've seen this happen several times already in the short history of the internet, and we will see it happen again, and again, and again for as long as the internet exists. This is just the life cycle of a web based company. So in other words Facebook isn't really winning any war, because honestly, there really isn't any war. At best it is yet another period of reshuffling during which yet another service ends up on top.",1307157699

They're unprofitable due to fixed costs (advertising, sales force, etc.). Their revenue has almost zero associated marginal cost and is actually quite good and in fact is what they're banking on.<p>I don't think he really understands what ""Ponzi Scheme"" means either.

I understand the spirit of this law, that using facebook and twitter is using a public good for advertising outside of the context of an ad.

The program is unsustainable in the long term as currently implemented because the ratio of people above the cutoff age to people contributing will be so high that the program is losing money indefinitely.  There are many knobs we can turn to solve this problem, however.  We could start killing old people, move the cutoff age to be later, limit the number of years benefits last, cut benefits, raise the payroll tax that partially funds the program, admit that the program has to be funded using other taxes and just accept that, implement a long-term policy of monetizing the program, lie about inflation so that the cost of living adjustment fails to retain value in real terms, or make a long-term commitment to explosive population growth.  Right now I think our plan is a mix of lying about inflation and increasing the cutoff age.<p>I am not a Republican and I consider the word somewhat insulting, much like the word Democrat.",1307157096
