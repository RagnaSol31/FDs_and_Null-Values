1,58742,comment,58593.0,58593.0,0,0,karzeem,,,"There are certain types of apps that will probably never reside in a browser, and certainly never with AJAX.  Heavy-duty stuff like Final Cut Pro and the Adobe CS springs immediately to mind.  I know a lot of people use GMail as their primary mail client, but to me, it can't touch Mac Mail.  From a UI perspective, freedom from the browser is the ultimate trump card.<p>Obviously, there are plenty of apps that make more sense to have exclusively on the web (like, say, the good old Google search engine), but there's a lot that will always belong on the desktop.<p>The mistake AJAX zealots make is an overly broad view of the web's value.  The web is valuable as a back end.  That's it.  As a front end for apps, the desktop's possibilities are comparatively limitless.<p>If, for instance, Word featured remote access and collaboration (i.e. use the web as its back end), Google Docs would be in serious trouble.  The same goes for almost every major desktop app (including OSes) whose death knell the web 2.0 crowd is so eager to ring.  In the next few years, using the web simply as a back end for the desktop is going to be a huge area of innovation.",1190606045.0

But its not a very powerful tool for deciding to act or not in any situation before that future arrives. <p>If you had a stock market model that's based on very observable micro effects and your model predicts past stock prices well, would you use it to invest?

The economics of this sort of model (which is similar to that of ""Free iPod"" promotions, if I'm not mistaken) are such that the amount of work required to earn something valuable (like an iPod instead of a gumball) is too much of a hassle for most users.<p>Similar companies' affiliates also tend to spring all sorts of hidden conditions and charges on users, so that's something Acebucks should avoid like the plague.",1190604662.0

A model to predict the future stands or falls on it's ability to predict the future. <p>For example if I had a model of the stock market that failed to predict the market that model couldn't be be considered to be correct so long as nobody could come up with a better model.

15,58728,comment,58580.0,58718.0,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Sure. And there are plenty more effects you haven't even mentioned. What about the changing population ratio between people with white skin and dark skin? More dark skin means more heat absorption which means more global warming. <p>Of course the effect is probably 1 zillionth the size of the effect of CO2, but apparently thats irrelevant to global warming skeptics. I'll admit the effect cosmic rays on cloud formation is quite creative, but I think their are even more ridiculous and irrelevant effects out their if you were really trying. <p>The only honest scientific rebuttal of AGW at this stage is a model inclusive of all known effects (including CO2) that predicts current temperature patterns better than AGW models do. Positing inputs to the system without reference to magnitude and other inputs is absolutely insufficient. ",1190603733.0

With regard to scaling, I am guessing that you refer to feedback effects produced by plant production of oxygen from the CO2. My assumption is that the rate plant growth on the planet will stay constant, or, at the rate we are going, vastly decrease (rainforests, etc) which will worsen the effect.  Also, economic growth planet wide can only increase energy consumption, and therefore, CO2 production.  I don't think there are any off-base assumptions there, but I am open to the evidence of some.",1190603369.0
