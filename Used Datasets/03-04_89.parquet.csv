1,1409818,comment,1409521.0,1409521.0,0,0,jsz0,,,"In some situations throttling is the best solution. It depends exactly what criteria is being used and what the motivations are. Outlawing any type of ISP throttling without making some exceptions is a bad idea. For example in the past I've seen throttling used to dampen the impact of ISP uplink outages. BitTorrent and Usenet get slower but most people browsing HTTP don't notice that the ISP has lost 50% of its uplink capacity for 4 hours. Is that a bad thing? What about smaller ISPs? This impacts rural users quite a lot. We focus on Verizon, Comcast, TWC, Cox, etc but there are scores of smaller cable ISPs in the US who simply don't have the money to do large scale network upgrades required to offset 2% of their users being bandwidth hogs. Should they go out of business? Raise prices? Implement strict bandwidth caps? or throttle the 2% of users at peak hours? For the bigger ISPs the turnaround times, planning and budgeting of upgrades is never perfect. Sometimes there are gaps due to mismanagement (solvable), vendor/partner delays (not so much so), weather delays (nope) or other things out of your control. Between upgrades do you let everyone suffer with slow speeds or just throttle the 5% of people using 50% of the bandwidth? It's really not a clear cut issue. We also have to consider that the alternative to intelligent throttling are strict bandwidth caps and metered billing. I would prefer the top 5% be throttled or pay more.",1275883152.0

Like you mentioned, I handle customer support for Twilio and hear about countless ideas, feature requests, etc. everyday.  There's no way I could remember who came up with what, and multiple people run similar ideas by me all the time.<p>I built this to scratch my own itch and its also a really simple use case to illustrate the ability to control real world devices with DTMF tones.  Some Twilio projects I had in mind when I built this include Buzzeromatic.com, which is also powered by Twilio and costs $1.95/month and had a very public launch.  Sunlight Labs also did a door hack with Twilio and an arduino that I thought was pretty sweet.<p>What I think is important is that what I've built doesn't have any UI or anything like that, just a really stripped down version and I'm not looking to make it into some paid service.

Six short periods, all leading to recession. Why? Because the government needs to run a deficit, it's the only way to inject financial resources into the economy. If you're not running a deficit, it's draining the pockets of the private sector. I was at a meeting in Cambridge last month where the managing director of the IMF said he was against deficits but in favor of saving, but they're exactly the same thing! A government deficit means more money in private pockets.""<p>""The way people suggest they can cut spending without cutting activity is completely fallacious. This is appalling in Europe right now. The Greeks are being asked to cut 10 percent from spending in a few years. And the assumption is that this won't affect GDP. But of course it will! It will cut at least 10 percent! And so they won't have the tax collections to fund the new lower level of spending. Spain was forced to make the same announcement yesterday. So the Eurozone is going down the tubes.""<p>""On the other hand, look at Japan. They've had enormous deficits ever since the crash in 1988. What's been the interest rate on government bonds ever since? It's zero! They've had no problem funding themselves. The best asset to own in Japan is cash, because the price level is falling. It gets you 4 percent return.

I had tried just about everything mentioned and had finally accepted that I couldn't work a normal-work-hours job. So I resorted to working remotely and outsourcing a lot of my work.<p>I discovered melatonin after finally coming across the DSPS wikipedia article and realizing that it was describing me exactly. I initially started off with 3mg of melatonin about an hour before bedtime and that was waaay too much for me. I ended up sleeping most of the next day. After some trial and error I found that 1mg works perfect for me.<p>Now that I've been on a more 'normal' schedule for several months, I take it for granted. But when I first discovered that I wouldn't have to be a severe night owl for the rest of my life - it was a joyous revelation.<p>The hardest thing about DSPS for me was the loneliness at night. I could not go to sleep naturally until 4am at the earliest usually - and that left many hours when most things were closed and most friends were asleep. I feel much healthier now especially due to my improved social life with my new schedule.<p>While there were some benefits to DSPS - like beautiful 3am runs around San Francisco when everything's asleep and some great 'flow' time for programming, ultimately solving this problem has been a huge improvement in my life.",1275880964.0

The economists who noticed this phenomena won a Nobel Prize for it, so there's a good indication that it's well recognized.<p>Also, a ridiculously amount of money is already made compensating for this, and we tend to hate the industries that make it.  Consider this: almost the entire higher education industry is devoted to letting unemployed young people signal that they are, in fact, fit for the labor market despite never having held any job.  The certification industry takes over that function for older workers, letting them signal that despite being out of work or wanting to switch fields, they can perform the job they're being hired for.  A major portion of the open-source industry is driven by programmers who do that more directly: by writing code on their own time, not locked up by NDA, they signal future employers that they can write good code and increase their value on the open market.<p>Another interesting observation: one way to get rid of the problem would be to make all information public.  If all of your past work products, private statements, interactions, personal beliefs, etc. were always available to anyone who wished to look, then prospective employers could always completely and thoroughly evaluate whether they wished to work with you.  And vice versa: companies that act blatantly stupidly or crookedly would have their stupidity and malfeasance exposed to the world, and everyone would refuse to do business with them.  It's like Foucault's Panopticon, yet instead of having a single authority watch everybody, everybody can watch everybody else.<p>Somehow I don't see this being politically acceptable, though.",1275880649.0
