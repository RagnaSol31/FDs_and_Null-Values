I did not have a safe career with a stable income when I met and married my wife. One of my best friends dropped out of college and married his sweetheart (they started off living in a single room). Recently, another friend of mine was laid off. He's just got engaged.<p>IMHO The safe, stable, incomes make it easier to get married only if it is an ""arranged"" marriage where you are scrutinized by the parent and relatives of your wife-to-be. Otherwise it really doesn't matter.",1241236411

Male babies have a lower survival rate.  Among the Amazonian Yanomami 40% of the men are murdered or killed in combat.  That would lower your odds of being an ancestor.,1241236332

6,589511,comment,583508.0,583818.0,0,0,serhei,,,"> So rather than fixing broken behavior of existing apps, we should instead bloat the platform with new features ripe for abuse? That seems... unwise.<p>Who, exactly, in that sentence is 'we'? Such sloppy wording does not give credit to your argument.<p>The first clause is talking about Apple. Apple does not have fixing this behaviour as its priority, and is consequently not fixing this behaviour. Neither is it bloating the platform with new features ripe for abuse.<p>The second clause is talking about the people who are annoyed by broken behaviour. It is infeasible for them to fix it, because they are not Apple; however, it is feasible for them to jailbreak their phone and tack on new features to work around this behaviour.<p>There is no 'we' here, capable of simultaneously shutting down the jailbreak developers and getting Apple to make the improvements that make the jailbreak developers' annoyances go away. If the above comment reflects your beliefs, then your beliefs appear to be poorly worded, and if it does not, then you are trolling. I am sorry for trotting out the T word, but your mode of discourse annoys me that much.",1241236299

Twitter offers the ability to mark yourself as private, but doesn't actually protect everything. The same goes for deleting -- you are given every indication its gone, but it stays in search (where people go to ""find"" thing, probably the place you want it gone from the <i>most</i>).",1241235950

Depends on your market to an extent.<p>One of the potentially false appeals of an affiliate network is easy access to affiliates.  You still need to get their attention somehow, prove your sales conversions, and demonstrate that you actually have a good product worth promoting.<p>I have been very successful in selling my web app by simply setting up a self-hosted affiliate solution (we wrote our own, but idevaffiliate is good) and going to conferences to befriend the people who already have access to my market, well in advance, and then organizing a launch with them getting good commissions.<p>The ""if you put it on cj, they will come"" marketing model isn't going to get you near the same kind of loyalty and promotions that you will get from connecting with real live people and getting them excited about what you've done.<p>John.",1241235930

The granularity for a Web app is infinitely greater than an Swing/Flex app. Having the UI Structure (HTML), Style (CSS), Logic (JS) interpreted at runtime allows the server to take generate dynamically many part of the applications. This is the big difference, not that the scripts are compressed/minimized.<p>Now, I agree, some applications overuse AJAX, and often, single page is an overkill with lot of drawbacks and complications.<p>But the big sites, such as YouTube, Facebook, seems to be using these technologies the right ways.",1241234338
21,589495,comment,589346.0,589404.0,0,0,miloshh,,,"Interesting theory, but wrong. In fact, the right answer is well known, and does not involve memes at all.<p>The reason why it's equally good for the genes to produce a male or a female, and why there's an equal number of males and females in almost all animal species, is that the expected number of offspring for a male and a female is equal. It has to be that way, because everybody has exactly one father and one mother.<p>While it might be true that 8/10 of females and 4/10 of males of a given species reproduce, the males reproduce more when they do. A smaller probability of a higher number will give you the same expected value.<p>I think this argument (among many others) is nicely explained in the Selfish Gene by Dawkins.",1241234281

You might convince the smallest ones to take you on without any prepayment.  Next step up require around a $5000 prepayment, but might waive that if you can show proof of sizable traffic or revenue.  Mid to high $XX,XXX is only to play with the big boys (and even there, my impression was that it's possible to get that waived if you already have enough sales from other sources - but I might be wrong on this).<p>I agree with your other two points.",1241233883
