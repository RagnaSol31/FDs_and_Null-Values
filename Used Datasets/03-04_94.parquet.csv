Immediately after my talk, contributors to Rubinius sat down with Matz and other MRI developers to discuss their effort to create an ISO specification for Ruby. We asked whether RubySpec could be part of the specification but were told that it was not appropriate to include it.<p>This seems telling.<p>Does anyone have any concrete information about why Matz and the Ruby team are opposed to using RubySpec then?<p>Has there been any progress on creating an ISO spec?<p>EDIT: It seems Ruby has a published ISO spec since April 2012 - <a href=""http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59579"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_...</a>",1420084636.0
