Go to your phone's backup folder.  On this Mac, it's ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/[big random string here]<p>Once you're in that directory, grep for the file that contains the sqlite database by looking for a text string used only in it: 'grep appLaunchCount *' works.  You'll get one result.  Pop that baby open with a sqlite editor - I use MesaSQLite, myself, but it doesn't matter which.<p>In the database's Scalars table, you'll see three columns - key, daysSince1970, and value.  For each day in the last couple of weeks, and for each app you've used, there will be the following keys:<p>-- appActivationCount.com.[app name here]<p>-- appActiveTime.com.[app name here]<p>-- appBackgroundActiveTime.com.[app name here]<p>-- appLaunchCount.com.[app name here]<p>The values are the number of times the app was launched & activated that day, and how long the app was active in seconds.  Not 100% sure on the difference between appActiveTime and appBackgroundActiveTime - perhaps the latter involves the app actively doing something while in the background?<p>There's a bunch of other data in that file as well, but that's the stuff relating to frequency and length of app usage.",1301716777.0

It's what the movie studios and theaters have been banking on to compete with the quality of home theater setups, not an increase in 2D image quality. Caring about the unique look of film compared to digital while trying to increase the quality is why directors like Christopher Nolan like the IMAX format, but shooting with 70mm film is not only expensive but unwieldy because the cameras are huge.

Sure, it loses a lot of color info and distorts the gamut etc. but it has a particular feel <i>because</i> of that.

While I was going there, the official called the guy at the Xerox shop and told him to tell me how the process works. Suffice to say that I gave something and apparently that wasn't enough, so I had my mom visit him the next day and he made a comment that I hadn't given enough. My mom just smiled, picked up the certificate (which was in front of him) and left.<p>On the other hand, reporting an official is still a bit scary knowing that him or his partners-in-crime can <i>accidentally</i> mess up any of the other official documents and since most of the documents are still on paper and not digitized, it could throw you down into a deeper hole.
