The author and everyone else has a different metric in which the gauge intelligence. Someone can be very strategic and have an average IQ as such the have a specific form of intelligence. Secondly just by the mention of a PHD as a requirement shows that little care was taken in such a flippant comment. Amount of schooling is not an indicator of intelligence, is any PHD good enough to qualify? from any school? The whole idea of requiring intelligence before and individual can cast their lot is absolutely backwards to the idea of freedom. Part of freedom is the freedom to be stupid. The solution is education, we should educate people on the issues and incentivize people for getting that education. The problem is there is no incentive for politicians to incentivize the education of the population.",1331524701.0

There are over 1400 open source Google projects (The number is actually much larger, but i've only counted those that wanted to be identified specifically as Google projects), and >98% of them allow contributions the last time I looked.  In fact, it's easier to simply list the ones that don't than the ones that do.  I have to imagine you have your own list of what you think are ""Google projects"", and are working off of that when you made your assertion.<p>Second, there is definitely no ""attitude pervasive at Google that open source is a great marketing tool, but that it's a one-way street"".  As the guy generally responsible for helping teams that want to open source stuff, I can tell you that in 6 years, I've run into this attitude maybe 5 times out of the (again) 1400+ projects that got released.  That's not to say everyone open sources stuff at Google for the same reason, but there is certainly no pervasive attitude like you describe.  The reality is a lot of folks at Google have released open source projects for a lot of reasons, and of those reasons, ""marketing tool"" is pretty far down the list.<p>BTW, none of this is to say I agree with Kevin's approach to running Guava; I don't, for various reasons.   But in the end, he (and the rest of the guava folks) are the ones doing the work, and the issues here will work themselves out in the normal way (either people will grudgingly accept it and keep using guava, or some fork will become more popular eventually and take over).  In either case, Kevin making a clear statement on the situation helps move things along one way or the other, and is a lot more than you can get out of other OSS projects that do something similar.",1331523446.0

There are also quite a few Americans who should be in correctional supervision, but aren't.  (For a bare start, suppose we believe the commonly quoted meme that there are 1 million gang members in America.)<p>In either case, I think the most basic question is: why are there so many criminals?  What about the present-day American system of government is so amazingly criminogenic?<p>For instance, one commonly quoted ""root cause"" is our proverbial callousness to important issues of social justice. Is an absence of social justice the problem?  Let's consider some evidence.<p>Robbery is a pretty good ""index crime.""  For instance, in 1900, there was about 1 robbery per day in all of England (source: <a href=""http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp99/rp99-111.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp99...</a>).  This is roughly a factor of 35 lower than current reported crime rates (same source) in the ol' Sceptered Island - assuming you trust HMG's statistics.  And all crime statistics in all countries everywhere are generally admitted by all informed observers to be utterly buggered to hell.  (example: <a href=""http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-05-04/news/the-nypd-tapes-inside-bed-stuy-s-81st-precinct/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-05-04/news/the-nypd-tapes-i...</a>)<p>In any case, you may compare the public concern for social justice in England, in 1900 and 2000, and note precisely the reverse of the correlation predicted by the hypothesis.<p>Japan has extremely low crime as well, and is probably the least Americanized of all First World nations today. Clearly, it is physically possible for the State to eradicate crime.  Clearly, the American system of government, at home or abroad, seems to carry with it unusually high levels of crime and disorder, at least by historical First World standards.<p>But why?  If what we need isn't more social justice, what is it?<p>(edit: I just checked and this parliament.co.uk link isn't the right one for my robbery numbers - I'll have to look.  Still, money graf - ""The number of indictable offences per thousand population in 1900 was 2.4 and in 1997 the figure was 89.1.""  Two orders of magnitude any way you slice it.)",1331523264.0

Now there are some industry specific and domain specific languages that companies pay for that deal with such things as avionics and other tightly controlled mission critical systems. That is really the last safe harbor for closed commercial languages that requires compensation to use. So to me, you are going to have to be light years ahead of everyone else if you are targeting general computing and even then you have an issue with adoption that you will have to deal with. Conversely if you are targeting a specific domain, then you will have to do due diligence on that domain and the offerings in that space and see if you can compete.<p>Conversely you can still get paid if you decide to open source the language. A lot of organizations founded around the designers of open source languages are well compensated through other means, such as books, certifications and consultancy services. Being the authority on the language puts you in the unique position to capitalize on that authority.",1331522701.0

That is not true. As explained here (<a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/4201/why-does-the-low-entropy-at-the-big-bang-require-an-explanation-cosmological-a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/4201/why-does-the...</a>) the basic laws of physics are time-symmetric, i.e. there's no currently known <i>fundamental</i> reason that entropy behaves the way it does.<p>2) I've read this story 20+ times, yet each time it gets me. I think the force of the story comes not from the scientific predictions but from the poignant depiction of humanity's futile fight against oblivion. Aren't all monuments erected for this purpose? The fact that the story is very light on the tech details paradoxically increases its punch.<p>3) The described technology is a curious mix of far-sight and ridiculous backwardness: In describing harnessing the power of the Sun, Asimov may have had in mind something like a Dyson sphere, which Dyson described in 1960. However, the technicians still use a teletype to communicate with Multivac in 2061!<p>4) One thing that I think Asimov got wrong fundamentally is that researching the ""final question"" should have taken all of Multivac's CPU capacity. It's stupendous that Multivac just runs <i>that</i> question on a separate thread while doing everything else. <i>The Hitchiker's Guide</i> gets this right: when Arthur asks a very powerful AI (the Nutrimatic Drinks Dispenser) to make tea it totally paralyzes the machine.<p>5) I've never been able to find a good interpretation of Cosmic AC's response ""NO PROBLEM IS INSOLUBLE IN ALL CONCEIVABLE CIRCUMSTANCES.""",1331521968.0
