Many people seem to be thinking they're doing a bad job of letting new product info leak early, but I think this shows they are still doing a good job. I'm also really excited to see how well this feature works on my 3GS as well.<p>I have the Camera + app as well, and it works pretty well for me.<p>As far as Tap Tap Tap sneaking in that easter egg with using the volume buttons as activating the shutter, that was flat out a bad decision. They are not stupid people, and I'm sure they knew Apple would catch a whiff of this and pull the app from the app store. Considering the amount of revenue they pulled in (which is still not confirmed), they should have submitted an update to get it back into the store. There hasn't been any information on whether or not they plan on doing this, but I'm hopeful.",1283486381.0

Search for web browser in the App Store and see how many results you get (hint: a lot).<p>For clarity: The other comment thread refers to the fact that the developer submitted an application that allowed the user to take pictures by pressing the volume buttons, which violates the Apple Human Interface Guidelines by removing the actual volume increasing/decreasing functionality of the buttons. It was nicely rejected by Apple, but then the developer did an end-around and publicized a URL scheme that would launch their app and enable the button functionality anyway â€“ the app was summarily pulled off the store, and oddly enough it looks like the developer has disappeared off the face of the earth. (Apple ninjas killed him?)<p>FWIW, the main developer over there wasn't well-respected in the iPhone community either. Not entirely sure why, but I saw him pick odd fights from the company Twitter account with other developers for reasons beyond my comprehension.",1283486198.0

What 8 megapixels buys you is larger files, more noise and slower processing (on a sensor this small). The size of the pixels matter.

When someone shows you an 'HDR' image, its just 'understood' (or misunderstood...) as the result of tone mapping.

21,1658564,comment,1658235.0,1658312.0,0,0,cletus,,,"The lack of a front facing camera is a common complaint but honestly (owning an iPad that I love and use all the time) I don't think the use case is as cut and dried as that.<p>Video calls are most often made with a desktop computer or laptop. Laptops have a camera at the top of the screen. Most Webcams are attached to the top of monitors. So you are typically eye level with a desktop webcam or just above with a laptop. That's a fairly natural position.<p>With an iPad it is most often put on a table, your lap, held in your arm on an armrest or your lap or propped up on your lap or chest when lying down.<p>All of these cases would have a highly unflattering view if using video. ""Looking up someone's nostrils"" is how I'd describe it. I could see it working in the keyboard dock, if you have that (which I don't) but that mimics a laptop setup.<p>I'm not saying they won't add a front facing camera but just think about the practicalities of it.<p>As for Gen 2, I've gotten so much use out of mine that I won't think twice about selling it to buy the new one. I simply use it that much that it's a complete no brainer. Few devices I own, other than my PC, get that much use.<p>I'd like to see more memory. Not because I need it but because more applications will be possible with it. I'd also like to see digital out. There is a VGA out connector but it's analog and has idiotic restrictions on it like you can't play iTunes video on it, I guess as an appeasement to the idiots at the MPAA.<p>But front facing camera? For me it's pretty low priority.<p>As far as form factor goes, there might be a smaller one. Rumours of a 7"" iPad persist. I'm frankly unconvinced. Even if there was one I wouldn't buy one. A 10"" screen for a portable device is truly wonderful. I'm not going backwards, I don't care how much lighter it might be.<p>And as far as Android/WebOS/Windows tablets go, my own view is that the competition is AT LEAST two years behind. Sure in the next 6 months you're going to see any number of crappy tablets coming out but it will be at least 1-2 years before they'll have the polish, battery life and especially the ecosystem of the iPad.",1283485598.0

I first heard it in reference to Half Life: Lost Coast, but since then I've only heard it in reference to multiple exposures in photography.<p>I might be wrong, but I'm that the sensors in modern professional SLRs can handle much more difference in exposure latitude than smaller digicams and especially cell phone cameras, with film holding even more latitude.

For instance, get annual reports from several companies from 2004. Try to get a survey of companies in the sector, and not be influenced based on what you know now about the companys.<p>If you're married it would be best to have your spouse anonymize the companies by copying down the key figures from the annual reports, and then the price on Jan 30th, for each of the next 5 years.  Have her keep the company key seperate.<p>Analyze them on that basis, then look into the prices on the stock market in January 2005. Use those prices and discounted cash flow analysis to predict what their prices will be in 2010.   Invest a fake $150,000 in the companies based on those calculations.<p>Then wait a week.  Each week, look up the prices for the companeis a year later and decide if your thesis still stands.

There are also many canadian resource companies that will return a good percentage in dividends and then stock appreciation, plus you'd benefit from the depreciation of the dollar against the CAD.   IF you go that route, look for one that is adding resources faster than they are depleating them-- some have really high dividends but they are burning thru their reserves.<p>%12-%15 is not that hard to get, and doesn't involve substantial risk, but does involve doing your homework.<p>I would recommend one of Timothy Vick's books on Buffett for some advice.<p>Back when I was in the equities markets, I was able to predict the return I would get from a stock, buy it, and then, on average, exceed that return.  Stocks are not gambling when you buy low, pre-calculate expected return over 5-10 years, and only buy when you are getting a good deal based on the expected return.<p>I'm out of the equities market because the US dollar is in serious danger, and I would not recommend bonds for this very same reason. I've been doing better in precious metals than I did in equities.  But if I were in equities I'd also research some of the good precious metals companies-- some are very well run, and have both equity and growth appreciation by moving assets from discovery to production, as well as leverage to the decline in paper currencies which will cause their resources to have a larger market value.  It is one thing to buy gold in the ground for $20 an ounce, it is quite another when gold is going up in price while you're doing it.   But this sector takes more research.<p>IF you're willing to put in some time, it isn't that hard, but first I would recommend learning.

If a confrontation like the one here happens, the most important thing is to not display fear or annoyance.  (The is exceptionally hard to do, but after you have had your ass kicked a lot it gets easier.)  Then, you basically have two choices:<p>1) Diffuse the situation.  An example of this would be to meet the intimidator on his own level of casual conversation, but with obvious elements of friendship or compassion (that perhaps are genuine, or just brazen).  Invite the guy to have a seat with you.  When the guy asks ""When was the last time you got your ass kicked?"" You can say ""I get my ass kicked a lot, but I haven't had it kicked yet today.""  Once I was walking home through the ghetto with a pizza in my hand, almost to my apartment.  The guys on the porch next door say ""hey, you brought us pizza.""  I walked straight towards them, and asked who wants a piece, with a smile on my face.  A couple pieces of pizza is a small price to show you are not afraid.<p>2) Or you can escalate the situation. This doesn't mean throwing the first punch (necessarily) but it could mean keeping your mouth shut, not responding to the initial questioning, then 5 seconds later getting up from the table.  You go somewhere and come back quickly.  When you return to the situation, you have the leg-up.  You could have called someone, you could be carrying something.  The dynamic is different though.  At this point, keep your hands in your pockets, stay calm, and ask ""what do you want?""  After that don't say another word.  You are harder to size up at this point, and there's a chance the intimidator will go away.  If not, you can leave the place, or you can grab the person by their shirt and walk forwards with them and release them.  They'll be very angry, but they'll realize that you are serious and unafraid to fight.  There are a few key things to remember once the physical part of the conflict begins:<p>- No talking, threatening or noise-making.  Just do what you need, be forceful and catch the other person off-guard.<p>- Most intimidators looking to start a fight are looking for  some kind of foreplay or testing of your confidence.  Don't allow that.  Say as little as possible.  When it comes time to act, prior to the first contact the movement should be casual but in their direction, and then silent and forceful when you have to touch the other person.<p>In 95% of situations, you are better off leaving.  But if you are forced in something you have to deal with, deal with it confidently and calmly knowing that tomorrow you'll be able to look at yourself in the mirror, even if you do have one black eye.",1283483547.0
