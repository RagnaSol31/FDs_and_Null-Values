0,52412,story,,,16,25,Kaizyn,Startup Question: Why Venture Capital for Web Startup?,,"This is probably a silly question, but this seems a good forum to get an answer:  It seems to be taken as a given that any founder will sooner or later apply for VC funding.  Why would a founder of a web startup ever bother with venture capital?  A web startup can be built by a team of 1-4 people working on it part-time (so no need for anyone to quit their full-time jobs).  The time required to build such a web system would probably be on the order of 12-18 months.  Because servers, bandwidth, and/or hosting services are cheap, this can all easily be self-financed (for ~$5000-$10000?).  What have I missed here in this analysis that makes venture capital desirable or necessary?",1189313103

Spammers are comparatively easy to guard against; they don't care enough to create 100 sockpuppet accounts, and in any case the guys at reddit wouldn't have any qualms about killing spams that seemed to be merely for profit. This is a tougher problem.<p>You could say all the anti-C++ stories were already evidence of this problem. But a large proportion of programmers, even C++ users, disapprove of C++, and an even larger proportion of the kind of people who would use a social news site.<p>The Lisp zealots are another matter. This is more like spam; it's not just people who hate C++ so much that they reflexively upvote stories that sound critical of him; it's a deliberate attempt to market something online.<p>Incidentally, I'm not saying this because I have some kind of ulterior motives. I think C++ is the worst language of my lifetime. And I am not anti-Paul Graham. I know nothing about him except that every article he writes makes it onto reddit--no one writes that much gold.",1189312101

Here's my favorite section:<p>'Since from the time of Newton to now, we have come close to doubling knowledge every 17 years, more or less. And we cope with that, essentially, by specialization. In the next 340 years at that rate, there will be 20 doublings, i.e. a million, and there will be a million fields of specialty for every one field now. It isn't going to happen. The present growth of knowledge will choke itself off until we get different tools.'",1189311823

There really should be no systemic effect from self-selection, apart from in the recruitment process (which they don't discuss).",1189311477
5,52406,comment,52351.0,52351.0,0,0,danteembermage,,,"The trouble with these kinds of studies (and with empirical evidence in general) is that there are often omitted correlating factors left out of the analysis. Doctors would be sure to control diet and other medications, economists would control socioeconomic status, sociologists would look for cultural factors, etc. However, they're not going to do two or three of these sets at once so the result is a biased study no matter who performs it.<p>In this case I think a good potential omitted factor is the level of parental discipline. Suppose parents A are Dr. Spock laissez-faire with their kids. This is most likely correlated with:\nNot sitting still for the family meal\nWatching a lot of television\nGetting their way in public places\nSo Junior gets lots of TV dinners, quick snacks, and time with the power rangers so he wants to do karate instead of read Fox in Socks<p>Parents B run a tight ship and consequently their vegan, free-range fed wonder-child is happy to sit on the magic carpet and hear about anything so long as it's not The Wealth of Nations again.<p>Applying the overused correlation != causation mantra is a bit cheap, to be fair we must follow the immediate next step, ""If correlation != causation, why?"" I think here we have plenty of compelling falsifiable narratives to try before we make green key-lime pie illegal.<p>",1189311055
