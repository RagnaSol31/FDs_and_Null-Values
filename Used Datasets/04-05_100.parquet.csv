When I first discovered Reddit I became a contributor, most of my links got upvotes, one or two even hit the front page.<p>But after a couple months, suddenly every single one my submissions was getting downvoted within the first minute or so of submitting, no exceptions.  Even many of my comments were getting pointlessly downmodded.<p>I figured at best I had pissed off some script kiddie with a downmod bot, at worst a voting ring had begun systematically suppressing competing links.<p>I just read the site for a while after that without submitting or commenting, eventually created a new handle and retired the original, and then discovered subreddits which imho is the best idea ever.  It's not a problem anymore, at least among the subreddits I subscribe to.<p>I <3 reddit, have learned more from people there, esp Proggit and the like, than even my undergrad education, and was one of your recent contributors.

The course was CS106 which was introduction to programming, a requirement for CS students and some EE majors and some math majors I believe. Technically I was a guest lecturer.  I got my first job as a programmer through one of my professors. He was pretty well connected with several companies in San Diego.<p>SDSU was switching most of its courses to be taught in Java.  They also had MSCE certification courses and were starting Java certification courses.  I had just landed a new job at a local java shop.  My old professor was looking for professionals to teach the new java courses. I was a pretty good developer and my name came up to teach the course (which paid pretty well.)  But he decided that I need some teaching experience and got me to teach the intro to programming course to give me the experience.   I know he had to pull a few strings to make it happen since I was not a grad student and not exactly a seasoned professional.<p>It turned out to be a great experience.  I really enjoyed it.  The pay was horrible.  After preping for the lecture, grading, office hours and the lecture, I think it worked out to ~$12/hour.  Quite a bit less than I was making as a regular developer.  So I only taught the one semester.<p>I know of another guy I used to work with who was a horrible developer.  I mean really bad. I believed he had a masters degree.  But he taught extension courses at UCSD. I think the extension courses have a lot less restrictions on the requirements.  From there he ended up teaching full time at another college, can't remember where.  It was another small one in San Diego.

No, just because it gets clicks, and we'll decide what to put in the chart 100% based on what will get the most clicks, not based on what is actually true about bottled water or anything (I imagine they don't go out of their way to make up stuff, but clearly an interest in bottled water is not their motivator).<p>I agree that linkbait in general has many of those features, but I'd consider most linkbait to be at least a cousin of spam.
