But I have reservations about how effective multinational cooperation on international monetary policy can be.<p>One of the reasons that the dollar is the global reserve currency is because there is so much of it in circulation.  No other currency is as liquid.  Moving oil purchases of a bloc of countries to a non-dollar basket of currencies ought to be a significant hit to global demand for the dollar.  But those same countries will have to correspondingly increase the amount of their own currency in global circulation, if the basket is to be used for international trade contracts.  Despite being a strong currency and having a strong central bank, the EU has not pursued a policy of making the Euro a globally viable reserve currency, precisely because they do not want to have to deal with the problems that stem from creating the massive amounts of currency in circulation necessary for global use.<p>However, something similar was done in the past in Europe.  During the transition to the Euro, the currency was brought into existence for use in financial transactions three years before it was brought into physical circulation (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_of_the_euro",

""Calibration"" consisted of a half-hour of reading pre-scored essays and taking a test that required a passing rate (being within some margin of the ""true"" score) of only 80%.<p>There were ridiculous formulas about the number of adjectives, etc., required for a certain score.  Imaginative writing suffered the most; cookie-cutter writing was rewarded the most.<p>Scorers worked eight hour shifts.  Sometime after my morning coffee I was the most generous, and in my afternoon lull, when I could hardly keep my eyes open, I'm pretty sure I graded the hardest.<p>I remember one of my colleagues had, sadly, suffered brain injury in a car wreck.  His scores were all over the place, as I could tell when he asked my opinion on the essays he was scoring.  Others had modest educational attainments -- people who had maybe gotten a bachelor's degree twenty years before, but not really been engaged in mentally rigorous work in the mean time.  Many of them couldn't reliably spot an adjective. They were amazed that I had an ""accuracy rate"" of 97%, the highest at my table by a good 15 percentage points.<p>We were grading fourth-graders' tests from Arizona.  The previous cohort at my center (that I didn't belong to) had graded high school tests from, if memory serves, Minnesota. (This was late '90s).  The tests were ""high stakes"" -- failure on the test kept the student from high school graduation.  It later came to light that some large number of students who had failed the test and been denied graduation, had later challenged their scores and successfully shown that their tests had been severely mis-graded.  They were allowed to graduate, half a year too late.<p>After the grading period ended, I stayed on a mailing list to hear about job openings the next summer in that city.  However, some time during the spring I got a letter saying that there wouldn't be a grading center in our city that year.  Wonder why.",1254804353.0

(e.g. ""As a member of a particularly undesirable racial group, ..."" or ""Some of us less desirable types ..."")<p>The real shocker though is who advocates for restricting searches by race! From the comments, it is people who are part of undesirable groups who actually want OKC to be race-aware and allow people to discriminate.<p>Clearly the data shows that there are biases toward certain races. However, from my experience, finding potential dates online is a roller coaster ride. It has ups and downs, and unfortunately we are always looking for what causes those downs. After all, people just reject you without a reason!<p>With data like this, many people will just assume that RACE is the reason for rejection -- something they cannot do anything about -- when it is more likely something they can accommodate for.

Not having used it recently, I had to go to the manual because I couldn't remember which combination of q-commands would do a simple effective rebase.<p>I was especially sensitive here because the last time I was a heavy hg user, I did lose changes to queues because hg doesn't have anything like the wonderful safety net of reflog to allow me to just put my tree back in a prior stat and let me try a complicated merge/rebase again.",1254802500.0

It's hard to set aside that ""I'm a little kid again and having fun"" feeling that you get from running around barefoot or near barefoot.<p>I paid more of a price for my first actual barefoot on a track a few months ago.  One thing about that - your feet go a bit numb, so it's hard to tell if you're hurting yourself.  I ran 2 miles easy and ended up with some blisters, but nothing too serious.  (interesting note:  Running with shoes, you tend to get blisters on the ends of your toes and can lose toenails.  Running barefoot, you get them on the bottoms of your toes where callouses should be).  Following that, I know to be much more careful, and have been slowly working barefoot runs into my weekly running.<p>My first run in the Five Fingers was just an easy 3mi loop around my neighborhood (my normal runs are 6-10).  I still ended up running way faster than I intended to (they are light after all), but luckily no muscle soreness or other problems.  Like anything else, I think the key is to make little changes - this week I may do 4, next week 5, and so on.  I'm kind of eager to try to race a fall 5k in them.",1254802493.0

They're all monetized through promoting my software, which means that even if 97% of the people who come to the site never pay me money I'm still sitting pretty.<p>In my case, the software antedates the content sites, but one could just have easily made the transition from publisher to software vendor as the other way around.  (Or hired someone to make you the software, or made an arrangement to white label previously-existing software, etc.)<p>This doesn't help if your content sites are pitched at a market which does not pay money for goods and services, of course.<p>Incidentally, the economics of advertising your own product versus CPC ads are quite compelling.  I routinely pay Google $2 CPMs for inventory on 3rd party sites, so let's accept that as typical in my market.  Of that $2, Google keeps a buck or so, so the content publisher sees less than $1.<p>My own effective CPM (sales / visits * 1,000) bounces up and down depending on what flavor of search terms I'm doing well on, but for many of my content sites it is in excess of $20.  As much as I'm indebted to AdSense for giving Webmaster Welfare to the folks who send me a lot of my traffic, I'd have to be insane to put it on my own sites.<p>As an added bonus, its easier to get a link to a site that doesn't have AdSense plastered all over it, because it can be seen as non-commercial even if is essentially one gigantic ad.

You seem to think that I was arguing that discrimination on the basis of sex is <i>exactly like</i> discrimination on the basis of race when it comes to picking romantic and/or sexual partners.  Perhaps I was unclear due to brevity but that's not what I intended to say at all.<p>My point was that we should refrain from judging people for having racial preferences in who they want to date <i>for the same reason</i> that we should refrain from judging people for having sexual/gender preferences in who they want to date: because nobody really controls who they are attracted to, because attraction is a very personal thing that is based on a whole host of factors, some less rational than others, because there is no basis for saying that any particular set of sexual preferences is ""right"", and because saying that people ought to be attracted to people who they aren't just leads to alienation and unnecessary grief.<p>All of these preferences probably meet the technical definition of various forms of discrimination, but the words we have for those types of discriminations (rightfully) imply a certain moral judgment about the person being described which I think is inappropriate in this instance.",1254801829.0

This is understandable true in a way, since after all, AIs cannot do many of the things that natural intelligences can do. And so there is this perceived disconnect between the weak AI that we have (rules, heuristics, belief networks, bayesian inference and friends) and the strong that we AI (magic?).<p>But there is a similar disconnect that looms between the rudimentary intelligence of simple organisms and the more sophisticated intelligence higher mammals. Many researchers have noted this taken the insight that with a simple set of rules you can get complex behavior. This has lead to something of a revolution in ML, robotics and neuromorphic engineering. If this analogy holds, then it may be that the distance between weak and strong AI will be bridged in the same way that the distance between single celled organisms and primates appears to be bridged: by iteratively building complex systems on top of simpler building blocks. There simply won't be a secret sauce to be found, but each layer of complexity will allow for increasingly sophisticated behavior.",1254801795.0
