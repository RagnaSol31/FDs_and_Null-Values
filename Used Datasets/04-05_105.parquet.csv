I took the SATs/ACTs/SAT IIs the same as any other student.<p>Wherever possible I applied using a college's home school form, and I wrote supplemental essays wherever possible explaining why I left my high school (especially important since I had awful grades at the time I left).

So yes for us living in Canada, USA, Western Europe...etc there would be absolutely wrong with living forever and rewarding ourselves for all our marvellous work with exotic travels until we're bored and then we can just take the ""death"" pill at a time of our own choosing.<p>In your retirement travels to distant lands, however, it is very likely that you would encounter people who do not view life in those terms. You might discover that they work simply to survive, and perhaps have some kids for whom they try to make life just marginally better. And maybe in 50-60 generations, the ancestors of those hard-working people would be able to enjoy themselves a little more and spend their 60s travelling the world just to see what other places look like.
