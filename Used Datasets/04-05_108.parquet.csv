That would give them a crazy position to experiment with hardware and keep a check on Apple - after all, Google means serious business with the Nexus one and the mythical tablet. And we all know Google likes to experiment with 3D stuff in browsers and such. Again, I am just blithering- with Google's purchase of AMD (+ATI), they might just have crazy nice open-source 3D tools, maybe even a cloud platform for map-reduce rendering work (take that Pixar - yet another Steve Jobs production).<p>But on the other hand, Microsoft is the one who could benefit the most from buying AMD. For one thing, MSFT gets ATI for Xbox 360, a platform that MSFT has well executed. And now, Microsoft even make their own chips from win 7 mobile phones to consoles.

The way they recognise that two phones were bumped into each other is by having each phone contact a central server and having the central server compare the timing of the two events as well as some rough location information.<p>So this means that you have to send your data through their central servers. Yes, it is encrypted, etc. but I would feel much safer if it were encrypted and sent locally instead.<p>Also I am sure as it gets popular there will be issues with timing, such as different people bumping at the same time, or the bumps being mistimed, due to differences in the way the wireless networks of two different providers time stamp the various notifications.<p>So it seems that while the act of bumping may give an impression of security (i.e., that you know for sure who you are sending your data to), this impression is illusory which means you will have to authenticate the recipient anyways, so you might as well use bluetooth.<p>And as somebody else noted if they devoted the same efforts to bluetooth, I am sure they could make their app just as nice.

But that doesn't seem to ring with a company that I presume mainly makes for the domestic German market (and art-house cinema overseas to a lesser degree) and probably doesn't have a good grip of the benefits of allowing limited remixing of original content.,1271910189.0

I paid for it. Done. Now it's mine. I don't have to KEEP ON paying for it. In the typical ""own a home"" scenario, even after a mortgage is paid off, you have to keep right on paying for that house each month/year. At a minimum, you have to pay home ownership taxes. Notice you do not have to pay ongoing ""just because you own it"" taxes on most other items that you own. A computer. A book. Clothing. Once you own them, they are yours, you don't need to keep paying for them.<p>But if there's some fee an external entity is essentially forcing you to pay, either directly or indirectly by threat of force, then you do not really own it. You are renting it. The key question is if you were to stop paying a certain fee whether some big mean people will come and take it away from you. If that's true, you are only renting it.<p>Arguably the OA is about comparing one kind of renting to another kind of renting. There are advantages to each, but in both scenarios you <i>will</i> be paying for the home for the rest of your life.
