So I unchecked all the items that had been on my profile for several years, thinking that they would still be displayed as simple text (as opposed to links).<p>Instead, they were all deleted! So I took some time to (partially) rebuild my list of interests as links, only to then of course witness the flood of news items posted by those pages. I have been 'hiding' them as they show up.

To get hot spots is if you contend on a single row -- but that's really an indication of something going terribly wrong in the data model.<p>ACID (transactional properties) and KV (data model) are orthogonal concepts.

We actually have access to programs structured more like the E. Coli graph. They crash a lot. Because the fact that one error takes down the whole system has less to do with the organizational structure of the code, and more to do with the fact that we've deliberately built the system such that one error will crash the entire system... because the alternative is worse. There's no recovering from a segfault not because there aren't enough different implementations of core functionality, but because there is no sensible way to recover from a segfault.<p>Cells have a type of redundancy programs do not have, and may never have, and it actually hasn't got anything to do with the source code at all. They have numerous independent copies of things that mostly work, most of the time. They perform tasks that transform lots of things into lots of other things, most of the time. The whole system is built so that everything mostly works, most of the time, usually recovers, and it doesn't matter much whether this cell dies or that mitochondria malfunctions. It's an entirely different set of primitives brought on by massive parallelism. (And not the usual biological parallelism you hear about in the brain, but physically, everywhere.)<p>It's the difference in primitives that brings about the difference in result. Difference in optimal layout is an <i>effect</i>, not a <i>cause</i>. Cells don't have the option to work like programs, and programs really don't have the option to work like cells.
