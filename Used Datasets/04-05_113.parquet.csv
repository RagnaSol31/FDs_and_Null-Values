Corruption functions well as long as this kind of isolation is maintained for one simple reason: usually in this kind of arrangement, your gain is somebody else's loss.<p>If the network of corruption is too large you have to spread the gains much too thinly to make it worth the effort. Likewise, the more distant someone in that network is from the originator of said corruption, the more like they are to have very different goals and ideals and therefore disagree with and expose this kind of corruption.<p>That's why I think this kind of system has a considerable degree of resistance to misreporting of information.

At least, felipemnoa cared to explain: ""the best way to learn is to make a lot of mistakes, in everything"". I don't care that much about karma (would ""Why"" care? I doubt) so I will say here why I don't agree.<p>Mistakes are good, to some extent, but not in everything. Would you tell someone that unsafe sex is ok, and that one should learn its danger by doing the mistake, catching a STD, and then not doing it again? Would you tell someone that building a bridge without double checking pressure contraints and simic conditions is ok, that one will learn by one's mistakes when the bridge will fall apart? Hmm, so there are some limits to this ""learn by your mistakes"" thing, right?<p>In coding, the same. It is ok ""to write dangerous or crappy code"" (Why quote) in personal projects, not in those where life are at stake, eg. airport traffic control or medical software. It is ethically not ok to write dangerous code in these case, and I would say it is the same when your code will have to be read, used, debugged by others. I admire people taking risks, too, like I admire someone eating 50 eggs in 1 hour, but I would not always advise my friends and relatives or coworkers to take those risks. Sometime, most of the time, the reward is not good enough.<p>I appreciate ""Why"" writting skills, he is or was an impressive guy, but taking to the letter every of his tweets should not be mandatory on HN, I believe.<p>Thanks for explaining why and where I'm wrong, if it is the case.",1314159521.0

It could be non-final though, because it's a field not a local.<p>The second part is the more interesting part, and is part of what people are talking about when they say that Java doesn't have closures: you can't modify closed over local (stack allocated) variables. However you can call methods that modify or otherwise modify heap-allocated objects, for instance if bar was an array you could modify it's contents, or if it was a Vector you could call addElement() or whatever.<p>In the GP's case, bar is a member field, not a local, so I don't think it needs to be final, and a quick test checks out. But if those were variables local to a method and you referenced them from an anonymous inner class, they would have to be final.<p>See: <a href=""http://c2.com/ppr/wiki/JavaIdioms/ClosuresThatWorkAroundFinalLimitation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/ppr/wiki/JavaIdioms/ClosuresThatWorkAroundFina...</a><p>If I recall correctly, from digging into the famous Guy Steele quote ""we were after the C++ programmers.
