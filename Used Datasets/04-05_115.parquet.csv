SQL scales, but you need expensive, exotic hardware (InfiniBand switches, SAN storage) that requires niche engineering skills just to get up and going. By the time a startup-type company purchases all of this hardware and has figured out how to use it, the window of opportunity will have closed. In addition, you're then pretty much locked into support from the vendor for performance issues. With solutions like Cassandra, you've got the source and can solve your own problems, which, to a company rich in software engineering talent, is exactly what they want.<p>Even if you look past all that, RAC and ASE will run into limits as they're still relational, which is not a truly scalable approach to data modeling. There are real limits to their scalability as well. Oracle RAC will only scale to 100 nodes. That's a lot of dough for a 100 node limit.<p>So there it is. SQL doesn't scale (effectively or efficiently).",1267592386.0

There are many aspects to data, how it is used, how it should be stored & accessed, and what is or it not important within the set of available data.  The RDBMS cabal set a particular set of standards (ACID) that were a good match for a lot of the early ""big data"" systems and the computing infrastructure of the time, but times change.  As more people are bringing new data sets, new uses and access patterns for this data, and the computing infrastructure is changing from large servers to swarms of small systems the options for storing and accessing this data are also changing.  I don't know many in the NoSQL crowd who are actually opposed to a RDBMS as a solution, but it is not necessarily the first choice for any problem; most of the people in this group seem to start by considering the data and the application and then picking and choosing the characteristics of the data system that will be used to meet these needs.  The massive and highly distributed systems get a lot of attention (and they are almost always NoSQL systems) but that does not mean that alternative data systems do not have a place up and down the IT stack, nor does it mean that a RDBMS is not a good option for some situations.",1267592226.0

We're going to dip again; it's unclear when. This is because, despite the bailout, there hasn't been any material change in the workings of Wall Street; we've merely reduced the number of players.<p>Wall Street salaries will always be high relative to other industries, but what will change post-crash (the upcoming one) is that the industry will employ fewer people. We'll have as many if not more billionares made by hedge funds, but the number of players is going to drop considerably, and Wall Street will no longer be able to singularly support the Manhattan economy (and no industries other than finance and ""biglaw"", whose clients are mostly Wall Street firms, pay sufficiently to support these prices). This will be good for New York's diversity and character; bad for real estate prices. But it could easily take 5-10 years before RE prices revert to a reasonable level.

All great design is obvious because great design produces things that are appropriate. Moreover, because great design is so obvious, it must be easy to design great things; the world must be full of great designs.<p>Right?<p>Um, no. The truth is that great design is NOT easy, and it stands out so prominently because the world is NOT full of great designs. Things like swiping to unlock are ""obvious"" only in retrospect. All great design is obvious -- in retrospect -- because great design produces things that are appropriate. But it is hard to do (PG has several essays on precisely this topic). Moreover, because it is hard to do, great designers are rewarded with some degree of protection for making the details of their innovations public (thus the legal terminology that patents ""teach"" a particular topic). I don't see why we should expect great designers to give up control of their ideas, willingly or otherwise, simply because those ideas are particularly good. Much of the logic in these comments amounts to ""the iPhone had such a marvelously simple UI that everyone copied it, and because it became pervasive (by virtue of the copying), it must remain pervasive via Apple giving up the right to protect their IP.""<p>I just don't buy that.<p>Also, people are asking ""why now? why not earlier?""

They can't sue Google (remember that Schmidt sat in Apple's huddles for years, listening to the plays, learning the playbook by heart, soaking up all insider info he could) because Google is intentionally disabling contested technology in Android -- they evidently know quite well what patent infringement means. Google is instead relying upon their handset manufacturers to enable the contested technology and thus take the bullet for them.
