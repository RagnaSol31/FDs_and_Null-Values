If it was made simple then we would probably have korean matches commentated in a billion languages and analysis/strategy video podcasts all over the place.<p>We decided to do something about it.\nTwo years later it's finally ready.<p>What it does is basically that you can pick any YouTube video and cast over it instantly. You can draw, put pictures and write over the video and add links to wikipedia or whatever you want. People can watch you doing all of this live, or just wait till you're finished and then watch your vod. Absolutely no software install or download or upload required. Oh yeah and you can do it together with friends too.<p>Time passed by and nowadays SC2 will probably get the most use out of it but after launching our private-Beta, we've noticed many people are using eLive for many other reasons than just casting a Starcraft match : working with friends over the web, singing karaoke, making video game reviews, doing interactive audio/video podcasts, doing translation... wow, people are just so creative !<p>Here some videos if you wish to learn more about us :\nhttp://www.elive.pro/main/vfaq<p>And if you want to test it yourself, just apply for a BETA key and we'll be happy to send you one when we have free slots :)<p>PS : this is the TechCrunch FRANCE article talking about eLive :\nhttp://fr.techcrunch.com/2010/08/31/avec-gamersband-et-elive-pimentez-vos-parties-de-jeux-video-invitations-beta-inside/",1285042941.0
