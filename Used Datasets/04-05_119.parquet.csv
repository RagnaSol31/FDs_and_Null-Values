I expect something similar will apply when large numbers of small, cheap autonomous drones start being deployed. It has real-world applicability. It was also effective, I believe, in EVE Online. Plus, it was an interesting application of technology. It wasn't just ""shoving"".<p>By comparison, Ferris' shoving tactic is virtually useless outside of the context of a ring-based martial art competition. (Maybe if you got in a fight on the edge of a cliff, or on the roof of a building, or next to a pool of sharks...)",1292475549.0

We built a home-grown e-commerce platform, and made it scale.  Lots of interesting challenges for hackers and a strong technology focus - improvements to the platform contributed directly to the bottom line.<p>Year 2 has a different emphasis.  Many of the technical challenges are now past us.  We did such a good job in Year 1 that we don't have to do much WRT scaling, UX optimization etc in Year 2.  Year 2 is more about sales and marketing - continuing to find channels to acquire members and getting products into the store that people want (at good prices).<p>This has much less of a technology emphasis than Year 1, and indeed while Year 1 was very exciting, in Year 2 I find it difficult to motivate my team when the tasks at hand are things like ""ok guys so we need a modification to our internal admin tool so that marketing can..."".<p>Sure, there are constant improvements to be made.  We do regular tweaks.  We think up mini projects (""site looks weird on Android.  ok lets fix that this week"").

23,2011133,comment,2008704.0,2010408.0,0,0,pjscott,,,"I'm definitely not talking about mutable state that's shared between processes. I don't want global variables, or any such thing. I just want to be able to write little blocks of code where I can change local variables. To illustrate what I'm getting at, here's some code in JavaScript which will calculate the nth Fibonacci number:<p><pre><code>    function fib(n) {\n        var a = 0, b = 1;\n    \n        for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            var temp = a + b;\n            a = b; b = temp;\n        }\n    \n        return 'fib(' + n + ') = ' + a;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIt uses a for loop. Of course, you could do the same thing with a tail recursive function, or probably some higher-order-function trickery, but a for loop is a very direct way of putting it.<p>But how do we implement this on the Erlang VM? It doesn't support any of this dangerous mucking around with the values of variables! As you rightly point out, there are good reasons for this. What we <i>can</i> do is convert this to, essentially, continuation-passing form. This looks awkward is JS, but it gives the same answer:<p><pre><code>    function fib_cps(n) {\n        function forloop(a, b, i, cont) {\n            if (i < n) {\n                return forloop(b, a + b, i + 1, cont);\n            } else {\n                return cont(a);\n            }\n        }\n    \n        return forloop(0, 1, 0, function(result) {\n            return 'fib(' + n + ') = ' + result;\n        });\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe for loop was converted to a tail-recursive function which takes the values of all the mutable local variables and tail-calls some function with (some subset of) these mutable local variables. Since Erlang has proper tail-call support, this should be no problem. And it doesn't require any modification to how heaps are handled, or Erlang's garbage collection scheme, or anything. It ""just"" takes some compiler work.<p>That's what I had in mind. Does it sound more reasonable?",1292474565.0

I wish I’d <i>ever</i> had a body like yours; I can barely touch my nose to my knee without bending it, and I still can’t do a simple handstand, even backed by a wall.  And it’s a huge step up from many, many high-schoolers who spent those same thousands of hours playing Mario 64, getting drunk, and screwing.<p>With regard to high-school achievements, though, what do you think of Julian Assange, Jon Lech Johansen, William Kamkwamba, and Aaron Swartz, who were high-school-aged at about the same time you were?  When they were 14-18 years old, they disrupted overseas nuclear research; enabled free software to play DVDs; electrified their town with a windmill built from scrap; and contributed to defining RSS, published a standards-track RFC on RDF, and defined the Creative Commons metadata standards; respectively.<p>(I’m not saying this to make you feel bad. My own achievements in high school consisted of learning calculus, learning a little about the internet, and not getting anybody pregnant.)<p>It’s true that most presidents from a hundred years ago are forgettable. I can list quite a number of <i>people</i> from before 1910, though — let’s say people who had a substantial impact in the 1890–1910 period: off the top of my head, Edison, his assistant Dickson, Tesla, Bell, Michelson, Morley, Einstein, Carnegie, Hollerith, Curie, Becquerel, Röntgen, Hearst, Gandhi, Jack London, Mark Twain, Darrow, Susan B. Anthony, and Cixi.<p>Looking these folks up, here are their achievements during that time. I deleted a couple from the list above because they didn’t achieve anything significant during that time.<p>Edison: funded the invention of motion-picture cameras and projectors and did some of the inventing. First commercial film piracy in 1902. Electrocuted an elephant in 1903 to publicize the dangers of AC electricity. Developed first commercially practical fluoroscope, killing his assistant Dally in the process. Invented prefabricated concrete buildings. (He did a bunch of other stuff, but that was before 1890.)<p>Dickson: led the team that did most of the inventing, founded the first film studio.<p>Röntgen: discovered X-rays, received a Nobel prize.<p>Tesla: supposedly discovered the skin damage caused by X-rays before Röntgen discovered the rays, invented RF oscillators, built the first (?) radio, maybe invented transformers, built a radio-controlled boat, fought for AC, supposedly invented ignition coils and spark plugs, invented AND gates (?), invented the bladeless turbine, built history’s largest Tesla coil, went broke and somewhat mad. (Too bad I didn’t think of Bose, Marconi, J.P. Morgan, or De Forest off the top of my head.)<p>Bell: led the Bell Telephone Company, built hydrofoils, commercialized the phonograph.<p>Michelson: made improvements in the manufacture of diffraction gratings. Michelson grating ruling engines are still in use today. (His famous experiment with Morley was in 1887, and his high-precision measurements of the speed of light were even earlier.)<p>Morley: Replicated the Michelson-Morley experiment to much higher precision with Miller.<p>Einstein: in 1905, published papers explaining the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of matter and energy.<p>Carnegie: prevented the annexation of Cuba, launched Carnegie Steel Company, sold it for US$225 million, founded public libraries all over the US and UK, founded half of CMU, founded TIAA-CREF, failed to settle the Homestead Strike, which ended up killing a number of people.<p>Hollerith: founded one of the four companies that would eventually merge to become IBM and led the technical development of tabulating machines.<p>Curie: discovered that radioactivity made air conductive, discovered that thorium was radioactive, discovered polonium and radium, invented the word “radioactivity”, received a Nobel prize and many other awards.<p>Becquerel: discovered radioactivity, received a Nobel prize, died.<p>Röntgen: discovered X-rays, received the first Nobel prize in physics and several other awards.<p>Hearst: co-invented yellow journalism with Pulitzer, founded a national political party, and (again with Pulitzer) started the Spanish-American War, initiating US imperialism.<p>Gandhi: was accepted to the bar, failed at establishing a law practice, moved overseas, founded the Natal Indian Congress, led civil-rights activism in South Africa, survived a lynching attempt, organized a volunteer ambulance corps to support the British war effort against the Zulus, began to abandon his racist beliefs, gave up sex, and invented satyagraha.<p>London: got arrested for being a Socialist, and wrote <i>The Call of the Wild</i>, <i>The Unparalleled Invasion</i>, <i>To Build a Fire</i>, <i>White Fang</i>, and <i>The Sea-Wolf</i>, all of which are still read today.<p>Darrow: represented Debs in the Pullman Strike case, once successfully and once unsuccessfully; helped organize the Populist Party; successfully defended Big Bill Haywood, Moyer, and Pettibone; published his first book.<p>Twain: wrote <i>Pudd’nhead Wilson</i>, <i>The Mysterious Stranger</i>, <i>Letters from the Earth</i>, his autobiography, and a vicious literary criticism of the Leatherstocking series that’s better reading than the Leatherstocking series itself; did a six-year around-the-world lecture tour; survived a depression when everyone he loved died; introduced Helen Keller to the rich benefactor who paid for her education; became VP of the American Anti-Imperialist League; received an honorary doctorate; died.<p>Anthony: created the National American Woman Suffrage Association; worked for universal adult female suffrage in the US until six years before hear death. She succeeded 14 years after her death.<p>Cixi: led a coup d’état against her nephew, the emperor Guangxu, bringing herself to power, and later poisoned him with arsenic; abolished the imperial examination system; and, through political miscalculation, ended 268 years of Qing Dynasty rule in China and 2133 years of imperial rule in China; but kept China independent.<p>๛<p>So, I don't think it's hopeless to try to achieve things that will be remembered in 100 years. People do it every year. It's just that getting elected president isn't a particularly effective way to do it.",1292474046.0

This has nothing to do with what I wrote.<p>The resources used PER CAPITA in suburbs will be greater than the resources used  PER CAPITA in a dense urban core, other things being equal. This is a simple matter of space and resource use. Resources will tend to be more heavily used in a dense urban core, therefore society gains more benefit from that those resources, assuming the point of the resource is to be used.<p>Compare the use of fuel in the city, and fuel in suburbs. Much fuel in the suburb is spent on automobiles, which are well known to be inefficient. In a city you will have mass transit, which offers a more efficient use of fuel, per capita.<p>You write:<p>""In an urban environment, sure fuel costs per person drop drastically, but when other costs are taken into account, I remain unconvinced it is so much cheaper.""<p>Nowhere did I say the city was cheaper than the suburbs. I suggest the opposite - the suburbs are cheaper than the cities.

No matter what, there are gives and takes.<p>Browser plugins might be the eventual solution's first steps, though they're more and more becoming sandboxed websites (which I like.

I guess that would be quite a lot of work for them and I know the economy is not the best right now, but it seems to me that software developers are still in short supply.\nAnd the other question is: what salary could i expect as an intern?
