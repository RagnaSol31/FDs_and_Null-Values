That's why you can quickly come up with stories of the Mark Zuckerberg's, Andrew Carnegie's, and Steve Jobs' who never graduated college, but just as quickly come up with stories of the Mark Pincus', Phil Knight's, and Jeff Skoll's who got MBA's and became immensely successful entrepreneurs.

In addition, they have large classes and spend hours and hours grading and providing valuable feedback on homework/projects and exams.<p>For the sake of the discussion, some sample thoughts about what the ""good"" teachers think about:<p>What about considering the larger questions? Why are the students in the course in the first place? Throughout the course, are they being inspired to continue their studies outside of class? Why is the material on the syllabus actually on the syllabus -- what purpose does any of it serve the students? Is this purpose taught in such a way that it is understood by the students? Are they often intrinsically motivated to learn or are most of them just seeking a good grade? How can you structure each activity, lecture, and exam to ensure or encourage students to be intrinsically motivated and care about their learning and development? How can you help students desire the knowledge long-term, rather than just for the course or for their studies...? Are the students learning to think about the subject at a deeper level -- more like the experts? How can you encourage such thinking? Is the learning environment or atmosphere itself safe and welcoming -- encouraging students to ask questions without fear of failure or looking dumb, and is free from stereotypes and negative expectations -- does it encourage free-thinking, discovery, negotiation of meaning -- does the teacher feedback encourage all this? Is the learning functional or is it just leading to correct answers? Do the students to the proper extent have control over their own education/learning? Are the expectations in place to encourage this? Is it thought about what should be expected of the students once they complete the lesson, section or course? What deep mental models does it appear the students have that prevent them from learning to their fullest? How could those be tackled? How can it be encouraged to collaborate on finding answers? How can the course be taught by having the students asking the proper questions rather than being told what to think?... and so on.<p>Taxing...",1310359124.0
