I see tons of laptops around but I have yet to see a Vietnamese using a Macbook. Maybe the people that can afford to fly can also afford a more expensive laptop?<p>I do see a fair number of iPhones around though. Maybe because comparable Android phones aren't significantly cheaper.,1313729970.0

For example, if you put in 5 productive hours of work a day and end up achieving a, what you describe as a happy life, you would consider that success.<p>But a lot of people tend to measure success in a different way. For example, Even though during atleast two days in a week I might have opportunity to go back early. I purposefully use the free time to check if I can do some extra work which will give an edge to my career. Generally its something like this, I check if I can add some feature that has a direct impact on revenue or some bug that I can fix or something I can read upon which will help me take more informed decisions later.<p>I was not a very brilliant kid in the school, nor in college nor during my engineering. In fact I was almost on border, but I would always make it. How? By multiplying effort over time. Most of my friends back in school when I meet them today, find it astonishing that I have made it so big in the industry, while even many high scoring folks haven't.<p>At work my philosophy is very simple, Seize every work opportunity as it comes. Ensure you multiply effort with time. Thereby, completely hedging for my low IQ by sheer work alone. Indeed as they say opportunity multiplies as you seize it. I also see a lot of high scoring people straight out of college who don't do it big in the industry. Because intelligent people expect, brilliance will make up for everything. But the fact is, Intelligence only acts as a catalyst in the path to success. The bulk of everything else is sheer hard work.<p>Apart from this its important to understand things like management. Especially time management. Its important to plan, review and track your life time, decade, yearly , monthly and weekly goals. Measuring your productivity is important. Reviewing it constantly, and course correction is the key.<p>The great thing is today you can achieve anything by sheer work. This gives me great hope for the future.",1313728434.0

How does the way that you store dates internally have anything to do with date parsing? If you are accepting dates from users, then you still have to normalize then to unix timestamps.<p>That also doesn't cover things like:<p>* Take this date and convert it into a week represented by the last Sunday of the week (i.e. 20110410 represents 20110403-20110409).<p>* Basically anything involving days of the week.",1313728199.0

That's exactly why HP is getting out of the consumer PC business.<p>You might be right though that lots of people have no interest in a post-PC era but how much longer will the discount PC isle be well stocked? They may not have much of a choice. HP decided the business model is broken and not worth saving. They were relying on constant growth of the PC market to slash prices to the bone. Now what? If there's not enough demand prices will have to increase. If the business model is broken for HP isn't it probably broken for Dell and the other big PC OEMs too. They will benefit in the short term from HP bowing out but over the next 3-5 years they will face the same problem.
