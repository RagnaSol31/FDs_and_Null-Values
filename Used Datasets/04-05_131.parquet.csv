All wheat (fiat currency ) is blown to the top of the silo where the value is stored until it is needed to be converted back into fiat currency again.<p>At the bottom on a equal basis Bitcoin purchasers and miners go to the market when they desire convert back into fiat currency to pay required taxes and or expenses that can only be done in fiat currency. The volatility in price is a added incentive for those using Bitcoin as a payment system to convert back to Fiat currency thus reducing the stored value.<p>Miners contribution (processing power and electricity) occur outside the silo (this is there basis of claim and conversion to fiat currency to pay the operating bills).<p>The miners do not increase the amount of wheat (fiat currency )  in the silo system. \nBitcoins by there simple function produce no new income or growth either inside or outside the silo that increases the stored value of wheat (capital) in the silo.<p>So any distribution to miners reduces the amount of wheat (stored capital ) by almost 40% which is dilutive to those who paid full price to buy Bitcoin.<p>Tommorow if the market price of Bitcoin increase more wheat is added to silo. This is just borrowing against the future stored value.<p>If enough Bitcoin is exchanged for the stored value in the silo  (fiat currency) then the market price will drop to reflect this inequality.<p>Mining bitcoin is a dilutive to the value paid by those who buy Bitcoin in the free market by those who receive coins for mining. lets do some simple math based upon today statistics. Todays volume 6297.55 x Avg price 247.6 =\n$1,559,273.38 minus (3,800 coins mined x 247.6 = 618,393.38)\n98.1958666466.

Great job on the UI.One thing kinda bugged me was when you select the source from the sidepanel it collapses for each selection not allowing to select another source without collapsing. I am on OSX Yosemite/Chrome-Version 41.0.2272.104. Also is the backend Elasticsearch?\nIs the backend elasticsearch?,1427602258.0

Although you would think that by living in the city the individual will save money by expending significantly less natural resources and dramatically lowering his carbon footprint, it ironically costs him less money to do the exact opposite by living in the suburbs. This is because if the individual chooses to live in the city he must pay an extraordinarily high commission in the form of capital gains or rent to land lords. From a financial standpoint living in the suburbs is the only rational choice.<p>This type of counterintuitive behavior only occurs because we live in an era where oil is dirt cheap. This is the only time in human history where living farther away from the city is actually cheaper then living closer to it. Before the advent of the automobile, urban infrastructure centered around walkable cities as you will see throughout Europe. One day, as we start running out of oil, the suburbs will become the new ghettos.",1427602188.0
