So with Readdis I can send a link out to my team in preparation for a meeting, and before the meeting, I can check who (which user) has read it, who hasn't, and take the appropriate action (ie. send a reminder).  I find bit.ly is made for mass sharing where you make a post and there's very little feedback on the people consuming it.  All you really know is how many people click on it.  What I am trying to do with Readdis is make it more like real life sharing where you know who's consuming it, when, and take action accordingly (which is what the instant notification and weekly updates are trying to do).",1292561925.0

I hired some pros from various translation websites. All were more expensive (money-wise) than MT, but the results were better, and I spent a lot less time.

For example, I wanted to buy some climbing shoes recently.  I have never bought a pair before, had no idea what I should be looking for and what size I should get.  I went to a local climbing specialist, they talked me through the options, fitted me for a shoe, etc.  At that point I could have left the store and bought the shoes on eBay for about 75% of what they would have cost in the store, but I didn't - I chose to pay full price because the store offered me a valuable service.   If that store hadn't been there I couldn't have tried on the shoes.  So I think there is a place for paying more for goods when you want/need extra assistance.<p>In the case of huge stores like BestBuy that are basically like a warehouse with pretty much no customer service except at the checkout I would have no problem buying from the cheapest alternative provider (Amazon/ebay/whatever).",1292561296.0
