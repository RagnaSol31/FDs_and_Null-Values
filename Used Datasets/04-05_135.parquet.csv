We've ported nearly everything out now but there are some algorithms that are still in there for no other reason than never getting around to porting them, but the other thing we rely pretty heavily on Flash for is cross domain communication with 3rd party services, many of them don't support or know about CORS/jsonp but getting them to add a crossdomain.xml on their site was easy. We'll probably just disable support for those services for people who don't have Flash. We'll also probably prefer to use flash whenever it is available for playback, because so far for the most part HTML5 audio is still more flaky and gives us less control over buffering/playback than Flash does...but at least the basic aspects of the site that most people care about will be able to work seamlessly whether or not you have flash. Eventually. :)",1346907509.0

They made an open mobile OS, and released it to the world.  What makes it attractive to the handset manufacturers and the carriers is that they don't have a software vendor trying to exert control over the product.<p>You can make a direct comparison to windows phone: Microsoft has all kinds of restrictions for handset manufacturers and carriers about what they can do with it: device makers can't bundle shitty bloatware, tight hardware requirements, updates are controlled, etc.  All things that produce a good experience for the end user.  And look how the vendors reacted: the OEMs don't really want to build them, the carriers don't push them, the salespeople recommend android over it, and usage is minimal.  Maybe if google took the same route and forced all the OEMs to upgrade to the latest firmware, those 21% of android phones that are on ICS would be android's total market share.",1346907487.0

9,4482902,comment,4480009.0,4480237.0,3,0,eric-hu,,,"> When people want AI in video games they want the AI to be truly smart.<p>Yes!  This statement made me think immediately of Team Fortress 2 and how impressive talented spy-players are.  They're so impressive that I can be in awe of a good player whether he's my ally or my opponent.  Of course, the latter also comes with some frustration.<p>For those unfamiliar, the spy in TF2 has the ability to cloak (turn invisible) for a few seconds as well as indefinitely disguise himself as a member of the enemy team.  Subtle cues give away a disguised spy--he can't run 'through' team members of the same color like true allies can; he un-disguises if he attacks.  His deadliest attack is the backstab--knife someone in the back to instantly kill.<p>What makes good spy players so impressive is that they've anticipated how other people behave and have thought of effective countermeasures.<p>A troll-ish, albeit intelligent, example of such intelligence involves a spy spraying a provocative out-of-game image on a wall at a corner.  He cloaks when an enemy approaches and waits near the corner.  Most new players will pause when running past the image to have a closer look.  The spy then uncloaks and backstabs the player.<p>Example: <a href=""http://youtu.be/zOR3snVKW0E?t=18s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/zOR3snVKW0E?t=18s</a><p>Pre-programming this sort of behavior makes it quickly predictable, unless the AI has enough variety in its 'bag of tricks' that it would take a long time to learn it all...just like playing against a skilled opponent for a long time.  I'd love to see the day when game AI could discover such behaviors on its own, searching for new ones when old techniques become too common.",1346907465.0

They then put these into storage and waited a decades, until they knew what comic books from the '30s and '40s were valuable.<p>Would they then be able to make forgeries of those comics, using their properly aged paper and ink, and so fool collectors?

17,4482894,comment,4482778.0,4482778.0,3,0,shrughes,,,"The Dvorak layout.  The high return?  Using Emacs is less bad for the hands, I think, because Ctrl+X stretches the fingers apart instead of scrnching them up.  Also, the underscore key is in a very accessible location.  I tried learning it in high school, failed, and eventually forced it upon myself in my freshman year by playing a video game while using it.  The problem?  It is low-return.<p>Another?  Learning Haskell would count, except I did it for fun, so there was no risk.  I could say learning Perl has been very useful, but again, there was very little risk -- I was in high school and didn't have a computer I could use all the time, so I simply read the 3rd edition of <i>Programming Perl</i> straight through up to the reference section, and then reread the first 7 or 8 chapters.  That taught me how regular expressions worked, that closures existed and how they worked, and other mundane stuff like foreach loops and pipes.<p>Another?  Maybe learning about math.  I spent a lot of effort learning a little bit of math.  When I think about the return I've gotten, well, I'm very comfortable with discrete math and quite good at estimating the performance of programs.  The presence of some math-related things on my resume helped me land the phone screen for my first job out of college.  The problem?  It was low risk because I enjoyed it.<p>Another?  Golf.  You could say it was my parents who took the risk because they paid for lessons and clubs, while I enjoyed every minute of learning how to play.  The return?  It's fun to play but really it's that I got my dad to start playing.  He now enjoys it a lot more than I do and has made several friends through the game.  My return?  One time the son of a guy my dad played golf with several times hired me for a cool summer job dealing with optics measurement systems.  The problem is that this is a lame example: no risk for me, and the return was kind of indirect.<p>Another?  Making sure to take the core CS classes while I got a math major.  The reward?  I was able to tack on a dual CS major with another semester (plus got some knowledge).  The risk was 5 or 6 poorly taught CS classes.<p>Another?  Maybe Emacs counts.  I couldn't convince myself to learn it and use it the first time, but eventually I managed to convert myself over to XEmacs from whatever awful thing I was using.  However, it's not as much of a risk as Vim, which is known to cause brain damage.<p>Another?  Learning how to play the piano.  I spent 12 years taking piano lessons.  The return?  When I had wrist problems as an adult programmer, I got a digital piano and started playing again, and the wrist problems went away for good.",1346907242.0
