It’s hard for developers to get their products into schools, it’s hard for teachers to use them, and school districts have no idea how effective those products are.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three years, we’re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (19M kids), and 42,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re currently a team of 80 people (33 engineers) based on downtown SF.  Right now we’re looking for a stellar product manager: someone who can see around corners, bulldoze through obstacles, and marshal engineering support to build products that schools and students love.<p>Check us out at <a href=""https://clever.com/about/jobs",
