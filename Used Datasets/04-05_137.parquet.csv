You will not know if your interventions are helping or hurting the people you are treating until you do a properly controlled study.<p>Second: in my experience, one of the major problems with screens for synergistic (or additive) therapies is multiple testing. If you test 100 compounds (10,000 combinations), a large number of combinations will appear to work by chance. Do you have a secondary screening approach to reduce false positives?",1426135006.0
