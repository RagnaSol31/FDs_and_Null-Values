This is in order to create more dividends in the future. Once reinvesting becomes expected, it just means that dividends aren't getting paid. We blur that issued then reinvested concept & just readjust our expectation for companies to grow.<p>The issue is that a situation where dividends are the norm, this keeps the system honest. Cash is harder to fake. If people own stock for dividends it's harder to get carried away.<p>The reality is that many companies will probably never pay dividends justifying their current valuations.<p>You can't just say that you've abstracted away the middle part & look at indicators of indicators of indicators forever. This isn't engineering. There is an enormous psychological element involved. You wouldn't get Uncle Khaled to invest in your shop if he visited & saw that no one walked through the door.",1230872387

13,417051,comment,415683.0,417008.0,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I would definitely recommend <i>starting</i> with some other text.  I agree with everything you said about its turgidity.<p>However, I really think people should make their way through it anyway.  Part of this is because most intro textbooks seem to gloss over it: I remember suddenly finding myself studying aggregate supply and aggregate demand in my intro macro course, and thinking ""Wait...this doesn't make any sense.  It's not at all like the equilibrium models we were just doing.  And it directly contradicts what we were just taught about the interest rate being the equilibrium price in the loanable funds market.""   I can only speak to Mankiw's textbook, but the presentation seemed very disconnected.<p>The other reason I think people should read it is that there's a very widespread tendency in Internet discussions for people to say ""Those dumbass Keynesians.  They didn't get anything right"" and then discount <i>everything</i> in the theory.  But their arguments are usually based on a misunderstanding of what Keynes was really saying, and he has rebuttals and justifications <i>in the book</i> that would make you think a little harder about what you're trying to discredit.<p>I view Keynes as being a lot like Newtonian physics.  There're edge cases where it's wrong; you certainly can't take it as a universal rule.  But his basic insights were mostly right, and you need to understand them to understand the more precise models that came later.",1230871378

And there may be additional function call overhead (which may be avoidable by having the compiler in-line it).  One reason to use goto is the style that all functions should have one entry and one exit.  Even if the cleanup code was put into its own function, you'd still have to ensure that the function was called in all the right places before returning.  Without gotos, the logic can become harder to follow through a series of if-else blocks.",1230870059
