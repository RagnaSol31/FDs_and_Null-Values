Some context: I live in Seattle, grew up in Minneapolis, went to school in New York, and my aunt and uncle lived/live in Manhattan and have for the last 25 years. I recently got them to experiment with Uber in New York. They rarely take taxis, so it was just sort of a novelty.  They hated the experience but only because they believe there has been a significant loss of &quot;institutional knowledge&quot; about cities (for lack of a better term, I guess).  What I mean by that is this driver had no clue where to go. I think this is sort of a danger with rideshare (not that I&",

My process was: Google for articles about taxi regulation, and see what percentage of them make the argument that regulation protects the underprivileged.  In my sample of 3 or 4, the answer was 0%, which seemed a clear argument against the sweeping claim that protecting the poor is &quot;the entire point of taxi regulation in the first place&quot; (note: not taxis, taxi <i>regulation</i>).<p>Furthermore, your links (or the few that I had time to investigate) do not support the central thesis that taxi <i>regulation</i> specifically protects the poor and underprivileged.  In fact, many of them are specifically contrary to your shallow analysis.<p>> Seniors, housewives, the disabled, and the poor each account for a much higher share of taxi trips than their share of the population (Rosenbloom 1985; Weiner 1982).<p>This says nothing about taxi <i>regulation</i> benefiting the poor.
