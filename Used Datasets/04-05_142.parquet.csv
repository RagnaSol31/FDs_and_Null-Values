Whatever density is reduced in iOS 7 has nothing to do with its flatness, but all to do with the designers conscious decision to give UI elements more breathing space. But I can point you to dozens of iOS 7 examples that are more information dense now than in iOS 6, and the main reason for this is the flatter, simpler aesthetic requiring less whitespace to make information identifiable.",1372307504.0
