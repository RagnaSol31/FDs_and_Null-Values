Add to that ""google-chrome --disable-images"" and it's a nice text-only twitterish feed of what my friends are up to.<p>On a related note, as a non-computer scientist who is not working in your field who loves to read about computer science, I find the blogs referenced by reddit and HN to be shrill pundits who aren't interesting or academic. Most of them are on the same level as the pundits of the journalism world and often include troll/flame bait headlines which are designed to pit two camps against each other. They tend to be the Zed/Dvorak/TheRegister type people who all openly confess that they are trolling. The ""academic"" articles referenced tend to be mostly flamewars about comp sci education and practice that revolve around languages rather than algorithms or interesting implementations and libraries. I suppose the reason for this is that link sharing websites are often oriented toward leisure time and goofing off and so people are not in a ""I want to learn a new concept"" mode and just want to talk shop and gossip a bit. It seems that, despite all the critiques of the mainstream media that come from the digital generation, we do love this type of activity and unmoderated we actually trend towards it.<p>I predict any HN startups that seek to solve the journalism/media questions that PG wants to address will not get around this basic feature of human psychology and will not be able to become something remarkably different (although I am sure they have the potential to make a lot of money). Therefore social change of a more fundamental type will come primarily in innovations and disruptions of education rather than of media. However, the currency and lead that universities have both in terms of branding/prestige and state-sponsorship will prevent any major startups in this area and most innovation will take place in university IT departments deploying open source e-education tools. I don't think any e-education tools in the cloud will survive in the long-term even if they can out pace development from universities in the short term.",1256619240.0

If we go carbon neutral and the final gross world product ends up at\n>> 2% less than this simple projection, it grows about 80.5% instead. Thus we'd\n>> reduce the amount of total growth by about 4%.""\n>\n> Hold on, that sounds nothing like what you originally said. I quote, ""Spending\n> about 2% of current world domestic product on CO2 mitigation seems perfectly\n> justifiable to me.""<p>They match perfectly, but you may have misunderstood what I was saying.<p>Several different studies have concluded that the cost of going carbon neutral would result in dropping future world domestic product by $1 trillion/year.  As the world grows, it is reasonable to assume that that trillion grows in proportion.  We would therefore suffer a permanent loss of 2% of production, on which you can superimpose otherwise normal growth curves.  So contrary to your repeated claim that I want to have my cake and eat it too, I'm talking about a large, ongoing economic hit.  However it is a small fraction of global product, and the hit is small relative to ongoing growth rates.<p>>> Thus we'd reduce the amount of total growth by about 4%. Take a 20th power and we\n>> find that the amount of growth in the end is reduced by a factor of 0.2% per year,\n>> compounding annually. Note that when I say 0.2% I don't mean that it would be 2.9%\n>> instead of 3.1%. Instead I mean that it would be 3.0934..% instead of 3.1%.\n>\n> I don't follow your calculations here. When I plug in 3.09% into a compound\n> interest calculator instead of 3.1%, after 20 years I get the same 184% answer. If you\n> suggest we can have our cake & eat it too, I suspect your math is screwy somewhere...<p>I could have messed up, let's to the math together.<p>Through this decade growth has averaged 3.1%/year.  So every year we have 1.031 times as much stuff produced as the previous year.  1.031^20 is 1.84150671005791.  So in 20 years I'd expect us to see 84% growth in production.  If we multiply that by 0.98 to account for the cost of mitigating global warming, we wind up with about 1.80467657585675 times as much production as today instead.  When I take a 20th root of that I get 1.02995907626323.  So we lost about 0.001% of growth/year, compounding annually.  That is about 3 percent of annual growth lost.<p>Oops, I definitely did have a calculation error.  Thanks for keeping me honest.  However you can still see that, relative to overall growth, we're talking fairly small numbers.<p>Another way to look at it is how far behind we are timewise.  And the answer is that at 3.1% growth we'll grow 2% in about 8 months.  So in 20 years and 8 months with CO2 mitigation our production will be about what it would have been in 20 years without.  Again a difference, but not that significant of one in the grand scheme of things.<p>Moving on, you're quoting figures from the IPCC about temperature and crop yields.  Those figures say that in the middle of the projections for where we are a century from now, crop yields are likely to decrease.  Furthermore we're not just talking higher temperatures.  We're also talking changing weather patterns, which likely means increased drought in most mid-latitude areas.  You might want to ask some of the farmers in California how drought is helping their crop yields these days, if you can find any in business.  (Yeah, I know, there is also a court case feeding into that.  But according to the climate models that business would have had to go away in the end anyways.)<p>(Skims forward.)  I think you're underestimating the economic and lasting effects of war.<p>Ah yes, the pollution item.  Carbon sequestration is popular because it doesn't harm any vested interests.  However it has never been proven on a large scale, and current estimates have solar and wind being cheaper.  If you generate the power on the grid with solar and wind, then replace cars with electric vehicles, it is amazing how much air pollution goes away.<p>Now you may say that electric vehicles aren't going to be adopted.  If you think that, go read <i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i> and its follow-up <i>The Innovator's Solution</i>.  One of the case studies is the car industry.  Based on technology curves the prediction in the mid-90s was that hybrids would be brought out in this decade, and electric cars would become fully competitive with old cars around 2020 or so.  Those curves have continued to hold, and so - even without any government intervention - the likely widespread adoption of electric cars is about a decade or so off.  Therefore planning on that future isn't exactly pie in the sky dreaming.<p>(Reads further.)<p>Well your comment about not valuing millions of poor people very much speaks volumes about your ethical system.  Likewise I'm guessing you don't really care about details like mass extinctions in the oceans.  With such a big gulf in our mattering maps we're not going to see eye to eye on a lot of big topics.",1256618013.0

I usually end up telling myself it's crazy to think that I can compete with Google, but the recent thread (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=902999) on the apparently declining quality of Google search, especially for niche queries, got me thinking that it might not be so crazy after all. What's more, I know of at least one existing search startup in this domain who seem to be doing well, so that's some additional validation of this market.<p>Although I'm a pretty competent hacker, I'm new to search. I've done some reading on search and information retrieval in general, and picked up a copy of Manning et al.'s ""Introduction to Information Retrieval"", (http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html) which looks fantastic.<p>However, I don't want to reinvent too many wheels, at least not until I really have to. I'm planning to dive into Hadoop, Lucene, Nutch, Solr, and other open source tools and see how far those can take me.<p>I would appreciate any advice on this endeavor -- preferably from your own real world experience -- tips, tricks, pitfalls, resources, etc.<p>One particular issue that I've pondered is how to do a good ""targeted"" web crawl -- how to restrict the crawl (or at least indexing) to pages I know are relevant to my domain. It occurred to me to seed the crawler with a set of ""authoritative"" domains that I know are relevant, then use pages from those domains to train a simple classifier to apply to each page visited, to decide whether to index it and crawl its outgoing links. Any other (simpler?) strategies?<p>Also, how far can I realistically expect to get with ""off-the-shelf"" OSS tools like Nutch, etc.? Those of you who've used such tools ""in anger"", what roadblocks and brick walls can I expect to run into?<p>Thanks in advance!",1256617380.0

Suicide bombers can probably achieve a higher murder rate than people with guns, much as people with guns can achieve a higher murder rate than people with knives, and people with knives can achieve a higher murder rate than people with clubs.<p>High availability of suicide bombers in a society is likely to lead to a higher homicide rate than in a society where suicide bombers are not so prevalent.
