As an environment to manipulate data in, it's by far the best that I've used- once you get the hang of it, the pattern/transformation-rule language is <i>incredibly</i> useful for reformatting, recoding, mixing, slicing, dicing, etc. one's data. If you're coming from Haskell, you'll probably pick this part up way faster than I did at first.<p>If your stats needs are relatively simple- linear models, glms, logit models, anovas, simple tests of hypotheses, etc.- MMA is more than adequate. The new version looks like it adds some non-parametric stats functions, as well as paired t-tests, both of which would be quite useful to me.<p>Also, the visualization tool in MMA are fabulous, and don't make me want to tear my beard out every time I have to go off the beaten path (as opposed to those found in certain other one-letter-long stats environments I could name). 'Nuff said. Another thing I really appreciate about MMA is how consistent the syntax and functions are- once you've figured out one function, the odds are good that your knowledge will be useful on the next function you try and figure out. This, again, stands in stark contrast to other packages (R, SAS, I'm looking at you guys).<p>I <i>have</i> found myself turning to R for certain specific things, though. Mixed-effects models, repeated-measure ANOVA, Fisher's Exact Test, etc. Really, the two work together well- it's easy to use MMA to get your data in exactly the right form for R, export it, and then do whatever you need from there.",1289883559.0

16,1909088,comment,1907516.0,1908506.0,0,0,stevenbedrick,,,"SPSS is quite good, for certain things. A lot of researchers use it because little-to-no programming is required, and you can interact with it in an entirely GUI-way- if you can use Excel, you can use SPSS. It makes it easy to set up certain analyses, and gives lots of output... and there's where my concerns about it come up. It's easy to fall into a false sense of security with it, and to end up with statistics that you don't know how to interpret properly (I call this the ""Huh. Now what do I do?"" problem). The documentation is often pretty useless on this front as well- lots of pages follow this general pattern: ""Jones Test of Gronkularity: If checked, SPSS will calculate the Jones Test of Gronkularity statistic, which tests the null hypothesis that the data are gronkular"", as opposed to useful information about why you might care whether the data are gronkular or not, why the Jones test was included in another test's output, etc. For a product aimed at people with relatively limited technical capabilities, I feel like SPSS should have better docs.<p>One important thing to know about SPSS- that a lot of people don't- is that is really a programming language, for which the GUI is simply a code generator. I find that it's almost always easier for me to interact directly with the under-the-hood guts of SPSS than the GUI, although sometimes when setting up a new analysis for the first time I'll use the GUI to do most of the work and then tweak its results.",1289883209.0

It makes sense to secure the passenger terminals instead of the individual planes to reduce the amount of equipment and staff needed.  LAX for example has 150 gates across 8 terminals.  Securing each plane would mean placing TSA agents, metal detectors, scanners, and X-Rays at 150 gates instead of just 8 terminals.<p>Come to think of it, US airport security is pretty weak compared to an airport like Manila NAIA (in the international terminal).  Passengers get checked curbside for passports and tickets, and again at the door.  Then they must pass through metal detectors and bag scanners to get into the ticketing area to get boarding passes.  Boarding passes and ID are checked again at immigration.  Then there is another bag scan and metal detector to get into the passenger terminal.  The last check is the most thorough.  To get to the individual gate, there is a checkpoint with one station where all carry-ons are opened and inspected, one station where passengers remove their shoes for inspection, and a final station for a pat-down by security.  This last security check must be repeated every time you go to the bathroom or visit the shops or restaurants.",1289881839.0

SMS<p>When I send a message via SMS, it could be either to pass on information or initiate (continue) a conversation.  Sometimes the content of the message isn't clear enough to highlight the context and when this happens between a boyfriend and girlfriend, the gates of hell can be opened, and the fury of a thousand suns going supernova is unleashed, usually on the hapless boyfriend (not a true story, I swear).<p>Or whether you should end the thread with 'ttys' or 'ttyl' or 'brb' as with IM protocol, and trust me, sometimes not continuing a SMS thread or not ending it nicely can lead to you having to spend money to say sorry.<p>Although I think SMS usage has been happening long enough that people generally tend to interpret context relatively well NOW, SMS communication sometimes do suffer from the problem of parties not knowing whether a conversation is supposed to be happening asynchronously or (relatively) synchronously.<p>If you have ever sent an SMS (usually to an attractive member of the opposite sex after a first meeting, or maybe a very prospective business contact) and waited for a few hours for a reply, frantically wondering if you had said something wrong, or that person wasn't interested in maintaining what looked like a blossoming relationship, then you understand how different perceptions of what mode a conversation is supposed to be in can sunder the social fabric.<p>2. Email<p>We tend to allow the intervals between subsequent emails in a conversation to be longer than SMS.  After all, there is the general understanding that accessing  and replying to one's email is harder than receiving and sending messages via SMS because of the ubiquity of the mobile phone versus Internet access on the move and the ease of entering a long form email versus sending a SMS.  Also, it is easier for most to type long message when emailing than when sending a SMS due to the nature of the clients and where we actually do it (i.e. on the desktop).  I usually switch to a more focused mode when reading emails because they generally are about work and are usually longer.<p>Subject headers in email are a great way to delineate threads.  An email with a new subject is the start of a new thread.<p>3.  Instant messaging<p>Instant messaging is clearly generally expected to be synchronous.  When instant messaging, there are socially acceptable standards to start and end a conversation.  The signaling has been learned.<p>Is it going to be impossible to learn the new social rules of engagement?  I don't believe it will be so.  However, I do believe that the lack of clear signaling of the context of a conversation (i.e. synchronous versus asynchronous, start of a new topic ...) could be disastrous.<p>Note: Maybe only some of us have to relearn.  It could very well be the younger generation already know how to contextualize the messages without use of the various channels, subject headers ... If so, I'm curious how they do it.",1289881650.0
