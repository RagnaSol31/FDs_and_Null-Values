The complaints are about the inegalitarian way market competition is used to drive down wages in specific sectors where workers are politically marginalized (tech rather than law, finance, medicine). People who suffer from this discrimination are not wrong to object to the selective commodification of their labour.<p>Additionally, the market-based alternative to H1-B is higher wages for domestic staff and expanded (and higher paying) contracting work abroad.",1425185845.0

Apparently male pumas roam a range approximately 3 times as large as female pumas, and therefore must be much more mobile to maintain their territory - average lingering time at a kill site was estimated to 7 hours shorter (2.86 vs 2.56 days) for males than females in areas with minimal human presence. The suggestion from the authors is that the since males are already under pressure to be mobile, that they were already spending close to the minimal amount of time required at a kill site to extract sufficient energy.<p>Other things of interest is that we can actually see variance in behavoir increasing as human density increases. The error bars (standard deviation) on time spent at kill sites (or really doing anything) open right up the moment housing appears.",1425185765.0

Those with seniority get to pick the best routes and can earn $250-300k. The new pilots however end up working terrible routes and earn 1/10th of that. Overall there is a huge amount of money going towards pilot pay because pilot unions have huge negotiating power. But the unions have determined how to distribute that wealth.,1425183929.0
