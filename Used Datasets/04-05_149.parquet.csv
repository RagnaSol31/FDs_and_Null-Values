You know, so you make a contribution to the cause?<p>It is annoying though that an install of both chrome devs and the ie9 betas overwrite the stable versions.  The firefox beta at least installed elsewhere so I can easily use the old version if I like without having to dick around with it.",1288933175.0

Some people's aptitude for handling complexity lulls them into relying on it to get themselves out of tight spots, rather than learning to architect their code better; and they wind themselves up tighter and tighter. And on the other side, ""app dev"", people are pulling together a lot more constraints than the bit-twiddling level, combining user stories, business strategy, long-term supportability and team development, UX, and a bunch of other things which, while more nebulous and less concrete, are usually more important, economically speaking.",1288933070.0

Does Chrome just sometimes decide to send hundreds of HTTP GET requests for no reason? Is it attempting to pipeline per the HTTP spec and just screwing up? This article is so high on rant and low on information I can't tell what's going on. Have you checked if there's a bug report or filed one yourself?,1288933042.0

The only basis for comparison I have is the wii.<p>Initially, there is some confusion as to what it is you're supposed to do but after a minute of awkward movement you get the hang of it. This feels much more natural than the wii, and the lack of controller is freeing. The full body movement detection is fun and really encourages you to move around. On the other hand, the sensitivity is not that high. It's okay with the casual games it comes with, but I'd like to see some more examples of, say, shooters.",1288933020.0

We are taught to destroy the three weak areas of the human body (can't fight if you can't see, can't fight if you can't breathe, can't fight if you can't walk).

On the other hand, I think the idiosyncrasies of javascript like `this` and call/apply, the enforced n-arity of functions, and a lot of the 'convert it to a string' fallbacks (think lisp 1) were attempts at fitting lisp concepts onto the self-like object system. Of course, I have no basis for this so I'm probably wrong, but it makes me feel better when I have to explain them.<p>I will note that JS is moving into limited metaprogramming with the harmony proxies proposal.
