I don't think that pure math or quantum physics or research or, in general, going academically above and beyond the call of duty, is something beyond the reach of regular people.<p>I do think that it takes years of general dedication towards learning to start tackling such topics, and it takes confidence to know that what one is aiming for is achievable, and it takes the honesty to realize when one truly is and when one truly isn't understanding some topic. I am continually astounded by the insight and intelligence of what some on this board might consider regular folk, and I think that what sets me apart from the masses isn't in hardware (a better brain), but software (beliefs and an outlook more conducive to learning).

Sure they could increase their leverage a bit, but this ""lifestyle business"" is more likely to be a success than the average VC backed startup....(unless success only means an exit north of $100m or whatever)<p>EG: Better to have %90 chance of %50 of a $30M business (what I'd evaluate their likely outcome as) than a %10 chance of %5 of a $200M business-- what they'd be looking at if they took VC funding.

14,79037,comment,78706.0,78875.0,0,0,BitGeek,,,"No.  The price of milk, oil and gas are all effected by inflation.<p>Inflation comes from only one source- an increase in the money supply.  When the government prints lots of money, inflation gets high (like the %10-%20 we're seeing now).  When the government isn't running printing presses in overdrive, then inflation is lower.<p>Milk, Oil and Gas prices are affected by a lot of factors such as regulation of these industries, farm subsidies, discoveries of new resources, productivity improvements, etc.<p>But when you define ""inflation"" as a measure of prices, then you speak in error.  Using the CPI as a measure of ""inflation"" is really untenable, and its a measure of just how economically ignorant americans are that every news report uses the term ""inflation"" when the government releases their current CPI numbers (which, by the way, are so manipulated that you can't compare them from year to year as they don't measure the same thing from one decade to the next...)<p>CPI is a fabrication designed to keep people from realizing how much of their money is being stolen by the government thru the mechanism of monetary inflation...<p>BTW, the constitution has written into it the requirement that it be run on a gold standard-- this trick is not new and the founding fathers were well aware of the actions of the bank of england.   WE were on a gold standard up until the 1930s-- the period where we were the fastest growing economy on the planet.  Since then, we've been slowing down, and this is not a coincidence.<p>This is really important for startups because if you are measuring your returns in USD you will get a very differnet number than if you are measuring them in Euros, and both of those will do poorly compared to an objective standard like gold.<p>We have the situation where the economy has not grown very much but the DJIA is at 14,000 or something.... people think this means the economy has grown, but the reality is that the dollar has simply declined.<p>The dollar is not an objective unit of measure, due to monetary inflation.\n",1194928111

18,79033,comment,78706.0,78706.0,0,0,BitGeek,,,"\nThis graph is in error.  Historically the price of gas has been declining over the period shown, if actual inflation figures were used.<p>The NYT uses government provided CPI based inflation- and CPI is based in part on the price of gas, etc... and chronically under-reported... thus trying to represent the price of gas adjusting for ""inflation"" measured by the price of gas doesn't really work.<p>Real inflation-- which is defined as growth in the money supply- would show that the price of gas has declined strongly over this period-- primarily because of the effects of the ""robber barrons"" who drove down prices to gain market share, and because productivity has made gas a much safer and easier item to get from oil... though I expect in recent years the prices would be going up because of increased government regulation and asinine ""environmental"" requirements.",1194927734

Neither were the years when I was 20-24 years old (when I was doing my doctorate).<p>Of course, if you're not interested in learning, you'll find college/university to be a waste -- and in such circumstances I would very much encourage dropping out.

However, the problem is that you're saying people <i>must</i> have a co-founder, and that they <i>must</i> manage this way... and there's a big difference between having a cofounder you've known a long time and getting a cofounder because you foolishly followed the advice of a self styled guru. <p>If my response seems harsh, its because your tone is pretty strong.  If you expressed your opinions in terms of preferences it would be one thing-- but you lay them down and defend them like they are religious law, and do not respond to the fact that this religious law does not work in all situations... which brings us back to the plane analogy-- its great for trying to make me look stupid, but its piss-poor (actually irrelevant) for arguing against what I was actually saying.\n",1194927449

I was also greatly swayed by the fact that this could earn me scholarships. These scholarships ended up paying for me the whole way -- I couldn't get an entrance scholarship because I never went to highschool.<p>I could choose my classes so that the material would be generally useful, by moving into a combined honors, or interdisciplinary degree. I tried really hard, and eventually people started coming to me for tutoring. I taught a few classes, professors asked if I wanted to work with them, and eventually I graduated with the university medal.<p>One thing that I never gave up on was the idea that you can turn anything from an 'assignment' into a really educational experience by going above and beyond. In math assignments, prove auxiliary theorems, and the general case. Always do the bonus problems. For projects, release on Sourceforge. Write essays to please an online audience. For new projects that would be better in a different language, learn the new language. Learn everything from first principles, and when something looks wrong, bring it up. Do all the readings, and read the original works. Program in programming contests. Program for fun. Program as reflex. Don't ask permission to do research. Live in Libraries.
