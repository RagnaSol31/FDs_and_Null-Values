That's when you need an engineer to solve the problem, CS will help you become one.\nThe question is do you want to be one?<p>If you are more into Internet entrepreneurship studying something that is not CS could give you more advantage. \nMany great programmers never create any significant software for themselves, their knowledge is too confined to CS. These are people you might want to hire once you have your start-up, tell them what exactly you need your software to do and they will perform.<p>Go to Top Coder's website. All the top schools are in Asia and Eastern Europe. Actually a school from Poland, my country comes, in 3rd. Few years ago it was 1st. I would hear on TV how we have the best programmers in the world. But did they ever create anything significant? No.\nMost of them now work for Google, MS or some other big corporation that needs people who can write very efficient algorithms fast. So while I could easily attend an university that generates those great programmers (even for free I think, not too sure) I never even thought about it.<p>Knowing the science behind paint does not make you a painter and you don't need it to become one.<p>I'm not in any way against CS, it's definitely very interesting to study and if you truly love programming then by all means go and study it.

There is a particular Facebook secret group that I visit absolutely every time I'm on Facebook, which is several times a day. That's a practical place for me to ask focused informational questions, and also a place where I can share a lot of camaraderie with dear friends who have had similar--and yet very diverse--life experiences. Because of the stronger filtering abilities of Facebook, I can indeed see how it could supplant many niche sites.

It would be a place for discussing the discussion, explaining site guidelines, etc.  I think of it as sort of analogous to Wikipedia's discussion tab.<p>My idea here is that such a meta-chat view might help get crufty comments off the main view, as well as encourage more communication about <i>why</i> a comment is inappropriate.

To address your specific request, I am not bothered by the issues you raise because there are strategies to ameliorate them.  Security issues and corrupting memory largely come from unbounded data. C has <i>fantastic</i> tooling to profile and analyze applications.  Unlike Go, there is always something you can do to achieve your desired behavior.  YES there are warts and problems a-plenty, but they are well-known and there is a vast collection of people and articles about dealing with them.<p>I never meant to imply that C was more safe than Go.  Erlang is, which I meant to imply with the comment about immutable message passing concurrency.  Immutable message passing concurrency is amazingly safe and free from classes of errors that Go programmers still have to deal with (race conditions!)  In Go, the canonical style is to pass pointers through channels (and pass ownership along with it.)  Two goroutines can still mutate the same object out from under each other, leading to all of the potential issues you run into with multithreading in C.<p>The Go garbage collector sucks, currently (check out the recent mailing list threads with trivial applications that trip it up.) They know this and it is on the roadmap for development, but it isn't there yet; stopping the world to do your work (and taking a LONG time to do so in perverse cases) is not something I want to deal with.  When using a ""systems"" language, I want to have repeatable and knowable performance.<p>Using the unsafe package defeats all of the benefits of using Go while maintaining all of its shortcomings.  Additionally, there is great difficulty with incorporating existing C libraries (yes, cgo is an option but it does not work with gccgo and it is poorly documented -- for instance, how do you make the Go garbage collector aware of C struct lifetimes?) Even if you stay within the language,  you have to choose lightweight go-routines or optimized code generation (gc vs gccgo.)<p>Another irritating thing is that Go maps cannot have binary data as keys, only certain types (numbers and strings, basically.)  Discovering this was not easy, and the suggested answer is to coerce an array of bytes to a string (making a copy) for storage and every time the key should be accessed.<p>> If you looked at Go, it must have been from a very, very far away.<p>Just because I have come to different conclusions than you have, please do not assume my view lacks research or analysis.",1307937654.0
