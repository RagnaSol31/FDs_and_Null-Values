So for example, SPY is the &quot;normal&quot; ETF which tracks the S&P 500 index.  UPRO is a triple-leveraged ETF which is designed to get 3x the daily returns (gains or losses) of the S&P 500, using the same amount of capital.  Some other ETFs are leveraged and inverse, meaning they will gain value when the index loses value, and vice-versa.  In general, day-trading these ETFs is a way for small traders to increase the leverage on their bet.  However, there is always some sort of &quot;friction&quot; with using leverage in this way, which causes the all leveraged ETFs to slowly lose value over time.  Intuitively, you could say that you taking out a tiny loan in order to increase your bet, and the friction is just interest payments.

Under that criteria, every television channel in the US, every magazine, every newspaper could be banned according to your reasoning, yet you can contort this in some theoretical way so that it has nothing to do with the content.",1452312060.0
