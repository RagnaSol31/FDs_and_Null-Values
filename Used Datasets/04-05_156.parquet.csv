Here's a more technical explanation, gleaned from <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2666"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2666</a>.<p>Each prisoner dilemma round has four possible outcomes: CC, CD, DC and DD (C=Cooperate,D=Defect). We study probabilistic strategies which depend only on the previous round, so for instance, P(player 1 plays C at round i+1|CD was played at round i)=0.3. From the paper:<p><i>Such games can be described by a Markov process defined by the four probabilities that characterize each of the two players strategies [9] (because this is an infinitely repeated game, the probability to engage in the first movewhich is unconditionaldoes not play a role here). Each Markov process has a stationary state given by the left\neigenvector of the Markov matrix, which in this case describes the equilibrium of the process. The expected payoff is given by the dot product of the stationary state and the payoff vector of the strategy. But while the stationary state is the same for either player, the payoff vectorgiven by the score received for each of the four possible plays CC, CD, DC, and DDis different for the two players for the asymmetric plays CD and DC. Because the expected payoff is a linear function of the\npayoffs, it is possible for one strategy to enforce the payoff of the opponent by a judiciously chosen set of probabilities that makes the linear combination of determinants vanish (hence the name ZD strategies). Note that this enforcement is asymmetric because of the asymmetry in the payoff vectors introduced earlier: while the ZD player can choose the opponents payoff to depend only on their own probabilities, the payoff to the ZD player depends on both the ZD players as well as the opponents probabilities. This is the mathematical surprise: the expected payoff is usually a very complicated function of six probabilities (and four payoff values, for the four possible plays). When playing against the ZD strategy, the payoff that the opponent reaps is defined by the payoffs and only two remaining probabilities that characterize the ZD strategies.</i>",1345178954

Bike from one Hubway station to another, then go home on the bus or train or in your friend's car without needing to figure out what to do with your bike. I do lots of  circular itineraries where I switch from bus to bike to strolling to train to bike and back to bus without ever retracing my steps.<p>100% secure bike parking at any Hubway-equipped destination. Because bikes stolen from Hubway stations are not my problem, they are Hubway's problem, so once I dock a bike at a station I just walk away with no worries.<p>(And right there we've probably got my $85/year of value. Imagine a service which provided lighted, security-monitored bike racks at forty or fifty stations around town, with insurance against theft and an iPhone app to tell me if a particular rack has space for my bike at this moment. I might well expect to pay $10 a month for that service. And Hubway provides that, plus they throw in bikes for free!)<p>Minor advantages include spontaneous bike trips (mitigated by my own insistence on wearing a helmet, which is annoying to carry around ""just in case"") and much faster arrival and departure because unlocking and locking these things is fast. I walk up and leave in thirty seconds, most of which is spent putting on the helmet, readjusting the seat height, and strapping my bag to the bike basket; arrival is faster, maybe fifteen seconds. Looking for a good locking spot, then fiddling with U-locks is not so much fun as that.<p>Meanwhile, sure, thieves could strip the bikes at a Hubway station. I'll bet they'd be doing it on camera the whole time, though, and Hubway stations tend to be near major intersections in populated neighborhoods. And Hubway bikes are pretty odd; I'm not sure there's a lot of easily-fenced standard parts on there.",1345177371

The marketing people rarely told engineers what the customer wanted, and the engineers didn't talk to customers, and didn't know the cost (or value) of their time.<p>If there are any well-tested rules for producing good software, they're 1) small teams, 2) technical people with authority and responsibility, 3) talk to the customer.",1345177253
