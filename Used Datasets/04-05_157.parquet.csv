1,2575024,comment,2573970.0,2573970.0,4,0,JacobIrwin,,,"Here's a bit of information I found regarding Founder's Stock (reported here in similar Scribd fashion):<p>To ensure that stock issued to founders is properly ""earned"" by each founding stockholder, startup companies typically put in place stock restriction agreements with each founder. The primary purpose of this agreement is to give the company a right to purchase shares held by a founder in the event that the founder leaves the company for any reason. This purchase option generally applies only to shares that are unvested at any given point in time, with shares becoming vested over a predetermined, usually time-based, schedule.<p>There are several variables that need to be determined when putting in place stock restriction agreements. They include the overall duration of vesting, whether there is any up front vesting, what period of time, if any, must elapse before there is any additional vesting, and under what circumstances there may be additional or accelerated vesting-for example in connection with a change of control of the company, or upon the termination of the founder. Venture capitalists have established certain acceptable ranges for these variables.<p>From the founders' perspective, one of the most important areas of concern is the basis upon which their shares accelerate in the event they are terminated. In the event the founder resigns voluntarily or is terminated for cause, no additional stock vests. However, if the founder is terminated without cause, or resigns for good reason (in other words, is ""forced out""), there arguably should be some compensation to the founder out of fairness, and to deter the board from terminating key people in order to recoup equity. Occasionally founders are able to negotiate for partial or even full acceleration. The definition of what constitutes ""cause"" for purposes of determining whether termination triggers acceleration is critical but subtle, and any common stockholder should be aware of the drafting options and seek advice of counsel to ensure his or her interests are protected.<p>Related to the question of whether acceleration occurs upon termination is the issue of what happens upon a change of control. Full acceleration is often a reasonable starting point for negotiation. After all, if the company is sold, the founders who are still with the company likely made significant contributions to put the company in a position to be acquired. Venture capitalists and other stockholders who do not stand to realize any acceleration, however, are likely to oppose acceleration upon change of control. This acceleration will simply result in dilution to them and reduce their share of the consideration received in the acquisition. If full acceleration cannot be negotiated, an alternative is to request additional and possibly full acceleration if the founder is let go or resigns for good reason within one year following a change of control-a mechanism that is sometimes called ""double trigger"" acceleration. However, this compromise position only works well in practice when the change of control calls for the founders to receive ""replacement"" equity with respect to their unvested stock. The ""double trigger"" concept does not translate as cleanly where the consideration received by the selling stockholders is cash, and specific provision should be made for this situation, again with advice of counsel. If full acceleration either at change of control or pursuant to a double trigger is not acceptable, then the company and the founder may agree to a mechanism that is simpler to apply, such as one year or 50% vesting upon a change of control.<p>Founder's stock issues, especially as they relate to vesting, can be quite complex and assistance of legal counsel can help improve a founder's situation significantly. Founders should consider retaining separate legal counsel to advise them on these issues.<p>SOURCE: <a href=""http://www.mbbp.com/resources/business/founder_rights.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mbbp.com/resources/business/founder_rights.html</a>",1306126735.0

A few months after I moved here the enormity of the situation hit me and I nearly cried. Sure, the average salary is much higher, but I've realised that a day off is worth much more to me than my daily wage.<p>People are no more productive here than there; work tends to take up the time you give it. Burnout rates seem to be much higher in North America, people are more tired and less traveled.<p>Because companies here have more control over when an employee can take a holiday, team members take holidays in groups ""when it's good for the team"", meaning that there are a couple of weeks when absolutely nothing can get done even for those who aren't on vacation.<p>Another closely-related issue is sick leave. In the UK the occasional sick day isn't usually subtracted from your holiday allowance. Here no-one wants to be off sick because they lose a valuable day off, so they come in to work and spread viruses around to everyone else.<p>Having said that, I don't think the 3-day week would help. I feel that to improve productivity, one needs a period of time to completely wind down and three days isn't enough for that. I think more week-long vacations would be a better solution.",1306125178.0

I had to do the file I/O, some decompression (only for PS2, lzo running on the IOP chip).<p>But what he talks is balooney. Now I wasn't directly involved with how the levels were made (they were in segments, I believe kind of like hexagonal, more likely brick style layout, with a big strip every one in a while). Every such brick or strip would get asynchronously loaded.<p>Okay, now how to get that fast on console? Well first, your data has to be precooked, at minimum only pointers should be fixed up. No ""new""/""delete""/""malloc""/free"" - you load it in a buffer, and it's almost initialized (without the pointer fixup).<p>Then problems - say for example Spidey goes towards one of the bricks - you should start loading the neighbouring bricks too, but as soon as you know more about where he's going you should start CANCELing these I/O requests. And better if your system really supports them (or if not so, read in less chunks, or find the buffer size that the I/O controller or OS is splitting the request into - for Xbox I think it was 128kb).<p>Then make sure that you get as much as possible I/O asynchronous requests per frame from the levels, sound, etc. and for a DVD (and maybe for HDD) do an elevator sort - e.g. start from somewhere and always take the next request that is closer to the previous ones (sometimes that's tricky, as by the time you want to start the next one closer, and the head is already on something further away).<p>Then the biggest pain is that on burn media you get one results, while on GOLD discs another. Mainly because of how CRC checksums are put - I believe it was for every 32 sectors (or 16), while on the burn was a bit different.<p>Then you might experience problems, where the japanese PS2 version of the console just reads badly, hopefully your devkit has the same problem, so you know you would run in to.<p>And not forget - check which mode would work better for you - constant angular velocity, or constant speed. In the first you get slower results in the middle (I think it was the beginning of the disk), rather than the end - somewhere (ballpark figure) 1-2mbs/s vs 3-4mb/s<p>And find decompression algorithm that decompresses faster than what you reading (I was able to get lzo with some small unaligned write assembly optimizations) and have uncompressed speed of 5-6mb/s instead of only highest 3-4mb/s.<p>So my problem with the article? He's not even talking about the simple things I explained. Believe it's that's only the scratch in making streaming game (Look what Naughty Dog did, when they could not load the level in time - the character would trip and hop - now that's very good solution, but really tied with your gameplay).<p>In our case, we had testers banging out what Spidey's maximum speed could be, so we can adjust the levels - some of the levels he had to do some quick missions, and pop-ups were never allowed (it was considered bug).",1306124033.0
