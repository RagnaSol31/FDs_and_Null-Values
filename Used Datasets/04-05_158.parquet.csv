Thanks for finding that. I thought about the whole 404 thing, funny thing is, I didn't really think of it as a bug at the time, since I had a specific set of use cases where <i>not</i> specifying a 404 would have been senseless. That's the likely cause for my myopia there.<p>However, the deal with paperboy is it's more of a starting point for writing your own file based HTTP server, not so much a drop it in and serve static files affair. It's got some other problems as well. I'd fix them, but I don't really use node.js anymore. If I were still using node here's what I'd look at with paperboy:<p>1. No tests (ugh)<p>2. I'm not sure what would happen if you tried serving a large file to a slow client (it reads in a stream based fashion, but since writing to the socket doesn't block, that memory has to go somewhere) Reads might need to be throttled.<p>3. It doesn't have sensible defaults, like the 404 thing.<p>All that stuff would be trivial to look at, hopefully someone will.

20,1734598,comment,1733941.0,1733941.0,0,0,photon_off,,,"xMarks has an amazing set of data.  A set of tagged bookmarks on a large enough scale is essentially like running mechanical turk (with 2,000,000 users) on the entire internet (better yet, only bookmark-worthy parts of the internet), and asking it to ""describe this page in 10 words or less"".  The results, I think, are the most accurate description of URLs you could get on such a large scale.  Essentially every site that has over a certain amount of bookmarks is <i>guaranteed</i> to be of high quality and very relevant to what it's been tagged as.  (The only problem is when sites change, domains expire, etc).<p>When I was making MoreOf.It, I scouted the competition in depth.  The only one that stood out was xMarks, and similarity search wasn't even their main gig.  They understand the richness of bookmarking data.  They've separated URLs into categories, and have the highest ranking sites in those categories.  They also nailed similarity pretty well.  I might even say their results are better than mine, because they have a much larger index of sites.<p>Two and a half years ago, when I first built a prototype of similarity search, there were hardly <i>any</i> meta-websites.  Besides Quantcast and their ilk, and bookmarking websites, and maybe a couple of bullshit ""site worth calculators"" (which just multiply site traffic by an estimated CPM), there was hardly anything happening in the meta-site space.  Now, there are tons more services that cater to people Gooling an actual url or site name.  To name a few, CrunchBase, AboutUs.org, BackType, UberVU, SimilarSites, SitesLike, and sites that aggregate results from these (QuarkBase).  ""Meta"" is blossoming, and it seems like xMarks could take advantage of this with their rich dataset.<p>For example, as someone told me I should do, they could sell analytics information to websites about their competitors.  If you're ZipCar.com, for example, you would pay to know the following:  How have people described zipcar.com in the last (x amount of time), and what are the trends of those tags?  How is my popularity vs. an automatically generated list of my competitors [ala: similar sites].  Which competitors are trending, and with which tags?  Any new competitors that are breaking through the ranks?  Some information could give cues to alter your business:  What types of tags are related to my business are trending right now (i.e.: perhaps ""bike share"" is becoming more and more popular.  I think that's valuable information.  And, like an arms dealer, you can deal to both sides of competition.  With 2,000,000 users organizing this set of data (for their own benefit of course), it's pretty confident sample size and it's win-win for everyone.<p>Frankly, I don't understand what benefits ""synchronizing"" offers. Why not just store your bookmarks on any number of bookmarking websites (Delicious, Google, etc), and then log-in to that website from whatever browser/computer/device you want?  I do, however, see value in the analytics of what people bookmark, and how they bookmark it.",1285649324.0

27,1734591,comment,1734221.0,1734369.0,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"We agree on the basic economics, ie repayment in full (which is also what Wolf advocates).<p><i>Further we have just witnessed a perfect implementation of this theory- after the dot com crash, government lowered interest rates below inflation, making free money and spent massively running up record deficits.</i><p>Ah...see I have a problem with this - with luck we can disagree without falling into partisan bickering. 'Government' is not this indifferent entity that does whatever it wants, it's people implementing policies, and I think you're glossing over the details.<p>So we had a small notional surplus at the end of the last decade, and in 2000 we got a change of administration. We agree (I hope) that the seeds of the dot-com bust were already rooted; I don't blame any political figures in particular for that. Greenspan warned about 'irrational exuberance' etc., and pretty much everyone I knew told him to shut and stop being a party pooper. Sometimes people just have to learn the hard way.<p>But the new administration came in and gave people a tax cut, on the principle that if the treasury was running a surplus then it should be giving the American people's money to them (the same tax cuts which are supposed to be expiring soon). Just so we're on the same page, when I refer to EGGTRA I'm talking about the 2001 tax cut and by JGGTRA I mean the 2003 (post dot-com bust) one:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Growth_and_Tax_Relief_Reconciliation_Act_of_2001"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Growth_and_Tax_Relief_...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobs_and_Growth_Tax_Relief_Reconciliation_Act_of_2003"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobs_and_Growth_Tax_Relief_Reco...</a><p>Now, I say you're 'glossing over' things with your analysis, because while there are policy justifications for both cutting taxes to stimulate growth and paying off debt (less lovely cash in your pocket, but less long-term interest accruing while you sleep), it seems rather disingenuous to complain about government failing to pay off the debt and ignore the fact that the administration of the day opted to cut taxes and make up any shortfall with borrowing.<p>Even the budget director at the time, Paul O'Neil, thought this was a dreadful idea, and by 2002 was expressing his alarm at the ballooning deficit, allegedly causing VP Cheney to respond with the argument that ""Reagan proved deficits don't matter."" O'Neil departed the White House by the end of that year. Now, several people have argued that the Clinton 'surplus' was no such thing, and amounted to little more than an accounting trick (for example <a href=""http://www.craigsteiner.us/articles/16"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.craigsteiner.us/articles/16</a>). There is some merit to this argument, but it is not disputed the the rate of increase in the national debt slowed down during that period, nor that it was ~$5.8t when the White House changed hands in early 2001.<p>After that, deficits ballooned and the debt swelled considerably. A lot of people (like me) expressed the belief that cutting taxes like this was a terrible idea - a justifiable war of the kind the US undertook after 9/11 is one of the few occasions where you can persuade people to tolerate higher taxes, because a situation of genuine military necessity exists. It would have been better (in my view) to either use available revenue to slow the rate of deficit growth, or at least to pay for the Afghan war. Come 2003, and the administration launched a second war and <i>another</i> tax cut. At the time, objections to this were generally dismissed as loony leftism or sour grapes or lack of patriotism. I don't want to rehash all of those political issues, but from an economic point of view war is expensive and I haven't seen evidence to suggest that the tax cuts significantly boosted revenue - in fact, I agree with you that low, low interest rates had more to do with the asset bubble which followed.<p>Now those tax cuts are set to expire, and because one party has suggested that perhaps it would be sensible to extend them for the great majority of people who earn under $250k/year (and that the increase on those making above would still leave them paying less than in Reagan era), the other party has taken its ball and gone home - rather than roll them back partially for now and fully later, they've instead committed to making them permanent, which means a ~$4t hole in projected revenues, right around the time we are entering a demographic retirement bulge, and a good deal of our infrastructure is in very poor shape.<p>It's all very well to wag the finger and say it's time to lay off the fiscal moonshine, but I find it really hard to take seriously lectures about debt which blithely a policy of repeatedly  substituting borrowing for revenue.",1285649182.0

I started 2 small ventures as a teenager (both were profitable), and after that I have been in the regular corporate job for about a decade. Most of the places I interviewed for a job, they often suggested that I consider doing my own business as that's what lights me up during the discussions. I too wanted to, but never really got to it until recently. Though I have been involved with a lot of startup and related activities over the years.<p>I often faced a problem while at work, and started looking for available tools to solve that problem - couldn't find anything that directly solved this problem, though there are some round-about solutions available and off late, a few startups are trying to solve similar/related problem.<p>I thought that there might be others like me facing the same problem, so I went out asking my business associates and friends if they too faced the same problem - many said yes. Then I started thinking about a solution for this problem. The next step for me was to validate the business idea and the problem further. I met with a couple of senior executives from the silicon valley startup community - most of them said that the problem is worth solving, and encouraged me to go build a prototype solution. Since I am non-technical and the tool would require hackers to build it, so I thought of getting further validation from potential users - again, I got encouraging feedback. By then, I knew I had to do something about it.<p>So, I asked few engineer friends to help build the prototype. Though we didn't really get any far - as they had other commitments and couldn't spend the time required. Then, I started looking outside for potential technical co-founder - a Stanford student agreed to help out. Plus, I also roped in another solid technical guy as my advisor. We have built a very basic version of our app, and we are planning to go for a private alpha next month - and work with real users in shaping our application/tool.<p>I was also thinking of applying for the YC fall batch. But then suddenly, my Stanford co-founder decided to scale back his involvement as he has too many things going on in his life, and he feels he wouldn't be able to commit time required by our startup. Since our app is almost ready (some bugs need to be fixed), I hired a freelancer to help me finish the remaining work, so we can go ahead with our private alpha next month. Meanwhile, I am also looking for another technical co-founder.<p>But for now, I am a single, non-technical, female founder of a software startup, debating whether it is worth it to apply for YC right now and what are my chances. Having some traction for my app will make my case a bit stronger, but it will take some time to build that traction and YC application deadline is October 19th.<p>I thought of turning to the HN community for advice. What would you recommend?<p>Thanks.",1285648230.0
