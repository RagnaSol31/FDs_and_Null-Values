Ownership of a physical address could be verified once and thereafter excluded until a new landlord who buys the property opts-into the service.<p>IANAL, but I would think that if Airbnb ignored a request to exclude addresses, that would likely expose them to a greater chance of losing a lawsuit.<p>Additionally, cities or states could pass laws requiring services like Airbnb to have easy opt-out policies for landlords rather than banning the service altogether.",1403323658.0

When Nest does this over multiple homes in a neighborhood or county it can, Fadell claimed, lower energy costs for utilities by 50%, by re-routing peak energy being used in empty homes.<p>โWe know how many people are home during those times,โ he said โWe know which homes have cooling, we can go through the data and we can say we believe weโre a five megawatt power generator or 10 megawatts in this county. Thatโs what we can deliver โ 50-60% of the energy that was consumed in that window has been shifted away.โ<p>The services makes Nest a middle man for utility companies, meaning that Google itself will now play a role in managing energy efficiency programs across wide swathes of home and even counties โ something that Google has been keen to do for some time.&quot;<p>This is pretty much why I wouldn&",
