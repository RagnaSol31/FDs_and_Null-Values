Processed food and suburbia are falling out of favor not because the Boomers fought against them in the '60s, but because all generations are recognizing them as harmful and moving away from them.<p>What happened with the Boomers and drugs in the '60s is a blip on the radar. That generation is now the greatest obstacle in repealing the War on Drugs, which draws its support from moralistic, reactionary Boomers. Xers, as a general rule, are too pragmatic to dump hundreds of billions of dollars into ineffectual and damaging moral pissing contents.<p>In fact, the naively utopian druggies of the 1960s fucked up a lot of opportunities for discovery. Humanity's knowledge of powerful and potentially very helpful (but also dangerous when misused) chemicals like LSD and psilocybin is decades behind where it should be, since the illegality of these substances also entailed a research ban. LSD/psilocybin research was considered completely respectable in the 1950s and '60s-- LSD's inventor was a respected chemist who used it experimentally but rarely, and lived to be 102. This was before a small set of clowns, driven by half-baked knowledge and clouded judgment, started publically recommending these drugs to <i>everyone</i>. That sort of idiocy, of course, hasn't gone away; these days, we have moronic 17-year-olds posting salvia videos on Youtube... although that is definitely <i>not</i> a drug to take likely.",1224910780

11,343352,comment,342358.0,342615.0,0,0,time_management,,,"<i>In finance, the primary capital base of a firm is its reputation and network of dealmakers. When you're just starting out, you have nothing here, which is why newbie I-bankers work 16 hour days and only get paid in the high 5-figures. But once you've been at it for a couple years, you've built up a network, and those clients are yours, which is why experienced I-bankers rake in the dough and have nice working conditions.</i><p>I'm sorry, but I've worked on Wall Street, and you couldn't be more wrong.<p>I-banking analyst positions are for mediocrities full of empty ambition. Workhorses who'll suck up the shittiest tasks and say, ""Give me more."" Anyone smart who is interested in finance tries to find a hedge fund that'll take him as a quant or trader... or to get an MBA first, Analysts do not usually have these sorts of options; they endure the miserable lifestyle because they, by and large, are not especially talented or qualified people, and they simply wouldn't otherwise be eligible for the exit opportunities (top MBA, private equity) made available by this path.<p>Third- and fourth-year bankers do not have their a personal client base... not even close. Additionally, it's logistically difficult to ""steal"" clients; investment banking is an oligarchy and I think it's extremely difficult to start an independent investment bank. It would also be extremely unlikely that a client would switch loyalties based on the movement of a peon VP. Finally, investment bankers don't have decent working conditions until they attain Managing Director level, and that takes about 10-15 years. Your odds of success as a serial entrepreneur over 15 years would be much higher than the odds of making MD before washing out.<p>The primary capital base of a banking firm is partly its reputation, but largely the money itself, since even the vanilla operations of banking are costly and risky.",1224909803

They're willing to do grunt work, but only if they learn from it (and hopefully, can automate it so that they don't have to do it in the future).

They're annoying. On the other hand, their most damaging trait is their laziness rather than arrogance, and our generation doesn't seem to have fewer or more lazy people than any other.

You can work yourself to the bone and still receive a pittance if the company is doing poorly for reasons beyond your control as an employee.<p>Where 'profit sharing' works, it tends to be called something else: a commission, for example.
