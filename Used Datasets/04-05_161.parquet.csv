Therefore there exist real numbers that are not in any particular enumerable set.  Now consider the set of all potential finite definitions of a number using a finite set of symbols.  This set turns out to be perfectly enumerable.  Not all definitions in it will turn out to be well-formed, numbers have multiple definitions (for instance 5/10 is the same as 1/2) and many that are defined are not in the interval (0, 1).  But this is no barrier.  According to the classical view of mathematics, the set of definable numbers in (0, 1) is an enumerable set.  Therefore almost all real numbers in that interval do not have any possible definition.<p>In what sense, I ask you, does a number with no possible definition actually exist?<p>Is there another way to look at this problem?  It turns out that there is.  If you take the constructivist view of things, things only exist if you can lay your hand on a concrete construction.  ""Constructions"" that classical mathematics does not blink an eye at may not qualify.  In particular this ""enumeration"" over possible definitions, and being able to sort through to figure out which definitions are valid, and which are equivalent, and which fall in the interval, is an example of something that is beyond the pale.  Why?  Well many of the possible definitions are computer programs.  Figuring out which of them actually define numbers means doing things like solving the Halting problem.  Which we can't actually do.<p>From the point of view of constructivism, ""uncountable"" does not mean ""really big infinite set"".  It means ""really convoluted set structure"".<p>Yes, I know that constructivism lost.  Nobody wants to consider these odd questions.
