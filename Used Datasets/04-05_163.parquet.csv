I bought one of those spinning gyro thingies for my wrist.  I got them spinning pretty good but then I got elbow pain.  Got more exercise and re-started supplements like chondroitin and glucosamine (these do wonders after a couple months) and now no pain.  Should be able to do wrist exercises again soon.,1313557033.0

Productivity is going to decrease as communication issues arise. People at motorola will probably get annoyed at being dictated to, always being wrong for misunderstanding directives, and want to move on (like I said above will take Google for all they can while they do it). Theres a serious chance they will view Google as an ivory tower issuing commands whilst being out of touch of reality. Loyalty will plummet.<p>Google is in for pain. Serious HR pain.
