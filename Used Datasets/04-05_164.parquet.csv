So, if the ball usually spins from right to left, a googly would spin from left to right and trick a batsman and get him out. Hence the phrase ""Google bowls a googly"".

I know people like them because they have a really pleasing and intuitive backstory, but as a grad student in AI I can tell you that they suck at actually solving anything. Mostly this is due to the fact that GAs take what is already a difficult, non-linear problem (the problem you're trying to solve) and immediately, explosively, complicate it (what's your mutation rate? what are the chromosomes? how are crossovers handled? how are you deciding the answers to these questions?)",1295672361

The convergence of some of Python's web frameworks is great and the fact that WSGI has become such a central specification is great.<p>In relation to Werkzeug and Python 3 you'd have to ask Armin himself but I think he said merely that a direct port of Werkzeug isn't likely possible as opposed to Werkzeug will never be ported to Python 3. Werkzeug is lower level and likely can't be ported directly due to a number of the differences between Python 2 and 3.<p>As he points out higher level libraries like Flask stand a far greater chance of surviving direct ports from Python 2 to 3.,1295671639

32,2129937,comment,2128953.0,2129477.0,0,0,carlgrimm,,,"The social internet garners its masses by feeding, often simultaneously, into the most basic human needs. Our needs for social information exchange are fulfilled, we can find and cultivate our own community. Humans are hardwired to be connected. Socially we evolved to be as such because at its base it is life sustaining. We survive because somebody bit the dust eating a mushroom and somebody else learned from it and then taught us.<p>The other side of the success of Facebook is that it serves to entertain us. Americans watch on average 34 hours of TV a week. Most of it is nearly worthless and not a value add other than to be amused.<p>But, people in the course of fulfilling these tasks on FB are leaving behind information trails. We know know what they are talking about, who they are talking to, who they just friended. Now we can compile this information and do something with it - back to the purpose.<p>Let's take a look at a site like hunch.com - a very good use of collecting data about an individual by answering questions (a form of amusement to many) written by other members. They then leverage it to solve some problems that Amazon's rating system fails at - letting me know what user reviews are more like me. Am I more similar to people who give it 1 star reviews or 5 star reviews. I really enjoy the site and I willingly give it information about me so it can help me more.<p>This data is usually used as you stated to find similarities . In people, for matchmaking sites, here are things purchased by people who...read the same stuff, watch the same movies, etc. It can turn out well, but for what was known by the Netflix challenge teams as the Napoleon Dynamite problem. A movie that based on similarity clusters  was almost impossible to predict how a user would rate it.<p>Now as you ask what are the candidate purposes for which people want the results of software that leverages social graphs.<p>Companies are much easier than people because unlike our list of uses and goals earlier, companies just want to make money. Facebook for example.. How do they make money? By selling advertising (other sources comprise only about 10%). How do they make more money? By entertaining more people, for a longer time, and charging more for their ads. If you can serve a targeted ad you can charge more, etc. If you know what feed information to show a user, they will stay on longer, you then serve them more ads. And as such, their purpose for using the social data and derivatives thereof will be for those purposes. Similar to amazon, the purpose of the data are to sell you more goods by recommending things you might buy based on predictions made.<p>So why does Facebook lack dating as part of their core offering? Because while they could be good at it they up to now have just been a platform company. This has changed a bit with the launch of FB messaging and @facebook email. But look deep into the reason why? Gmail makes Google money because they serve you contextual ads based on your content. Why does Facebook hope you use their mail? Ah yes, you get it now...so you spend more time on their site and they have more data about you so they can serve you more ads. With one small feature change you might say the showed a glimpse of who they are becoming.<p>Before they were a true social media company – a platform where users generated content to share.  Now they want you to spend more time on the site, use it as a common login for other sites, send and receive email through it? Why..again the money. So they can do what they do best. Serve you better ads and have a longer time to do it. Every move you see FB make you will see it is now to broaden the platform and increase your dependence on it so you spend more time on it.<p>Facebook is becoming the new money printing machine by taking exactly the same path Google originally did – by getting people to the information they want faster. How did Google do it? Google page rank – they figured out that rather than word density – the social element of a link to the content was more important. Google is scared now because the content that is being generated inside of Facebook’s closed walls is massive and it is a powerful predictor of what is relevant.<p>In both Facebook and Google’s case they make money by helping us perform the transactions we desire by using social data.\nSocial search on the other hand, at least how I see it going, is leveraging all this data to wade through the murky garbage everybody is producing with social media and actually help me find what is relevant.\nRelevancy is key because what is relevant to me I look at, I take action with, I buy. This makes other people money usually (if it does not then they usually fail to build or go under).<p>Again the purpose is user specific and the social data helps you determine relevancy. A matchmaking site would use it to find you a date you liked faster, a consumer retail site would use it to help you find the garlic press you are going to like faster.<p>Finally - back to the graph. What are your thoughts on using them? Personally I would find them useful for discovering trends in myself, my research etc. They help us explore, sort through data. But they are the end product and for most companies just a form of entertaining you with all the data they have about you.",1295671448
33,2129936,comment,2128085.0,2129551.0,0,0,Timothee,,,"I smell sarcasm in your comment. But the point is that yes, I expect Google/Gmail to understand that when I'm marking an email as ""Spam"" or ""Not Spam"" by clicking the buttons <i>they</i> put there, similar emails should be flagged (or not) accordingly next time one comes in. If clicking these buttons doesn't do anything, they should just get rid of them.<p>Sure, I could use epochwolf's suggestion with filters, but filters are for granular sorting and personal preferences: adding labels, skipping inbox, forwarding, etc. that would be pretty much impossible to guess for a ""machine"". As far as I'm concerned, clicking ""Not Spam"" should be very similar to creating a filter that says ""every email that look like this (same address, same kind of content, etc.), do NOT mark it as spam"". If this is not what's happening, these buttons are just useless.",1295671440

It's a divided country so it doesn't seem crazy that MSNBC's most popular show should be able to match Fox's least.

I founded Forrst last January, and it's now me plus two full time guys, with a third on the way. We're raising some money and doing pretty well in terms of growth. Starting to look at the business side a bit, but only casually; the community is still pretty new and wouldn't benefit from us trying to turn the revenue knob up to 11 quite yet. I also built Streak.ly and Facto.me as experiments, in September 2010 and January 2011 respectively. The former has something like 4k users, with about 500 using it regularly, and the latter somehow managed to grow to 5,600 users, 30k facts, and 500k pageviews in 19 days. Both were intended to be fun distractions from Forrst, and both ended up getting a tiny bit of traction (Facto even ended up in some CNN article). Finally, I have youshouldworkwith.me going on the side, which has been pretty fun thus far, and a nice bit of extra income; it's pretty low impact (I'll do a few hours a week). Anyhow, fundraising is intense, and I'm generally feeling pretty overwhelmed with the side projects, specifically support and wasted potential. I didn't really plan for either Streak.ly or Facto to actually go anywhere, but now I'm sitting on a ton of support requests and feel guilty as hell for not putting any time into either, as I think both could be successful in one way or another. I thought about trying to sell both side projects, and would be open to offers there, but moreover am just looking for some insight (or a good kick in the ass) about what could be done about it all, aside from the perhaps obvious ""don't start any more side projects"" bit.

90,2129873,comment,2099816.0,2100209.0,0,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"There's a much more mature way to approach your problem:<p>What you have is a problem in statistical <i>hypothesis testing</i>.<p>So, you want to start by stating and assuming a <i>null</i> hypothesis.  This hypothesis is for a particular account and assumes that the account is <i>normal</i>, that is, that there is nothing wrong with it, that is, that any problems are <i>null</i>.<p>With this assumption, you will get a lot of additional information that will let you calculate some probabilities and <i>test</i> the hypothesis.<p>In this process, there are two ways to be wrong:<p>(1) False Alarm.<p>You conclude that there is something wrong with the account when it is normal.  A false alarm is also called <i>Type I</i> error.  Call the conditional probability of a false alarm given that the account is normal the <i>false alarm rate</i>.  Commonly the numerical value is denoted by alpha.<p>(2) Missed Detection.<p>You conclude that the account is normal when there is a problem with it.  A missed detection is also called <i>Type II</i> error.  Call the conditional probability of a missed detection given that there is a problem with the account the <i>missed detection rate</i>.  The numerical value is commonly denoted by beta.<p>Typically you can design a hypothesis test so that alpha is adjustable and known in advance.<p>Here's how the test calculation goes:  Given the data on one user and assuming the null hypothesis, calculate the probability of getting data such as observed or <i>worse</i>.  If this probability is really small, then we argue either (1) the account is normal but we observed something very rare or (2) the account has something wrong with it.  If the calculated probability is very small, then we reject (2), conclude (1), and raise an alarm.<p>In more detail, before we do the test, we select a geometric region, the <i>critical</i> region, for the data we will observe.  We know that for a normal account, the probability of observing data in the critical region is just alpha.  So, we take the data on the user and see if it falls in the critical region.  If so, then we raise an alarm.  Else we don't.  This way we do get false alarm rate alpha.  What beta we have for this test, however, is not yet determined; tests vary.<p>For each false alarm rate alpha, you want the <i>best</i> or <i>most powerful</i> test you can get, that is, the smallest rate of missed detections beta.  How to construct such a test is given in general but somewhat abstract terms by the famous Neyman-Pearson lemma.  There are elementary proofs in most intermediate texts on mathematical statistics.  The best proof I know I wrote out in terms of the Hahn decomposition in measure theory (it is an easy result of the Radon-Nikodym theorem with a famous proof by von Neumann).<p>In practice, given essentially any calculation at all of the available data, you can estimate the false alarm rate alpha easily enough:  Just take some old data on accounts that time, etc., have shown are good, feed that data into your calculation, and see what fraction of the calculations yield alarms.<p>It is possible to test the detection rate similarly, but the number of bad accounts is typically much smaller meaning that getting a good estimate of the detection rate beta is harder.<p>In the classic hypothesis tests, one important approach is to assume that we know the probability distribution of our data for accounts that are normal.  Then we get to assume this distribution in our null hypothesis.<p>When we do not assume such a distribution, then our test is <i>distribution-free</i> and, thus, more general.<p>Another issue is the number of variables in our test:  The classic tests commonly used just one variable so that the critical region was, typically, just one or two intervals on the line.  But clearly using several variables and, for the critical region, something complicated, even a fractal, in several dimensions can give a more powerful test.<p>Tests that are both distribution-free and that use several variables are rare.<p>I developed a large family of such tests.<p>Your problem is a special case of monitoring in near real time for problems, many or most of which have never been seen before.  So, such monitoring can be important for server farms, networks, the financial system, and parts of national security.  Once I gave a talk on my techniques at the Institute for Defense Analysis, and several persons in the audience thought of applications to problems such as yours.<p>There is an intuitive approach:  Suppose from the data on a user we get two variables.  Suppose the probability density of these two variables for normal accounts looks something like the Shenandoah Mountains.  Take the lowest point in the mountains and, then, the volume of the mountains above this level, and call that volume 1. Now pour water into the mountains and have it reach a level.  Let this water cover the fraction alpha of the mountains.  Let the wet area be our critical region.  So, we get the largest critical region we can for the volume alpha we have covered.  There is a crude optimality property here; this property can be useful for detecting <i>zero day</i> problem where we have no information on non-normal accounts.  As we know from Mandelbrot, lake boundaries are typically fractals.  So, our critical region can be a fractal.  Does this mean that the mountains are rough?  Actually no:  It is possible for the mountains to be infinitely differentiable and the lake boundary still a fractal, e.g., the Mandelbrot set.  That is, for any closed subset C of R^n, there exists a real value function f:  R^n --> [0, infinity) so that f(x) = 0 for x in C and f(x) > 0 otherwise.<p>But in your case, you have a lot of data on both normal accounts and bad ones.  So, you want a means of separating such data.  Again, the Neyman-Person lemma is first-cut guidance.<p>In all of this, standard deviation will likely play little or no role unless somewhere you can justify a Gaussian assumption.  However, if you can justify a Gaussian assumption, be aware that sample mean and sample standard deviation are <i>sufficient</i> statistics (more from the Radon-Nikodym theorem) for the Gaussian distribution so that, put simply, your test need use only sample mean and standard deviation.",1295668999
