I also liked the low amounts of ammo. Reloading meant throwing away whatever was left in your current clip, so you were always balancing risks.<p>These things came together to create some wonderful cinematic moments. I remember one, during a clan match: I was the last member of my team alive, almost completely out of ammo, with three remaining on the enemy team. They rushed into a room to get me. I managed to take down one with the last bullet in my gun, then kicked another out of the room, causing him to drop his hand cannon. I whirled and threw my knife into the face of the third, then grabbed the dropped shotgun and took out the second as he ran back in. I think I had to take a break to recover after that, haha.<p>I also remember AQ2 <i>not</i> showing which players were alive on either team. I distinctly remember games where I'd use the radio command to report in, only to be met with complete silence... and suddenly realize I was all alone.<p>Even as a long time CS player, I still prefer AQ2. I'd love to find a modern game like it.",1321505861.0

13,3246449,comment,3246092.0,3246092.0,22,0,Shenglong,,,"I recently (well, a few years ago) went through sex education in schools. They don't really teach you sex, as much as why you shouldn't have sex. Even when they're teaching contraception, the consistent emphasis on only x% effective really cuts out student interest. It's almost like saying, ""yeah we have a method or preventing HIV transmission, but it doesn't really work."" While it might seem like a good idea at first, I found it to quickly invoke the <i>I'm not listening anymore</i> response.<p>Next, is the issue of effectiveness. Personally, I've been shown way so many gross images of venereal diseases, that I I won't even touch without knowing I have protection. Unfortunately, this doesn't follow through for a lot of other kids who went through the same education as I did. ""I was drunk"", ""we didn't have any"", ""it doesn't feel as good"", and ""it's too much work"" are all (yes I know it's sad) frequently cited responses among people I know.<p>Thirdly, and most troublesome of all, some people don't care that they're <i>spreading</i> diseases. I recently found out someone I knew was receiving treatment for Hep B. I asked her when she found out, believing this to be a recent development. ""I've had it all my life,"" she responds. I walked out of the room. She's quite active, and her disdain for condoms is legendary. How anyone can exhibit that kind of carelessness is honestly, beyond me.<p>Rather than force education, I feel we might have to take a completely different approach. Teaching is great, but it doesn't work when kids don't want to listen or don't care. Perhaps we need to stress the <i>why</i> here, rather than the <i>how</i>.<p>Lastly - I know this is really aside the point of this article, but schools should probably also teach <i>how</i> to have sex properly. Not using condoms, but common erogenous zones, sensing feedback, appropriate pressure, etc. It's kind of sad that we learn all these things by exploration, again and again, generation after generation. I think it's about time we standardized it. Everyone needs to (well, almost everyone) have sex one day, anyway. Might as well at least have fun.",1321505702.0

Good salaries, interesting / challenging work, usually mature career development programs, ....<p>2) I had similar experiences. While our situations differs in some key aspects (I'm much older, have university degrees, long work history), my work history has also not been the text-book IT career path for most of the time. I also found banks much more interested in me than IT firms.<p>3) My speculation on why that is: Banks are better (in light of recent bank problems, maybe ""more willing"") at risk taking. Your circumstances make you less predictable than a candidate that has a ""standard"" career path. Big corporate IT is a lot about minimising risk. IT chooses the candidate that poses the least risk of a bad hiring decision. Banks may be willing to accept higher risk for higher potential return. My speculation is based on conversations I had about this topic with a small sample hiring managers at banks and IT HR managers I worked with.",1321505579.0

This manifests itself in numerous ways; one of which is our inability to properly extrapolate information from an interview: if a good programmer needs to search online for information to solve a problem about once each 8-hour day, then during the interview, the good programmer may ask for help once. But if they do that, then the interviewer sees that they need to ask for help once every hour. Alternatively, if they don't ask for help, the interviewer might be led to believe that they don't use tools afforded to them. Because one cannot ask for help 1/8th of a time, the interviewer has a negative impression of the candidate regardless of the choice the interviewee makes. This sort of lose-lose for the interviewer due to extrapolation can happen for many different facets: anything that is necessary, but only in moderation.<p>Interviews are a very flawed system for identifying skill.",1321503744.0
