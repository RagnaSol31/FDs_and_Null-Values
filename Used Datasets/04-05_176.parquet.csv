11,5693211,comment,5691216.0,5691216.0,1,0,manasgarg,,,"The only problem with unfinished projects is that they leave you incomplete. When a project is complete, you get a sense of completion in your mind. Otherwise, it becomes a dangling thread of thoughts in the mind. It keeps taking space and mental cycles (even if it is in the subconcious). And that leaves little room for exploring new ideas and executing them. The mental space starts looking cluttered.<p>At the same time, there is this problem of when to call a project finished (or completed). As such, everything in this world is ever changing and ever evolving. And that means calling a project complete becomes more of a mental thing than a well defined state of the project itself. For example, if I start working on a movie now, I may feel complete by making the movie, or by making sure that it is seen by as many people as possible, or by creating a sequel that's even better than the first movie etc etc. In fact, in this example, the project goes through multiple well defined stages but there are projects where there are no well defined stages. Things like blog, business don't have well defined stages. There is nothing discreet in their progress. There are jumps but it is still a continum which goes on and on and on.<p>When I look back, I feel biking is one project I finished. I wanted to own a bike and travel around since college days. I bought one when I got into a job. I travelled to many places. And then during one trip, I felt complete from inside. I felt that I had done as much biking as I wanted to do. I could have done more; in fact, I did travel to more places after that. But there was no urge to hit the highway on bike anymore. Same thing happened with photography. I wanted to do photography. I bought a camera, shot many pictures and then eventually, I stopped clicking photographs because I started enjoying the moments better without a camera.<p>So, while it is important to complete projects, completion itself is a state of mind. Which makes it difficult to complete a project with the ""intention to complete it"". Because completion is not ""about the project"", it's about how ""you relate to the project"".",1368334445.0

21,5693201,comment,5692605.0,5693066.0,7,0,gizmo686,,,">Dynamically typed languages are intrinsically easier<p>I don't think this is necessarily true. Dynamic typing moves an entire class of bugs from compile time to run time. And, I am not aware of what benefits it brings (other than minor expressiveness) that can not be had in a static type system. For the most part, you will right code assuming a variable has a given type. If that is not the case, you will get a runtime error instead of a compile time error. In the cases where the variable can be multiple types, doing so in a static type system can be as simple as declaring the type to be polymorphic (or as horrible as java generics, or as hacky as void*). The other advantage of dynamic type systems is that they often come with autocasting.<p>While both of these do provide some expressiveness, working around them in statically typed isn't really complicated, just a minor amount of boiler plate.<p>The main awesomeness of Python's type system (and maybe Ruby's, I've never used it) isn't dynamic typing, but duck typing. The idea hear is that you almost never care what type an object is, only if it supports a given method. For example, if I define a new object, and define a method 'read()', I can pass it into a function that was expecting a file, so long as it only calls the 'read()' method.<p>Of course, avoinding garbage collection is still a big advantage.",1368334194.0

67,5693154,comment,5690812.0,5691947.0,1,0,dchichkov,,,"What I was saying, is that if you are to complain about lack of pattern matching syntax in Python, you want to consider that such syntax require concise and unambiguous handling of a number of cases:<p>matching a value of variable:<p><pre><code>    |z when z = y -> print y\n</code></pre>\nfree matching with a bind:<p><pre><code>    |y -> print y\n</code></pre>\nmatching several values:<p><pre><code>    |2|3 -> print ""2 or 3""\n</code></pre>\nmatching tuples:<p><pre><code>    |2,3 -> print ""tuple 2,3""\n\n</code></pre>\nNow, if I'm trying to come up with such syntax for Python, I see immediate problems. For example, lets consider following syntax for matching several values:<p><pre><code>    match x with:\n        1: print ""my string""\n        2,3: print ""2,3""\n </code></pre>\nWould it be equivalent to matching a tuple (2,3) or matching one of the values 2 or 3? Ambiguous. So you need some other syntax. Let's try a few variations:<p><pre><code>    match x with:\n        1: print ""my string""\n        2:3: print ""2 or 3""         ",

Back in the day, all the stores were owned by a local person. You go to this store, that's Bob's store, he knows all about the fruit he gets, it's always the best, he goes over to the farmer's field and makes sure he gets the cream of the crop.<p>From here we have a huge population of stores (like neurons competing / cooperating to be heard). All over America, people are employed by running their own stores. Until one day, when a super store comes on the scene. It sells things cheaper than the other stores, and it has a bigger selection. Bob doesn't work there, but they have pretty much the same produce. Maybe the high school kid working there doesn't know the farmer where the fruit came from, but that's not so bad, I didn't know that farmer when I bought the fruit at Bob's. Slowly, slowly, ever so slowly, our world is shifted. Instead of going to the store, knowing the owner, striking up a conversation, getting the latest scoop on the happenings of the neighborhood, we go to the store to accomplish a task. This is efficiency, right?<p>There's another shift too, and it's a personal shift (that might not happen to anyone).<p>I go to Bob's store, and I see he mismarked his apples, they should be a $1 a piece, but they're $0.10 a piece. I don't want to rip Bob off, I know him, he's a great guy. I say ""Hey Bob, is this right?"" He says ""Oh no, that's a mistake, sorry about that."" That's alright, you have to make a living and I don't want to make you lose money by purchasing something from you.<p>I go to a big box - they mispriced something. Maybe I can slip this by them, and the cashier won't know the real price... I mean, there's no real people to hurt, right? I'm not ripping anyone in particular off, just the company, which is a bunch of people, and no single one of them is going to be worse off because I purchase a mispriced item.<p>Any way that you can represent that this purchase is not part of the 'race to the bottom of the barrel', that's great. All the efficiency in the world will not make a place that's happy for people. Efficiency is inhumanity.",1368332670.0
