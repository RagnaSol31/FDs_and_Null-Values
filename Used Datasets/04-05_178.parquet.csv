You think any sensible VC would have invested in Microsoft if there was nothing preventing Tandy, etc, from buying a single IBM machine, copying the OS off the disks, and selling as many machines with Windows loaded as they wanted without paying any licensing fees to Microsoft?<p>As for YC, etc... What a ridiculous bit of self-important exaggeration. Scribd, AirBnB, Discus... Oh my god all the innovation! More innovation than has ever been made possible by the patent laws or the copyright laws over the course of history! Seriously, I think YC, etc, is great, but let's not forget that there is a whole world of technology out there, and internet startups are one small niche. In most technology fields, all the money YC has ever handed out would barely make a dent in the capital requirements of bringing a product even to the prototype stage.<p>Also, let's not rewrite history here.

I'm in one of the largest alliances in the game and general consensus is that it can be ""a terrible game"", but there is so many things that are wrong or is just misunderstood in that post that it would take me all day to go through them individually.<p>Setting aside all the inaccuracies and misunderstandings of basic game mechanics in it (which is in part due to the steep learning curve of the game I admit, so it's somewhat understandable) EVE Online at it's core is ultimately a geek social hierarchy with a thin veil of ""science fiction video game"" masked over it.<p>Nowhere in the post did it mention ever interacting with other players, let alone leaving the safety of high security space to join one of the established social powerhouses in player controlled space. This is where the real ""game"" takes place and which is why the retention rate of new players is so extremely low, they don't get to see it.<p>If you are wondering why people keep playing this game, it isn't because they are stuck in some kind of ""WoW-like"" grind trance and just want to see a progress bar inch forward. It's ultimately the chance to ruin another social groups day and proclaim that your social group or culture ""is better then theirs"". You can visibly view a generated map of player controlled space[1] and say ""we own this, we took it from you"". The large super capital ships used in these battles are also worth upwards of $1,000 USD. A battle not long ago[2] resulted in the destruction of somewhere around 13 to 15 thousand dollars worth of capital ships.<p>Ultimately, EVE Online is a social experiment first, a war simulator for privileged first world geeks second, and a science fiction video game somewhere down at the bottom of the list.<p>[1] <a href=""http://go-dl1.eve-files.com/media/corp/Verite/influence.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://go-dl1.eve-files.com/media/corp/Verite/influence.png</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://themittani.com/news/supers-tackled-station"" rel=""nofollow"">http://themittani.com/news/supers-tackled-station</a>",1349671846

None of them would have come up with ""Hey! Why don't we grant inventors monopolies over inventions! We could increase the ammount and quality of inventions by limiting what others can invent!"". No one would ever think that's a good idea. It's completely backwards and counter intuitive. They would come up with things like y-combinator, angel funds, startup incubators. Or straight up government money investments. These are the obvious ideas that come up when you're trying to figure how to incentive ideas. You incentive ideas by investing in them, not by limiting them.<p>And of course, as most people here probably already know, that's not how IP was invented. It was not a conclusion from trying to come up to a solution for investing in ideas. No sane human being would have thought that was a solution. IP was invented as a monarchy monopoly to give power to the king. The ""but it's good for innovation"" meme was an excuse invented later when they figured they could actually make a lot of money from it, so those who were profiting off monopolies had to find an excuse to keep it.<p>It's so mind boggling to watch so many discussions where people ask ""the ultimate hard question"" of ""but how else could be possibly incentive ideas without copyright???"". C'mon, it's so straight-forward and we've been doing it for centuries. YC alone has done much more for promoting innovative creative works than copyright has done since it's invention. Do you really care about investing in ideas? Then put your money where your mouth is, become an angel investor, and stop pretending it's a hard problem to solve.",1349671702

52,4625503,comment,4625240.0,4625434.0,9,0,antics,,,"Facebook is, by a <i>huge</i> margin, the buggiest release software that I use every day. When I look hard, I notice at least a dozen UI bugs a week. Yet, Facebook is hugely successful -- so successful, in fact, that it's hard for me to think of ways in which it could be more successful. Your comment implies that there is some threshold that they will pass, at which point they will be forced to adopt more stable sensibilities. There are 1 billion active users [1], so I ask: if they haven't gotten to this point, when exactly will they?<p>I don't believe the lack of quality in Facebook code poses an existential threat to Facebook, and I don't believe it ever will:<p>(1) Facebook code is not Google code, but it is not <i>bad</i> code, it's just not needlessly good code. If Google is consistently buggy, anyone can switch to Bing. On the other hand, switching from Facebook is really hard. Their core services are not easily replaceable. People are willing to put up with more. Note that this is even true in the case of businesses: Facebook is <i>horrible</i> to develop against, but developers don't have a choice.<p>As the network grows, this cost will be higher, which means Facebook can throw its weight around more, not less. This is exactly opposite of the situation you predict. The only thing that can really reverse this is if there is a viable competitor, but the increased growth of Facebook makes this increasingly unlikely. It is clear, in any event, that G+ is not quite there.<p>(2) By maintaining a lower bar, Facebook actually has an advantage. It is a website, and can fix its product at will. Code can be deployed quickly and rolled back accordingly, making failure cheap. This means they can concentrate on things that really matter like user acquisition.<p>(3) Facebook does <i>not</i> run nuclear reactors or bank systems. There is a high incentive to switch from buggy bank systems. There is little incentive to switch from buggy social network websites.<p>footnotes:<p>[1] whatever that means",1349670381

57,4625498,comment,4624761.0,4625257.0,5,0,InclinedPlane,,,"That's a very worthwhile point but there are a few major reasons why it's a more problematic strategy.<p>First, reliability. When you engineer a vehicle as large and as complex as an orbital launcher which only operates once in its entire lifetime you typically need to <i>over</i>-engineer a lot of key parts of the thing in order to ensure a high level of overall reliability. This runs counter to the sorts of optimizations necessary to bring production costs down by orders of magnitude. More so, when a full up test inevitably results in the destruction of the vehicle (because it is expendable) and tests cost as much as a launch (tens of millions of dollars) it makes it very, very difficult to evolve the design of the vehicle extensively.<p>That leads to a catch-22, you have to run a lot of launches to make the vehicle design significantly cheaper to manufacture. Buuuut, now you've vastly increased the development cost of the vehicle so you've erased all of the cost gains you've made.<p>But, if you design for reusability then you can actually increase reliability because the cost of the vehicle is amortized over multiple flights, so you can have a more expensive vehicle.<p>Also, while a lot of aerospace components (like fuel tanks, electronics, etc.) can be mass produced with the right design, this is a lot more difficult with rocket engines which have a very high number of precision machined parts made out of special alloys. This makes the engines the long-pole in the costs of a rocket, and it's very difficult to reduce those costs. Right now SpaceX is already the world's largest manufacturer of high-power rocket engines, so if there was a way to cut costs on them they would already be on top of them.<p>Now, back to reusability. Another thing that you get from reusability is that <i>testing</i> can be much cheaper, since you can make incremental changes to a vehicle design and then re-test it.<p>With reusability you have the best of all 3 worlds. You have reliability, you have low per-flight costs, and you have an enhanced ability to prove out potential vehicle redesigns economically.<p>Now, if the size of the launch market were much larger and reusability were more difficult then the equation could change, because it might be easier to recoup expensive cost-saving efforts over a shorter period of time.",1349670333

Reading along, and WHAM, there it is out of nowhere.<p>It's not wrong, but it is also not true, since it is a tautology and so devoid of meaning.  Patents ARE intellectual property, so the statement is a nonsensical ""patents are vital to protect themselves"".  A circular argument.<p>I suspect the author is failing to distinguish between ideas and ""intellectual property"", and is trying to say ""Patents are vitally important to protecting ideas"".  An idea is not intellectual property though.  It is born naked and free and has no inherent attributes of property, such as limitations on its use.  It is patents that attempt to convert ideas into property, and the onus should be on the patent advocate to demonstrate benefits over unadorned ideas.<p>It bugs me that so many ""software patents are bad"" articles go like this:<p>1. Example of why software patents are bad.<p>2. Unsupported assertion that patents are essential.<p>3. Unsupported assertion that pharmaceuticals will not be produced in the absence of patents.<p>4. Half-baked conclusion that something must change, but it's a scary thing to do because it might kill innovation.<p>Why not do it this way?<p>1. Start with the assumption that monopolies are bad for innovation and innovation happens best in a free-wheeling environment.<p>2. Example of why software patents are bad.<p>3.
