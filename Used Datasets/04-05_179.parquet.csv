Unfortunately the business is more likely than not to fail before bearing fruit and even after successfully running the business for large profits over time competition, laws, and factors out of your control usually kill the business.

You combine that with for profit universities which have discovered that the bank and their interests are aligned, they charge what ever they want for tuition, the banks make sure the students can get that in the form of guaranteed loans and non-dismissable loans, and the students play their part by putting themselves into indentured servitude.
