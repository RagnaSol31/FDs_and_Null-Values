3,410766,comment,410469.0,410712.0,0,0,davi,,,There are plenty of microscopic techniques to distinguish inhibitory from excitatory cells.  Computers can tell the difference if given appropriate microscopy images as input and the software to process those images.  Not too hard.<p>But these are dynamic objects.  Google 'rebound excitation' for some counterintuitive effects of inhibitory input.  Hard to dissect how circuits of these objects work.,1230353565

That made the economics of bandwidth-gobbling services, such as internet video, much more attractive. The rapid rise of companies such as YouTube would not have been possible without all that extra cable.""<p>I thought extensive edge caching is what really enabled this.  The backbone never had a chance, even if much more of it were lit up.  However, it probably did help youtube when they were small, and it certainly helped things like Justin.tv (though I believe they now have their own caching solution; youtube live announced they were using Akamai).<p>>""The second thing that a bubble can do is to make a more profound impression on the public mind than a more conservative period of economic development can manage. The 1920s land boom implanted the idea of Florida as a glamorous holiday destination that has lasted to this day. Fisher, who displayed an unending genius for promotion, can take much of the credit.""<p>Why does he give, ""implanted the idea of Florida as a glamorous holiday destination,"" as a positive effect <i>on its own</i>.  I was expecting him to list some positive outcome of this, like say, ""This was a good thing because Florida actually <i>is</i> a glamorous holiday destination, and people really had mistaken ideas about this that were really cleared up when he implanted this idea.  Plus [insert some convoluted means, along the lines of the rest of the article] it helped Florida farmers grow more oranges."" All he did was show that this specific outcome of the bubble was good for Florida, not that it was a good outcome overall.<p>>""He reckons that the introduction of general limited liability in Britain in 1856 was hastened by the experience of limited liability for authorised railway schemes during the boom.""<p>Just my opinion, general limited liability nets out to be a terrible, very un-free market invention.  Reasonable people can disagree, and it is somewhat made up for by the voluntary corporate tax that investors take on when they choose to be an LLC.  Though Reagonites see this as a ""double tax"", it really isn't (because those investors are free to remain a private partnership and avoid the tax entirely).  Corporate income taxes are completely voluntary payments made in exchange for some very lucrative benefits.\nAnyway, I'm not convinced at all by his arguments.  Bubbles leave behind remnants and have side effects that can be beneficial, be they are ultimately misallocations of capital and human labor due to incorrect speculation on the future.  When and if we find out a bubble was helpful and better than alternatives, we generally revise our history and no longer call it a bubble.  It's sort of a definitional thing--there isn't much way around it.  Perhaps the author would have been better changing his thesis into an argument in favor of such a revision for the specific case of Florida and the telecoms.<p>""Dubai's developers similarly fashioned a city out of the desert.""<p>Time will tell whether those resources could have been better spent elsewhere.  What could Dubai have achieved if they had invested even half of all of that sovereign cash directly into education and general welfare for the migrant near-slave-laborers who built the place, rather than rely on some sort of exercise in trickle down theory involving indoor ski slopes in the desert?",1230353483

Get one of those and your luggage problems will be over, in a gloriously impractical fashion.<p>Incidentally, the Miata and the S2000 seem to be pretty fun cars, although I'm too tall for one and too cheap for the other. When I lived in CA I owned a 1986 Toyota MR2; that was lots of fun too, and with a gloriously quirky mid-80s dated look. Bought it for like $6k, and it ran flawlessly, perhaps because it was a Toyota, but more likely because it had been cared for by an obsessive car person for a decade and a half.

However, saying that this contribution alone brings the tipping-point closer is rather pompous.<p>First of all, since gene expressions are such upstream information, knowing it won't give us the whole picture (or even come close to it.)<p>It's like knowing the code of a program, which has syntax you have never seen before, and you have no idea what the compiler does, not to mention the machine code describes an astronomical non-linear computation.<p>Second of all, gene expression dependents on age, environment, behavior, and probably things we don't even know. I haven't look at the data, but I assume it's just the mouse's brain in one instant. Otherwise it will be a VERY resource intensive job. Not to mention that you have to freeze the brain in order to slice it and map the gene (unless they got better technology now), so even if you get a different instant of the brain it won't be the same mouse.<p>However, a step towards the goal is a step towards the goal.

He sounds like he's in the middle of that. I would encourage you to keep talking with him and his doctors. Tell the doctors about what he's experiencing. Often there are good ways to ameliorate side effects. Insist that your father's discomfort be allayed as much as possible. Consult with dieticians and nutritionists about good ways for your father to get proper nutrition while experiencing the radiation and chemotherapies. If his physicians don't provide alternatives, consider consulting with other doctors.<p>Often there are emotional issues at play in the face of serious illnesses that aren't addressed by doctors, or even families. Again, encourage your father and all the family to ask questions of the doctors, and get those questions answered. Listen to your father with empathy. Acknowledge and reflect his pain...and most importantly, the uncertainty you are all facing. You might consider counseling for he and/or the family. There is actually a difference between the emotional pain people struggling with serious illness undergo, and actual clinical depression (major depressive disorder).
