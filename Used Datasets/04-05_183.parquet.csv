30,5234224,comment,5234000.0,5234000.0,6,0,jacques_chester,,,"This is what I like about old-fashioned business. You can tell when the business is a failure: you are no longer able to meet your obligations to creditors.<p>Usually this happens when you run out of cash. It's one thing to have a solvent balance sheet where assets handily outweigh liabilities. It's another entirely when bills fall due and you have no cash to pay them.<p>The classic example, to me, was SiCortex. They had a fantastic future A/R on sales pipeline in a growing segment. But they were also slowly moving from cashflow negative to cashflow positive, which meant they needed regular injections of cash to execute their plan. The GFC struck and cash stopped being invested; and that was that.<p>This particular example sticks in my mind for two reasons. The first was because it was such a vivid illustration of income vs cashflow. The second because of the amount of beard-stroking BS about how they were a victim of x86 blah blah blah. Seriously, no. They ran out of cash.<p>And generally that's what happens. The difference now is that lots of startups have short cashflow cycles. If they bill, they bill monthly. If they're on advertising, it's probably paid monthly. They frequently use Pay-As-You-Go services to run their business, and most PAYG providers bill ... monthly.<p>So when the cash runs down to zero, there's really only a month of obligations to meet. In fact you can bail out a month earlier and never have to go through the very unpleasant and often <i>very public</i> insolvency dance.<p>Meanwhile, most conventional businesses have lots of long term A/R and long term A/P. Cashflow is locked in months in advance, so if and when a crunch arrives there's very little to be done about it except to go to a bank or investor with a cap in hand. Sometimes they say ""no"", or worse, ""we've already given you $X, and now we want it back no matter what"". Boom, you're insolvent and people can see it because your creditors took you to court.",1361076389.0

Pushing DRM into the browsers would only obscure this matter. EME is therefore not serving any good purpose for the open web and should be opposed.

From farther along in the article: ""Those samples were obtained through a U.S. project known as the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth, now in its fourth decade."" There is nothing so amazing about the genes of the participants in the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (one of whom is my immediate descendant, also a participant here on HN) compared to what is amazing about their upbringing, including having the opportunity to take the SAT college admission test before age thirteen as part of regional Talent Search<p><a href=""http://cty.jhu.edu/talent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cty.jhu.edu/talent/</a><p>to qualify for inclusion in the Study of Exceptional Talent.<p><a href=""http://cty.jhu.edu/set/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cty.jhu.edu/set/index.html</a><p>As another few replies have already noted, IQ is polygenic, and no one can identify any genes with a strong effect on IQ.

And the same genes may produce very different IQs and heights against different genetic backgrounds and in different environmental circumstances. This would be especially the case if height and GCA and other psychological traits are only single facets of multifaceted traits actually under more systematic genetic regulation, such as overall body size and balance between processing capacity and stimulus reactivity. Genetic influences on individual differences in psychological characteristics are real and important but are unlikely to be straightforward and deterministic. We will understand them best through investigation of their manifestation in biological and social developmental processes.""",1361074067.0

106,5234145,comment,5230602.0,5234060.0,2,0,latchkey,,,"Node handles one request at a time. It isn't multithreaded. It will receive a request, process that request and return a response. If another request comes in at the same time another request is in process, it is queued until the currently processing request is finished. I googled around, here is a good explanation for you. <a href=""http://howtonode.org/understanding-process-next-tick"" rel=""nofollow"">http://howtonode.org/understanding-process-next-tick</a><p>The way my application worked is that we had 'long' running things like saving data to a database happening before we return a response to a client (in this case an iphone app). Sometimes mongo, the dyno, networking, phase of the moon, talking to the facebook api, etc... we would get 'slow' processing and it would take a few seconds for a response to make it to the client. As soon as this happens, on a heavily loaded system, the heroku router would get backed up (since it only routes to 2-3 dynos at a time) and would start throwing H12 errors.<p>So, what we did was rewrite the entire app to do minimal data processing in the web tier, send the response back to the client as quickly as possible. At the same time, we also send a rabbit queue message out with all the instructions in it to process the data 'offline' in a worker task. There is no spinup since these workers are running all the time. We even have several groups of workers depending on the message type so that we can segregate the work across multiple groups of dyno workers. This also allows us to easily scale to more than a 100 dynos to process messages. It works great. Rabbit is a godsend.<p>I say 'long' and 'slow' above because the longest amount of time we should be taking is a couple seconds at most. Unfortunately, the way that the heroku router is designed is fundamentally broken. As soon as you get a lot of 'slow' requests going to the same dyno's they start to stack up and the router just starts returning H12 errors. It doesn't matter how many dyno's you have because the router only talks to 2-3 dyno's at a time. We get H12's with 50, 100, 200, 300, etc dynos.<p>We also saw very strange behavior with the dyno's. We use nodetime to log how long things take and we'd see redis/mongo take only a few ms, but we'd have >15s just for the request to complete... somewhere things are slow and we can't figure out where. Until this whole mess came out, Heroku just pointed fingers at everyone else but themselves.<p>Oh by the way, as soon as you get around 200-300 dyno's deploys start error'ing out as well because heroku can't start up enough dyno's fast enough and that whole process times out too. You can't tell if a deploy worked or didn't. They didn't seem to care about that at all either.<p>Anyway, I could keep going... but once again, I'll repeat that I'm glad that the Rapgenius guys are calling Heroku out in public on this stuff. There is some big issues here that need to be addressed and the H12/router stuff is the big issue. I'm looking forward to see how they pull out of this one.",1361073861.0
