We also think captchas are only part of the solution and should be employed with other things (rate limiting, keyword filtering, etc)<p>That being said, we don't just ignore security. There are a lot of captcha alternatives out there that survive on just obscurity, if they were widely adopted, they wouldn't take much to get around (like a slide to unlock captcha). We analyze mouse movement and other behavior, to avoid this.<p>To test our algorithms, we write our own bots to break our game (as well as working with the AI lab at the university of michigan) and use that data in our machine learning algorithms. We're always tweaking the bot to see how we can beat it and then looking for new features from the data that we can use.<p>The main point being, that as people do write bots, we can learn from that and incorporate it. We can also adjust the threshold. Some of our customers care much more about usability and just want a minimum level of protection, other's want the threshold a little higher and accept the risk that humans might fail more often.",1343537657

Thus they could see say a big buy order coming in and pull their offers or even take out the offers themselves, knowing that the buyer would have to pay up. This has the effect of raising execution costs for the company trying to accumulate stock for their long term positions. Obviously the same techniques would apply to the long term investor trying to close a stock position by selling.<p>This was effectively legalised front running of the market, something that would normally get you sent to jail. In the name of liquidity, exchanges allowed this and of course they got paid big bucks by the big HFT firms.<p>The whole trading game is pretty corrupt. You would expect that given the amount of money sloshing around. For example we knew about market manipulation in LIBOR for many years. It was an open secret but now the regulators are ""discovering"" it because the political climate is such that fewer people are prepared to live with the big banks excesses.<p>Still there is plenty more ongoing manipulation going on in trading even as I write this. I am awaiting the day that the regulators will ""discover"" these. Some of the bond markets for example have proportional fill executions. So if you have the best price and are first in the queue, a big institution can come along and show an order in vast size, which they have no intention of trading, just to get a fill of the fraction they actually wanted. You of course are left high and dry with just about nothing of your order filled because proportionally it was tiny. It is an amazing sight to behold how these vast orders come along just as the market is about to move and then instantly disappear. It is clear to any trader that someone is working on inside information, but everyone (read: big money)is in on the secret so no one is telling.",1343535538

My grandmother was kind enough to give me her Comcast account info so I can stream through nbcolympics.com<p>Their system is garbage. IE9 and IE9 64-bit come to a screeching halt after 30 minutes of live streaming and have to be killed by task manager. Firefox Nightly x64 (my main browser) does the same thing after ballooning to 600MB of RAM. In Chrome the video starts to skip after 20 minutes when RAM usage hits about 300MB.  So far Chrome + AdBlock is the only thing that's been stable so far.<p>Which brings me to why nbcolympics.com is garbage. They've managed to take a YouTube stream, and then surround it on all sides with 2 flash ad banners, commercial breaks during live streams, many many more commercial breaks during replays, and a drunken orgy of Web 2.0 tracking systems and social medias as far as the eye can see.<p>They've taken the most widely used video distribution platform and turned it into a hulking behemoth that destroys web browsers.<p>Ignoring all of that for a moment. NBC also has gaps in what you can watch on nbcolympics.com The opening ceremony wasn't streamed live, or streamed ""live"" when NBC showed it on TV. I'd have to check, but I don't think you can even watch a reply of it now. I wanted to watch some archery and the USA women's soccer match from earlier. While scrolling through the list I saw a reply link for every event...except gymnastics. NBC decided not to allow replays of that.<p>This just grows the amount of hatred I have for NBC since the 2010 games when they implemented this system and I couldn't get the same Comcast account to authenticate. So I was stuck with tape delay everything while my friends up north were watching everything live through cbc.ca<p>The trial run of NBC's system in 2008 was the best run they've had.

I should try a few reCAPTCHAs to see if this is a correct assumption.<p>EDIT: Confirmed. The ""proper"" word is taken directly from book scans and I can type anything to pass the CAPTCHA. It seems that the control word is very Google-style.",1343534496

The ""user doesn't care"" mentality embraced by so many managers leads to lots of long-run pain and sometimes, paradoxically, even to business failures, because not keeping your ""coders"" (I utterly dislike this word, btw) happy is really BAD for business.",1343534434
