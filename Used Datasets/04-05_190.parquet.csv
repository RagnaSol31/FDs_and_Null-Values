7,9007782,comment,9007082.0,9007491.0,0,0,orbifold,,,"The answer to this question has changed over time. My knowledge of the history is incomplete to say the least. During the first super string revolution, when it was understood that perturbative string theory would give a description of perturbative quantum gravity, the goal was to demonstrate that there were only a few choices of compactification manifolds available from consistency arguments (anomaly cancellation and unbroken super symmetry in four dimensions, probably the most well known paper is &quot;Vacuum configurations for superstrings&quot; by Candelas et. al.)<p>Ignoring heaps of details, the result was that the vacuum manifold (that is a solution to the 10d vacuum Einstein Equations) had to be some 4 dimensional symmetric space (usually taken to be Minkowsky Space) times a Calabi-Yau manifold, those are Kaehler manifolds with vanishing Ricci curvature (those have non-vanishing constant spinors, which you need for unbroken supersymmetry).<p>Initially it was believed that with additional physical consistency conditions and by relating the geometry of the Calabi-Yau manifold to known physical parameters, like the number of generations of particles, it would be possible to narrow down the number of &quot;stable&quot; vacua to a limited number.<p>While there were discovered a fair amount of dualities between different string theories, with the discovery of D-Branes and Flux Compactifications (which stabilize the moduli  of a huge number of potential vacua, the general idea is that the space of calabi-yau manifolds can locally be paramterized as a finite dimensional manifold and those paramters would show up as massless fields that aren&",

My argument to him stands IMO, that your understanding of what constitutes a valid side channel attack is fundamentally flawed in any case.<p>First, lets start with: All of the library and showcase pieces are WAN material. If you bothered to look, you would have noticed that all of the necessary blinding is performed for all cryptographic operations as received, thus even for LAN access, thanks to blinding as widely accepted mitigation strategy, no timing information is leaked.<p>Second, if you bothered to actually peruse the implementation, you would have noticed that when it receives a bad HMAC, instead of reporting that differently to the would-be attacker, it randomizes the expected packet length, thereby rendering timing information based solely on the TLS and/or SSH state mechanism useless.<p>Third, padding related issues are treated the same, such that no attacker-perspective notifications are broadcast.<p>Fourth, the TLS Blacklist feature I added was only an additional, and IMO decent server-side mitigation technique insofar as during normal operations, decrypt operations do not fail, and if they do, why give an attacker the opportunity to perform 32M+ tests against my implementation?<p>In any case, as mentioned specifically on my rwasa page, I left the TLS Blacklist feature disabled for my own website due to the ssllabs.com security scans being incorrect if it is enabled.<p>In summary, my speed increases are not due to shortcutting security protocols or best practices, but the fact that my modular exponentiation routines in x86_64 assembler are indeed faster.<p>Please send me my private key to 2ton.com.au and I will take the whole lot down immediately.",1423197713.0

For example, I remember once he set up an apparatus to grow crystals using chemical vapor transport.  To know when it was finished, he sealed wires to inside the quartz tube (as an open circuit) and connected them to a battery and a light bulb.  When the crystal (which was conducting) grew large enough between the leads, the light bulb would turn on.  It was elegant and simple.  (Usually this type of synthesis occurs in a furnace where you can&",

Impala is very fast - it basically bypasses the entire Hadoop stack to perform its own distributed processing and IO, and Parquet is a great data-at-rest format. I have found the best way to update data holdings is by landing data in Avro format (which is a great streaming format as it carries its schema around with it), referencing it as an external table, then scheduling an Impala query to convert the current Avro bucket into Parquet. I am also looking at using Spark Streaming for real-time map/reduce style processing to value add to the data flowing into Solr/Impala. Even with a moderate sized cluster I feel like I have a lot of processing power at my fingertips, and it all just works. Hadoop is really starting to shine.",1423195413.0
