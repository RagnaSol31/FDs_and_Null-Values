Not exactly the most popular combination. My attitude in high school was mostly not caring about being popular, and I didn't make any effort to identify with people I considered to be unlike me. I had other friends, in the music program, who were sociable and could identify with the less academic oriented crowd and they did fine. I gained a lot of this awareness in college and actually went on to be my fraternities social and rush chair, and what changed was that I gained a more acute awareness of people's social interactions and put in the time to figure out the college social situation. This isn't always a huge priority of nerds, or they just haven't gotten there yet: they may be so advanced in one aspect that the social skills haven't quite caught up yet. However, I disagree that all these geeks will go on to inherit the world: if they don't EVENTUALLY gain those social skills and recognize how valuable they are, they won't get anywhere near as far as they can. There is some ridiculous statistic like some 60-70% of all senators/presidents were Greek (frat and sorority life), and I think this speaks less to the value of the greek system and more to the fact that people who place value on interacting with other people and communicating go farther than those who don't.",1310012940.0

This makes helping people learn something really hard, because mistakes are an important part of learning, and most people would rather make the mistakes themselves than have you steer them around it.<p>As a computer programmer, and particularly a hacker, I can't help but try and optimize everything. Every inefficiency or middleman causes an internal ticking, something that must be addressed before it causes further annoyance and costs people more money and time.<p>Regarding inefficiencies; most people tend to not notice them. Non-programmers look a a system and see something that either works or doesn't. As a programmer I see a system of variables that need to be tuned, or a process with discrete stages and actors, specific inputs and outputs.<p>Another pet peeve which is more specific to me and my experience designing user interfaces and user interactions is the assumptions that people make, often knowingly, before they even start a project. When building a UI for a touchscreen application, programmers and designers that have come from a more traditional software background will automatically map check-boxes to boolean inputs, and radio buttons to pick-one inputs, all while making the assumption there isn't a better way of getting input from the user. They won't consider sliding buttons (like those used on iphone and android phones) as a better alternative to a checkbox, or a selection list in place of a set of radio buttons. It is just as important to identify the reason for your assumptions as it is to identify the assumptions themselves. Often I find situations where assumptions are rendered invalid because people try and use them outside of the specific context in which they are created.<p>Never be afraid to question the status quo, especially when the only reason it remains so is because no one questions it.",1310011869.0

If they are now using a DVCS then they probably have repos for different code stages plus all the local repos.,1310011483.0
134,2737090,comment,2735775.0,2736664.0,5,0,phillco,,,"Reddit is like an enormous spotlight. They have so much traffic, but it's focused on just 25 spots on the front page each day. As a result, whatever gets on the front page receives a truly astonishing burst of traffic. And this effect only increases as Reddit grows  for even as their size has doubled and quadrupled over the years, all that traffic is still focused on the same 25 spots.<p>It's true that you can make your own subreddits, and of course you can keep loading more pages, but the cutoff rate is pretty severe. A few non-default subreddits (like /r/Frugal) do have sizable power since they're well targeted, essentially functioning like mini-reddits.<p>HN is similar, but since they go out of they way to stay obscure, any increase in traffic is practically accidental.",1310011451.0

How you use an hour in front of a room of people is up to you. Conference sessions don't have to be limited to bullets on a slide or purely declarative knowledge.,1310011340.0
