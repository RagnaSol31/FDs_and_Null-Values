As well as just being fun people, they really help me to navigate (and organize) social situations and to meet new people.

Here on HN we regularly see articles espousing the concepts of pair programming and code reviews and SCRUMs and other techniques involving groups. In research settings we regularly get together for lab meetings and journal clubs and conferences and discuss ideas, and generate lots of new ideas. Heck, people regularly convene on sites like Stack Overflow, not to just get answers, but to discuss ideas. These are all meetings which are productive and generate ideas, not just the convening of pontificating idiots.<p>There was a TED talk linked here on HN a while back, called ""where good ideas come from"" [1]. It completely disagrees with this article, but with facts instead of generalizations.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_where_good_ideas_come_from.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_where_good_ideas_com...</a>",1357617723.0

Yet, people generally believe that group brainstorming is more effective than individual brainstorming. Further, group members are more satisfied with their performance than individuals, whereas they have generated fewer ideas.""<p>I've never judged the productivity of a group session by the number of ideas produced.  I think that's a terrible measure.  I judge it by the quality of the few that the group settles on by the end.  And in my experience, group sessions produce ideas of a quality that I could not have produced by myself.  When working with good people, we riff off each other and fill in the gaps in each other's ideas that we wouldn't have even realized were there if we were working on our own.<p>It's very hard to spot your own weaknesses.  I'm convinced that feedback is great and that getting out of your own head is great, and a good meeting can deliver that.  Not always, of course.  I'm a programmer.  I like my me time, and I'm definitely not arguing for group work all or even close to most of the time.  But I'm definitely a better person for the trips I take away from my shell.",1357617663.0
