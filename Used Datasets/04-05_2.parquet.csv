My suggestion is that given it's rate of acceleration, mass fatigue with it will start to set in amongst many and soon.<p>Perhaps the title should have read: We're going to have to change how we use Twitter. Then of course, that seems a little dull, doesn't it?  :-)",1228625914

I did go ahead and get myself a VA to automate part of the process on my end. The site pays for that and I get them for personal use too (<a href=""http://TimeSvr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://TimeSvr.com</a> - they were mentioned here a few months ago).<p>Then again it is December and a lot of orders might be Christmas presents. I'll have to see if it holds up afterwards.",1228625858

Economies of scale let me process each order for less than what it would cost to order 1 at a time, so I can cover the final shipping cost on my end because of the savings.<p>I haven't had any complaints about price, but I did see a comment on Jackcheng.com comparing me to GM or Ford because of the price.<p><i>edit</i> Here's the actual comment if you don't want to go hunting for it: ""That's awesome that you take a $4.95 product and mark it up to $19.99. Do you work for Ford or GM or something?""<p>I don't think he ordered one.",1228625603

But one of Jens' subtexts is, if they're going to clear the deck every 15 years, you might hope for something more interesting than ""better Unicode support"".

16,388633,comment,388473.0,388621.0,0,0,brandonkm,,,"I doubt it, given how weak his argument that twitter is going to die based on perceived reasons like ""its like high school"" and ""people just collect followers"" make me wonder if this guy really knows what he's talking about or is he just going for a shock title.  I just think if we're writing articles called ""twitter is going to die"" and giving reasons to support that based on the social interaction aspects of the site (like you stated), then better reasons should be stated.  Contrary to his argument, i'm sure twitter is not like ""high school"" to millions of users, and people are not just ""making"" or ""collecting"" friends but rather tapping into their interests and networks to stay updated on things in real time.  I've seen similar arguments made for myspace, but twitter is a fundamentally different type of social site, so the ""collecting followers"" argument dosn't hold up as well here.",1228624552

Looking at the table of contents, doesn't seem to have much actual ""Cocoa"" specific content (like AppKit, etc.)<p>So it looks like the blog post title is misleading.<p>EDIT:  And looking through it, I see I can work backwards and re-learn C++ stuff from the parallel ObjC code, as I know ObjC better than C++ which I haven't used seriously in a very long time.",1228623940

I don't see much connection between mass feminization and global warming, but it seems like scientists know if they can cram the words ""global warming"" in there somewhere they'll get the reporters' attention.<p>Reminds me of the old joke about the New York Times headline:  ""World to End.  Women and Minorities Hardest Hit.""",1228622913
