I dropped out of high school 2 years in due to a confluence of factors (primarily boredom and some family issues that resulted in me entering foster care.)<p>My perspective is that the academic aspect of high school is nearly worthless for the long tail of people who have above-average intelligence. What <i>is</i> valuable is the social interaction with peers and other extra-curricular activities. You can get most or all of those activities elsewhere, but it's harder. Additionally, if you have plans of attending a prestigious college you may have more trouble getting in with a GED - although a reasonably high score guarantees admission to a lot of state schools.<p>Unfortunately I wasted any potential gain by spending a few years not doing much of anything except playing video games - in hindsight, probably due to depression.<p>Currently I'm taking college classes and working independently on some projects; I'd be happy to answer most questions.",1369111970

I'm completely guessing, but it is probably different for quantitative finance where rather than investing yourself, you come up with a strategy and follow or even automate it.<p>Of course, that also requires more than just intelligence--you won't get far without the discipline to test everything thoroughly and to follow the strategy even if it loses money in the short term.<p>Also, I imagine the two styles of investing require vastly different <i>sorts</i> of intelligence and are best suited to people of different temperaments.

As irritating as these increases have been for us, we're sorry to say that any protests regarding these increases have fallen on deaf ears. We've held off on passing this increase to our customers for an entire year simply because we didn't want to believe it was true.<p>However, we are sad to report that we've allowed reality's harsh embrace to alter our thinking on domain pricing for .com and .net domains. As of June 15, 2013, we will be increasing the price for .com and .net domain registration and renewals to $11.95 per year.<p>Due to our commitment to non-profit organizations and all of the good work that they do, we will NOT be increasing the price for "".org"" domain registrations and renewals at this time. They will stay at the current rate of $9.95 per year.<p>We're sorry to be the bearers of bad news and wish we didn't have to follow in Verisign's footsteps on this, but them's the breaks.<p>Thanks for your understanding.<p>Should you have any questions about this, please check on our wiki first to see if we've already answered it:<p>http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Domain_Registration_Price_Increase_FAQ<p>If it's not answered there, do feel free to contact us at support@dreamhost.com.<p>-The Not-So-Happy DreamHost Domain Registration Team",1369109999

Maybe I have misinterpreted something?<p>The actual paper does describe generating n different patterns and then randomly selecting one of them to encrypt the message, but the index of the one that is randomly selected is sent with the encrypted message so that Bob can use it to look up the appropriate pattern. I took this as just generating more than one key for convenience's sake.<p>Notably, a requirement for security of the slab is that given temporary access, Eve ""must not be able to efficiently copy or model its contents."" So, I think the point is that since there are many different P's (and hence K(A)'s and K(B)'s), Eve cannot recreate K(B) for all P's in a reasonable amount of time. Further, she can't actually make a physical copy of the device. Still, it seems that if Eve can steal the device, she can break old messages --- which I guess is, as you said, a property shared by regular OTPs. When she steals the device, though, she can only decrypt so many messages before detection, since there is apparently a key recovery rate of 1.5 seconds per key.<p>But one of the other requirements set forth in the paper is that if the slab is stolen, Eve must not be able to send or receive messages.

It seems to me that you would be introducing many more potential intrusion points by using physical encryptors since many more parties (people, databases, and systems) will be aware of the details in order to produce the appropriate slab.
