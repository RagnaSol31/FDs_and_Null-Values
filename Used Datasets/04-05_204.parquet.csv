If you're attempting to derive your sense of happiness through relative goal posts like that then you'll never stop - you won't ever get to a point at which you have an ""absolute"" sense of success. The good news is you can get that sense of absolute success now: just focus on what you have and practice being happy (which is both a choice and a skill).<p>Secondly: don't think about what you can <i>do</i> out of the context of how that helps someone else.<p>""I can code""\n""I can make music""\n""I can ride a horse backwards""<p>All these are fantastic skills - what problems do they solve? You'll notice in each of the cases referenced in the original post, he is picking a very specific problem with a well defined revenue model. These are everywhere. Practice looking for them, and practice releasing anything (there are so many free services out there now you barely even need a backend for your site in order to make money - for example you could create a static site to generate affiliate revenue without a backend, then pay someone to build the backend once you have cashflow).<p>At any rate, don't focus on what you have to offer, focus on what other people need and eventually you'll see something where you think ""you know I can do that - I could solve that problem"" then you do it - and it might work or it might not, but you just keep trying.<p>Also just some context: I'm 31, I was ""the kid to started the lemonade stand"" etc. etc. I never had any business success, studied engineering at 21, got trapped in technology and emerged about 2 years ago and have been reconnecting with my business/sales self ever since. I currently gross about $200k per year but have a team of 2 people and a wife and child to feed so whilst we're subsisting we're not rich. We are growing, and with each year I find that my focus on solving problems and keeping my clients' and customers' needs at the front of my mind at all times, and not getting wrapped up/absorbed in the technology, not only does the business grow but that rate of growth increases as well.",1340254725.0

I'm from an embargoed country and I recently lost job offer in a big semiconductor company because of the deemed export requirement. To avoid any export control liability, some tech companies prescreen applicants before extending interview invitations. If you google, there are a couple of articles where lawyers advise companies to prescreen based on country of origin, arguing that it doesn't violate anti-discrimination laws.",1340252739.0

The requirements are here: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/jj128256"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/jj1...</a><p>The relevant parts for this discussion are:<p><pre><code>    17. Mandatory. On non-ARM systems, the platform MUST implement\n    the ability for a physically present user to select between two\n    Secure Boot modes in firmware setup: ""Custom"" and ""Standard"".\n    Custom Mode allows for more flexibility as specified in the\n    following:\n\n        1. It shall be possible for a physically present user to use the\n        Custom Mode firmware setup option to modify the contents of the\n        Secure Boot signature databases and the PK. This may be\n        implemented by simply providing the option to clear all Secure\n        Boot databases (PK, KEK, db, dbx) which will put the system into\n        setup mode.\n\n        2. If the user ends up deleting the PK then, upon exiting the\n        Custom Mode firmware setup, the system will be operating in\n        Setup Mode with SecureBoot turned off.\n\n        3. The firmware setup shall indicate if Secure Boot is turned\n        on, and if it is operated in Standard or Custom Mode. The\n        firmware setup must provide an option to return from Custom to\n        Standard Mode which restores the factory defaults. On an ARM\n        system, it is forbidden to enable Custom Mode. Only Standard\n        Mode may be enabled.\n</code></pre>\nPK is the ""platform key"". It is the key used by the firmware to identify the platform owner, and is used by the platform owner to enroll the ""key exchange key"" (KEK). The KEK is used for the firmware and the operating system to establish a secure channel. DB is the database of authorized signatures and certificates. DBX is the database of banned signatures and certificates.<p>UEFI has two modes, ""User Mode"" and ""Setup Mode"". It is in User Mode when there is a PK enrolled, and in that mode the secure boot policy is enforced. When in Setup Mode, no secure boot policy is enforced, and PK, KEK, DB, and DBX are writeable without any authentication required.<p>In other words, in Setup Mode, you can put your own set of signatures and certificates in. You should be able to even put Microsoft's certificates and signatures in DBX and thus prevent people from installing Windows on your box. (Or, more practically, put Microsoft's keys in DB along with yours, so you can dual boot).<p>Also:<p><pre><code>    18. Mandatory. Enable/Disable Secure Boot. On non-ARM systems,\n    it is required to implement the ability to disable Secure Boot\n    via firmware setup. A physically present user must be allowed to\n    disable Secure Boot via firmware setup without possession of\n    PKpriv. A Windows Server may also disable Secure Boot remotely\n    using a strongly authenticated (preferably public-key based)\n    out-of-band management connection, such as to a baseboard\n    management controller or service processor. Programmatic\n    disabling of Secure Boot either during Boot Services or after\n    exiting EFI Boot Services MUST NOT be possible. Disabling Secure\n    Boot must not be possible on ARM systems.</code></pre>",1340252676.0

Must say that one of my future projects (about a month away) is a website where people who are looking for co-founders can post messages and interact. Its weird that I must build this tools.<p>Though I must admit that finding a co-founder is not as easy as posting an ad on a website. A co-founder is akin to a business wife/husband. You just cant go and marry anyone. There has to be a connection between the two people. Maybe not be best friends, but a common understanding of what the big goal is. Skills must also be somewhat complimentary. I, for one, look for people who have business/management experience and will get things done. I'll take care of the software, they will take care of the management, but we will both (or all) have a say in all things. Maybe the other person might not know an SQL Join from a Python variable, but they can do testing, design feedback, Q&A, R&D, etc. I might not be a good business manager, but I can call people on the phone and get appointments, help with a presentation (or do it myself), help with the marketing, etc.<p>Its not a what you can do versus what I can do, but a what we can do together.

It wasn't called DRM at the time, but DRM is just an acronym describing any similar practice, not a specific technology.<p>From Wikipedia we also learn: ""A very early implementation of DRM was the Software Service System (SSS) devised by the Japanese engineer Ryoichi Mori in 1983 [135] and subsequently refined under the name superdistribution. The SSS was based on encryption, with specialized hardware that controlled decryption and also enabled payments to be sent to the copyright holder.""",1340251229.0
