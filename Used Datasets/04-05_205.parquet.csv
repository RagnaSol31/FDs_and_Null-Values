If that is so, it is a solved problem :)<p>Basically, implementations log the error to the console and raise the PotentiallyUnhandledRejection event if an error occurs inside a promise and no .catch handler was attached. If a .catch handler is attached _after_ the error is already logged, then a RejectionHandled event is raised. You can listen to those global events (the context is process in node, and window in browser, I think).<p>0: <a href=""https://github.com/domenic/unhandled-rejections-browser-spec",

Many touch sensitive input devices have a too low temporal resolution such that movements at the speed typical for handwriting cannot be captured in sufficient detail.  I agree that the lag of this noteslate thing is a problem but at least the temporal resolution seems pretty decent.,1443761838.0
