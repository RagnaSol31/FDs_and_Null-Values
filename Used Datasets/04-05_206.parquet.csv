This is a common problem with many popularity based recommendation websites such as Digg, StumbleUpon, or Youtube. The problem stems from the fact that they rank content in a single global bucket, where its hard for new comers to compete with established ones.<p>We came up with the idea to allow viral web content to spread like real viruses, by real people across real locations.<p>Benefit number one is that by associating content with locations, each point on earth has its own virtual bucket, in which we only expose content that is spread to, or created at the location. With this breakdown, new content has a better chance to be noticed. \nThen because users on our system picks (Facebook like) and facilitates the movement of content across locations, we create a crowd-sourced filtering system like the natural selection process. So you can trust what reached your location is good.<p>With these, we hope to bring excellent content to consumers, and at the same time democratize content promotion.<p>Our blog has more details in case you are interested: http://blog.infactio.us.<p>Our question is, would you give it a try? Does our app (infactio.us) live up to its promise?\nYour feedback would be really valuable for a young startup!<p>Thanks HN community!<p>Loyd",1313036858.0
