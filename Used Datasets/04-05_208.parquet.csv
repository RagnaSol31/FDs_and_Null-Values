You do realize that these are cuts to <i>government</i> spending, right? How does government get money to spend? It taxes or borrows (taxes in the future). Therefore, a dollar not spent by the government (in a monopolistic, corporatist manner) is a dollar more for the private sector to spend (in a more competitive, efficient manner). If this wasn't true, the government would be the sole provider of all goods and services. Even if the private sector wasn't more efficient in allocating resources, the economy would only be hurt in the long term by that loss of efficiency, not any immediate loss of economic growth, because the spending just shifted from public to private.",1312174245.0

42,2830742,comment,2829463.0,2830506.0,2,0,shabble,,,"I have a few problems with this answer (and perhaps your site itself):<p>Firstly, pretty much by definition, every situation will be unique. Factors\nthat you may deem insignificant and not worthy of mentioning may be crucial\nin diagnosing a condition. A trained doctor should be aware of these factors,\nand ask pertinent questions to consider these factors.  People unaware of such\nconfounding factors may just pattern-match on the information you have provided,\nand come to an erroneous conclusion.<p>The ""facts referenced on a sheet of paper"" are (ideally) distilled from\nwell-designed studies appropriately carried out (double-blinding, suitable\ncontrols, adequate statistical power, etc).  This is arguably better than the\n""raw, personal information"" which represents a single datum, with no control\nwhatsoever.  Granted, studies may not exist for a large range of conditions, or\nmay be performed poorly, etc. I would still be wary of testimonials by\nunqualified people, however.<p>Secondly, which is something of a rehashing of the first point, the people\nasking the questions may not know enough to ask the right questions. I've heard\nthis commonly referred to in the CS world as an ""XY problem""[1].  Paraphrased,\n""You've concluded your problem is X, and you want to know a treatment,\nY. Instead of asking about X, you ask about Y"".<p>This may involve providing incomplete medical history to answer a question,\nor not have access to various diagnostic equipment, etc.<p>Thirdly, how does it ""[focus] on the key health topics""? It looks something not\ndissimilar to a stackexchange site, perhaps without the\nediting/metacommenting/badges, etc.  I assume some moderation will be in place\nto select these key health topics, and perhaps eliminate the spam? The main\nforms of communication (towards answering a posed question) appear to be adding\nanswers, or voting up others.  I'm not sure that's a suitable model for health\nissues - you're either going to end up with people upvoting things that they can\n(however vaguely) relate to, or adding additional answers to espouse their\npersonal pet theory, adding noise to the discussion. I'd therefore look to the\nSE sites for ideas, such as communal editing, etc, but I think a score/badge\nrelated system is inappropriate for this subject.<p>Finally, I'm not sure of the legal situation, but I can certainly imagine that\nactual medical professionals would avoid answering questions, due to concerns\nabout liability and professional ethics issues.  Much the same occurs around\nlaw-related topics (disclaimers abound: IANAL, IAN<i></i>Y<i></i>L, etc). Without that\ncountering opinion, I fear it may drift into placebos, rainbows and unicorns\nterritory. I couldn't say for certain that will be the case, but the first\nquestion I looked at, the answer pointed to a thread on ""earthclinic"", with\na huge number of people suggesting various vitamins, supplements with little\nor no justification for their use.<p>I realise this post is excessively negative, but I am deeply dubious of the\nvalue of ""crowdsourcing"" for situations in which lives may be at risk, and\npeople could waste time waiting for answers, instead of going to the doctor\nor emergency room.<p>Perhaps the most useful way I think it could be used is as a sanity-check for\nactual diagnoses or treatments.  ""My doctor thinks I have X, and has prescribed\nY, but there is no sign of improvement, any other ideas?"".<p>Even then, I think it's fairly common practice to ask your doctor to refer you\nfor a professional second opinion, which would probably be more useful. Then again,\na fresh and distinct pair of eyes could pick up something a hurried, ""treat as the\n most common case first"" doctor might miss, as indicated by your facebook/autoimmune\nlink upthread.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341</a>",1312173684.0

The interest payments on that are probably $30,000 a year (15% of your income). Your solution? Borrow more? What bank would lend you money?<p>Multiply those numbers by a million and you have the current situation of the US government.<p>Non-discretionary spending is spiraling out of control. I had this discussion at dinner last week where someone suggested it was crazy not to raise taxes. I disagreed. My argument is basically this:<p>1. People on low incomes currently pay little, no or even negative tax (factoring in government benefits);<p>2. Such a system creates a disincentive to work with the <i>marginal</i> rate of tax. If you earn $10,000 and get $2,000 from the government but by $20,000 you are paying $2,000 in tax with no benefits, the marginal rate of tax is actually 40%;<p>3. The problem isn't the top rates of tax, it's all the exemptions and the complexity of the tax system.<p>So how about instead of populist pleas of taxing the rich we simply make everyone pay their fair share? What about 25 cents in every dollar for every dollar you earn each year above $20,000 (and nothing below)?<p>Congress seems beholden to special interests and pork barrel politics. In the 90s Congress tried to surrender their power to the executive branch by passing the line item veto measure. In previous years they were unable to close military bases and had to establish the Base Realignment and  Closure Commission.<p>Will it take a similar commission for Congress to distance themselves from similarly hard decisions? The longer this goes on, the harder it's going to get.<p>What I see happening in the coming years:<p>1. Retirement age being raised to 70 <i>or even higher</i>;<p>2. Federal sales tax similar to the consumption tax every other OECD nation has. State sales taxes are too complex. Interstate sales tax exemptions are fighting a losing battle to continue to exist; and<p>3.

You do your edits on devtools, once you are ready, push a button (will try to make it a keyboard shortcut) and the changes will go back to the localhost files (js and css changes) and site itself will be refreshed. If one edits the localhost file, again the page on the browser is refreshed (just Alt+Tab to it).",1312171351.0

I used to work for a municipal fiber company and they are FAR from being the best group to build the kind of Infrastructure we need.  Don't even get me started on the problem of politicizing the communications infrastructure of a city.<p>The only path forward is for us to get some real competition between the cablecos and the telcos.,1312171261.0

The compounding pharmacy that my doctor referred me is very reasonable and they can 'custom make' drugs.  Mexico is a very good option (I live in San Diego) because I can go get a generic equivalent for 1/5 to 1/10 of the price in the US, and I can use my HSA card to pay for drugs in Mexico.",1312171225.0
