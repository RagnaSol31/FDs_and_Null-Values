46,8046067,comment,8040109.0,8042973.0,4,0,jblow,,,"I certainly welcome the attempts to reduce annotations and will look again at the language in a while.<p>It is interesting that the design priorities are so library-centric. I agree that library quality is important, but think about this: For every library that someone writes, N people are going to use that library in leaf programs, where if the library is useful N is much much greater than 1. So by definition the vast majority of code is not library code.<p>In video games we write programs that are between 200k and 2M lines, say. That is big enough that you do want to think about what API you are presenting from part of that program to another, but stability of that (internal) API is almost never a concern, and in fact this is one of the big boons of statically-typed languages: you can change a function and you instantly get errors at all the calling sites, allowing you to be sure you updated them (except in some bad ambiguous situations).<p>This fluid ability to change how parts of your program talk to each other is very important in large programs. It is one of the major ways you avoid code rot. The more friction is introduced into this process, the lower the ceiling on how large and complex a program you can build.<p>The other thing about games is that the problems are inherently very interconnected. Yes, we kind of partition things into different modules, but these modules all want to talk to each other very heavily (partly for inherent problem space reasons, partly for performance reasons). So again, friction introduced here hurts us more than it hurts most people.<p>I understand that private-by-default seems like the right idea because it supports a certain paradigm of programming that is generally considered the right thing (encapsulate your implementation details, modularize as much as possible, etc). But what I have found, in my field at least, is that this is less true than many people think. Yes, it&",

My job was not impacted at all by the layoffs so I speaking from my memory of what was happening around me. In fact, I was working on an incubation project that was one of the few ideas that was green-lighted with a pretty sizable team that year.<p>My perspective:\nFrom a company perspective, eliminating 5000 people in 2009 was a great idea. It was (and is) a huge company so it probably could have been more. However, the layoffs in 2009 were seriously botched. Many organizational best practices were violated.<p>Microsoft made an announcement saying that there would be ~5000 layoffs and that they would be completed over the following 18 months. This timeframe is too long! Layoff best practices say: cut deep and cut fast. Get rid of the people that have to be let go, treat them as well as you can on the way out, and then show some serious TLC to the employees you want to retain and rebuild your culture and trust with the people who stick around.
