One thing I often noticed was many people break some key computer science concepts while on the goal to achieve some minor usability improvements or some other minor goal such as code reuse.<p>There was one instance where in a multiprocess environment, one of the engineers wrote some library to access a database table and read its contents. In the process he/she maintained a cache of it in memory. Then somebody else decided to use that convenience library/methods in a different process and so on.., essentially cache coherence problems were left unsolved and when I brought this to the attention of people they shrugged it off saying when they see a problem they might handle it - which may be fine, but seemed like some key computer science concepts were overlooked in the goal to achieve software reuse (here reuse of existing accessor/cache code to the database)<p>I have seen design choices that cause race conditions or non-determinstic behavior, following some patterns or cargo cult programming because something is an industry trend etc.",1441946870.0
