55,5568916,comment,5568184.0,5568184.0,6,0,DannyBee,,,"I see a bunch of folks confusing first sale doctrines, contract law, etc here, so let me give a very short generalized primer:<p>1. The first sale doctrine is exhaustion of a single right of the exclusive copyright rights.  In particular: It states that the right to restrict <i>distribution</i>[1]  terminates upon first sale. It's codified at 17 USC 109, and states: ""... the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord. ""<p>As mention, this is exhaustion a very specific right of copyright, and applies to copyrighted works.  In this case, that would be software.  It has literally no bearing on <i>a contract as part of the sale of goods</i>, or whether you can sue for breach of that contract. It is a defense to <i>copyright infringement</i>.<p>To whit:<p>If I sell you a book, as part of a contract, and that contract says ""no resale"", and you sell it, the first sale doctrine would probably[2]  prevent me from winning a lawsuit for <i>copyright infringement</i> but not prevent me from winning a lawsuit for  for <i>breach of contract</i>.<p>2. Sales of tangible goods in the US are covered by the UCC (uniform commercial code).  Every state has passed a version of the UCC (though not all are on the same revision, for this discussion, it doesn't really matter).<p>The UCC lets you freely contract for almost anything.  It fills in and has default terms when not stated, requires some contracts be in writing, etc, but there is generally nothing that prevents you from doing something like preventing resale of an object.  You can argue it's unconscionable to a court, or you can argue it violates some <i>other law</i> (antitrust, whatever), and thus the court should not enforce it but in most cases, it'll be a valid and enforceable contract on its face.   In general, if you have a legal right to do something, you can validly contract to forgo that legal right. For example, you can promise to not marry anyone until age 30, promise to marry someone in exchange for money, etc (Neither of these would be UCC contracts)<p>3. As a final note, for sales of UCC goods, there is no additional consideration necessary for them to modify the agreement, only the general requirement of good faith.<p>I offer literally no opinion on the status of this particular agreement, or anything like it. The above is also not legal advice (among other things, i've left out exceptions, and merchant <-> merchant rules, and ...), just an attempt to clear up some common misconceptions.<p>[1] ""to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;""  Note that ""distribute copies"" does not mean ""make copies"", it literally means ""distribute"" an already made copy. Reproduction is a separate right.<p>[2] There are some current cases (and past ones) making arguments that you can contract away your first sale rights. The problem with this idea is that as titled and written, 17 USC 109 is, IMHO, not an affirmative right (and thus something you could agree to forego, even though some cases hold it must be pleaded as an affirmative defense), but instead a limitation on the exclusive rights <i>the</i> owner has.  It's even titled "" Limitations on exclusive rights: Effect of transfer of particular copy or phonorecord"".<p>This is why the standard mechanism software companies attempt to use is to classify their agreements as <i>licenses</i> that do not transfer ownership, rather than <i>sales</i> that do.  If you are not an owner, the first sale doctrine does not help you.  Success varies in ability to convince courts they aren't selling software, but instead, licensing it.  In the end, it may not matter if they can succeed by suing for breach of contract rather than copyright infringement :)",1366259862.0

Given that there is no way for a legislator to tell how many people in their district support a petition, I would guess very little.",1366259672.0

74,5568895,comment,5565424.0,5567895.0,3,0,EEGuy,,,"Agreed, stunning it is that so common and reasonably safe a thing as a self-serve gas pump is a 22 MW chemical energy delivery system!<p>Some reflections:<p>* Perhaps an EV might be 10x as efficient with its input energy as a gasoline powered car.  Perhaps 220 KW would do.<p>* Perhaps a robotically mobile, rather than a counterweighted, manually lifted and connected cable is in order.  The present day robotic car wash design where the car stays still while the motile, rotating washing machinery moves around it comes to mind.<p>* Electrical connectors give me more trouble than wires and cables.  A replaceable, quick-disconnect connector capable of 20KA seems more of a design challenge than the cables that would go with it.<p>* High voltage insulation and wiring is ""easier"" than high current conductance (low resistance) wiring, for example:  Common engineering practice with 30-volt solar panels is to wire them in series so that the total string voltage is 300 to 600 VDC at 8 Amps, rather than in parallel so that the current would be 80 to 160 Amps at 30 Volts.  Air is a lousy and unsafe insulator, but there are good liquid insulators which could easily, temporarily fill a two-pole, ground-surround high-voltage connector (displacing the air) before it's allowed to be electrically energized and ramped up to a high voltage.  Precise ground fault current detection could make it safe from fault currents (i.e. shocks & shorts) in the milliamp range even as the cable carries hundreds or thousands of Amps.  But any HV supply requires up-conversion at the station and down-conversion in the EV; whilst these can be 95% efficient, the effect of each conversion inefficiency is multiplicative, and they add weight.<p>* Then there's the charging station itself.  If it has eight charging stations at, say 250 KW each, that's 2 MW draw from the utility (or an underground group of batteries recharged at a lower rate from utility power?) when all stations are charging cars.  Not trivial; just the 500 KVA (call it 500 KW for discussion purposes) utility distribution transformer outside building where I work is the size of four refrigerators, not including its switchgear, all of which is enclosed by a 20 foot tall fence surrounding about 200 sq feet.  Multiply that by four in volume to get 2 MW supply required from the utility.",1366259431.0

They were extremely serious about their music, about their shows, and about the fans. But they didn't take themselves seriously. Trey pretty much sums all of this up well in one of their documentaries.<p>With this attitude of theirs they also came on the scene at a good time. In the mid 90s, grunge rock was dying or dead, and the serious bands such as Nirvana gave way to materialistic hip hop, commercial rock, and (remember?) swing. Phish, at least for me, filled the void of grunge rock and opened me up to a whole new world of music. I could get really into Phish because I knew they approached their music with such care. It's hard to invest time in appreciating something and studying it when you have doubt that there's actually no substance or skill underneath, at least when it's not the most approachable material. Phish really never disappointed in that regard.<p>Further, it's hard to overstate the genius of two people in Phish: Trey and their lyricist Tom. Trey is not only incredibly skilled, he has an enormous amount of energy and enthusiasm powered directly by the crowd. If you watch him play, he's so tuned in to everything around him, you can feel that he's not really focused on the guitar (the physical aspect or the theory). It's not a challenge for him to manipulate it which lets him focus on playing with the rest of the band and the crowd which he does so well. The best analogy I see is what a touch typist experiences with the keyboard. You really don't think about typing. Now imagine being able to type messages live to people and every character you type is truly thrilling and enjoyable to your audience, and oh you can write in rhymed iambic pentameter without trying.<p>And Tom's lyrics I think are simply fantastic. Round Room I think really shows his true excellence. He can craft together 3 or 4 meaning and themes at once without making it seem like a big stretch. And he has such a soothing tone it sounds like a children's book sometimes, but the meaning is really almost beyond the realm of being able to consciously analyze it, yet not reaching the level of absurd.",1366258991.0

You will just need to remember a big password (or just a small coffer where you put a unique printing of your password). The protection of your property will be cheaper.,1366257737.0

The first thing I'd do if I had to use Django again would be to eschew its ORM and use SQLAlchemy instead.<p>[1] This was a few versions of Django ago; if they fixed this since then, I welcome corrections.",1366257610.0
