58,6209942,comment,6208419.0,6209724.0,9,0,saurik,,,"The notion of &quot;freedom&quot; is complex and context sensitive. Some people (whom I largely disagree with, as I think this usage of terminology is itself context sensitive; it is, however, useful as a first approximation to get the ball rolling) look at the difference between &quot;freedom to&quot; and &quot;freedom from&quot;; by taking away my &quot;freedom&quot; to own other people, chaining them and forcing them to work for me by force, other people obtain the freedom from being slaves, and now have the freedom to run their own lives. The &quot;freedoms&quot; being looked at here are simply being given to different people: the GPL restricts freedoms of developers working with th software to provide and guarantee freedoms among the end users f that software; on the opposite side, BSD-licensed software tends to give developers more freedom, but the freedoms they are given are specifically for and really narrowly able to be used with the one purpose of later restricting freedoms of others. The question, thereby, comes down to which freedoms are more important and how many of each kind of consumer there are, in an attempt to define which philosophy provides more freedom. Advocates of GPL would say that there will always be more end users than developers, and that their freedoms are porbably more important anyway, so the GPL provides more essential &quot;freedom&quot;, even as it is actively defined in a way that &quot;restricts freedom&quot;, in the same way as we usually like to think the emancipation proclamation brought &quot;freedom&quot; even though it really was stating that slave owners had to give up some freedom: its all about perspective.",1376454765.0
