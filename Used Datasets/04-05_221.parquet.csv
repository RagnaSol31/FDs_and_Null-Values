In the ""revert a revert"" article above, the problem is that merging a topic branch doesn't cause the first few commits on it to be applied if those commits were already merged but then reverted -- the revert has no effect on the merge. This is precisely because every commit object, since it includes it's parent's sha1, uniquely determines a history of changes, and commits in that are in both ancestries don't get re-applied.<p>In Bram's example, you have the opposite problem -- two commits are semantically the same but were made independently and have different sha1s. If Linus were drawing this diagram he would label them B and B' (and so on... there's a lot). To git, B' is totally different so a merge applies the change ""again"". If the other person had noticed this and reset their branch to the first B, the merge would be a fast-forward.<p>IMHO, the Don't Do That should apply to creating those commits (by cherry-picking, or not rebasing duplicated work) rather than merging. Not because such commits are morally wrong or something like that, but because git intentionally (""the stupid content tracker"") doesn't handle them well. That's the tradeoff of the nice object model.<p>Our git workflow at my job is pretty messy and does run into this sort of stuff. I'd love something just a <i>little</i> more darcs-y, like say grafting together the two branches in the second example that arrive at the same content (without having to manage a local grafts file separate from the repository), but that opens many other cans of worms that I'm sure I'm not intelligent enough to deal with.",1303101484.0

It's hard to me to imagine that you were somehow slowed in your learning progress by using Windows instead of Ubuntu, MySQL or SQLite instead of Postgres and Vim instead of Emacs.<p>This is because the first and foremost important thing about learning to program is the desire to do so. The early hackers programmed by directly banging hexadecimal machine code into computers without screens. Were they not programmers? Sure they were. Don't put too much stress on the tools - just program.",1303099252.0

If it comes down to an arms race, they can't win more than extremely temporary victories. If they could, they'd have completely stopped filesharing over Bittorrent, IRC, AIM, MSN, Skype, HTTP, email, Usenet, various P2P services like Kazaa and Limewire, ... and so on.<p>If they start blocking/interfering with the protocol (like Comcast injecting RSTs into suspected torrent connections), you can just encrypt the entire transport layer and randomise the ports. People were configuring their firewalls to drop the falsified RSTs from Comcast.<p>If they blacklist hostnames, there's a near limitless number of them that can be generated. The client can precalculate a domain and ping it at a given time for instructions the same way botnet clients work. The government can't register/block every possible domain name that will be generated. Another alternative: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_flux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_flux</a> There's nothing illegal about having a hostname resolving to an IP.<p>> Especially if the software is open source, as Bitcoin is, all the knowledge of the inner workings of the protocol is public knowledge<p>This is also true for GPG, ciphers like AES/Twofish/Serpent, etc. Openness does not necessarily imply weakness.",1303099247.0
