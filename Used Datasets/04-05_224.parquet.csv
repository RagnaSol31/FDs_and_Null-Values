They called this design pattern &quot;acquisition&quot;, and seemed rather proud of it until they realized it was the kind of magic that was ultimately too magical for its own good.<p>The Zope guys tried very hard to eradicate it, and in the process ended up alienating all the developers with the new, non-backwards-compatible version.
