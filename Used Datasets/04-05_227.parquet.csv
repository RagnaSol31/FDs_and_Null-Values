However, the brief overview that you have given does not contain all the details required. First of all, have you graduated yet? If yes, then it seems that you should be able to use your OPT until then, and can continue to work on the startup. However, on OPT you cannot receive ownership of any company stock and as such have to be excluded. You are free to work, but not free to own. The company can pay you some salary, provided it has the ability to do that. The rules could be murky here, but as far I understand it, my lawyer expressly stated that I should not own any shares before obtaining my visa. (Although my visa category was an E2 investment visa, which is a different designation)<p>For your company to sponsor you for an H1 visa, it needs to be able to show that it has considerable financial resources (either revenue, or investors). So if in a year from you have a LOI from an investor or revenue, you can show that to the INS for credibility.<p>As far as the incorporation goes, I think initially its best to have it as a partnership LLC, since it is pretty flexible and gives you enough wriggle room since LLC's are often open-ended and can be structured in a variety of different ways. Once you go big, have your H1B you can think of shifting towards another incorporation model, as most investors would want you to anyways.<p>IF you have not graduated, then best advice: take a min number of credits while in school and work on the startup till you get decent sized enough that you can attract funding or have enough revenue to get an H1B or an E2 investor visa.<p>Hope that helps. I know how hard these immigration issues are to wrap ones head around, so let me know if you have any more questions. I have been through it.<p>There is also a great blog post written by one of the principals at K9 ventures. I suggest reading all of his stuff on visa issues as well: <a href=""http://bit.ly/nTsGTy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/nTsGTy</a> (its a text only version since actual page is not loading)",1311137675.0

I'm not sure why you think I misread the patent, though.  If I thought the ""server"" had to be on a different machine, I'd be claiming Android didn't infringe.<p>You are correct about claim construal, but no narrower construal suggests itself to me for this claim.  So perhaps you are mistaken and there is no such cited prior art, or perhaps the examiner should have stricken this claim, or perhaps there is a narrower construal that isn't obvious to me.<p>You are mistaken about my worldview.  My worldview comes from patent law.  In your example, if people have been buying frobnitz flanges before Apple's new invention, they are clearly adapted to some other use than displaying blurple.  So, in my worldview, they are a ""staple article of commerce"", a term I have used several times in this discussion and which you would do well to look up, so their sale is non-infringing.  However, a piece of software whose installation and use on a computer necessarily infringes the patent is not suitable for substantial noninfringing use (unless perhaps you can argue that its use to paper your wall or as an illustration in a discussion about software patents is substantial), so selling it separately is clearly just an attempt to infringe the patent in a sneaky way.  (Presuming, of course, that the patent is valid at all.)<p>This is not some hare-brained theory I just thought up on the spur of the moment.  You'll find it explained in any patent law textbook, in quite a number of online introductions to patent law, and in 271 (c) of the Patent Code.  You are welcome to attempt to explain to Congress and the Supreme Court that their logic doesn't work because it forbids the sale of frobnitz flanges or whatever, but don't blame it on my worldview.",1311137392.0

I am doing some marketing work for a small startup job board for medical device professionals (http://meddevicejobs.com). We had a logo and brand designed in 2004 by a design firm here in Phoenix, AZ.<p>Just recently, I noticed a different local design firm using a logo almost exactly like ours. This is the first I've heard of them, so I sent a sarcastic tweet from the company account, just ""Cool logo."" They tweeted back that it was cool and it's interesting that they've had it trademarked for ""many years.""<p>Next I get an email from them asking me to take our logo down because it infringes on their trademark. I looked up the trademark and they have the ""M"" thingy trademarked, but reversed. The trademark was for 2008. We had this logo in 2004.

There is an intense country of origin bias against China, so to serve really solid retailers, you are going to have to offer wonderful terms. For example, when you start a relationship with a smart (small) retailer, they are going to want generous credit terms, they will want you to pick up shipping, and they will want to know they can return anything they don't sell (at any time and in any condition) on your dime. Ultimately, it ends up looking like a consignment deal, only your margin won't be as high.<p>If you want to serve one or two large retail chains, you are going to have to spend big marketing dollars to reach them. Then, they are going to tell you how to run your business, how to set up your systems, how much to charge, and when you are getting paid. The last one is critical because large retailers know they are in charge of the relationship - they will pay you when they feel like. If you are a single SKU supplier, you will be the last one to get paid - if you have to go into debt to buy your stock, you can easily lose money because your margin likely won't be much higher than the interest you pay.<p>If you want to become a supplier to a distributor, you need a very compelling product. Distributors are tremendously smart and they have already thought about importing your product directly. Your prices/quality have to be good enough to justify going through a middleman (and not sourcing it directly, with all of their contacts to help out).<p>As a general rule, I would rather perform open heart surgery on myself with a spoon than work with large retailers. And frankly, going after distributors eats up a whole lot of time/marketing dollars. Consequently, the small retailer option is best, though they are still a very difficult group to reach.",1311135553.0

The key IMO is to pace yourself: don't overwork on days you feel like it, and force yourself to work -- even if just a little bit -- on days you don't.<p>For software, having your code in a public repository like GitHub provides some socially-based motivation to keep your projects active.  Just the simple act of regularly committing small changes can provide you with a sense of momentum -- and bonus points for raising (and fixing) issues, etc.<p>For days that you aren't on your A-game, it's also helpful to have made a TODO list from a day when you were thinking more clearly, so you can work on a relatively simple task just to maintain momentum.<p>Another key is to have a ""big picture"" goal that your projects are helping you towards.

I definitely remember avoiding stdio when writing small utilities that I wanted to start up and run fast.<p>Also remember that back in those days echo was not a shell builtin.  (Hell, back then the testing operator '[' wasn't even a builtin.  Some UNIXes like OS/X still have a vestigial /bin/[ executable!)  Programs like echo that ran from shell scripts constantly had to be coded to start up as fast as possible.",1311134733.0

Some days we feel really motivated, other days we want to sit around and do anything but work - both of those are fine. Just try to get the most out of your good days, and enjoy the ""slow"" days.
