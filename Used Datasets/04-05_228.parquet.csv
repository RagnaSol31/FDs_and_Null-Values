1,2968419,comment,2968068.0,2968368.0,2,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"It depends. I found myself in that situation and just started doing the job, but this requires your boss' approval, since it will take time away from coding and cost money. To do this, you have to have a current gap in product management (as opposed to PMs making bad decisions). This was my path into product management.<p>If you can't get your boss' approval or there is existing product management, you can try sitting down informally with them. Explain your concerns, but be tactful (this part is hard for many engineers who are completely data driven). You have to be careful not to get people defensive. Go in with an attitude of ""I see this as suboptimal, teach me why I'm wrong"" instead of ""You're an idiot, you should be doing this thing instead"". Make sure you are being objective, though. I've had engineers fight me on what ""should"" be done because they were only looking at technology instead of the whole business.<p>If neither of those work, you are probably going to get frustrated quickly. Few things did more damage to my team's morale than feeling like they were working on something useless.",1315371531.0

A few months back, a job posting for a designer at inDinero included a sidebar that asked this question. Jessica suggested that the answer was ""No"".<p>It seems that product managers are not required when a company is relatively small, and a co-founder has the bulk of his/her time to dedicate to product development. In such a case, a team need be made up of only engineers and designers.<p>Even when teams are larger, new-ish web application frameworks like Rails make deployment incredibly easy/fast and all of the ""strategic thinking"" that a PM might ordinarily contribute is done with live product. In these situations, all of the activities listed in Joseph's blog post - focus, vision, avoiding frankensteinism, customer-centricity - could be handled by a product designer or product-minded engineer.<p>Are product managers a thing of the past?

Lots of scripts which are of the form ""move these files around, run this command on the files, mangle the output, send it to this command to summarize, send to another command to pretty-print"" can be long in line count, but are really well-done in shell.

What I am against is outsourcing based on the simplistic math that you can get ""3 for the price of 1"" in Bangalore. When we give Bangaloreans(?) work based simply on price and not on their core competencies (and how the outsourced team will work with the rest of the company), then outsourcing won't work.<p>I feel that outsourcing should be done where it makes most sense.

(Ratio of Scala projects that succeeded divided by total Scala projects.)<p>Pollak wants the average doofus Java developer (""COTM"" as he terms them) not to use Scala so that Scala's win rate stays high, even if Scala's absolute number of wins remains low.<p>But having a multitude of doofus developers leads precisely to things that Scala kind of lacks right now, like quality IDE support, idiomatic libraries for every possible use case, and so on.  Without the <i>hoi</i> <i>polloi</i>, why spend a massive number of man years developing IDE support that can efficiently parse incorrect source code in the language as correctly as possible?  Why write idiomatic payment processor code?<p>Similarly, focusing on only the best developers has arguably led languages like Haskell and Lisp to be great languages for learning language constructs and new ways to think, but poor day-to-day languages.  (Though I do recognize that Clojure is gaining ground, etc.)<p>In short, is Pollak right?  Is win rate so critical to adoption of a new language that Scala should kick out the COTM programmers?

Kiln was brand-new at the time, and was a big part of the demo, so I thankfully had an excuse to do the European DevDays stops to answer questions and do demos.<p>And it...well, it starts awesome, if you do it right: you get to see a bunch of stuff you've never seen before, you get to fly first-class if you're lucky, and you meet a bunch of brilliant people.
