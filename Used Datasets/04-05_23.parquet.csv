The contest, by paying out only under certain conditions, guaranteed a usable result and thousands of people working on it. So it was much cheaper than the alternative in more ways than just financially. It was a brilliant idea IMO. Releasing the data without passing on liability of some kind, maybe not so brilliant.",1261112152.0

The only thing it has hindered is the possibility of me getting an H1B and working in the U.S.. After I dropped out, I was really paranoid about proving myself. I'd hang around on TopCoder and several head hunters on there offered to hook me up with interviews with big companies in the U.S. like Microsoft. It's my understanding I wouldn't be eligible for the required H1B however.<p>Education matters so long as you're mature enough to make it matter. The vast majority of undergrads from the mid-90s onward coasted through university and didn't learn the fundamental point of it which is to ultimately be able to learn on your own. Having had to interview people with varying levels of education, I can say there's little correlation between success and education. Intelligence perhaps, but at the rate that universities are printing degrees, they've literally been forced to lower their standards. It's my opinion that in general, a university grad of 2009 has undergone a much less rigorous education than that of 1979.<p>Here's a tip though. You need to seek help. We don't fully understand depression, but it's my opinion that it's the equivalent of your brain's Check Engine Soon light. You can keep driving with that light on, but you'll ignore it at your peril.<p>I'm speaking from experience here... judging by your statements here I don't think you're in any condition to think about starting a successful company. Take a sabbatical if you can afford to. Get your emotions and relationships figured out, start exercising, sleeping a fairly consistent sleep schedule, and eating healthy food. If you live with your parents, consider taking on a part time job to contribute toward paying expenses. Spend the rest of the time just sampling different experiences. You'll eventually notice a trend and that'll be your path.<p>And for goodness sakes, keep your social life and don't be afraid to have a few drinks a week. Just don't overdo it. Making yourself a hermit to ""be more productive"" will backfire. I made that mistake too. Now I just look back at those two or three years in my early 20s like they're a black hole I wish I could fill with actual memories. I stunted my emotional growth and basically spent my late 20s catching up for all those experiences I missed in my early 20s.<p>After 6 months, revisit your decision to drop out. As someone already mentioned in this thread, closing counts for a lot. But if you decide you'd rather start your own business, you'll have a clear mind and a healthy body to devote to it. Right now, you don't have that and it will undermine your plans.<p>If you want to chat more about this, let me know. I promised my parents I'd eventually get my degree. I'm not one to break my word, so my current plan is to cash out of my business then go back to school and become a permanent student... one of those annoying mature students that asks a ton of questions in lecture because they really really really are passionate about learning.<p>EDIT:<p>One thing to add. I didn't know a bloody thing about running a business when I dropped out. There's no way I can spin that to be a good thing. It was just terrible and I was foolish thinking I could run a successful business when I didn't even know what that meant. I found my legs in business only after I decided to pack it in and take a salaried position with a small company. I eventually left that job but I used that experience to absorb as much as I could about running a business.",1261112111.0

10,1002556,comment,1000406.0,1002175.0,0,0,gojomo,,,"Sure, a corporation might be insane, irrational, myopically short-sighted, or so dysfunctional that the management and employees pursue their own short-term enrichment at the expense of the shareholders' long-term assets.<p>But these things, when they happen, are recognized as problems and eventually corrected -- at least enough so that most large corporations don't malfunction in asset-obliterating ways.  (Even if you think corporations amorally destroy <i>others</i> assets via negative externalities, they do a reasonable job of protecting <i>their own</i> assets -- so much so that even labor unions and left-wing wealthy people keep most of their wealth in corporate shares.)<p>That is, corporations malfunction plenty, but not often catastrophically, and they remain pretty good at holding and efficiently exploiting assets without destroying them.<p>Compare that to the case of an unowned, depletable commons that's exploited my many individuals and corporations. If you think one corporation could tend to poor management, then the 'commons' case has no hope: every participant, including amongst them flawed corporations with short-sighted managers, can only profit by racing others to use the pool before it's inevitably gone.<p>A government or regulatory agency <i>could</i> theoretically act the part of a single rational long-term-perspective owner -- but those multiparty hierarchical institutions have the same flaws you've pointed out in corporations. In my observations, they're even worse -- larger, with responsibility even more diffuse, and the 'shareholders' even more distracted and unable to hold staff accountable for egregious failures to protect stewarded assets.<p>I'm far from certain monopoly ownership would work but it needs to be compared against what's actually happening, and against what's actually possible with unowned/government-driven approaches. It's not enough to just note, corporations sometimes malfunction and ownership might also result in overfishing.",1261111732.0
11,1002554,comment,1001834.0,1001998.0,0,0,pfedor,,,"I have no opinion about energy drinks, but I think I can explain why Science Fiction and comics are more popular among geeks than general population.  Sci-Fi and comic books are two examples of fields of art where the social perception is below the real value of the art.  Science Fiction novels are no worse than mainstream contemporary fiction.  (One could even argue that SF is now in its golden age, like say romantic poetry was in 200 years ago.)  But the stereotypical notion is that SF is junk without artistic value.  Similarly for comics.<p>Geeks have below average ability to conform with social norms and expectations.  That's pretty much a definition of a geek.  Therefore, a geek is more likely to enjoy a good novel which belongs to a genre without prestige.  A person more receptive towards social expectations may be repelled from the same novel because they're aware of the lack of respect associated with the genre.",1261111680.0

The entire point of this policy is to stimulate business by encouraging spending, make credit more attractive because the value of debt loses value over time due to inflation, and discourage saving.  As consumers spend more, businesses make more, sending signals to the job market that getting into business and getting an MBA is a really good idea because you make more money.  So that's exactly what people have done.  Now that the American consumer is tapped out, broke, and unable to take on any more credit, obviously businesses are going to do poorly because their goods aren't being purchased, and they certainly can't afford to hire any more expensive MBAs.  Do you agree?<p>A growing and productive world workforce does lead to additional production/wealth creation, and I do think this is conducive to business, but I don't think it's the significant factor explaining the current glut in the job market for people with MBAs in the United States.<p>The population in China is still expanding, workforce is growing, and GDP is still booming, so if this were the driving force fueling the demand for MBAs from America then that demand should still be there.",1261110273.0

It includes arms manufacturing, ore processing, and even illegal niche industries like child prostitution. It can do these things in addition to maintaining and operating a fleet of sophisticated spacecraft, running intensive military operations, and feeding, clothing, and sheltering everyone. It usually feels more like a population of half a million than 38,000.<p>But some of the episodes feature shortages of labor or resources, and I like it when this happens. It seems more real.
