So they'll call their projects Blah.js.<p>It's also easier to remember JS libraries as Blah.js instead of having to worry that it's Blah.js or Blah.coffee.<p>Yes it is somewhat dishonest. But users of a lib or framework should not be reading its code in most circumstances. Otherwise it's crap API/documentation.<p>With CoffeeScript you can use the lib from JavaScript seamlessly. It is essentially Blah.js. If the lib was written in Ojb-J or ClojureScript that's another story. Then lib authors couldn't say it's Blah.js.<p>If you need to read coffee code as JS for some reason, compile it. If you need to submit a patch, doing it in CoffeeScript will indeed be a minor inconvenience. Not so for Clojure, Obj-J or whatever else will come along.<p>----\nAnd on another note. These languages compiling to JS are essentially causing fragmentation. If ClojureScript gets as popular as CoffeeScript is now it won't be pretty. I'll bet that CoffeeScript will reach critical mass at some point. The newest libs and tutorials will all be Coffee. JS.next should adopt as many features as possible or promote it as the new standard to stem the tide and make fragmentation less obvious.

I haven't really looked too deep into it but so far my ideal would be GitHub or Khan Academy.<p>Though to answer your question, I haven't spent any time actually <i>trying to get a job</i> even though my work was originally based on that premise.<p>I'm trying to make a go out of starting something of my own.

They took a chance and bet wrong. If you've been doing business long enough you would realize that a trusting relationship will not trump self interest. And any legal document doesn't mean anything if you don't have the resources to enforce it if the other side wants to get out of it.<p>""We are a company without the cash to try to enforce the NDA, and The Company knows it since they saw our financials during due diligence.""<p>So they knew they didn't have enough money to enforce the agreement and they knew the acquirer knew that but yet they thought that it wouldn't be possible to have that used against them? That's naive as well.<p>Additionlly, everyone is assuming that they did steal info and that is a proven fact. It is not a fact. As of the writing of the story nothing has been built and there is no violation. We don't know if the company that ""screwed them"" ever did anything at all or if there was any abuse. Even if this went to trial (assuming funds were available) there isn't enough info in the story to even begin to make a judgment on who is right here and who is wrong.  Companies always have disagreements and things get drawn out legally because each side thinks it is right. Nobody is looking to throw money out the window on clear cut legal cases. Two sides always see things differently.<p>When you say ""violating an NDA"" the NDA has not been violated. We have one side of a story.

Always.<p>Neither side gets a good deal with fixed-price contracts, no matter how nice they sound when you're thinking about throwing money at strangers.  The contractor has to always throw in a significant amount of 'padding' on a fixed-price contract to account for the unknown problem that occur in every project.<p>The number one goal of a contractor: never, ever get stuck in a situation where you're working unbillable hours.  So under-bidding a fixed-price is a big no.  Which means over-bidding is required.<p>With fixed-price, we will also demand that the whole contract be renegotiated if anything changes.  <i>Anything</i>.  Oh, oops, you want one extra quick little feature that should only take a few hours?  Fine, but the contract is being rewritten to include it and we're all going through the trouble of formalizing it.<p>Paying hourly is frightening when you don't know who you're hiring, but that's where a NTE comes in.  We still do the schedule estimation that we would do with a fixed-price contract.  We give you that as the estimate, and something like 1.5x that as the not-to-exceed price.  We bill hourly, and you stop paying when the project is done.  Often that is before the original estimate, and you save money.  If we hit a snag, or if you decide to add a few small things, it can be handled smoothly without changing the contract.  You can elect for a higher NTE, if you trust the contractor, and get more room for 'agile' development.<p>You define 'finished' extremely specifically, up-front, before letting them start.  If you don't know what 'finished' is for your own project, there's something wrong, and you need to think about it harder.  All software and documentation, delivery format, media, copyright assignment, etc should be specified.<p>Here's something that absolutely, <i>absolutely</i> critical: define at least a few milestones, at least one a week for the first month, and make sure you get them and verify they work.  If their output looks good and they've been professional for the first month, you can let the frequency fall off if you wish.

Commit against this branch all you want. Then when you are done with your work, return to the main branch and do a ""git merge -squash <yourworkbranch>"". git will pull all the commits you did in the feature branch into the main branch's index. You are then free to commit the whole shebang into the main branch as one commit, with whatever commit message you want.<p>I've never used Mercurial, so I don't know if it has any equivalent to that.",1330401712.0
