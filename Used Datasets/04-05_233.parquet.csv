It's not a commodity like gold - is is pure fiat money, fully based on trust<p>That's what most currencies are today - symbols fully based on trust.<p>> In fact, by reducing friction, making transaction costs almost negligible, it will help this very thing!<p>What friction are you referring to?<p>> The only real problem is for governments, who won't be able to use the seignorage tax anymore, ie inflation, ie printing money out of thin air at the detriment of currency owners, to coerce people to do things or lose money.<p>There are a finite number of Bitcoins (21 million total), so yes, that would be one way to look at it.  However, that would also lead to rampant deflation, which was associated with the Great Depression - rampant unemployment, social unrest, slow growth, etc.<p>Or, put another way, the governments currently prefer (out of the lessons of history) encouragement of investment, full employment, and growth ... over the rentiers (i.e. dead stock) sitting on their money,  and letting everyone get poorer.<p>You seem also to be contradicting yourself, as easier you suggest:<p>> There is nothing inherent to bitcoin that may hamper a ""country to convert a great part of this dead stock into active and productive stock"".<p>Yet its finite nature actually does encourage dead stock -- rich holders sitting on piles of cash instead of using it for productive purposes.<p>> Bitcoin is a game changer, the end of a tyranny - the use of force to make people work, instead of being able to live with what they have without the fear that the government will decide to reduce the purchasing power of what one owns by 20% overnight, through inflation or plain just stealing (as in Cyprus) to ""transfer that wealth"", reverse Robin Hood style, to their well connected and too big to fall fat-cat friends.<p>Right, Bitcoin is far superior as it merely ensures that the current fat cats get fatter and skinny cats die of starvation due to deflation.",1365828846.0

Did not accomplish anything.

Total costs end up being something like 1 percent instead of 3-5 percent. And the exchange rate typically ends up being better too.<p>So I am bullish on bitcoin, although I think it will be less a currency than an asset store for many early adopters. The way to deal with volatility if you are worried about market fluctuations is simply to buy and sell on multiple exchanges simultaneously, ideally holding a small float so the exchanges are near-simultaneous and you aren't exposed to downside risk.<p>On a side note, I pay for server hosting using a credit card now and am interested in saving the 3 percent VISA fee, since that adds up to almost a thousand dollars a year at this point. So if anyone can recommend a professional server colocation and leasing company that accepts bitcoin and is based in California (ideally the Wilshire facility) I would be interested in hearing about your experiences. Please note that I'm not looking for shared hosting or VPS provision -- I need to lease actual hardware.",1365827805.0

Due to its nature, the project obviously would not conflict with my business unit or any business unit within the company.  Approval should have been a 5 minute conversation with my manager.<p>Instead, I had to write up a proposal for the open source review board.  After a week or so, they agreed it was acceptable.  The next step was to fill out a form and get a VP to manually sign it.  This took a bit of time since the VP is 4 levels up and was, unsurprisingly, out of the country.<p>That experience will affect my next job search.",1365825627.0
