I'm putting together a hobby-project website with a lot of SVG images and have been thinking of looking into PhantomJS to generate pngs or gifs for browsers where svg isn't supported (preemptively in case this sounds stupid: that's way down the road, so I don't know if what I'm describing makes sense).  I read your post and thought that I would be completely happy to spend a dollar or two a month (expected non-svg traffic is basically zero, but I'd like to support twitter cards) to support your project and generate the images on the fly using your service as a CGI, but 1) the pricing convinced me that the answer is ""no"" and 2) I'm no closer to knowing if what I want makes sense.<p>A few tutorials on how to do various tasks with your service would help a lot too (beyond the one-liners).",1363496388.0

4,5388193,comment,5385235.0,5385905.0,1,0,barry-cotter,,,"Your impression is pretty accurate. Professional schools like business, social work, education or law do a weird mix of vocational courses and cross-disciplinary/applied work. The post you're responding to sounds more like behavioural eceonomics than sociology to me (it's the ultimatum game or a similar one) but you could do very similar research in psychology or in anthropology doing cross cultural comparisions of how people play this game. It has been and is being done.<p>I'm not familiar with accounting research but my impression is that there's quite a lot of overlap with some areas of microeconomics. After all, accounting is either about modelling and prediction or about accurate reporting and analysis if it's not to be book keeping.<p>Sometimes the cross-disciplinary/applied thing just means that garbage is published by people who aren't familiar with research in another field that covered the same ground decades before. The worst though is when something is researched, disproved and they keep on teaching it in these professional schools for reasons of ideology or politics. Stuff like Howard Gardner's multiple intelligences is still taught in Ed schools and researchers like Linda Gottfredson have to deal with witch hunts because they do work worthy of a real psychology department while in an Ed school.

Protecting and backing up your data against hardware failure is a big part of what I want this software to do, but it is not a drop in replacement for mathematical/scientific cluster computing solutions at all. It is more about backing up static data, providing multiple working environments at once, and allowing data to flow between machines in arbitrarily complex ways.<p>I think this software is very interesting and does have real world uses, but it would need work to turn it into a math/science tool, and in general Plan 9 has a much smaller ecosystem built around these things.

42,5388153,comment,5387504.0,5388101.0,12,0,gruseom,,,"To me the word ""tax"" includes some expectation that the funds be used (however imperfectly) for the public good. But the bailout-and-austerity regimen seems to be about protecting financial institutions at common people's expense. For example, it wasn't the Greek people being bailed out, but rather the banks who lent to Greece. Yet we don't hear about that, we hear about irresponsible Greek bus drivers and the like. (As a side point, such fanning of nationalistic flames has served its diversionary purpose well in this case, but is really playing with fire.)<p>It seems to me the bottom line is clearly: are the bondholders of insolvent institutions expected to take a hit as well? If the answer is no, as it mostly has been throughout this crisis, that's ""heads I win tails you lose""  rotten both morally and from a market point of view. The bondholders in this latest case are not touched at all, according to <a href=""http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2013/03/17/cyprus-stability-levy-another-sad-euphemism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2013/03/17/cyprus-stability-levy-a...</a>.<p>(You make a good point that this surprise tax isn't the worst way they could do it, but that's what makes it so puzzling politically. The way they're doing it is so naked, so brazen, that it's bound to cause a larger backlash. Everyone can understand someone reaching into their bank account and taking a fistful; that's political poison. Why didn't they find a worse way (if need be) to do it, cloak it in complexity, and exempt the poorest citizens to mitigate criticism? Something along those lines would be standard political practice, and it's puzzling why they didn't do it in this case. Is it simply that Cyprus doesn't matter?

77,5388116,comment,5387228.0,5387228.0,34,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"When a sovereign fails, its banks fail, and private sector losses are virtually assured. The question is who bears the burden. Roughly half the deposits in Cypriot banks, with assets five times its GDP, are of Russian, Greek, or British origin [1]. They were attracted by high deposit rates (roughly double EMU average) and a system tolerant of likely tax evaders.<p>>""<i>This whole thing is entirely unfair for the people living in Cyprus. The average citizen had nothing to do with the banking sector stocking up on Greek debt, but now they have to pay for it.</i>""<p>Foreign deposits are flighty. The loan-for-austerity solution is too slow. The Cypriot financial minister has already noted ""substantial outflows"" from banks over the past few weeks [2]. Announcing a future tax would leave the burden exclusively on ordinary Cypriot depositors. This measure was intended to help the Cypriots, not burn them.<p>Further, the mark-downs on Greek debt is a proximal, but not the root, cause of the problem. The IMF warned Cyprus in 2011 to raise capital levels, potentially by slashing deposit rates - it did not. Ratings agencies chimed in, in 2012, that private sector losses would result if Cyprus did not increase contributions to bank capital. Complicating the situation is that 15-20 percent of Russian bank capital and nearly 10 percent of Russian corporate deposits sit in Cyprus - there was probably external pressure to keep the banks leveraged.<p>Pre-crisis, Cyprus stood out for its high growth (almost 4%) and low unemployment (low of 3.6% in 2008), despite a falling savings rate, rising labour costs, and a red hot real estate market following its accession into the eurozone in 2004 [3]. Today, we have a zero growth economy with a banking crisis that would have tipped its debt/GDP from 87% to 145%.<p>Cyprus needs a capital injection equal to half of GDP. This was never going to be painless.<p>>""<i>So what do investors, businesses, and savvy savers do? They pull their money from banks in the troubled euro countries. No need to take the risk, even if its small.</i>""<p>This is unlikely - the EU banking environment is already highly re-patrimonialised. Non-financial corporate and high net worth deposits have already fled to the degree that they can. Domestic depositors are, for better or worse, less flighty (and savvy) than senior bank debt investors - hence the logic for preserving their latter at the expense of the former. Also Cypriot banks have very little senior bank debt (0.3% of assets for Laiki [4]). This is cruel, yes, and I sound with <i>The Economist's</i> criticism of the tax levied on minor accounts (those holding less than 100 000). But forced de-leveraging will be cruel.<p>Given the political constraints from Deutschland limiting the ability of the European Central Bank to launch into Fed-style monetary base expansion and its Landesbanks preventing euro-wide deposit insurance, the bank regulatory constraints imposed by a country relying on flighty deposits for financial stability, and the economic constraints of a highly-indebted nation in the middle of a geopolitical brouhaha between Greece, Turkey, and Russia slated for near zero growth in the near future, this is not a terrible deal. Note that Iceland, which was in a similar position in 2007, saw its economy crater by nearly 1/3 from 2007 to 2011, or about 9% annually. Peak (2007) to trough (2009), 3/5.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/03/13/russias-cyprus-problem/",

I went through a lot of shit trying to set it up (this is phantomjs v1.3 i am talking about - mainly xvfb - which kept sending shitty screenshots). I am pretty sure you have a good market out there.<p>My suggestions:\n1. Change your name - since you are doing a hosted phantomjs browser as a service, try to have either the word phantom or browser in your name.\n2. Change your design - Go with bootstrap-based template for SaaS apps.\n3. Too much content on your page. Cut them down.\n4. Spin off couple of specialized tasks as separate services - screenshot capture and web scraping.\n5. Quite a bunch of phantomjs and casper.js user groups/mailing lists. Actively participate in them.<p>Good luck!",1363492905.0
