4,4389972,comment,4388056.0,4389431.0,2,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"At least as of a few years ago, the rate of death per skydive had remained largely constant for years.  What changed drastically was that people died from injuries sustained after a successful canopy deployment.  Concurrent with Cypres's adoption was the emergence of high performance canopies.  With large, ""boring"" canopies, it would be hard to kill oneself if already under a good canopy above cornfields.  However, small, high-performance canopies provided thrilling swoops toward the ground along with long plane-outs.  Half the fun of the skydive now could be had during the landing.  With this fun came the risk of a poorly executed turn slamming a person into the ground hard enough to kill him.  So, having achieved greater safety in the air, perhaps skydivers adopted add-on risks?  The other factor which probably reduced deaths due to low deployments was the widespread adoption of larger aircraft which could quickly take large groups of jumpers to 15K ft.  When one's only option for skydiving was to ride for 20+ minutes in a Cesna 182 to 10K, he wanted to maximize his airtime and might deploy somewhat low.  However, the extra time in the air isn't so significant if one can exit 5K higher after a mere 10 minute ride.  Deploying higher means extra time to cut away a malfunctioning main canopy and deploy a reserve parachute.<p>tl;dr; Skydivers traded increased safety levels for newly-found risks.",1345093115.0

24,4389951,comment,4389691.0,4389806.0,2,0,Danieru,,,Over the past four months I wrote a library in C. In said library exists the following chain:<p>typedef hidden pointer -> object -> dictionary  -> attribute object -> linked list -> object<p>Then the whole thing can start again from the last object. At both the linked list and dictionary points the pointers have been cast to void. During development there was linked list in place of the dictionary. Since this was before I wrote output debuging involved manually walking the two linked lists.<p>Else where a function takes a void * array of structs yet needs to access the contents and thus requires a pointer to an accessor function.<p>I love C but it can get <i>confusing</i>.

The C language doesn't define references like C++ does (as another name for an object). In C, references are much informal (the conceptual definition is used; as in a means to access something else).<p>I am going to be honest with you, I read the beginning. Found it strange, then looked at the topics. Saw you had a ""pointers and arrays"" section. Read it (it's the part where people get confused more). You seem to make the same mistakes. I didn't read the rest.<p>These are not minor problems, IMO.<p>Here is a quote from the pointers and arrays section:<p>""Imagine an array variable like a pointer that cannot be changed that holds the memory address of the first element of the array it points to. Even though the array variable holds a memory address, you cannot assign a pointer variable to an array variable, even if the pointer variable actually points to the same or a different array. You also cannot assign one array variable to another.""<p>Arrays are not pointers. And they don't hold memory addresses. An array is a continuous block of memory holding as many objects as you specified, all of the same type. You should explain ""value context"" and ""object context"" and tell people that when an array name is used in a value context, the value you get is a pointer to its first element. This is not due to ""arrays are pointers"" or ""arrays hold pointers"". Arrays are not pointers; and they only hold pointers if the element type is of a pointer type (however, in this case, the pointer(s) is(are) its element(s)).<p>You should explain what it means ""arrays values are pointers to their first elements"", and focus on ""value"". If you take the sizeof operator or the address of operator, they operate on object context (not on value context), then you will ""reveal"" the ""true nature"" of the array.<p>To really be able to explain pointers, you should explain other things first. Which is very hard to do in a small blog post. I suggest you make a series of posts; and try to make then correct, w/o getting bogged down with definitions of C terminology (which idk how to avoid). Terminology such as lvalue, rvalue, name, value context, object context, value of something, object, identifier (in C, identifiers and names are 2 different terms), and some others.<p>Out of curiosity... Can I ask you why you're posting about C?",1345091402.0

Combining the two allowed me to build complex deployment strategies, and then with a few clicks launch a complex invasion. It really did a lot for advancing RTS gaming.",1345089852.0

I was ""officially"" hired to work on the mobile web team which I quickly found out consisted only of me: the college intern.<p>I actually ended up working on a completely different project but I had to periodically build a useless calculator using jQuery Mobile in the corporate colors and present it to our completely useless VP of IT.<p>He had sold the company's leadership on the absolute necessity of a mobile presence, that this effort needed to be completed post-haste and how it would dramatically increase sales (most of the company's business was selling insurance to other financial firms, almost no consumer products in their portfolio).<p>In my first meeting with him he told me he wanted ""MSN Mobile for an insurance company"" and offered no other instruction.  He literally pulled up m.msn.com on his iPhone and said to make a version of that as their mobile presence.  After that meeting I just hid in my cube and laughed for a few minutes. That was when I realized what a farce this effort was.<p>Basically the entire development team knew how pointless this was but the VP had sold it to the rest of the execs and now they needed to build it. No one wanted to put in the effort.  The created the internship position so they could foist the actual coding off to an unsuspecting college student (me) while actually having him work on an unrelated but useful project.<p>Didn't learn much about coding (VB.NET, ugh) but the experience in how a bad company works?
