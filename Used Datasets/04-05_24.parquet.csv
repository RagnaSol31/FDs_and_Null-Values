It seems redundant.<p>However, I'm aware that there are sometimes more than one city that corresponds to a single zip code. Apple's checkout page has an interesting solution: when you type in the zip code, they perform an AJAX lookup, and show you the city state if it's not ambiguous, or give you a drop down if it is (see: http://www.lukew.com/ff/content/apple_checkout_zip.gif).<p>Has anyone built something like this?

Note this is coming from a person who is reading techcrunch for the first time and does not follow the tech industry at all.<p>After her comment, i did a filter on all arrington's articles and i understood what she was saying right away.

Most people would be unwilling to accept a performance downgrade.<p>I could see the MacBook Air line and other consumer products going in that direction, but certainly not the MacBook Pros or the Mac Pro desktop for that matter. These products are targeted towards serious professionals who need performance. The notion of ARM chips in a workstation computer is laughable for the near future.<p>There's pretty much zero chance ARM will ever reach performance parity with x86. Not to mention Intel's near two year process technology lead over everyone else.<p>The only scenario I see something like this happening is far in the future, when everything transitions towards the cloud and thin clients.

The way in which janitors are singled out as not having the same level of expectations to accomplish their tasks as a VP or any other position. I was a janitor for my high school, and I can tell you from my experience we busted our tails making sure the floors were swept and mopped and the all garbage was taken out on time every single day. Management had high expectations of us and refused excuses, which I respected them even more for. If you started slacking, you were out the door, period. Janitors are professionals too and I don't think it's professional to exemplify them as having inferior expectations or purpose compared to any other job.
