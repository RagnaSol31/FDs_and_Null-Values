3,618114,story,,,1,1,kineticac,"Ask HN: How do you define ""real-time""",,"How exactly do you define ""real-time""?<p>Currently a lot of companies are coming out with a real-time label on some aspect of their service.  The trend seems to be:<p>1. Content they serve is now automatically updated without needing viewers to manually reload.\n2. Content is updated sooner and faster\n3. Slap a chat on it, call it real time.\n4. Put some twitter, facebook, openid, what have you and call it social real-time.<p>I see real-time as things happening at the exact moment, which is updated a bit faster than 10 seconds.  But you are real-time with what?  The server?  Everyone you follow on Twitter?  The key is to have someone on the other side to be real time with you.  That's interesting.<p>This comes in many forms, here are some I think are particularly important:\n1. Content you're interested in that people provide. (twitter.com updates, friendfeed, digg stories)\n2. Action sharing, such as screen sharing or browse sharing. (webex solutions, browseology.com)\n3. Information generated from a source that is time sensitive, not necessarily from the mass of people, but from a single entity. (big events like sporting events)<p>What's your definition?",1242795274

I do appreciate variety, but I'd prefer if there was less need to deviate. Radical and counter-intuitive ideas are harder to implement, and it's harder to find associates with those shared values. The point of deviating from the norm is that some normal ideas <i>hurt people</i> or <i>cause problems</i>. At least that's what I think. There is a genuine disagreement about the wisdom of some normal ideas, not just deviation for the sake of being a free spirit.<p>> If one partner decides that they're liable to ""chat someone up and accidentally have sex"" they should divorce/separate and carry on.<p>That's one option but there are lots of others. Richard Feynman made a game out of not cheating on Arline with tempting girls. He enjoyed the challenge. If you don't want to cheat, there are rational ways to accomplish that.<p>> I'm just appalled at an apparent justification of betrayal.<p>I think it's bad to betray people. I also think it's generally wise not to make promises that are hard to keep in the first place. One reason is this reduces the number of betrayals that take place. Another reason is that it's hard to predict the future and predict what you will want in the future.",1242793198

Nirvana was popular; ergo, their music couldn't be very good. Those sellouts!<p>But, more charitably, it might be that certain book lovers really cherish reading, which is quite distinct from being read to. Someone once said that that the secret to books, as a medium, is that they give you the illusion that you and the author are sharing a private experience. You're alone in your own little space, concentrating and free from distraction, along with someone who has never met you, who might be hundreds or even thousands of years dead, but who is nevertheless speaking to you one to one. Even the person sitting across from you has no idea what you and the author are sharing as you read. And even if you read something as mind-blowingly popular as, say, Pratchett or Wodehouse or Gaiman or Rowling, there are still going to be moments where it will feel as if the author is sharing a private joke directly with you. The medium does that.<p>I suspect that audio books break that illusion for many people. Suddenly a reader, a bunch of Audible.com sound engineers, whoever happens to be within earshot of your car radio, and a potentially huge number of visual distractions (such as cars rolling by on the highway) are packed into that imaginary space along with you and the author. It's kind of like the difference between a quiet dinner for two and your junior prom. This explains why it's often a good selling point to have an audio book read by the author, despite the fact that most authors do not have years of experience as professional book readers. Hearing a book read by its author helps to preserve the illusion of intimate conversation.<p>Though I suspect that the rise of personal media devices -- for personal listening, home recording, and cheap distribution -- are changing the feel of the listening experience. Back in the early days of TV, watching TV probably felt like going to a show -- people did it in groups, with families or in bars, and even the shows on TV were based on vaudeville, theater, and big public events like wrestling matches and baseball games. But in the era of YouTube, you can have a video-watching experience that feels much more intimate, although perhaps never quite as intimate as silent reading.<p>I have to admit that I've liked the few audio books that I've listened to, but I don't seek them out. Given the option, I'd rather read.",1242792058
