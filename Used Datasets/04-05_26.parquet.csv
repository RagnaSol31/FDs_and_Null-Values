There are other car companies these suppliers can sell to. Of course there will be disruption, and probably some job losses, but not the whole 2-million-person industry (to use the industry number). And if some of those jobs do disappear, maybe it's because demand for the product no longer supports them.<p>I know my perspective is different on this, because I'm 25, and honestly cannot fathom a lifetime with one company. My career will be a couple years here and there, and most likely I'll have more than one career as well. So it is alien to me that anyone wants to protect (or even prefers) this idea of having a single job, at a single employer, for life. Why is it so terrible that someone might have to find a new job or that a town might die out?<p>That said, I'm not unfeeling about this issue. I realize these are real lives here (my dad is a GM retiree).
