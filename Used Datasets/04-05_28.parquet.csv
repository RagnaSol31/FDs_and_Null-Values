With a country which has had very low capital investment (later growth models separated capital and technology), you will see very high growth rates, which will experience diminishing marginal returns as additional investment is made.<p>Ultimately, you will return to the point where investment in capital, labor or technology have equal returns to each other, so all must be invested in. It is argued that this is where developed nations are today.",1247547567
2,703127,comment,702613.0,702613.0,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Communism set China back so much. The Cultural Revolution and one-child policy especially. This is a country with a tradition of great scientists, statesmen, inventors, engineers, traders, and so on - and they suppressed it all for... what exactly? Forced labor camps so that everyone is equal, except for the Party leaders who are more equal? If China had even a semblance of classical liberalism, human rights, and free trade, they'd probably be the strongest nation in the world. Lots of natural resources, a large population, strong family ties and loyalty, and an unreal work ethic.<p>That said, the one child policy hurt the country <i>a lot</i>. Countries where the old outnumber the young vastly tend to go in heavy decline, and that's going to bite China pretty hard in the coming years. Also, the male:female ratio is getting to a crazy point. Historically, wars break out when the men outnumber the women so much. I could see China fighting a pretty brutal war in Asia at some point in the next 30 years.<p>That's if there isn't a civil war first. They're built as a highly centralized empire where the Han Chinese have basically all the power, and the other groups - Xianjianese, Chen Chinese, Hong Kongese, Taiwanese, Macanese, and Tibetans all have no power and basically don't want to be part of China. Historically that produces civil wars. I think as soon as one of the areas pushes hard for independence, others will follow. It happened to the English, Spanish, French, and Dutch at various periods, happened to the Greeks and Romans, happened basically everywhere. The only way an empire holds itself together with diverse groups is through decentralization of power, and representation of all groups in the central government. To truly bond a nation, you need to mix blood and local groups so it's diverse. That means encouraging movement and mixing of people, but the Chinese are pretty outwardly racist (and it's not really seen as a bad thing there - there's not the same moral judgment about it was have in the West). Talking down and making racist jokes about people from lesser provinces or areas of China, and especially China's neighbors is par for the course. People do it at formal dinners and nobody really bats an eye unless the person goes too far with it.<p>I see China being a world power over the next 50-100 years, but they do have some bad things coming up on them: The male:female ratio imbalance, the old/young ratio, and the lack of representation under a powerful central government and oppression/conquest of minority groups and parts of the nation are going to be a problem. If China can liberalize (in the classical sense, not the modern - basic individual rights) and grant representation and bring the distant parts of their nation willing into the fold, they can probably weather the storm. Or who knows - perhaps the conquer parts of India or Russia, or find a pretense to ""stabilize"" North Korea after it starts falling apart, or invade Japan if it loses its status as an American protectorate (perhaps because the US goes bankrupt and needs to cut foreign military bases - improbable but possible).<p>Interesting to look at that part of the world. They have the potential to be the dominant world power and set the pace for the world, but they face a lot of problems. If they sort their house out and move away from Communism and the Party fast enough, the nation could have the influence over the next 50-100 years of the world that America has had over the last 50-100.",1247547559

Yup, only called ""z"". It turns out that someone was running a script looking for awstats vulnerabilities, managed to find my installation and installed ""z"".

I personally remember reading about a lot of more peaceful alternatives that ranged from not actually invading, to targeting Osama directly, to accepting offers by the Taliban to hand Bin Laden over to an international tribunal or neutral third-party country.<p>God knows how serious the last offer would have been (perhaps it was a stalling tactic), but it would have been easier to find the man that way - assuming locating Bin Laden was the actual point behind the invasion. Regardless of how things play out now, claiming there were not alternatives to invasion only excuses the poor judgment of those who backed the war in the first place. These people need to be kept as far from government as humanly possible, not excused for the ""inevitability"" of the Michael Bay approach to foreign policy.",1247546224

I've lost a pretty serious relationship as well because I became a very ""going through the motions"" kind of guy and basically stopped really caring about anything.<p>My advice is to get yourself a mind mapping tool (xmind is free) and name the center item ""Life"" and just put down everything in your life on there. I just did this and have branches for Projects, Work, School, Social, Personal, and Financial. Fill up the the whole thing with both where you are and where you want to be.<p>I have found that having everything objectively in front of me instead of floating around my head drastically improves my ability to line them up and evaluate everything for what it's worth. By having it all laid out in front of you, you can see what areas need attention and which ones can hold off for a while.<p>Also, ideas aren't a bad thing. I find myself drowning in new ideas, almost to an ADHD level of lack of focus. The best thing you can do is pick 2 or even 3 of the main ones you want to focus on and write down everything else. You don't want to forget your ideas but at the same time you don't want to lose focus, so keep a notebook full of everything you think of until you have time to go through it.<p>Bite sized chunks are really important too. I fell into a lot of financial troubles because I just stopped caring, stopped opening my bills, just overall gave up. If that's the case, go through your finances and find out exactly how much you need to live on, add a few hundred for just in case, and divide that by 20 to find out roughly what you need to be making on a normal work day to get by. That way you can see at a moment's notice if you're working enough or not.<p>Lastly, I kind of just started feeling really guilty about the way I was acting. It didn't take much for me to drop everything and head to the bars with friends, and that lack of self control greatly impeded my ability to get work done. I've since developed a bad taste in my mouth and am consciously working on making sure I don't screw around as much.<p>It's easy to be lazy man, it happens. You have to harness your willpower to pull yourself out of the rut. Start small, track everything, and improve upon yesterday always. You'll get there, it just takes active thought to make it happen. Good luck.<p>EDIT: I almost forgot a big part of fixing things. Make lists. For everything. Grocery Lists, todo lists, goal lists. Todo Lists are the most important thing to help with procrastination.<p>What's important to remember is to make everything on your todo list ""actionable"" (to borrow from GTD). so don't put ""build website for Greg""...instead put ""setup server, install CMS, mockup template, etc...you want individual, achievable items, so that you can both: see what needs to be done, and see what has been done.
