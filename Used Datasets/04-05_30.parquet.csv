I always figured it'd land in the $500 range, and this isn't too far off.<p>The real carrot for me was the idea of a prepaid $29/mo data only plan, which I actually thought was believable.  T-Mobile already offers pretty much the exact same plan ($1/day) for prepaid Sidekick users (voice is 0.15/min.)  I barely use voice (~100 minutes/mo), and if I could drop my unlimited text/internet/450 voice plan for something that was only $29, I could definitely learn to live with the quirks of VOIP on a mobile handset and the loss of MMS.<p>Honestly, even if you threw me in a contract to get the phone at $199, as long as data was that cheap I'd gladly sign up for two years the same minute I was sending Verizon their $350 good-bye letter.<p>I don't use my phone as a phone and am sick of having to pay so much for minutes I just don't use.

Bertrand Meyer's arguments are that it's of relatively little use, compared to the cost (i.e. the kind of complexity you're describing), that it can get in the way of multiple inheritance and that genericity is a better tool for the sort of thing overloading is often used for. There's a section in OOSC about it (then again, there's a section in OOSC about more or less everything).",1262146077.0

California is the 5th largest economy in the world and it generates tremendous revenues for the Federal government from businesses and individuals.<p>Also, your argument is self-contradictory since if you care about per-capita spending, California ranks very low in per-capita spending on DoD contracts.",1262145997.0

Californians however at an individual level are subject to the same federal tax rules as people in other states (and if they were poorer I'm sure the pendulum would swing the other way).<p>This being the case, it is even more remarkable the financial straits that California finds itself in.
