It's irrelevant how similar they sound to the English ear; you might as well argue that ""the"" is interchangeable with ""duh"".<p>Also, contrary to the GP, there's no difference in stress, which is on the first syllable in both words. The reason they're different words is that ""sh"" vs. ""ch"" is a phonemic distinction in Russian, just as it is in English. That's why we distinguish between ""sheep"" and ""cheep"", for example, and would regard it as bizarre to conflate them.",1272689912.0

I'm trying something different here. Deployment is definitely still important to me with babushka, but I'm trying to build a more general tool that makes it as fast and pleasant as possible to automate getting to some end goal.<p>And that's one of the other differences—babushka is goal-oriented, not task-oriented. Unless there's some specific incompatibility, you can install babushka on (for example) any Mac in any state with this<p><pre><code>    bash -c ""`curl -L babushka.me/up`""\n</code></pre>\nAnd then running this<p><pre><code>    babushka homebrew\n</code></pre>\nWill get you all set up with homebrew. But what it does is achieve the end goal of having homebrew set up—which might mean doing nothing, or cloning a git repo, or possibly just doing a `git reset --hard` to drop a binary in place. It depends on the system. The upshot though, is that if you're working on some other problem and a new colleague needs homebrew, you can run one command and you're done, instead of getting sidetracked for 15 minutes.<p>In focusing on that, I sacrifice usability in other areas—for example, right now there's not really any such thing as an unattended run using babushka, because most complex dep trees require user input at runtime. It's still very much a hands-on process. And that's cool with me—there are already tools out there that solve those problems, and solve them well.<p>I'm looking at working on deployment with babushka more with @glenmaddern, @dgoodlad and some other Melbourne hackers soon. But I'm very conscious of all the existing tools out there, and I'm a strong believer in deferring to the right tool for the job whenever possible. So I'm looking to integrate with existing tools where it makes sense, and solving old problems in novel and awesome ways whenever I can. :)",1272687740.0

51,1310086,comment,1309940.0,1310030.0,0,0,ben_h,,,"Hi, great questions.<p>Chef and puppet have a lot to offer. In particular, there are things that chef and puppet can do that babushka can't, like orchestrating ecosystems of multiple machines, and provisioning new hardware automatically.<p>Deployment is a problem that I'm very interested in, being a web developer and maintaining my own production machines, and I think babushka has a lot to offer in that area. However, I don't think of babushka as a deployment tool. I think of it as a ""remember what I researched or learned the first time"" tool, and part of that is deployment.<p>In building it, I'm aiming to build the most concise, powerful DSL I can for automating chores, and at focusing it as hard as I can towards the ""no job too small"" end of the scale.<p>My other main motivation is making babushka immediately useful and approachable, both as a user and a contributor—i.e. I want you to be running deps and seeing results within 2 minutes of discovering the app. And I want you to be able to write your own deps as easily and quickly as possible, push them to github with a single command, and have anyone else run or incorporate them into their own trees of deps equally easily. Most of that is already possible today using automatic dep sources, and the remainder I'm working on. :)<p>For example, Josh Bassett has been building a template for installing vim plugins: <a href=""http://github.com/nullobject/babushka-deps/blob/master/vim_plugins.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/nullobject/babushka-deps/blob/master/vim_p...</a> - which means you can automate the installation of your own plugins by writing a babushka dep like Josh's:<p><pre><code>    vim_plugin ""vim-cucumber"" do\n      source ""git://github.com/tpope/vim-cucumber.git""\n    end\n</code></pre>\nYou can run that dep with a single command, even if you've never used Josh's dep source before:<p><pre><code>    babushka nullobject/vim-cucumber\n</code></pre>\nAnd so on, to configure anything and everything you like. It's already doing this job, which I'm really excited about. <a href=""http://twitter.com/harvinius/status/13116470017"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/harvinius/status/13116470017</a><p>Similar things are already working well for textmate bundles, OS X app bundles and installer packages, git repos, and so on. The idea is that babushka is purely the engine (plus enough deps for it to install itself), and it should be as fast and pleasant as possible to not only write deps like the vim-cucumber one above, but to create new templates and make new tasks I've never thought of. You can extend the DSL using the DSL. :)<p>So — I have a lot of time for tools like chef, and probably have a lot to learn from them too. I'm building babushka to be complementary to those tools. For example, part of larger deployments is doing specific, more focused jobs at certain points, which is something that babushka is just right for.",1272686639.0

Continuations are similar, but allow longjmp-ing to the same point multiple times. As you might expect, this gives you a lot of flexibility in defining control constructs.<p>You can implement exceptions easily via continuations - pass along an alternative continuation to receive errors. Continuations are more <i>general</i> than exceptions, backtracking, co-routining, etc., but this generality can make them seem overly abstract - it can be hard to see what those constructs have in common.<p>Hey, and don't worry - I started with BASIC too. (I was five or six.) You gotta start somewhere. After you feel comfortable with continuations, try learning about unification. :)",1272686526.0
