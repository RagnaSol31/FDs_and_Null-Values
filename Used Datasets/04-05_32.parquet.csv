It's about keeping CODE free.<p>This is a perfectly legitimate move by Redhat.  It's unfortunate that they felt they needed to do this, but they are under no obligation to provide source code to anyone other than those to whom they distribute, and the GPL certainly doesn't force them to support anyone at all - they want to support paying customers.<p>It's not a move away from the spirit of the GPL in any way.",1299301186

Throw out some of the more useless things like PE, get rid of certain requirements like art, maybe take away a year or two of the ""read books most of the class doesn't care about and write essays hurriedly read over by the prof to later be never read again"" English classes.<p>Even just removing one required semester (half a year) of PE and one required semester of English (which shouldn't be very controversial) frees up two semesters, which for a high school level accommodates Calculus just fine. I'd love to see mathematical analysis courses taught at the high school level too (especially since many grown adults are under the impression math in general is like the algebra they did in high school) but that might be getting ahead of ourselves.<p>I also don't see why you can't teach number theory et al. throughout all the math courses.

A number of other articles re-hashed the same points described there, but I did find a few like [2], which also describe Iceland's connectivity -- it's far better than I'd thought.  As of a year ago, they had on the order of 8 tbps in undersea cables, stable ping times of around 100ms to the US (and, presumably to the EU, if not better), 100% geothermal power, and a climate that would enable passively cooled data centers.<p>I couldn't find anything directly relevant to whether access logs would be subpoena-able, but the reading I get from what I did find is that their focus is more on being a <i>transparency haven</i> than a privacy such. Whistleblowers, journalists, and their sources are clearly very well protected by the IMMI (which appears to have passed unanimously).  It's also, however, explicitly stated that the new law won't change anything in the current law WRT child pornography and copyright infringement, usually the big bugaboos of the ""we need to control the interwebs"" crowd. (Not to say those aren't problems; they just aren't the problems they're usually made out to be.)<p>So, net, I'm not sure Iceland's the answer to these kinds of shenanigans, but it's clearly a step in the right direction.<p>[1] <a href=""http://immi.is/?l=en&p=intro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://immi.is/?l=en&p=intro</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.technewsdaily.com/iceland-promoted-as-future-data-haven-0225/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technewsdaily.com/iceland-promoted-as-future-data...</a><p>(EDIT: fugly run-on sentence.)",1299301034

Both bots and browsers involve computers. However, as browsers can automate some tasks, and bots need human interaction at least to program them in the first place, there is a blurry line between bot and browser. CAPTCHAs try to force a certain amount of human interaction. The only reliable way to prevent human interaction between sending a request to and receiving a response from an unknown user agent is to require a response so fast as to preclude human intervention.",1299300974

All of these responses are exactly what I was looking for, and then some. As far as the phrasing, I'm equally interested in direct advice like ""read this paper"", and personal stories. I've always been able to intuit how to go about learning any given topic in computing, whether languages, game programming, HTTP, Win32, or what have you. I don't know exactly why this subject in particular seems more esoteric to me - probably a product of my background - but it does. I wanted to know how others learned. Before this thread, my best answer would have been ""Get a job at Amazon or Google as a front-end dev, and try to work my way into the back end."" Now I have papers to read, algorithms to learn, topics to explore, and ideas about setting up a toy environment for learning.

For example, when programming, I find it quite easy/fast to alt+1 to my browser for documentation, and alt+8 to go to my 8th workspace, where I usually have a couple terminals open with vim. Or sometimes I'm switching between those two and Gimp on workspace 6.<p>This doesn't really require XMonad, just having workspaces and quick shortcuts for moving through them is good enough. Most applications are easier to use when you give them the whole screen (at least smaller screens).

17,2290832,comment,2287980.0,2290227.0,0,0,chris_j,,,"> JAWS, in particular, is quite powerful, but pretty daunting to learn. Compounding the clunkiness of JAWS is that many apps and sites aren't built with screen reader usability in mind â€“ even if the developers made a good effort to ensure that it was possible to use their site in a screen reader, that all text was readable, etc, there's a huge difference between ""possible"" and ""easy"".<p>Seconded. I've done a bit of accessibility testing work with JAWS and was often frustrated by how unnecessarily difficult it was to use the software with a screen reader. You have to remember that it is probably uneconomical to make most software accessible and companies only do it because it is a requirement that software be accessible if you want to sell to certain governments (eg the USA). What this means is that development and testing is focussed on doing the bare minimum needed to pass a checklist, after which there isn't any need to do anything, regardless of whether the software is ""easy"" or merely ""possible"" to use.",1299300219

Now, I'm starting to rethink that, but not in a positive direction.  I think maybe Facebook may be cursed by it's valuation.<p>Right now, Facebook is like a developer-oriented gravy train.  They can work on cool features, do redesigns on a whim, play with heavy scale, and there's enough investment to keep it going in every which direction they want.<p>But profits aren't there, not on this level.  And remember that, for as indispensable as Facebook is, most people can survive without it, and the achilles heel of social networks is that the trickle of users leaving can quickly become a flood.  Myspace found this out, and they were twice as profitable, per user, as Facebook is (although they did have many problems that Facebook hasn't, terrible engineers being one of them).<p>What I'm wondering is, will the valuation force Facebook to make the kind of hard decisions they're putting off right now.  Are ads lucrative enough to appease the investors?  If not, where do they go?  Do they start heavy data mining?  Do they push the boundaries of privacy even further?<p>I'm starting to consider the fact that these astronomical valuations may end up contributing to Facebook's eventual demise by setting expectations that they cannot meet without fundamentally alienating their users.<p>We'll see.",1299297657
