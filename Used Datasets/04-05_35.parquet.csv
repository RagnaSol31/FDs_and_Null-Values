13,4170386,comment,4167862.0,4169304.0,2,0,zanny,,,"The problem with this argument is that we don't have any more extreme strides in mobile performance in the next 5 years.  We already have phones that can effectively run any intensity of ""eye candy"" with spiff - by the time such a policy came to market in 2 years, it would be 2014 - unless we have a revolution in tech that lets us crank up the ghz without dramatically increasing the voltage to match, any arm based device for Android will be able to run any degree of eye candy they can add in in the ""short term"".<p>Back in 2008, we could easily see that the 500mhz single core ARM chip was going to be short lived.  We had tremendous strides in performance available to us in just upping core clocks, and then we had the mobile multicore revolution.<p>We are done with both the main vein and the secondary digs of the mobile CPU goldmine (in reference to Herb here) and we are already pretty deep into heterogeneous computing.  Remote processing is next, when the telecom monopoly is torn down so we can get the data speeds we are actually capable of today without paying monopoly rates.<p>The hardware WILL get significantly better between 2014 and 2019 - a 2019 smartphone will almost assuredly be as powerful as the 2014 consoles that will be coming out for gaming - but we can actually predict that.  A 2014 console will have approximately a GCN 7850 graphics card and quad core 3.5 ghz cpu of some sort.  So expect the mobile chip of 2019 to operate at ~4ghz with some number of cores and a lot of compute nodes approximately equivalent to modern mainstream desktop graphics at similar wattages to what we have now.<p>If the version of Android in 2019 can't run on an Android device of 2014, then that isn't the hardware not keeping up with software - that is just terrible design.  Just like how desktop hardware peaked in 2006, mobile hardware will peak soon as well, after which performance is ""good enough"" for average joe consumer, and the UX won't change.<p>Another good example is how Google can keep pumping out new versions of Chrome without hesitation that the last version's user can run the new version.  The browser is not getting exponentially more power or resource hungry, and in many ways they optimize its performance as much as they sacrifice it each release for better experience (of course things like webgl are pressuring browsers upwards with new usage in an environment without resource contraints) but the basic device, or in this case application, is not growing more and more computationally intensive by large jumps each release, or they would not be able to push out silent updates like they do.<p>Same thing with Android.  Once it plateaus, there is no excuse not to use the silent continuous always backwards compatble update model, because the device is now ""good enough"".  Just like how a dual core 3ghz pc from 2005 with 4gb of ram is still good enough today for 95% of use cases.",1340859098

The cost of living is getting too high, while salaries for many industries are falling too low.<p>This gut feeling first appeared in me when I saw GM renegotiate pension plans with its retirees.  If even defined benefit pensions can be renegotiated, what is the actual rate of return on those suckers?  Is it enough for anything?  And it's not like I trust mutual funds, housing, or anything else to be much better anymore.<p>So I come to the conclusion that lifelong work will become a necessity for most.

21,4170378,comment,4169356.0,4170345.0,3,0,commieneko,,,"My point is not that artists shouldn't learn about color and learn color theories. And I'm not saying that they shouldn't learn how human's see and process information. What I'm saying is that they already do that. But they are doing it with different models and techniques that are keyed to their domain and tools.<p>Sure, learn about RGB/CMY. It doesn't hurt. And printing technology, which is a <i>different domain</i> is very similar, though not the same in critical areas.<p>There's nothing magic or even very special about the methods and models you are talking about outside their domain of use.<p>If you are a designer who is working in print or onscreen display, you will learn to think in RGB/CMY(K). But there's <i>nothing</i> universal or special about that system compared to other systems. It's not more <i>science</i> compared to the systems artists use in their various working practices.<p>It's <i>not</i> more keyed to human physiology, in fact I'd argue that it is less intuitive and useful. I'll agree that it's not a numeric model and it's not a model designed for <i>accuracy</i>; and reproducibility. But it <i>is</i> a model tightly coupled with human perception, expression, and communication.<p>(As a designer working with digital imagery and renderings, I make major use of HSB style color models.  I've written many special purpose tools for giving me effects I want, using all kinds of hair brained models, and then converting the results into RGB.)<p>To create a numeric model of how artists use color would be very difficult.  If it weren't we'd be able to make cameras that made illustrations. And we can't and don't.<p>What an artist does is make an observation, and I mean this in both an abstract and practical sense. He or she then takes that observation and creates an abstraction of it, and then tries to make a work that communicates that abstraction.  With the tools and mental model at hand.<p>There's a photo floating on Reddit right now of where a hair stylist has arranged hair clippings found on the floor in the shape of a dog. It's a wonderful piece of throwaway art.  Now you could sit down and say, ""If I take these hairs and arrange them with these percentages, I'll be able to get this range of colors and represent these textures ...""<p>But that's silly. The artist sees the hair, it reminds them of something, like a dog, and they spontaneously arrange them, making corrections and following intuition as they go.<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/ZNmxV.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/ZNmxV.jpg</a><p>Now if you are going to start an artistic tradition of arranging hair clippings for art, you might come up with some theories to model different effects. But I don't think you are going to be making numeric models. For one thing you never know what kinds of hairs you are going to find on the floor. Instead you are going to learn to ""fake"" it by using the relative and comparative artifacts of the human's visual and perceptual system. But it will almost certainly be intuitive and spontaneous. Lots of trial and error.<p>If this art form becomes a tradition, then special markets will develop in hair clippings, special dealers selling hair patches arranged nicely in special ways, maybe even a bit like RGB/CMY. (But don't push it.) Hair dyeing might become a specialty, but purists will insist on nature hair and natural hair colors. There will be much arguing about it and many bar fights.<p>And if you decide that there's a market in selling hair floor arrangements in mass quantities, then you might see something akin to what you see in modern printing or broadcast.  Specialists will arise.<p>And most artists will say, ""It's hard enough to make a pile of dog hair look like something interesting while worrying about all that. I'll make a good pile of hair and leave it up to the specialists to mass produce it. Maybe I'll use standard hair patches to make things easier, I do like it when the reproduction is well done. But I hate limiting my choices and opportunities, and besides the reproduced hair piles never look as good as the original anyway.  After all, it's just a copy.""",1340858765

Ultimately the only way to learn is to make visual art and look at it, a whole heck of a lot. But having theoretical models can help guide that thinking and looking, and can forestall a lot of confusion.<p>There are two kinds of models an artist needs to learn to deal with color:<p>(1) How the human eye sees color. This is so that texture and shape can be made to convey the desired effect of the picture. Its helpful to learn about simultaneous contrast, adaptation effects, and even more obscure things like Ralph Evans (Kodak) theories about what he called brilliance. Learning this doesnt tell you how to mix the paint, but it helps you figure out what results you should aim for.<p>(2) Color reproduction technology: the physical properties of paint / displays / printers / whatever.<p>Many people in the general public, including many artists, dont properly understand the distinction between (1) and (2), and also take the radically oversimple concept of primary and secondary colors, etc. (whether its elementary school teachers with their red, yellow, blue, or programmers with their sRGB) as some kind of ultimate truth.<p>All of our models of color are approximations.
