The only reason, ever, to make an investment with leverage is if there is some arbitrage opportunity that requires a large amount of capital to make money from.  But by definition, the <i>average person</i> is not going to be able to identify arbitrage opportunities in the housing market.<p>The real reasons to invest in housing are: a) diversification (so not everything is in bonds or stocks) b) excellent tax treatment c) excellent political protection d) interest rates that are often lower than the monetary inflation rate (by monetary inflation rate I mean growth in  M*V - nominal income growth).

Renting vs. buying is a very personal decision and has a lot more to do with lifestyle and personal choices than financial soundness. I bought my house in 2005 at almost the top of housing market in Florida. I paid $145k for my house and told everyone about how smart of a financial decision I was making. I've spent $15k in home improvements and my house is now worth $125k. Oops. However, my mortgage is still very low and I can easily afford it regardless of the current worth.<p>Now the question is, if I could see the future back in 2005, would I still buy this house? If all I could see was the housing crash of 2008-2009, then of course not. But if I could see the great times I've had in this house which includes absolute peace and quiet, friendly neighbors who don't change every other month, and the feeling of a little place by the beach to call my own, I would indeed buy this house. Buying a house has a lot more to do with making it a home than just a shelter for cheap.<p>Nobody knows the future. I could have rented this exact house and instead of benefiting in the long run, I could have ended up losing more money if rent prices skyrocketed.

(I disagree with the first sentence on philosophical/semantic grounds that aren't really relevant to your point.)<p>When I want to force others to share code that I have written, I will choose the GNU GPL or something very like it. If I don't care what others do with code, I will release it under a much less restrictive license.",1271563848.0

66,1274303,comment,1273131.0,1273723.0,0,0,halostatue,,,"Compared to the BSD-family of licences, the GNU GPL is less free, as it restricts what one entity can do with code granted by another. I'm not saying this is a <i>bad</i> thing; this is exactly what the GNU GPL is written to do: enforcing a share-and-share-alike ethos for a given set of code.<p>I do think that the rhetoric (including the ""four freedoms"") is nonsense that could be left by the wayside with no harm, and possibly even improve it. That's the part about the GNU GPL and the FSF that I can't stand: don't try to tell me that this is about freedom. Tell me that this is about building a base of code that requires share-and-share-alike behaviour and that you're doing it because you think it will produce a richer environment. I may not agree with you, but at least I'll respect your stance.<p>If I want to restrict others use of my software in a way that they have to grant others the exact same rights that I granted them in the first place, then I will happily pick the GNU GPL or some other license that achieves the same thing, because that's what I <i>want</i> in that case. If I don't want to restrict others use of my software in any way, I will pick something much less restrictive (such as the MIT or BSD licences). If I want something in-between, I will choose an in-between license like the MPL or the LGPL. But in no way will I pretend that my application of restrictions is increasing freedom. It's the restrictions I'm choosing for the software I'm writing. No more, no less.",1271563625.0
