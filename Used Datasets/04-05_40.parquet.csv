When you get a deflationary spiral, the shock to the economic system is sharp and sudden, and causes political/social unrest, economic upheaval, capital flight and sometimes horrendous wars.<p>Inflation on the other hand, in the long term, guarantees bifurcation of rich and poor (wealth disparity). The reason for this is fairly simple. The poor spend between 100 and 110 percent of their disposable income, and they spend it on consumption. The rich, on the other hand, invest at least 10 percent of their disposable income in some kind of asset, either fixed assets or financial assets. Assets can then be used as collateral against loans which are used to purchase more assets.
