Computer scientists have historically identified either as mathematicians (ah, the purity) or physicists (pretty good purity and much better government funding); but if you look at the kinds of problems we are trying to solve now (bunches of different aspects of the security problem, privacy, usability of pervasive computers, changing business models, e-voting) it seems pretty clear that the key issues relate to people and the way they communicate and organize themselves, rather than discovering the underlying physical laws of the universe -- in short, the domain of social sciences.'",1293339504.0

And you put Erlang between Python and C++ by verbosity, so I made my conclusions accordingly. \nAlso, synchronization and locking (with mutexes) are not the only approach to parallelization in C++. You can immutable objects, futures and other high level concepts. But Erlang has to be really nice for the stuff it was designed for, I have no doubts about that.",1293336815.0

This wasn't because I had number-memorizing superpowers, it was because I was a geek and I spent time memorizing numbers. If you look at interviews with top competitive mnemonists, you find very few who claim to have (let alone actually have) any sort of ""photographic memory"" or even autistic savantisms. It's just a mundane subject with strategies and tricks. People don't close their eyes and see numbers, they break them up into convenient chunks, look for symmetries and patterns, and memorize them.<p>You can't underestimate what people can accomplish when they have severe abnormalities in their interests. Calendar-counting to compute days of the week is not hard. Weather patterns are easily mentally compressible, with natural chunking points from the seasons. Most people's work schedules are highly regular, so it's easy to break weeks into patterns and exceptions. And so on. Everything that's demonstrated in this article is well within the realm of feasibility for a sufficiently dedicated person without superpowers.",1293336272.0

I think Hofstadter's GEB is one of the crucial modern texts that inspired a lot of people in that direction. Translating these concepts into rigorous theories is difficult; attempts like Wolfram's ""A New Kind of Science"" haven't succeeded in creating a new discipline.<p>I think the deepest explanations for the layering of complex structures at multiple scales we see in the universe are being developed at the intersection of the theory of computation and quantum physics. There is a very tight coupling of entropy and information at the quantum scale, as demonstrated by physicists like the amazing W.H. Zurek. The development of quantum computers and work on the P/NP equivalency problem is where I hope to see the long-awaited breakthroughs that may enable us to understand just how math, mind, and physics are intertwined.",1293336255.0
