The administrators are responsible for ensuring that the students at the school are safe.  Given the existence of bullies and the inability of the school to hire enough administrators to be everywhere at once, they need some other method for keeping students safe.  Here are a few options:<p>1) Find some way to convince bullies to stop bullying and realize how stupid they are.<p>2) Cameras everywhere and punish people for beating up other kids.<p>3) Find out what provokes bullies and prevent that from happening.<p>4) Do nothing.<p>",

The naive (and elegant) solution to the problem consists of a 20-line recursive function which took me about an hour to write. Unfortunately function calls are very expensive in Python, and I my sim required a couple billion of them, so I started searching for ways to eliminate the recursion. 3 weeks and a deep foray into Numpy later and I had it.<p>The second implementation is about the same length and replaces all of the simplicity of the recursive solution with a bunch of five-dimensional arrays. Never before did I have to think as deeply about vectorized functions, array broadcasting, dimension matching, etc. The non-recursive version is about an order of magnitude faster, and what's better, using the numpy operators means nearly all of the processing is offloaded into low-level C routines, so the Python overhead is effectively nil. On the downside the code is extremely difficult to follow now... trying to visualize what's going on in 5 dimensions is a real pain.",1257914979.0

Don't you think these sort of blog posts could easily criticise it's consequences too? First, the same criticism of perverse incentives applies. It takes more compensation to motivate a person take a job if he already has $10k + $6h/hr.

The main problem is that government work programs would (by necessity) have to involve jobs that almost anyone is capable of performing, with minimal oversight required.

This process is not designed, and the welfare law has simply evolved into a giant mess over the course of many decades.<p>That said, politicians and policymakers are not idiots. They are simply controlled by events larger then themselves.  It's the incentives of the political system that are at fault.  ( See Government's End by Jonathan Rauch )<p><i>How do we subsidise to a minimal level without destroying incentive to work? It's not an easy question to answer.</i><p>Roll up all the welfare programs into one program - give every American over 21 a check for $10k a year.  For people without a job, give a guaranteed government job for $6 an hour.  For people who need hands on help, go back to relying on local charities and local government aid.  They are closer to the problem and have the right incentives to actually fix things (and empirically, the local welfare systems of the late 1800's worked far, far better than our national system today).",1257912520.0

The movie theater agrees to let them place a stand on the outside to promote product ""X"".<p>When you are about to go in, they tell you if you would like a free sample or something like that. If you agree all you have to do is give out your name and your mobile number and your home phone number. They make the process seem very standard.<p>Once you go inside the movie theater you are constantly reminded to either turn of your cell phone or to put it in silence or vibrator mode for the movie, most people do.<p>After the movie starts, the criminals, start calling to your house and tell anyone that picks up the phone, that they have kidnapped you (they know your name, what you look like, what you were wearing, who you were with, etc) and that the family has one hour to deliver an small amount of cash if they want the person to be released. Most of the time, the families call the ""victim"" but since they are in the movies, generally people don't pick up the phone. So the family immediately assumes the call is for real.<p>You would not believe the amount of people that have been scammed like that. Is truly amazing.",1257912418.0

It has amazing properties, he says. Tropical rain doesn't leach nutrients from terra preta fields; instead the soil, so to speak, fights back. Not far from Painted Rock Cave is a 300-acre area with a two-foot layer of terra preta quarried by locals for potting soil. The bottom third of the layer is never removed, workers there explain, because over time it will re-create the original soil layer in its initial thickness. The reason, scientists suspect, is that terra preta is generated by a special suite of microorganisms that resists depletion. ""Apparently,"" Woods and the Wisconsin geographer Joseph M. McCann argued in a presentation last summer, ""at some threshold level ... dark earth attains the capacity to perpetuate—even regenerate itself—thus behaving more like a living 'super'-organism than an inert material.""</i><p><i>[...] Not all Xingu cultures left behind this living earth, they discovered. But the ones that did generated it rapidly—suggesting to Woods that terra preta was created deliberately. In a process reminiscent of dropping microorganism-rich starter into plain dough to create sourdough bread, Amazonian peoples, he believes, inoculated bad soil with a transforming bacterial charge. [...]</i><p>Wikipedia has, of course, an article on terra preta: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta</a><p>Most interesting is modern attempts by scientists to effectively reverse-engineer the soil; using a combination of crude charcoal, organic compost, and microorganism cultures to convert poor soils into something approximating the robust, fertile terra preta.",1257912085.0
