If you do have ~10 people working, then your operating expenses are in the million range.<p>But let's use your Google example. We know that the search market is dominated by Google, followed by Yahoo and MSN. Who are the others?

They have 500-1000 employees. Huge costs there. I am ignoring Terra, and Daum.<p>I guess what I am trying to say is that even a 0.01% market share can make you profitable, or attractive enough to get bought. And depending on the market (I did ""cheat"" a little by picking the largest internet market possible, search), even a 0.01% share might cost you millions to get there.<p>These huge sums are raised pre-launch/build because they're essentially, bets. Educated bets at best, but still, bets. The thing is that the payoff (for the VCs) can be huge, so they gamble on dozens hoping that 3 or 4 will provide return.<p>It's not my cup of tea, btw. I am currently building my Micro-ISV and I am quite happy, aspiring at most a nice boat, perhaps a bigger house. But the VC world is a reality :)<p>It's like complaining about software patents. They SUCK. But the system is set up in a way that you need them. It's part of the rules. You can complain about it, but they're there.

It was a Spanish 3 class taught by an eldarly women, who reportedly had a stroke over the summer (which I attribute the entire incident to as I can only hope no sane person would do what she did.)<p>Anyway, she was not teaching the class. I would go in there and sit and she would mumble on in English about nothing in particular. After about three weeks of this, I got a bunch of students together and we all complained to the head of the Spanish Language department (large school, many spanish classes). He said okay, and he told the teacher he was going to observe the class.<p>Well, the day he observed was the first day she taught the class anything. Of course, it was the material we should of known after a month of Spanish 3 so everybody had trouble following.<p>This went on three or four times until midterm exams. For the midterm, we had a standardized spanish test. Since he hadn't taught us anything, except when being observed, students knew nothing. I studied my butt off but that didn't matter. She stood in front of the class and read all the answers from the test.<p>I complained to the school and they had a huge investigation, and basically thought I lied about the whole thing. Why would a teacher give the entire class the answers? The real part that gets me is that nobody had the integrity to come forward and complain. They had to discretely question students.<p>Long story short, truth came to light and she found out I was the one who reported her. She was not fired, but kept ""teaching"". For some insane reason, she started changing the answers on my tests and quizes so I started out scoring everybody by huge margins.<p>In the end, everybody who had her as a teacher failed the final for the class, but the school system changed all our grades to As in some weird sort of cover up.<p>She still teaches to this day, at a different school, however.",1233201970

But some things are worth dying for.<p>America is a land of hope and opportunity, we have been through a lot of challenges (like the Civil War) and survived, and I believe we can survive the onslaught of socialism.  The Principles of the Constitution will survive (eventually), even if our Representatives fail us, even if, for a season, the People fail.",1233201970

I don't understand why in this day and age we need to learn everything by heart, when in the real world everything is 1 search query away.""<p>I think this is exactly the problem.  When formula sheets are allowed it is reinforced that you need not learn the material, but instead just know that you'll be able to plug and chug.  Sure, you may be able to look it up later, but in class students should truly understand the material not simply know where to plug in which numbers.  However, if you truly know the material intuition and the ability to derive the formulas will give evidence that you truly understand the material.",1233201754

The Android OS itself feels about as solid and responsive as the iPhone OS (does that have a name, btw?) or pre-cellphone-era-Palm-OS. I have had very little experience with WinCE, Symbian or whatever the Blackberry uses, so I cannot compare there.<p>Android has real multi-tasking. I can't even begin to tell you how nice it is to be able to SSH into a server from my G1, switch to email or the web to check something, and then come back and my SSH session is still active. I couldn't do that on the Treo (no multitasking) and it annoyed me to no end.",1233201718

It was the one where he said the history of unions could completely understood by looking at web startups.  It was retarded.)<p>15 people for 100k/month would mean you are paying an average of 74k/year. Who would willingly work for a startup for that, without lots and lots of equity (answer: the exact people that you would never actually want to hire)? And you can't give lots of equity to 15 people, and even if you give them 8% each you would be left with nothing yourself.<p>$12k per month on rent? You would have to be retarded to pay that as a startup. Rent an old house and get lots of card tables.<p>Servers/bandwidth at 20k/month? What kind of site is this? That's $240k per year of bandwidth. If you are serving up that much content and aren't making a profit already, you are either going to get bought out in a few months or go under in a few months after that.<p>My hypothetical startup budget:<p>Salary: Pay myself enough to pay bills and live on, as well as 2 or 3 talented confederates (if I happen to have 2 or 3 talented people, with skills I need, on tap. Otherwise, wait until some are located before hiring anyone. Nobody is getting my equity unless they totally rock.) Estimate: 6k-25k per month.<p>Rent: $0, I happen to have an office large enough for 4 people to comfortably work in at my home. If I didn't, I would charge a one time expense of $2000 to put some carpet in the garage, install an AC out there, and run some wiring and so on.<p>Furniture, equipment, etc: $500. Find your nearest very large public university. They probably have a depot that just sells old furniture and equipment. You can drive up with a truck and get enough furniture to outfit a small army for under $500 (one time fee). <a href=""http://www.purchase.umd.edu/ttrader/items/showroom/index.htm.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.purchase.umd.edu/ttrader/items/showroom/index.htm...</a>.<p>Servers/bandwidth: This obviously depends on what site you are making. A Youtube needs way way more bandwidth/servers/rackspace than a yelp for the same size audience. Using EC2 as a guide, a small instance is $70 per month if used constantly. If you used say 100 instances constantly, and transfered 1TB a day, you would be paying around $12000 per month. That is a metric assload of servers and bandwidth, so the $20k number is probably retarded also.<p>PR/Advertising: I'm not sure. 10k per month buys a fuckload of adwords. At a CPC of .40, you are talking 40k * 2.5 = 100k impressions a month with that advertising budget. In reality you can get clicks for .20, and lately even less, unless you are selling asbestos litigation.<p>So my point is you can get a hell of a site out there for like $300k per year or way way way less, unless you are an idiot.",1233201636
