Not just any single supplier, but very nearly the highest cost supplier (you can spend more, but you get better quality hardware if you do).  I just think there is a very clear comparison to be made between IBM in 1983 and Apple today, and it seems that your enjoyment of Apple products (and/or dislike of Microsoft products) has blinded you to that very clear comparison.<p>Apple isn't quite in the position of dangerous strength that IBM almost had, but IBM also had competitors (Commodore, Apple, Atari).  I merely think that a Mac system (even a three year old one) is not the ideal computing option for the average consumer.  Additionally, I think an Apple monopoly would be every bit as dangerous as a Microsoft monopoly.  Apple has a long history of taking advantage of the dedication of their users.<p>I come down on the side of Open Source solutions to this problem, though Linux also has problems of its own, it does solve the problem of having a single supplier for any element of the system.  With things like the Asus eee lowering the price of a laptop dramatically, while avoiding reliance on Microsoft (<i>or</i> Apple), I think things are looking up.<p>In short, I think your IBM vs. Microsoft as Robin Hood analogy should be applied equally to Apple, though Apple has managed to hold tight the reigns such that no Robin Hood can spring into existence to bust up the control Apple has over the Mac market.  Note that I don't have a problem, in particular, with Apple or Mac machines or Apple making money...just like I didn't have particular problems with IBM back in the day.  I just think it's amusing that Apple gets a pass, while Microsoft is Robin Hood for cleverly thwarting the IBM monopoly on the PC.  Pot, kettle, yada yada yada.",1208838807.0

So either the brain capitalizes on the signals of the body ready to go to sleep, then it immediately starts reorganizing memories, or the body tries to go to sleep once the brain starts to reorganize memories; or, since sleep is regulated in part by hormones, the hormone production precedes both the brain and body... haha, the more I think about it the less I think I know. If it is hormonal then, perhaps certain foods could induce the behavior more strongly than others?",1208836875.0
