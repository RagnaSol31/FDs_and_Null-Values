For desktop applications that the ""average user"" interacts with, Python is even less popular than Java/Swing.  Can you name any popular Windows applications written entirely in Python?<p>The majority of people using Python are using it in ways that aren't going to be replaced by mobile devices any time soon.  Nobody's going to  replace Django running on a server with some other framework running on a mobile device.  Nobody is going to throw away Blender and start doing 3D modeling on their iPhone.  There'd be little point in making a scipy library for Android.<p>Python doesn't have to dominate every single niche on every platform everywhere to be successful.",1349153854.0
