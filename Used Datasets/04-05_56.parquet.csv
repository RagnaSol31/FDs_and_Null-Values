I think I just figured it out:<p>Myself, American citizen, I've gotten, I don't know, maybe 1/10th of my knowledge and education from U.S. government related things? Something like that? Maybe I'm being charitable here, I've learned a heck of a lot more from books, primary and secondary research, my own experiences, and acquaintances with expert domain knowledge than I ever learned in school. I dropped out of two high schools, and I would've left the education system earlier if I was a little more self assured and independent when I was younger.<p>So maybe 1/10th of my education has come from the U.S. government, maybe. How much of my defense against foreign warfare has? 90%? 99%? The rest being my utterly trivial-in-comparison training in martial arts, marksmanship, and other survival and combat skills? I guess you could count the time time I've traveled as under the protection of the English government, or French government, or whatever else.<p>But the basic point is - various government-run military has provided almost all of my defense against foreign warfare, and very little of my education. If you cut military spending by 7/8ths without implementing mandatory service, conscription, or a draft, we'd be a hell of a lot less safe. Multiplying educational spending in the current American public education system by 8 times wouldn't make us a lot more educated.",1259470541

Billions of neutrinos pass through your body every second, and trillions upon trillions through the Earth; a possible transmission medium which may be less susceptible to planetary interference than, say, radio waves.<p>The speed of light appears to be an unbreakable barrier given our incomplete understanding of the universe.  If it does indeed hold up, getting from one galaxy to another may take eons.  Perhaps this is keeping the aliens at bay...<p>It also makes more sense for our society to evolve into robotic intelligent life for space travel.  Human bodies are poorly built to leave the Earth.  We need to bring oxygen, air, food, etc...  Atrophy of the muscles and bones occur during prolonged space flight.  We're high maintenance, and not nearly as efficient as, say, a future robotic being specifically built for space travel.  It may only needs sunlight for energy, or rely on nuclear fusion.<p>If we ever meet one, an alien may simply be the evolutionary product of their own technology, looking nothing like the species which initially built it.

Since the vendor seems incapable of debugging its own system, I ended up reverse engineering parts of it to identify the bug.  Then, a call was scheduled between me, the Fortune 500's application support folks, and the vendor's application support folks.  The vendor's customer service supervisor and I were the only two people on the call who were not located in India.<p>An analysis of the application's architecture is a data point in support of your claim.  The oldest pieces of the application seem to have some thought behind them although the implementation is significantly outdated.  However, the vendor's off-shored web-ification of the application is a cut & paste spaghetti disaster (as easily observed in nearly 4K JSPs, each with one-off authentication code).  This company was recently sold to another software vendor that seems to collect has-been cash cows, so it's clearly a couple steps from the graveyard.",1259469458

That cycle is not long - get out there and see if people are interested.  Dying for it?  Proceed to next step.  Not dying for it?  Iterate.<p>So many years of productive lives are wasted building things nobody wants by bypassing that short term period.,1259467855

Of course Harvard realizes their MBAs often end up with a duty to maximize shareholder value at any and all costs. Isn't that kind of the point? ""That"" being to create tension between the two duties and hopefully get people to examine the system?<p>This whole short-sighted duty to maximize shareholder value is unarguably a part of the problem with modern capitalism. That was the driving force behind the rush to the dizzying returns promised by the financial black magic that melted the economy.",1259467687

Bought electronics parts and test gear at hamfests, dead freight sales, and from profs; resold what I didn't need to local surplus dealers (really have to know what stuff will sell).  Had a total blast as an experimental subject (economics and biology).  Teaching/lab assistant during the school term, research assistant during summer.  Repaired, upgraded, modified, and installed home and car audio systems for classmates and profs.<p>A classmate cut hair (which was almost certainly illegal, in retrospect...).  Easy gig, and he had all the business he wanted right there in the dorms.<p>Heard rumors that someone would buy a car at each break, drive it out to school, and flip for a profit.  His angle was that the cars were salvage titled imports that had been rebuilt, and his home state allowed title washing, or something like that.  I think the DOT closed the loophole that he was exploiting.",1259467663

I always thought the word ""run"" was odd -- kind of like I was going to learn to run a cement mixer or something.  Now, I wonder if it was an attempt at selection bias; perhaps there's a correlation between those who respond affirmatively to the notion of ""running"" a computer are those least likely to read the fine print or return the CDs on time.",1259467605

It also says this on their home page. In fact, it's on the right side of the page on every page of the order process up until the credit card entry (which is where I stopped).<p>Any decently intelligent individual would know there will be <i>some</i> charge at the end of the trial. It is quite clearly stated as a trial. And because it is a trial, it doesn't matter what the full price is, just as long as you know you can cancel.
