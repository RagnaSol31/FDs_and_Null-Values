So, the question is, does cost matter?""<p>I think this is the important part of the debate.  Many people don't use these features, but with EC2 you are paying for them regardless.  For example, you pay for the ability to pay by the hour (in terms of increased costs), even if you never plan on doing so.  Yes, reserved instances can help, but they don't fully cover the cost difference.<p>So it really does come down to what features you need.  If you do use all the features, I'd imagine that EC2 is a great deal, because everyone else is subsidizing your use of them.  If you don't want any of the features, well, then you're subsidizing everyone else.<p>I think the ""cost shouldn't matter"" argument isn't relevant.  If cost doesn't matter, it is hard to make a case for EC2 vs spending the money to develop your own infrastructure + hiring lots of people + vastly overprovisioning your own datacenters.",1260334238.0

36,985315,comment,984789.0,984879.0,0,0,philwelch,,,"Right now, there are two ways to ""own"" a movie:<p>1. Buy the DVD.<p>2. Rent the DVD and rip it onto your hard drive.<p>Selling is more lucrative than renting for some of the same reasons that renting is better than buying: selling happens at a higher cost and the end consumer gets a physically fragile disc instead of a readily backupable set of data. We're talking orders of magnitude here: the movie industry could sell a DVD to you, or they could sell it to Netflix or Redbox, in which case at least dozens of people can rip a copy.<p>Thanks to first-sale doctrine, Hollywood can't even price-discriminate against Netflix or Redbox. To recoup their losses, Hollywood would have to charge Netflix maybe $200 for a $20 DVD. First sale allows Netflix to buy the same shrinkwrapped DVD for $25 from whoever bought it from Hollywood in the first place. Even if Hollywood clamps down contracts against all the possible mass distributors, end customers could play arbitrage on DVD's. Netflix would probably even mail you the empty envelope to do it in.<p>Obviously, as more people choose door number 2 over door number 1, the movie industry's DVD revenues will diminish significantly. That's the threat of Redbox: whenever you push down the threshold of renting a movie, especially to a psychologically insignificant level, you make it more and more likely that ""buying a movie"" will drop down that order of magnitude. Blockbuster and Netflix have psychologically high barriers of entry: you have to sign contracts, carry around a card, drive to the store, pay for a monthly membership, or otherwise make some sort of commitment. Redbox? You put four quarters in the machine and you get a movie for life if you can run Handbrake. That's the same cost and the same level of commitment it takes to do your laundry, minus having to carry around laundry.",1260333210.0
