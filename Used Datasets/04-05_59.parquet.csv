And they say no, it is not possible.<p>My latest example was, asking if animated characters in a video could have automated lip-synching, based on a text file (this could massively cut production times for new videos).  No, it's not possible, was the answer, and when I disagree, everyone in the room kinda looks at me like I'm the idiot.  [Of course it can be done, there are lots of products that do just that...and btw, I am the client in this scenario.]<p>Another example....we needed some customization in SharePoint, two specific requirements, that aren't provided out of the box.  I went back to my desk, implemented demos for both in about 4 hours using jQuery.  Did a demo at the next meeting....yes, that's nice, but jQuery isn't a standard here.  So we turned to an outside consulting firm, and they implemented the easy feature using.....jQuery.  (I don't think they knew how to do the other one, at least it hasn't gotten done).<p>So where I come from, the idea that you are surrounded by ""idiots"", which is a bit provocative, is often true.  I don't pretend to be an expert in law, engineering, etc, but I constantly encounter experts in their field that behave as if they are experts outside their field.<p>I will always listen to the opposing side of my arguments and always consider that I may be wrong, but I rarely encounter someone I disagree with who is willing to debate the disagreement with an open mind, and consider that perhaps they may be incorrect.<p>How else should we consider these people?",1272429679.0

Having the foreach construct require implementing IEnumerable will tie the compiler to a specific class definition. So instead, it only looks for a method with that name, which happens to be formalized in the class library in the form of an interface called IEnumerable.<p><i>Edit</i>: hm.. but I note that this doesn't work for the using(){} construct.<p>This requires the object to implement an interface that is convertable to IDisposable instead of just looking for a `Dispose` method.",1272427477.0
