Though this statistic does not say anything about industries, so the ""silicone"" industry might not be the only one to blame. Of course, this doesn't mean that we shouldn't stop doing bad things, just that we aren't as abnormal as others (or ourselves) label us.<p>P.S. All I was able to find quickly about this statistic is an editorial review from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Never-Called-Rape-Recognizing-Acquaintance/dp/0060925728"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Never-Called-Rape-Recognizing-Acquaint...</a> :<p><i>Based on first-person accounts, scholarly studies and data from a nationwide survey of college campuses conducted by Ms. magazine, freelance journalist Warshaw draws a devastating portrait of men who rape women they know. The Ms. survey reveals that 25% of the college women polled have been the victims of rape or attempted rape, 84% of the victims were acquainted with the attacker and 57% of the rapes happened on dates.</i><p>There are some important technical details missing, like how many respondents were, what's the estimated error and so on. I'll check your blog next week for further details.",1306040372.0

You could easily have a long video of your cat, say 30 minutes, and write a shell script to take a directory of MP3 files, and for each find the length, pick a random section from your long cat video of the appropriate length, extract a section of that length, and add the audio. The script could then upload the video to YouTube, putting the artist and song name in the description, so that on the receiving side naming and basic tagging of the MP3 could be automated.",1306040088.0

He could deny them in equally public fashion and/or go to the police himself.<p>The thing is: women <i>know</i> that making such an accusation in public will get them harassed for it, whether it's true or not.

Are they ""stupid"" or are there circumstances of which we're unaware?<p>Such circumstances also depend on the timeframe of the people involved. One person might have a 30-day perspective, another person is thinking about the grandchildren.<p>The HISB-square looks a lot like the Win-win(intelligent), Win-lose(bandit), Lose-win(helpless), and Lose-lose(stupid) grid of negotiation theory. The time when Win-lose is a valid strategy is when there's no ongoing relationship between the two parties, e.g. bargaining for goods in a no-refunds market. The whole idea of commodity/stock/etc exchanges is built around this concept. When some bandit pulls a Win-lose when there's an ongoing relationship, it's easy for the helpless loser to turn a Win-lose into a Lose-lose situation. It might look like revenge, but it could be to establish a track record for their next negotiation.<p>Besides timeframe, such circumstances depend on information available. There's many bandits around who hide their true identity, and pose as intelligent for appearances sake, but are pulling some nasty banditry behind the scenes. I'd suggest a counter-rule to rule 1:<p><pre><code>  Always and inevitably everyone overestimates\n  the number of intelligent individuals in circulation.\n</code></pre>\nThe intelligent-posing bandits in that situation call the helpless losers who swung a win-lose into a lose-lose ""stupid"". After many such incidents, the helpless tend to always assume they're dealing with a bandit, even though the other person may be intelligent. These are school playground lessons.<p>So I'd propose a second corrolary to the fifth rule's first corrolary (i.e A stupid person is more dangerous than a bandit):<p><pre><code>  Stupid people become stupid because bandits pose as intelligent.</code></pre>",1306036900.0
