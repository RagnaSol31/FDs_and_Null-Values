I am working on it as a hobby, putting my free time at the end of every day and in weekends (I cannot find more time, as I cannot quit my day job).\nI’ve preformed a very comprehensive market research to make sure my idea is unique. A few weeks ago a competitor launched an application almost identical to mine, but much better. It was built by a small startup, with the investment of a venture capital. They currently have 4 workers working full time on the project.\nFor comparison, my application doesn’t reach half the level of what they’ve built and only now am I about to launch my application to the open public. I currently have no users but friends who are giving me usability feedback.\nThe market in which we are both working is huge, and currently we are the only two players in it.<p>What should I do?<p>Thank you",1275886608.0

What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an \noperating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components \ncomprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.<p>Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is \noften called ""Linux"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.<p>There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's \nresources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete \noperating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called \n""Linux"" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",1275886601.0

You can read this snark againt Apple on the current front page at DaringFireball, not far from the one about Google. It's not unusual for Gruber to write snarky things about Apple. People who say otherwise: a) don't read Gruber and have no idea what he says and are thus unqualified to comment on his content, or b) do read him, but are so biased against him that their selective memory taints their ability to make objective comments.",1275884062.0
57,1409837,story,,,59,36,thinkcomp,Why does Adobe Acrobat take 15 minutes to open a PDF?,,"I do a lot of graphic design work. I have over 2,000 fonts. (Yes, I do use them.) Adobe Acrobat routinely takes 10 to 15 minutes (I'm not exaggerating) to open up a PDF file, whether it uses 1, 2, 10, 100 or no fonts at all. According to FileMon from Microsoft, it's because Acrobat loads every single font on my system before rendering the file. This makes no sense--especially because if I were to actually try to use one of those fonts not already embedded in the document by editing the file, it would re-load them all over again.<p>Some time is also spent reading and updating a local MySQL database called the ""organizer."" I've never used the Acrobat organizer. Not once. I suspect 99.999% of Acrobat users don't even know it's there, yet every time I open a PDF, I wait for it. There's no way to clear it except by manually locating the files it uses on your filesystem and deleting them.<p>Unrelated but equally infuriating: Acrobat insists on printing 100% black rectangles (meaning 0% C, 0% M, 0% Y, 100% K) as a mixture of C M and Y ink on my Xerox Phaser 6180MFP/N color laser printer. Illustrator prints the same exact PDF file properly using only black ink on the same printer.<p>Can someone from Adobe explain to me why this is reasonable? I've paid Adobe thousands of dollars over the year for its products. When can I expect to open a PDF in 2 seconds or less like I could with Acrobat 3.0 on my 100MHz Pentium ten years ago? When will Acrobat actually work?<p>(Before you say, ""Use Preview!"" know that I've already tried. It doesn't render my PDFs properly. It rasterizes things that shouldn't be rasterized and it draws lines that aren't there. Adobe made the PDF spec, I like PDFs, and I want to use Adobe's software.)",1275884027.0

The number of people on earth is still growing. The productivity of individual workers is still growing. We are capable of making more stuff in every year than we did in the previous year.<p>Now, suppose the supply of money were finite. But the amount of stuff being made keeps getting larger. So, every year, the price of everything goes down, because there's an ever-larger supply of pizza and beer but a constant amount of money.<p>But this creates a serious problem for the economy. Because now we've got deflation. And that produces a really big incentive to save. Too big an incentive. Everything will be cheaper tomorrow, so every individual benefits by burying money in the backyard and spending as little as possible.<p>But as people bury more and more money, the economy shrinks, because there is less and less money to spend, and everyone is trying to hang on as long as possible without spending anything. You end up with lots of people sitting, unemployed, with tools idle, and resources idle, and money buried in the backyard, staring at each other and waiting for someone to make the first move. Because, thanks to deflation, the first person who spends anything is a relative loser. And now your economy has deadlocked.<p>And that's why the government always runs a deficit, and why the inflation target is always higher than zero. The government prints money to make sure that the supply of money stays good. This produces some amount of inflation, of course, but the growth benefits of liquidity outweigh the inconvenience of having to do something more interesting with your money than bury it.<p>(Why don't more people understand this? Partly it's because the growth of the economy is a historically new phenomenon, dating back only about 150 years. Before that, as far as we can tell, human economic production per capita barely grew throughout millennia of history:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Farewell-Alms-Economic-History-Princeton/dp/0691121354"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Farewell-Alms-Economic-History-Princet...</a><p>The other cause for misunderstanding is that if you, say, define ""gold"" or ""silver"" as equivalent to money, and your society's economic productivity grows, but society's ability to dig up gold or silver grows <i>exactly as fast</i> as overall productivity at all times, the currency magically manages itself. Because of this, for a hundred years and more of the Industrial Revolution the world managed to struggle along with a gold-based money system. But, of course, the gold standard was abandoned when people finally figured out that this process is very haphazard -- indeed, it cannot be controlled. You can't discover gold overnight, but sometimes you need more money in the economy overnight. Like now, for example.)",1275883274.0
