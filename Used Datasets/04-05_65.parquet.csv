And they bought, sold, and pocketed.<p>If you're going to be outraged, pick one:<p>Did they profit from the misery of others by selling short? Then they had to be net sellers, which decreased prices and made the bubble smaller. Or did they needlessly fuel a speculative bubble? In that case, they had to be net buyers, which would make them net losers.<p>Since Magnetar was long volatility (returns will either be way better or way worse than investors expect), this complicates things. But they basically made money from being right, while their counterparties lost money for being wrong. As long as everyone goes into these transactions with the same information, that's the only way fools and their money are parted.",1270959082

Lets say that Adobe's compiler allows Zynga to quickly port FarmVille to Android as a native app.  There are 82.4 million FarmVille users who, like crack addicts, always need their fix.  They might just buy an Android phone for FarmVille and all the other games they play daily.<p>Now Zyngna does as you said and hires someone to build an iPhone OS native version.  It'll come out 6 months to a year later -- but it's there.  Then what happens?  FarmVille is always being updated.  It's easy to update the Android version but iPhone version always requires more work.  So inevitably it falls behind or stops working entirely.  Is that really more attractive for mainstream users?",1270959055

In fact, I was still hyped up about the post afterward that I made a few patches myself (thereby proving your ""time to write post"" vs ""fixing bugs"" metric just about correct) and got noticed by somebody on core willing now to give me write-access to the tickets so I can do the janitorial work necessary.<p>If you have children and family, of course they should come before any silly little open source project ;). Absolutely. If I had a wife (or girlfriend, for that matter) and kids I would be spending time with them too. But for now, I devote my effort into coding and writing.<p>My post is more directed at those magnificently-talented people (and perhaps, those who are not as much) to, instead of sitting there and wondering about ""What can I do?"" or whining about ""When is it coming?"" to actually <i>do</i> something about it. A great example of this would be a guy named Roland Moriz who has been going through lighthouse and picking out tickets that should be marked as invalid or completed. This is a simple process of just reading a ticket and determining its status.<p>If a thousand people went into the lighthouse and picked out one ticket, just one ticket, and ""evaluated"" it, then we would be long on our way to having no tickets left to evaluate.<p>I sincerely hope you enjoyed your wine and dessert and I appreciate your time spent to write that comment, all feedback is welcomed.",1270958619

They're committed to upholding open web standards, but have no similar commitment to their own API. HTML standards are slow to evolve by design, and Apple is okay with that, however that is the last thing they want with their own software stack.<p>Apple isn't focused on developing a smart phone operating system. They're focused on redefining what a computer IS, and how we interact with them. That's why they've been so careful about copy+paste, and later multi-tasking. They are taking this as a chance for a clean slate approach to computing and don't want to be hampered (or their customers to be hampered) by slow-moving third party compatibility layers. How much as Window's development hampered by the fear to break legacy apps compatibility moving forward? Apple isn't afraid to make their developers jump through hoops and make changes if they think it will benefit the platform in the end (a la the Intel switch). They'll provide tools to make that as painless as possible when the time comes (e.x. iPhone app compatibility on the iPad, Rosetta) but having another layer in between only slows this process down.<p>Whether you view Apple's actions as that momentous and revolutionary is largely irrelevant. I think THEY do.<p>Not that I'm not upset by this as well, but I'm trying to make sense of it.",1270958557
