And if you're willing to pay for it, that's awesome. But the thing is, most of us developers aren't, because we don't think we'll be good at it, we don't think we need to be good at it, we don't think it's worth the investment, we aren't ""designers"" and therefore don't want to spend the cash on it, etc.<p>But we really need everyone to understand good design theory, at least at a basic level. It streamlines the development process, and it may even prompt a few developers who hadn't really thought about it to do a little more with design.<p>What I love about Hack Design is that it is free and very casual, which means I can look into it in my spare time because of my own interest and motivation, without any investment and without any risk.<p>Also it should be noted that the course is largely comprised of a curated set of already-out-there blog posts, articles, tools, and other materials. Curated is the active word there; it's like a guided tour of the design community. The toughest thing about getting started with any new area of learning is knowing where to start, especially with something so vast and foreign to many of us as design. Having someone to point you in the right direction, let alone guide you step by step through the entire foundational process, is a huge leg up.<p>Okay, I'll stop gushing now.

You say retaliation against groups because of what other members of the same group did because they were members of that group is not reasonable.<p>On an intellectual level I concur, but I also realize that such a system is easy to game, and therefore cannot exist. Therefore group attacks, and group retaliation are a necessity, and they will exist regardless of what we rationally or morally feel justice should be. It's not a question of having this morally justified, no more than questioning the morality of a volcanic eruption anyway.<p>As for [1], that happened during the mughal conquest of India. Again, any violence against muslims during that time was as justified as violence against nazis was in WWII. Muslim invaders were genociding through India at the time, loss of life of that conquest, which included the building of that mosque, run from the hundreds of millions up to a billion dead.\nNumber [4] is such a trivial event I don't get why you even mention it. Drunks do that on a bimonthly basis 200 meter from where I'm sitting.

Business owners with budget congregate in predictable places: conferences for their industry, their own offices, locally organized meetups, the Chamber of Commerce, etc etc.  If you absolutely can't find an appropriate event, throw one yourself.  I'm totally serious.  Throw a seminar on How to (Put Any Business Goal Here) With (Pick A Technology They Have Heard About Recently) For (Pick An Industry).  Rent out a room for a few hours at the local civic center or whatever you have in your neck of the woods.  Buy coffee/donuts for everyone.  Teach folks for an hour.  Give a five minute sales pitch at the end.  Let folks mingle for a while so they can enjoy your coffee and donuts.  <i>Many people</i> will come up and introduce themselves to you.<p>(This can be done on approximately a $100 budget in Ogaki, so that's probably the upper bound for you.  If you can't afford that, write up how this advice actually worked out for you in a blog post and I'll reimburse you.)<p>Invite people via pre-existing networks like e.g. the Chamber of Commerce, which is generally happy to tell their members about free events which aren't (explicit) sales pitches.<p>When meeting people, ask about their business problems.
