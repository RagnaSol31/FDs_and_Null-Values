People have a right to associate with folks they choose.<p>Edit: actually - I can't say that I wouldn't participate myself.  Mentoring is mentoring - if I liked the people involved, I'd get involved.<p>I had no qualms when students at my college started a new all-male acapella group, or when they started ""The Men's Project"" (which, somewhat ironically, spent a lot of time discussing how to prevent violence against women).",1224046617

16,332986,comment,332417.0,332539.0,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"The most important tactile feedback of a button is not the spring of depression but rather the shape of the button itself. It allows you to constantly reset your bearings. When you're typing on a keypad, for example, you feel whether your finger is hitting the button square in the middle, or slightly to the left or right and adjust accordingly. You can look at the screen and type because of that.<p>Hell, you can probably type whole paragraphs with your eyes shut without erring. Without the feel of physical buttons, you'll inevitably drift one direction or the other. That's why BlackBerry typing is really so much better than the iPhone. When you have both in broad daylight and are staring at the buttons as you type, the difference isn't as noticeable. But on a Berry, you can text one-handed while driving (though I don't recommend it) while on an iPhone you'd slip up pretty fast. Or, more importantly, you can look at the screen exclusively as you type, as you would on a computer.<p>I'm not sure if this is relevant here though. Perhaps it will cause your fingers to drift upward when not looking? I really don't know.",1224044485

23,332979,comment,332527.0,332527.0,0,0,akeefer,,,"I have to echo these comments, given that my current company was founded in late 2001.  The horrific job market for engineers in the valley over the next couple of years meant that we could assemble a first-rate team much more easily than we could have in, say, 2005, and it forced us to focus on controlling costs and building revenue sustainably rather than just trying to get huge and grab market share.<p>Another upside the article doesn't mention is that companies in a downturn tend to face less pressure from VCs to get big fast with no regard for long-term viability, allowing you to build your business for the long haul and focus on quality products and real revenue.  At least that's been my experience, and I chalk it up to there being less of an arms race/land grab mentality, along with more of a realization that succeeding in this climate requires a solid business, not just a bunch of non-paying users or meteoric-yet-unmonetized growth.<p>The primary downside is that companies funded during a downturn tend to get far lower valuations for the same level of funding, giving up a lot more equity than they would in more exuberant times.",1224043917
