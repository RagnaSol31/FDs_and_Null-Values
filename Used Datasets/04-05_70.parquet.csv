The best applications are the ones that create an entirely separate interface and run in full screen, and even then you don't have very many that are attractive or appealing. I think the only real stand-out I've seen is Google Chrome, which was better-designed when it came out on Windows than any browser on the Mac, and which still holds a slight edge over Safari 4 in terms of pure elegance.

Apple is pretty far from the ""we build our own apps in the same sandbox you do"" state that Android is in.<p>As an example: Twidroid (and most other Android apps) can run in the background, and use data in the background without a custom push server. Apple's Mail app, on the other hand, isn't buildable (for the iPhone) with the public APIs. You'd need to run in the background for that, which isn't available.<p>Don't judge the API based on the quality of apps you're seeing - I've seen some well-polished Android apps, and some legendarily horrible iPhone ones.",1256703520.0

Also, in your resources list you should have the exact machine configuration, there are tools to retrieve that sort of info automatically.<p>Then, when you're done, store it in <a href=""http://inventory.sf.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inventory.sf.net/</a>\nor something like that.<p>It's typical that the people at rackspace would simply drop in the requested hardware, and that you yourself deal with the configuration.<p>The smart money is on running some tests after they've done that to make sure it went ok. Asking for a CPU upgrade and not checking if they're operational is just plain stupid.<p>I figure you literally asked rackspace to upgrade the CPU, and that's what they did.<p>Did you explicitly ask them to install an SMP kernel with a specific version and they didn't do it ? Or did you expect them to do it but you didn't check if they actually did until today ?<p>Two full years of trying to tune a box for performance and not noticing this, then publicly blaming rackspace is simply cheap, an attempt at pinning the blame on rackspace, for something that you should have noticed long ago yourself.<p>Kudos for writing about it but the title should be ""How I messed up"".

You may wish to customize grep-find-command to some reasonable default, e.g., mine:<p><pre><code>    (setq grep-find-command\n          (concatenate\n           'string\n           ""find . \\( -path '*.svn' -o -path '*.git' -o -path '*.hg' \\)"" \n           "" ""\n           ""-prune -o -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep -I -i -n -e ""))\n</code></pre>\n3. If you want to just search open buffers, you may find M-x multi-occur-in-matching-buffers useful. I use this simple wrapper, which you invoke using M-x search-all-buffers:<p><pre><code>    (defun search-all-buffers (regexp)\n      (interactive ""sRegexp: "")\n      (multi-occur-in-matching-buffers ""."" regexp t))\n</code></pre>\n4. You may find filtering files and query-based search replace useful, in which case you should try dired-mode. It does a lot, so try marking files (look in the Mark menu for various options), then operate on them (Operate menu). For example, hit ""% m"" to mark files by name regex, type ""\.[c|h]"" to mark all C and header files, then press ""Q"" to start interactive search-and-replace through all marked files.<p>5. I don't know of a direct equivalent to Nice Find, e.g., basing a search on ""git grep"" output, but if you look through the various Git modes, you may find something useful.",1256702564.0
