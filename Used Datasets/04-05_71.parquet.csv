I was originally in love with Facebook precisely because it improved those relationships.<p>Things were a bit different in college, I guess, when only .edu email holders were on the site. I'm not sure if that's because it was a safe walled garden for students to be themselves online or if it was because I had a much higher ratio of close friends to extended relationships. Either way, as the site has grown and more Bosses and Grandmas have joined, normally complex people who interact with me differently than the Boss or Grandma were suddenly forced to act in a lowest common denominator way.<p>I'll admit that the reason I left Facebook (late 2009) had little to do with privacy or advertising and more to do with the fact that most of my friends stopped posting pictures and self-censored because both Grandma and the Boss might see it. If I wanted interesting human contact, Facebook was decreasingly the place to find it.<p>Anyway, my gripe about the Facebook narrative, in addition to the one you just brought up, is that Facebook is the de facto place to communicate with anyone. It's not. It may be the path of least resistance in communicating with those acquaintances, but there are hundreds of ways to get in touch with people now. Facebook's grasp of social interaction is less of a stranglehold and more of a thin curtain that people, for whatever reason, refuse to look behind.",1351918365.0

But the big states may have found a work around: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstat...</a><p>In short, the states that agree to the compact agree to proportion all of their electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote.  (For example, if Romney wins the national popular vote, CA would give Romney all of CA's electoral votes.)  The compact will only kick in once the states that have ratified it have 270 electoral votes (enough to win).  It's already about halfway there at 132.<p>How crazy would it be to see campaigning in California and New York?",1351916910.0

The PS1 hand thousands of games available and if you were into imports you could get your hands on japanese gems as well, literally quadrupling the games available for the system. There was no other system like it (the closest in that regard being the Saturn). The N64 never reached that kind of ""standard"" status and therefore the offering and third party support was limited at best. As to whether the N64 was a more powerful system, yeah, it may have been, but on consoles we all know that software makes the different more than hardware.<p>There's a clear reason why the N64 sold way less than the PS1: it was just a much better deal to get a PS1 if you wanted to play lots of different games.
