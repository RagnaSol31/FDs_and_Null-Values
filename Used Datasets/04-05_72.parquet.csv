12,1560296,comment,1559480.0,1559708.0,0,0,blahblahblah,,,"The suggestion that students should major in liberal arts instead of engineering made me literally laugh out loud.  An engineering degree is the best value to be had in American post-secondary education.  Not only do you come out of school with real marketable skills that employers actually want, the solid foundation in general purpose problem solving is damn good preparation for life, wherever it may lead you.  The philosophy of the ancient Greeks may be the historical basis for Western thought, but in no way does that mean that it is a more worthy subject of study than, for example, an in-depth examination of the factors that led to the Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal or the role that the Haber process played in WWI & WWII.<p>Whenever there's an economic downturn, there are inevitably sob stories printed in virtually every major newspaper about how it's difficult for fresh college graduates to get a job and these human interest stories invariably include an anecdote or two about some specific young person just out of college living at home while desperately trying to find a job and having no luck because the jobs just aren't there.  How many times have you read this type of story in the newspaper where the sob story is about a kid who majored in chemical engineering or EE or metallurgy?  I've yet to see such an article and I anticipate that if I were to see such an article it would be lamenting that the kid couldn't find a job in their specific major, not that they couldn't find gainful employment somewhere doing something.  If you're an employer hiring for the kind of jobs for which a liberal arts degree is sufficient preparation, you'd be a fool to turn down an engineering grad if you were lucky enough to have one who was actually interested in working for you.  Your requirements for the candidate are:  smart and gets things done.  If they can survive the rigors of an engineering school, there's little doubt that they can do the job.  On the other hand, if you're a technical employer getting resumes from fresh liberal arts graduates, you're probably going to toss them straight into the trash bin.",1280465306.0

21,1560286,comment,1560072.0,1560258.0,0,0,noname123,,,"You right. But I'll give you the counter-argument.<p>In the stock market, just like the real estate/auto market, there are never just true buyers and sellers; there are also brokers and dealers who keep a inventory of goods, so that they can sell to non-discriminating retail customers who just want the goods right now. Their expertise and self-interests in turns, affects the price of the good in the whole entire market.<p>The stock market once have had traditional broker-dealers that controlled the spread of a stock. That is, dealers are willing to buy stocks from impatient traders who are willing to sell at a market order at a price that is set by the dealer; the dealers then in turn, later sell their inventory at an artificially inflated price to impatient traders who are willing buy the stock at a market at the price named by the dealer.<p>Traditional dealers, in order to tack on the risk of carrying their inventory of stocks (after all, a stock could theoretically drop to zero before they could sell the whole lot), keep the spread of the stock big (they are willing to buy low and sell high) at the expense of retail investors.<p>HFT, due to their high-tech platform and high execution speed tightens this spread because they don't carry as high a risk of inventory; because their execution speed is in timescale of micro-seconds; so essentially, in the timeframe of seconds, they buy a position and then sell that position subsequently and not really carry that position through for the market to affect the value of that position.<p>This in theory is good for retail investors as they actually end up paying less for their stocks. But with good technology, you could also use it for bad. With fast computers and sophisticated algorithms, HFT traders could learn how to game the traders and big funds that they are suppose to server - just like a regular car or real estate dealer.<p>If you know where the consumer demand is, you could buy up all of the supply ahead of time and artificially inflate the price to make people pay more. If you know that your competitors are replicating your every move, you could deceive them by making a small trade against your true intention, have them jump on the bandwagon and swiftly punish them by executing your true big trade afterwords.

Programming languages are the only place I can think of that OSS is cutting edge.<p>Surely you're joking? Outlook is a crappy email client. Mutt which is older than I am, handles mail better than Outlook does, I hate using Outlook. It means archiving my mail every month (several accounts over several PST files over an a very high mail volume). Ever since it's beginning outlook was the crappiest mail software. You can't figure out what the hell it's doing and it crashes all the damn time without error or with generic/cryptic ones. The only way to fix it is to wipe your settings from the hard drive, and reset registry keys to defaults. And if that doesn't work reinstall office.<p>Not to mention compiz/beryl had desktop effects before any other operating system. Linux in the kernel level has removed the need for file polling, replacing it with iwatch. Linux has on demand file system and virtual file system mounting. There are hardly any drivers for file systems or virtual file systems on Windows. Dokan is the only place where you can get FUSE or SSH and the software is crappy.<p>MS to this day hasn't standardized it's own security structure (EX: runas.exe in XP will have the processes pass on administrator rights to all child processes 7 doesn't neither does Vista). And lets face it on the top of it's game Windows default security could have been over-riden by pressing cancel on the logon screen.  On anything but a fickle consumer and ease level Windows and to some extent OSX (although the use of a BSD kernel and the growth of MacPorts mitigates this a bit) don't hold a candle to the features found in Linux.<p>You seem to equate success and innovation with sales and press releases.

So I enter my buy order into my OMS screen, which slices and dices these 200,000 shares into blocks of 100 shares (as for traders not to front-run me, because a naked buy order of 200,000 shares will drive the price up and I'll overpay long after my transaction is completed).<p>HFT program meanwhile is actively scanning the quote book on all market centers for patterns of such a huge ""whale order"". Bob Fund may leave discriminating traces of evidence, such as executing the same blocks of buy order under my unique MPID multiple times. Or the HFT program is hooked up to a dark pool where it's constantly sending out small sell orders for 1 share to try to sniff out and match Bob Fund's huge buy order. Or it just might be that the HFT program has reverse-engineered the Bob Fund's VWAP algorithm for slicing/dicing orders and can detect how the orders are being sliced/diced under any given market conditions.<p>Once the HFT algorithm is certain of a ""whale order."" It'll actively go out to every single market center, buy up all of the remaining AAPL liquidity on those markets and then present it to Bob Fund (voila! I'm providing you with liquidity at artificially inflated price!). Mr.Bob has no choice but to buy AAPL at a maybe a penny or two higher than what he could have paid for without HFT.<p>The flip-side of the argument for HFT traders are that perhaps, they are better dealers than traditional dealers. For all we know, there might not be any interested retail investors who are willing to trade with Bob Fund; so Mr.Bob ends up trading with traditional dealers which have traditionally higher spread on the price of their stock, as they take on more risk as a dealer because they don't have the same execution speed and high-turnover rate as a HFT dealer. Also, HFT increases nominally execution speed and brings all market center's prices in line, as if there is a NBBO on ARCA and Bob Fund's order is on BATS, HFT will essentially act as the middle-man to match the true best bid and offer together, in the quickest time.<p>However, the other counter argument against HFT is that it actually doesn't really provide liquidity to the market, as evident by the June flash-crash. During a situation such as this, broker-dealers are suppose to step during irrational exuberance and depression and trade with irrational investors and put a stop to the crash/rise. But HFT dealers stopped trading that day, triggering a lot of people's stop-market orders and hence we saw ridiculous sell orders of Accenture at $0.01.<p>So I'd say, HFT is a mix-bag.",1280463786.0

Someone tries to buy an item for $1.00, and the HFT algorithm tries to grab the item first and resell it to our original buyer (and other people in the market) for just a tiny bit more.<p>From my perspective it's effectively a sort of tax, like a bridge toll. It seems to me like this has to make every transaction affect the price <i>more</i>, not less. How does this increase efficiency or liquidity?",1280463227.0
