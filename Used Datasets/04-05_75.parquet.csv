12,3441485,comment,3440469.0,3441210.0,2,0,wwhchung,,,"Hi there.  While I agree with some of your points, i.e. issues with certain large companies being anti-competitive in the startup environment rather than being supportive, and the fact that the tax incentives offered could be better structured to be more accessible to technology startups, I still think Canada is a great place to build a company.  Why?  Well:<p>1. Canada does have great tech talent.  Finding them is a bit more difficult, but talent retention is much better.  And if you reward your employees well (i.e. competitively with any other company out there), you can attract world class talent.<p>2. Building a great company does not necessarily mean raising a huge VC round.  In fact, if you can build a business that is growing quickly without the need for VC, they'll come looking for you.  One thing that some people get hung up on is that you absolutely need to get funded to start a company.  That's not true at all.  Although, when the time does come to raise money, most US investors are actually comfortable with investing in Canadian companies.<p>There are a few things I do notice though.  Canadian culture is a bit more conservative (i.e. less willing to take big risks, which also explains a bit of the lower valuation).  It makes a bit of sense, since most of the larger industries are around 'traditional' sectors, like natural resources and finance.  But this is changing.  And as more and more successful tech companies emerge, the startup community will only get stronger.<p>Also, the tax incentives are well intentioned, however the way they're structure has been a 'one size fits all' approach.  The rules put in place make sense for some industries (e.g. medical R&D), but make it a bit inaccessible to tech startups without a lot of effort.",1326084764.0

70,3441427,story,,,2,0,sippndipp,"Node PR, you can do better",,"Today I've read this article http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/07/building-consumer-apps-with-node/ and i find it a little disturbing. Node.js is a totally cool piece of technology and I'm loving it, but in this article node is embraced for the wrong reasons - let me be the advocatus diaboli:<p><i>Its JavaScript!</i><p>Yes it's JavaScript, and as he said every developer knows a little JavaScript. But JavaScript has some bad parts http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook and as a newbie JavaScript developer you can easily shoot yourself in the foot http://wtfjs.com/<p><i>Code re-use at every level: browser, back end & database</i><p>We at 9elements dream of all tier code re-usages for several years https://github.com/janv/kupo but in the wild I actually don't see it. Also, do you really want your super secret business logic shared with the client? Code re-use ain't easy, but someone has to do it. There are some great concepts like http://nowjs.com/ but I guess the status quo of JavaScript is not there yet. We need ES5+ in the browser to do the really good stuff.<p><i>Strong, responsive and enthusiastic community</i><p>Big part of the community is great! Some really brilliant minds out there!\nBut there is also a part of not so skilled dudes who hated rails and now just hopping on the\nnode bandwagon for the wrong reasons (and leaving behind a trail of unmaintained github repos w/o tests).<p><i>Large productivity gains in HTML & CSS using Jade & Stylus</i><p>Well, switching from HTML/CSS to HAML/SASS was a large productivity gain. Switching to Jade and Stylus was just felt ""ok"". The real performance boost at SASS dev came from Compass, which didn't existed for Stylus for a long time. Now there is Nib http://visionmedia.github.com/nib/ but it's still a pretty young project compared to Compass. Btw: For those who do a lot of Rails + Node.js development check out https://github.com/9elements/haml-coffee it's HAML married with CoffeeScript.<p><i>Performance and scalability</i><p>I buy the performance, kudos to the V8 team and @ryah. But scalability does not come from using a certain tech (unless it embraces scalability per default). Scalability comes from crafting a system that has no single point of failure (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Point_of_Failure). So please don't compare apples to pines.<p><i>Wealth of hosting options: No.de, Joyents SmartMachine, Heroku, Nodejitsu</i><p>True, I would just add homebrew hosting and deployment with capistrano and forever: https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever<p><i>Make your developers famous</i><p>Don't be foolish. Doing Open Source (right) is one of the hardest disciplines out there. Just releasing some written code into a new ecosystem does not automatically uplift you to the rockstar developer olymp. You have to maintain your code, deal with issues, deliver support etc... Doing Open Source work is very important. You take - you give - but more important you'll learn. But you don't need node for that there is plenty of room in this Internetz thingy, look at https://github.com/codejoust/session.js<p><i>Developer happiness</i><p>I know the feeling: Staying on the bleeding edge looking into the space where no man has gone\nbefore feels great. But be carefull, if things don't go well they can easily switch to developer\ntears. It almost took the node ecosystem a year to mimic typical ""getting things done modules"" like EveryAuth https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth which derives from https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/ in the rails world. OH: If you seeking for something like rails in the node.js world... then just use rails.<p><i>Bottom Line</i><p>When you read this you may get the feeling that I don't like node - I'm loving node http://node.9elements.com/ and it definitely has it's use cases:<p>- if you do something in realtime\n- if you are developing an API\n- if you need high performance<p>but for other use cases I wouldn't bet my life on it... yet.<p>If you're interested in node, then go for it, play with it, never stop exploring - start\nsmall and grow with the ecosystem. One day it may replaces technology X with framework Y, but\nuntil then I would lower my expectations a little.<p>So... enough ranting, let's engage the discussion - I hope you enjoyed this article:<p>http://twitter.com/sippndipp",1326082358.0

Compare this with the $50-55K offers I was getting from Canadian companies, and it was a complete no-brainer.<p>The gap has only widened - I'm now in SF making <i>over double</i> what my going rate in Canada would be. The cost of living is higher (well, mostly just the rent, everything else is similar), but it doesn't even come close to canceling out the raw pay difference.<p>But sometimes the pay is a red herring - I know a lot of Canadian expats in the USA who would love to go home, and many are willing to take substantial pay cuts in exchange for Canadian QOL, including myself. In fact, some of us have actually investigated this option thoroughly, and the ugly truth is:<p>There just aren't that many interesting, challenging jobs for programmers in Canada. It's a country full of code sweatshops and satellite-office monkey labs. Interesting, fulfilling, high-impact jobs are few and far between, and <i>incredibly</i> hotly contested where you do see them. Compare with being in SF, where someone practically begs me to go work on <i>their</i> interesting, world-changing problem every week. So in order for me to go back to Canada, I'd not only have to take a >50% pay cut, but also resign myself to ye olde cubicle and TPS reports. Entirely unacceptable.",1326081799.0

The fact is, no matter what finite number of hypotheses you test before making your one guess about the rule, there will always be an infinite number of possible ""rules"" that could fit all the information you have so far (where a ""rule"" is a function mapping triplets to booleans).<p>So in the example he gave, let's say I decide to try his ""falsification"" technique as well.  I ask about all the same 6 triplets he gives as examples, and then decide that the rule is ""ascending numbers"".  So I guess that.  Nope, that's wrong in this particular case - the rule was actually ""ascending numbers where the second one is at least as close to the first number as it is to the third"".  As you can imagine, you could play that game forever.  I don't think his guess of ""even increasing numbers"" is any less reasonable than the correct answer of ""increasing numbers"".  Maybe the rule is ""ascending integers"" - he didn't try falsifying that by guessing 3.14 in one of his triplets.  There are unlimited ""patterns"" he'd have to try falsifying.<p>I think the ideas behind the problem are good but you'd need to constrain it in some way for it to be reasonable.",1326081645.0
