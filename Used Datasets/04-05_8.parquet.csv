2,218403,comment,217914.0,218270.0,0,0,tx,,,"SMS is more capable, by far more reliable and complex system than Twitter. (guess how do I know?) Most Americans are unaware of it because it has never been popular here due to pricing differences but it's changing. SMS are multi-casted more often than you think and the load I've seen were several times that of Twitter. I am not calling anyone stupid or incapable, I suspect it's just a side effect of ""release early, release often"" mantra.<p>And don't exaggerate for the sake of exaggeration: how many Twitter users have ""thousands"" of followers?",1213592109

7,218398,comment,218347.0,218370.0,0,0,icey,,,"It is not illegal to drop emails.<p>That being said, are you positive the problem is with hotmail itself and not its mail handlers?<p>For example, if you use the incorrect sort of line breaks [1] in an email that gets sent to a qmail server, the server will silently drop that email message. It will report an error textually but not return an actual error code. This could make it look like your email was getting dropped. This happens quite frequently with machine generated emails.<p>Who knows if MSN / Hotmail uses qmail, but my point is that there may be other matters afoot than Hotmail intentionally playing hardball with you.<p>[1] Qmail pukes when you send an email that contains carriage returns without line feeds.",1213591702

When I think of Google, I think of a grand deception, or a gilded cage. Or a company that used to have productive chaos and now just has internal disorder. A place that encourages regression to childhood dependence, rather than mature creativity.<p>Maybe you should say ""Google circa 1998-2003""?",1213590192

The game saves transparently when you walk around so there's no other good time to pop up with the allocation popup.

Firefox 3 tends to hover around 200MB no matter how long I've been running it. That's a big deal, even with 4GB of memory.",1213589303

I had an Apple //e, back in the days when it came with a built-in BASIC interpreter and the manual, and computer mags were often filled with BASIC source listings. Which was not great, but not bad either. I assume the Romanian kids got Windows XP and there is no obvious path to hacking with that OS. You're just a consumer.<p>But I don't think it was the machine that mattered. Plenty of my friends had the exact same computer and all they did was trade games and play them. Given a computer, I immediately decided to write programs with it. I'm just that kind of person. \nWhen I learned to play piano, I immediately tried my hand at composing. It greatly surprised me that my musical training courses were all about learning to play rather than learning to write music.<p>I suspect the same is true of any hacker; for us, the point of learning <i>anything</i> is to synthesize.<p>My point is, I think Alan Kay et al. may be crafting educational programs for ideal students, who do exist, but only as tiny fractions of the population.",1213589152
