Having options is only worth value if there is a successful exit which are rare. I was involved in an exit, that was pretty good for the founders (7 digit purchase price), but worthless for just about every employee. I think I walked away with $600.<p>The valuation of each company should also be figured into equation. It really only matters when there is an exit, but it would effect your payout.  Have the founders/owners had a successful exit before? Are they going to raise capital, thus diluting your ownership in the future?

But it is also possible that this person is working at a near-IPO company or something well funded. In that case, the 0.5% would be much more meaningful. In the end, I suspect that the most likely scenario is that insiders consider the expected value of the 0.5% to be almost exactly equivalent to $10k/year after accounting for risks.<p>In that case, I would personally consider how much of a relative difference would that 0.5% make (e.g., going from 0.75% to 1.25% might be more meaningful than going from 23% to 23.5%) vs how much of a difference would that $10k make. Presumably people who have thought about this consider them to be equivalent from the company's perspective, but only the asker knows which one is more useful to him/her. If he/she has doubts about the company's exit (as you suggest), taking the money makes sense. If he/she is confident and can delay the payoff, it may be worth it. Hooray, gambling.",1284007464

11,1674430,comment,1674035.0,1674035.0,0,0,formerpoweruser,,,"Obvious throwaway account.<p>As a former digg ""power user"" this is my take on the recent change and why I think is the only thing that will save digg.<p>I have been using digg since almost the beginning. At first I was using it for the same reason almost everyone way using digg at that time, for tech news and discussions. It might be very had to believe now, but once upon a time digg used to have very engaged group of users with thoughtful and knowledgeable comments, a lot like HN and some smaller sub-reddits on reddit. Digg was truly powered by the users with very little if any influence. It was a lot of fun and very addictive.<p>I think it was during v2 that they made some questionable choices by adding friends feature (I could be wrong, it could have been there before that) and ""fudging"" with the frontpage algo where instead of stories hitting the frontpage because of the interest on stories, they soft-limited on the number of stories-per-category could hit the frontpage. The idea was to ""diversify"" the site. Which in the business sense is not a bad idea, you obviously want more people to come to your site not only people who are interested in technology, but the implementation was a sham.<p>This had 2 negative effects:<p>- People who are passionate about technology and also the core majority of the digg users lost interest and left or at least started using digg less. You could really tell by the quality of the comments.<p>- It opened the flood gates for other non-tech sites who are now interested to get their site on digg frontpage. Getting on digg FP is profitable and also good for SEO, the amount of quality link-back you get after hitting the FP is crazy. Since the majority of the blogosphere is everyone quoting/rehashing everyone else with little original content. If you could get your original content to digg FP other related site/blog would pick it up and link back at you. Before you had to work your ass off to get high quality link back, now all you had to do was get on digg frontpage, which wasn't very difficult because of the half-assed ""community"" feature they added where you could friend people and they would get an RSS feed of your submission and you could blindly digg their stuff. People where literally blindly digging there stuff left and right.<p>The fact that this was going on alone should piss people off at Digg HQ. But they let this go on for as long as they did is, to me, mind-boggling. Either they were incompetent or they really consciously wanted the site to die.<p>But that's not even the worst part. But this was _very_ profitable for people who can fine tune the process of getting to the digg frontpage. (""very profitable"" is subjective if you are making millions of $ a month. But if you are making thousands of $ in your spare time with very little effort I think it was profitable).<p>Digg users who were power users at that time (and still are) but was doing it only for fun, now saw that they can actually have fun and make money at the same time!<p>As it happens in most internet community (even here at HN) there are some community celebrities and people will support them no matter what. They could possibly do no harm. ""babyman and co"" (a la digg power-users) had such mindless followers who would support them and mindlessly digg anything they submit. And these power-users had relationships with publishers who would pay them good money to submit their stuff. You get FP you make money, if you don't get FP you still make (somewhat less) money for the ""effort"". But with power-users with their mindless followers, they had a very very high probability of hitting FP. So they were most sought after.<p>How do I know all these? Apart from being one of the top 20 digg users (until recently, in terms of FP count) I knew 12 of the 20 top digg users personally and met them often and some of the rest I spoke to regularly by phone and IM.<p>So how I personally profited from this?<p>As someone who is fairly tech savvy and half-decent writing ability. I setup 3 separate tech blogs/sites and with the co-ordination with other power users (they didn't ask for a cut-off or money if you ask them to submit your own sites) I was hitting the FP left and right. At one point I was getting 75-80% on the FP stories and during christmas holiday with high CPMs premium ads I was raking in ~8-10k a week from those 3 sites by spending less than 4 hours a day (I am also counting my time on working on the sites). I don't know about you guys, but to me, thats big money. After that, I was doing it full-time for about one year.<p>(Since then I sold my site, and left digg. If you must know why, and I don't have a non-cheesy answer, I felt like I was cheating, which I was, and doing something very wrong. It hit my conscious, as hard as it might be to believe. I wanted to wash myself out of this, so I sold the site and just left everything that has to do with digg.)<p>But systematic manipulation was not limited to power users, there were automatic bots, browsers plugins, and userscripts that could be systematically used to digg and bury submissions. How I found out about this is I was once hanging out with one of the powerusers and while waiting for our food I was checking out digg (I know I am lame), and I saw his account was digging stuff even though he was obviously not using digg himself at this very moment. So I pressed him about it and he let me in his small secret group and now almost everyone who matters does it. Sometimes around last year they did update their site and did some mass banning on users who were using bots and scripts (I was banned too but they gave me 2nd chance), but that didn't stop shit. Everyone was back to the old game after few weeks.<p>At this point I must point out how ironic is that people, ""babyman and co"" (a la power-users), who are leading the ""digg revolt"" this time around was the subject of all the previous ""digg revolts"" (except for the first one). All these time everyone was crying about getting rid of power-users, or influence of a group of people. But now that they have ""fixed"" it, in the sense that power-users don't have as much influence on it as they used to, people are crying about the same features that gave the power-users the ability to manipulate the site. Digg4 pretty much kills the concept of power users, yes you can still game it, as we have seen with reddit feed being on Digg frontpage, but that was according to digg a glitch in their algo, but its nothing like before.<p>The concept of ""individual power-users"" is killed or diminished. Now the publishers are the power-users, the more followers they have they more likely their site will hit the FP and they get submitted automatically, but with proper algo they can also let the regular user level out the field with user generated contents (at least that what I understand from the chatter).<p>Digg4, in my opinion, is the only thing that will save digg. There was NEVER people-powered-digg since v2, there was the <i>perception of it</i>; now it is just obvious out in open.<p>Sorry for the wall of text and possible spell/gramm error. I felt like I needed to say something about this. I don't use digg much anymore I usually hang out here or at reddit.",1284007252

14,1674427,comment,1673459.0,1674359.0,0,0,muhfuhkuh,,,"Well, in a fair world, we'd have zero regulations or need for taxes or government at all (except for enforcement against personal abuse like murder, rape, theft and invasion), and as an example, oil companies wouldn't ever have spills because of the extremely high potential to be sued by the people living in the regions where spills occur and actually _lose_ these lawsuits, which effectively means going bankrupt and forced out of business paying back all the damage awards. That's the ideal Libertarian solution to the outsized hand of big business on both market and customer. It's similar to the Xeer stateless government, as adopted in Somalia. Maybe it can scale to a country of 305 Million, but that truly is a ""grand experiment"" likely left as a thought exercise for now.<p>In reality , though, the solution is a simple matter of tax revenue arbitrage. Instead of providing tax breaks to the lethargic corporations that will take those tax breaks but won't hire anybody anyway, give it as a guaranteed loan to a small business who will use it to directly hire workers and consume products and services expressly for business continuity and growth. Spread thinly enough, while the failure rate outpaces the successes, the succeeding companies have the potential to hit it _really_ big, spurring ancillary and supporting feeder companies sprouting around it and possibly creating a new industry.",1284007166

That's easy, it can be done today, and it will lay the groundwork for browsers to actually implement.<p>Someday, it would be nice if every single street address on the web was marked up in such a way that just from looking at the markup, a computer can unambiguously figure out the location you're looking for.

Most people are comfortable with it to a lesser or greater degree, generally those not running Windows do better, but it allows us to do things that we could never do in a sole Windows environment.

Pylons has a good user base and plenty of steam. There is also mavericks like Ian Bicking who wrote Webob and Paste (which Pylons is build on) who prefer the sans-framework approach because it is simple in Python to glue together the various libraries needed for a ""framework"".<p>Plus the addition of AppEngine with doesn't play nicely with Django due to BigTable<i></i> means people  look at other solutions.<p>Also, the Django community, especially some of the core developers do seem to respect the opinions of these other people and groups.

That means taking care of your people while disempowering the union.  If you're hostile to the workers they're going to rally around that union, no matter what.
