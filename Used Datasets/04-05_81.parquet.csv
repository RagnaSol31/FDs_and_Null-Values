The actions of one customer can effect hundreds of other customers. For example, we saw a specific firmware revision that caused the modem's burst modulator (upstream signal) to turn on a high power constant carrier in certain circumstances which would DoS all the modems on the same upstream offline. I've heard this was responsible for a massive outage in Phoenix last year due to 8 modems being upgraded before the code was fully tested. If you upgrade the firmware yourself it's putting other people at risk -- including digital phone subscribers who may be using their services as a life line. Changing your MAC address has some risk simply because MACs are supposed to be unique. You could accidentally DoS another customer offline by doing it although statistically the chances are pretty low you'd use another subscriber's MAC but it does happen from time to time when someone simply increments the last digit of the MAC address.",1264999991.0

Did I say turned-off? I meant outraged. Offended. Disgusted.<p>1. Neither the iPhone nor the iPad are going to replace full-blown computers. They're neither powerful enough nor comfortable enough for serious work. Of course, the situation could change dramatically a few years from now, but I'm sure we'll figure something out when the time comes. For now, get a Mac and have a blast hacking it :)<p>2. If you think Apple's touch devices have taken the world by storm and everything else pales in comparison, I humbly suggest you come to New Delhi and count the number of iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad owners. Most of the world just can't afford to spend cash on shiny entertainment devices. People are still going to buy and use computers. You can still write apps for Mac OS X/Linux/Windows. The world has not yet ended.<p>3. Most of the apps you find on the AppStore could conceivably be written as webapps. Why bother with ObjC and Cocoa when you can just use JavaScript+HTML5? A large percentage of apps just pull data from a server and display it in pretty boxes. On the other hand, if you're writing a game, you're already a ""special case"" and have to play by Apple's rules -- which are not different from what Microsoft/Nintendo/Sony impose on their developers. So, for most of your programming needs, JavaScript+HTML5 should be enough.<p>4. Have we forgotten that these days, Apple are an entertainment and content distribution company who just <i>happen</i> to make computers? Apple are not marketing the iPad as a general-purpose computer; they want to sell it as an entertainment device. Since it's a niche device, in the grand scheme of things, the closed nature of the iPhone OS doesn't really matter.<p>This list doesn't do much to allay the major concerns of the tech community: the iPad <i>is</i>, in fact,  a full-blown computer that is hopelessly locked-in by Apple and their delusional policies, that it could be much more than just an entertainment device, that we have something radically different from the traditional model of computing but cannot exploit the thousands of possibilities this gives us. This list is just an indication that we mustn't lose hope yet. Let the guys in Cupertino figure out when - if ever - they want to loosen their grip on the iPhone OS ecosystem. In the meantime, we'll just write web apps :)<p>EDIT: In a previous comment, I mentioned I don't want to write JavaScript. It's true. But I can put up with JS if it means I don't have to sell out to Apple.",1264999501.0

If you compare the costs of physically printing the book to publishing an eBook, there is obviously a huge difference. Look at lulu.com for starters on this.<p>On the other hand, his argument for flexible pricing is quite sensible.  The difference as we go to eBooks will be that the popular books will cost more, and the less popular books will cost less, as we get the physical production costs out of the way and the overhead is greatly reduced.<p>Just like recording artists and labels, authors will separate from publishers, as publishers fragment into the the physical production, editorial service providers and financial risk backing operations.",1264999217.0

I'm not sure of each's multitouch API, if any, but, really, there's not that much more beyond those things that HAS to be implemented for the <i>vast</i> majority of web pages and apps to fully function.

A huge chunk of the HTML5 effort has been toward just standardizing the response to the tag soup that is out there. That work is essentially done and doesn't have to be repeated. Just in the last year or two have things really taken off as far as adding new functionality to browsers and example pages, and it's only been in the last couple of months that a few actual commercial pages have started to use these things. In large part, that's because the web has been <i>stuck</i> for most of a decade because of IE stagnation.

To paraphrase one of the best ""We don't subsidize an incompetent hore why must we subsidize incompetent authors.""<p>Most published authors suck which has a lot to do with them making no money.  What publishers focus on is not high quality books but rather figuring out how to convince people to buy crap books that they will not actually read.<p>Amazon cut's into this in two ways, if you can read reviews before you buy you are less likely to pickup something you don't like.  The other approach is by removing the limited shelf space at the book store you reduce the control large publishing houses have over the channel which allows higher quality books to compete without backing from a major publishing houses .",1264998173.0

""Dramatically streamline the tax code"" is classic political double-speak for ""flat tax"", which means the elimination of most forms of taxation on US corporations.  Much of the ""complexity"" of US tax code is part of the long legislative history of closing tax loopholes that large businesses have successfully exploited to escape taxation in the past.<p>But even if you don't take my word on this, he actually does call for tax cuts in the post:<p><i>""Make capital gains on investments up to $1mm in small companies tax free""</i><p>This has nothing to do with ""streamlining"" the tax code.  Cuban wants the ability to invest in hedge funds and other ""small businesses"" without paying capital gains tax on the profits, and he's framing it as a way of ""encouraging investment"" in the mom and pop store down the street (who will never, ever be assisted by this kind of a policy change).

The print copy has intrinsic value; I can resell it, lend it out, donate it to a ""books for prisoners"" program or leave it to my grandkids; it requires no additional hardware, and I'll be able to read it anywhere, anytime for the rest of my life. If I drop it down a sewer grate or forget it in a cab, I'm out no more than the replacement cost of the book (which is probably out in paperback now). If I throw it in a box in the attic and leave it there, barring the Rise of the Silverfish I'll be able to pull the box back down again in ten years and pick right back up reading it again.<p>But the electronic copy has <i>no</i> intrinsic value; I can't resell it, lend it out, or donate it; it requires additional hardware to use, and I can only read it on the platform(s) the vendor allows me to read it on for as long as the vendor allows me to read it. If I'm reading on my PC, I can't change platforms or upgrade my OS unless the proprietary reader software is available for the platform/OS I'm moving to. If the vendor decides to adopt another format or leave the business entirely, my books suddenly have a drop-dead date: once my hardware breaks, I lose the titles I've bought forever.<p>A lot of these issues go away with non-DRMed titles, but in all but a few cases (bulky tech reference titles for example) a DRM-free eBook is still unlikely to be worth as much to me as the print version.<p>And you really don't want to get into the ""dollars per hour"" argument here. The iPhone game I just finished up cost me a dollar and I got a good 20+ hours of play time out of it. But I can get through an average-sized book in four or five hours, so if I went by price per enjoyment-hour, it'd make that book worth about twenty-five cents.

I think you'd find that most Americans - Democrats, Independents and Republicans are unhappy with how much was spent under Bush, but by the same token, I don't think it's unreasonable to note that the deficit under the Obama administration  <i>last year alone</i> was $1.074 trillion dollars while the Bush administrations had an average annual budget deficit of about $104 billion per year.<p>Let me repeat and rephrase given how stunning it is - the Obama administration's deficit last year alone was greater than all the deficits combined under the Bush Administration including all the war spending.  I think it's fair to argue that last year was unusual but deficits are also projected to remain high for the forseeable future and the Obama administration has additional significant spending programs in the years beyond his current proposed modest spending freeze.<p>EDIT - I erred - I used an average of 104 billion under the Bush administration when it was an average of 104 billion under the 12 years of the Republican controlled budgets which extends into Clinton's last administration.
