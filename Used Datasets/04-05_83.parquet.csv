For example, MIT libraries were open, but I wasn't even allowed to browse the stacks in some of Harvard's libraries-- let alone to check out a book.<p>In my memory, one of the things MIT did very well was avoiding barriers between academic departments.  They had lots of research groups comprising professors and students from multiple fields, and there were no limits on what classes you could take based on what department you were in.  (When I moved to Berkeley a few years later, I was surprised to discover I couldn't take a class in the journalism school unless I was enrolled as a journalism student.)<p>On the other hand, MIT did somewhat cultivate an exclusive attitude among its students-- particularly the undergrads.  During my time there, I felt there was a pervasive strain of ""We're the best in the world..."" getting shaded into ""...therefore nobody else is any good.""  I imagine if I had gone there after attending Harvard, I wouldn't have noticed so much, but as a midwesterner whose prior academic experience was at University of Cincinnati, it did seem to me that MIT spent a lot of time stroking the egos of its community.",1347080096.0

While historically dependent on the export of bananas and coffee, Honduras has diversified its export base to include apparel and automobile wire harnessing. Nearly half of Honduras's economic activity is directly tied to the US, with exports to the US accounting for 30% of GDP and remittances for another 20%. The US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) came into force in 2006 and has helped foster foreign direct investment, but physical and political insecurity, as well as crime and perceptions of corruption, may deter potential investors; about 70% of FDI is from US firms. The economy registered sluggish economic growth in 2010, insufficient to improve living standards for the nearly 65% of the population in poverty. The LOBO administration inherited a difficult fiscal position with off-budget debts accrued in previous administrations and government salaries nearly equivalent to tax collections. His government has displayed a commitment to improving tax collection and cutting expenditures, and attracting foreign investment. This enabled Tegucigalpa to secure an IMF Precautionary Stand-By agreement in October 2010. The IMF agreement has helped renew multilateral and bilateral donor confidence in Honduras following the ZELAYA administration's economic mismanagement and the 2009 coup.</i><p><a href=""https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ho.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/...</a>",1347079479.0

Then you store the sequence of phonemes, which is probably a triplet of integers (phoneme ID, timestamp, volume level), along with a waveform representing the difference between your phoneme-generated waveform and the original. You compress both of them. Since the difference is much smaller than the original waveform, you save lots of space.",1347078141.0
