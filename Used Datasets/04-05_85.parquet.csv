Having a cheeseburger doesn't mean you don't care at all about your health, it means you've decided that the short-term pleasure it gives you is more valuable than the long-term benefits from having a salad instead. And if you're indifferent between the taste of regular and diet Coke, it makes perfect sense to go for the healthier one.<p>The no-sugar-no-burgers-ever crowd is oddly similar to the abstinence-only-sex-ed crowd.

No consultant worth their salt would have allowed SpaceX to handle the secondary mission failure they way they did. They made a series of classic and potentially disastrous mistakes. The best thing they could have done was address the issue head on with what information they had and then filled in further details as they were known.<p>To build credibility you have to admit failure. You can't just omit the bad news while focusing on the good news. You can't allow rumor and speculation to be your spokesperson. There's no way around the fact that an engine failure led to the failure of their secondary mission. Test platform or not, fully insured or not, an expensive piece of hardware became a shooting star. Someone didn't get what they paid for.<p>How it was handled was seriously amateurish. It made me cringe because I really want to see SpaceX (and Musk) succeed.

To give you a small example, say if you are running PayPal- For a company of that scale you can't really plan any thing on the business side unless you measure things, so suddenly you see a requirement for a system which will deal only with metrics and analytics. Once your user base grows out to a large size, suddenly you will find yourself running large data centers, service engineering teams and their operations. You will need dedicated sales teams to tackle those problems, product teams to ensure crap doesn't shipped out. You will need architects who can make a dozen systems work together, you will product managers decide the right technical course for the future. You will need program managers to ensure engineers hit the deadlines. You will need QE teams to break stuff what engineers overlook.<p>Yes you can argue that you may not need all that, but when you do that you will inevitably find somebody or the other in the organization doing those jobs, albeit the scenario will now be a lot more chaotic with no center of ownerships and responsibility.<p>It becomes difficult to move quickly in such places.",1350103832.0

The current homepage design is arguably more minimalistic and useful than any design from 2000 onwards. Links to other Google services are conveniently located in a bar at the top where they don't get in the way (as opposed to crowding the area around the search box previously). I can click a microphone and speak my query. When I start typing, results start loading instantly. All improvements in my book, and definitely worth it for the broadband world, which is probably a lot of Google's business at this point.

It originally compiled down to native code on the server via OCaml as well as front-end Javascript, until the more recent switch to using Node.js on the backend. A lot of the security benefits it offers likely come from the type system (with type inference), probably similar to building a site in Haskell (compile-time errors on unclean strings, type-safe URLs, etc.).<p>Along side of this, it includes a slew of libraries and tools for doing things like authentication, interfacing with specific web services, and building websites, which is why it seems they've started to focus on the ""framework"" aspect.",1350103246.0

What made the idea profitable for the firms was that LPs that invested in years 4-6 did so based on IRR, without examining things in detail and effectively overpaid for a piece.",1350101223.0
