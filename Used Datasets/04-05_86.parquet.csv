I didn't know very much about it, but I recognized the name. There were Project Gutenberg discs floating around the conference so I snagged one and had a look.<p>I don't really remember anything specific from the talk, but I remember it was inspiring. It was called""Using eBooks to Break Down the Bars of Ignorance and Illiteracy"". There's audio of the talk online, and I think I need to hear it again.<p>The next day was the last day of the conference, and as was usual Jello Biafra was the getting far less attention than the other keynote speakers. They'd closed off the back part of the main hall, a hall which had been filled to capacity and then some for Michael, and some of us were tossing around beach balls. I pounded one particularly hard and hit some guy in the back of the head with it. When he turned around I recognized Michael. I don't think he was too happy with me in that moment.<p>With the eloquence that only a twenty year old can muster, I stuck my hand out and said ""I love your work. It's fucking absurd."" That's about the highest compliment I can give a person, and I'm glad to see that Shaw quote in the obituary. It says what I was awkwardly trying to express.<p>The tension drained out of the situation, and he shook my hand before turning back to his companion and returning to his conversation. I went back to playing with beach balls.<p>I admire what Michael built, and I admire how he did it. Project Gutenberg was slow but steady, and will continue past his death.

The complaint is <i>what the fuck was all that bullshit we've been doing for three fucking years if it didn't make any fucking difference - as demonstrated by your ""viable billing prices""?</i><p>And what does it say about their competence? After three years, they only discovered in May that they were measuring the wrong thing? Google? The analysis company. Only in May someone decided to look at how all the ""brilliant GAE Way"" actually impacted performance and resources? Nobody thought, ""this cpu billing is all very well, but we are actually running 20 bazillion machines to serve 5 web pages per second - maybe our model might be wrong"".<p>For the tiny guys, the free plan is viable. Perhaps for the giant guys, (I don't know) the plan is viable. For everyone in the middle, it <i>is</i> better to go to EC2. The only people who say they are staying are those who do not have the competence to move to EC2 or Heroku, i.e. non engineers every one of them.<p>So GAE used to be all ""Hey, engineers, come code to our awesome paradigm shifting api, and you can be efficient and scale.""<p>Now GAE is, ""Hey, MBAs and Muggles, have your monkeys write generic java/python and we'll make it scale no matter what the cost (to you)!""",1315455897.0
