Flow structures in this regime (low Re, that is low speed and small length scales) are notoriously sensitive to surface defects, e.g. the hairs being analyzed. A CFD sim will show nearly the same results for a given problem, and current CFD lacks the fidelity to really model tiny turbulent features at these scales as well as the necessary fine surface definition. Experimental results may show drastically different results depending on the minute upstream flow variations, and surface quality: in this case, legs with hair/sweat/dust/oils could all trip the boundary layer to varying degrees.

Firms manage and guide their funds, and charge a management fee. While managing a fund is a largely personal intensive business, much like consulting, there are some economies of scale which is why many Firms will have multiple funds. This also further protects against risk.<p>YC and other accelerators are Firms, potentially with multiple funds, but all of their funds are at the low/angel end.",1410235643.0
