SendGrid for email was an early, obvious choice.  I'll be migrating many of my blogs to WPEngine fairly soon.  (I'll write up my rationale for that at length after it happens.  They're a client, so take my arguments with a grain of salt, but it became <i>painfully</i> obvious when working with them that it was the right call.)<p>If I got a do-over on my two main software products I would probably re-write them to use Heroku over self-hosting them on my VPS.  It would have avoided ~6 minor service disruptions and ~2 catastrophes in the last year, plus saved me about two weeks of lost billable time.  (Mostly lost due to having a very involved migration from Slicehost to Rackspace which went fairly poorly, principally due to failing to invest another few weeks preparing thoroughly for it.)<p>I can't justify a rewrite of BCC or AR at the moment to migrate to Heroku, though, as they're both multiple weeks of work with high probability of breaking something, and my anticipated costs due to I'm Not Always A Sysadmin But When I Am I Only Fail On The Hard Stuff this year don't quite justify it.  (Please, please, nobody buy Rackspace to shut it down.  One migration was enough.)",1326601634

Over the long term I think this could be good. I also think the topic of ""Japanese Candy"" is big enough for you to write/video about it once or twice a week.<p>As for the service itself - I think it lends well to word of mouth, or at least it could. People get their candy and share it with others, and those others ask where you got their candy. I was a subscriber for probably 4-5 months, and at least two of my friends signed up because of my word of mouth.<p>Thing is, all three of us have unsubscribed - and for all three of us, it actually came down to the quality of the candy (or perhaps, it came down to our tastes in candy). I know originally (and maybe still) your thing was about sending people Japanese candy they can't get outside of Japan too easily. That's good and all, but in the end, after a while we all realized the candy itself in terms of quality / taste was hit or miss... and with subscription, you can't have too many misses before someone unsubscribes. I'd say I personally enjoyed the candy I got half the time, so I just unsubscribed because it wasn't worth it.<p>I think finding candy that people will like rather than candy people find different or original is much more important. I think that's the difference between gaining more subscribers naturally through word of mouth and losing subscribers.<p>At least, that's my opinion on it. I do hope you start revving sales up again, though. I loved the candy when I loved the candy, and I think it's a good idea, but between myself and friends we unsubscribed because we didn't always love the candy :(",1326601418

That would not be fair.<p>And finally: Domain names are a mechanism to apply a label to a resource in such a way that the when a person uses that label to access a particular resource, that person gets the resource that they were expecting.
