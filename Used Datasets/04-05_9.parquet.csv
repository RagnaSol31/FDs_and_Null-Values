When I read a particularly genius or stupid comment, I'd like to be able to not just rate the comment, but perhaps add in a personal rating for that username, either favored or disavored. Who knows if it'd work out, but it might make things better.",1227502230.0

The final deliverable (with the ""complexity of a cat's brain"") isn't just a model or a simulation. It has to be a physical artifact which requires no more than two liters of volume and consumes no more than two kilowatts of power (this information comes from the DARPA BAA). So yes, prototyping will be done in software, but to reach that kind of efficiency, drastically new hardware is called for.<p>I'm not intimately familiar with IBM's plans, but this is one of the applications HP has lined up for the memristor technology they've been working on (HP is another one of the three prime contractors on the original DARPA grant). The benefit to the HP approach is that data and computation are both local to the applicable memristor, which is much closer to a neural system. That means no time or energy is wasted shuttling data around and the entire system state can be updated in parallel.<p>For an idea of why this is so exciting, keep in mind that HP plans build memristors at about a density of a trillion per square centimeter, clocked at about a kilohertz. You get the rough equivalent of one floating point operation <i>per memristor per cycle</i>. At this estimated manufacturing density, the expected performance of these things is on the order of a petaflop per square centimeter, drawing on the order of tens of watts. It isn't really fair to make a comparison to Von Neumann machines since the architecture is so dramatically different and so application-specific, but for certain kinds of computations these new chips will be <i>vastly</i> faster and more efficient.<p>(for the sake of disclosure, I'm working on the DARPA SyNAPSE project, but not with IBM)",1227501350.0

8,374462,comment,374390.0,374426.0,0,0,rmaccloy,,,"Ivy is an addon of sorts for ant that does dependency management (e.g. libraries, etc.) It sort of jacks the Maven dependency resolution bits and leaves the rest. It's definitely not a 'system for managing build artifacts' (and it's pretty java-focused) but you can set up your own repository and have a build target fetch them, put them in the right place, etc.<p>I wouldn't necessarily advocate this since you'd inevitably end up having to build some system around it, but conceptually it seems like what you'd want. YMMV, I've only used it for pretty straightfoward Java stuff.",1227500956.0

This is not a deal-breaker (except that I don't like Mercurial's equivalent of cheap local branches, these patch queues are just an awkward model for thinking about it), but then there is the speed issue.

One <i>billion</i> hectares?!! That's 10,000,000 km^2. That is more <i>half</i> the 19,824,000 km^2 of total arable land! There isn't enough arable land for <i>food</i>!

Over long, long timescales, this is the same process by which the fossil fuels were synthesized.

A word as a unit of language has three characteristics:<p>* It has form, i.e. it is shaped out of sounds or, in the case of written language, out of letters (characters).<p>* It has function, which (among other things) means that it operates in a meaningful sentence.<p>* It has meaning, which implies that it refers to a certain unit of thought (a concept or an idea) within a context.<p>However, when a word is repeated over and over again, it is in fact only the form which is repeated. There is no sentence, so the function of the word is eliminated. Its meaning, too, is effectively eliminated, because there is no context. A few repetitions will leave the language user's memory and expectation intact: he remembers the meaning and expects a meaningful reference. Continued repetition, however, will more and more foreground the word form to the exclusion of function and meaning, until the word literally ""makes no sense"". It is not the word that is being repeated, but only one of its aspects: the word form.",1227499799.0
