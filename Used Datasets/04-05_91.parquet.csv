In the actuarial world, there is a rigorous credentialing process involving a series of exams usually taking a minimum of 4.5 years to complete.  However, even with all of the exams passed, without experience you'd be put into an entry-level position.  If your experience is in one field of insurance and you want to get into another, that experience won't count for much in the new field and you'll probably be starting near entry-level again.<p>That's for good reason.  Academia is for teaching you known facts and theories, and how to think for yourself.  Experience in an industry teaches you how to do a particular type of work so that other people are willing to give you money in exchange for your labor.  These are inherently different activities, though the former can weed out some inappropriate candidates for the latter.",1261544023.0

A century ago it was the WCTU and the YMCA; today it's NOW and Greenpeace.<p>*If a nontheistic religion seems like a contradiction in terms, the problem is merely linguistic; English lacks a good word meaning ""all religious beliefs minus the supernatural stuff"". Whatever you call it, a nontheistic religion can't help but show its roots: a nontheistic sect of Hinduism, for example, would still be identifiably Hindu, despite the absence of gods; it would likely lack a sin-redemption narrative, but would probably include some sort of caste system.",1261542984.0

They spend about the same on marketing, though in 2007 they spent 23%, which drags the amount up a bit. But...<p>They spend 30% on SI&A, which stands for ""Selling, Information, and Administrative"" purposes. This includes ""Direct selling expenses are expenses that can be directly linked to the sale of a specific unit such as credit, warranty and advertising expenses. Indirect selling expenses are expenses which cannot be directly linked to the sale of a specific unit, but which are proportionally allocated to all units sold during a certain period, such as telephone, interest and postal charges. General and administrative expenses include salaries of non-sales personnel, rent, heat and lights.""<p>So, you can't _really_ be sure of what they're spending on selling, because it's mixed in with non-sales personell... but bottom line is, they don't spend that much on R&D, not compared with what they're making, anyway.<p>And they wouldn't have an incentive, but I'd argue that they _shouldn't_.
