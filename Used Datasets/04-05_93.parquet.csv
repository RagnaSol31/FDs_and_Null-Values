Rather than allowing the printer to move downward though the paper, why not load the paper from the top?<p>One could set a full stack atop something similar to his current design using the rollers, and the finished pages could exit through the front in order to prevent them from building up below.  The final roller could simply be removed and a slit added to the front such that the finished paper could exit the printer cleanly.  A solid plastic sheet could then be added to catch the printed paper which folds back atop the body of the printer when it is being transported or simply not in use, perhaps to prevent the aforementioned build-up of dust.<p>This accomplishes Yamamoto&",

62,6228153,comment,6226607.0,6226607.0,6,0,roryokane,,,"I like this. Im not as impressed with it as many others seem to be, since Ive worked with Encore and Sibelius a lot and they have almost this exact feature. That is, they play synthesized audio while moving the bar along with the sheet music. But it is nice to have better-played music to listen to while following along with sheet music.<p>I do also sometimes pull up some classical sheet music and try to read it along with a recording. So if you get a bigger library that includes pieces I end up being interested in, your site would be useful in that respect. I would enjoy the safety of having the red bar following along to make sure I dont lose my place.<p>You said on <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6226990"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6226990</a> that the left and right arrow keys should move by page, and not by measure, and theyre just mislabeled. I think it would actually be more helpful for the arrow keys to move by measure. Thats what Im used to in other programs, and I would want to do that more often. I often move back a measure or three back to replay a complicated part I just heard. Moving back a whole page is too much, and using the mouse to click the previous measure is less efficient. You could still keep the keyboard page-moving functions, but bind them to Page Up and Page Down instead.<p>Ive used Transcribe! (<a href=""http://www.seventhstring.com/xscribe/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seventhstring.com/xscribe/overview.html</a>) before to manually mark up the measures and beats of pieces. You say you have some JavaScript tool that helps you mark up pieces, and I would love to see it, but you might also want to look at Transcribe! and see if that makes marking up pieces easier. Transcribe! uses a proprietary file format, but its not too hard to extract the beat times by parsing the text of the file.<p>Another scrolling method you could try to help people keep their place is showing two rows/systems at once. When you get to the end (right side) of one row, move the bar to the left side of the next row, and then scroll the next row up, displaying the row after that below it.
