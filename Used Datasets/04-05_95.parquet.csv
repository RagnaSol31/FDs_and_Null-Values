13,8346296,comment,8344966.0,8345776.0,1,0,mkremins,,,"This is spot on. In programming communities, design is frequently dismissed as an &quot;implementation detail&quot; or part of &quot;making it look good&quot; (i.e. marketing). This is a distinct and recurring cultural blind spot – more conceptually interesting programming tools than I can count have been torpedoed by a lack of attention to visual/UI/UX/HCI design.<p>Design is <i>absolutely critical</i> when it comes to helping people understand complex systems. Well-designed tools work with the human brain to mitigate cognitive load, allowing the user to focus on making stuff happen rather than on juggling handfuls of information. Few programming tools, experimental or mainstream, fit this description; even fewer have anything like it in mind.<p>Successful efforts to make programming less opaque and more accessible will necessarily involve massive leaps forward in design.
