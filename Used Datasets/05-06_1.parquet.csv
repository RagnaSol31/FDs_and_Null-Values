The Bretton Woods and Federal Reserve thing are huge.<p>In 1873 there was no option for the government to simply deflate the dollar by 50% which is essentially what congress is voting on this week.<p>The relevant press release being the one saying that FDIC insurance will now cover bank deposits up to a maximum of $250,000 instead of $100,000.<p>What that means is that in a year or two all wages and prices will be about twice what they are today except for real estate.  Real estate values will just sort of hold steady.",1223013376

It's the reason Microsoft doesn't aggressively fight piracy in developing markets (and if they do address piracy, it is by making the software available for practically free through legitimate channels).<p>I'm sure there are some Open Source developers out there who do want every possible user, and want, more than anything, to oust their leading proprietary competitor.  I'm only among them when I'm thinking like a business man, and trying to figure out how to make money from my software.",1223013103

Fair enough.<p>It's just that photo editing software has a relatively high learning curve. I think (anecdotal, I have no references for this) that due to the cost of photoshop many users start experimenting on pirated copies. Mostly kids & hobbyists. Years later they may buy a copy or take it with them to the workplace. By that stage, they're used to photoshop to the extent that it's the only option.",1223011397

20,322447,comment,322394.0,322431.0,0,0,DabAsteroid,,,"<i>[nuclear] decommissioning is hideously expensive.</i><p>How expensive is it?<p><a href=""http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf02.html</a><p><i>Nuclear energy ... internalise[s] all waste disposal and decommissioning costs. ...<p>For nuclear power plants any cost figures normally include spent fuel management, plant decommissioning and final waste disposal.  These costs, while usually external for other technologies, are internal for nuclear power (ie they have to be paid or set aside securely by the utility generating the power, and the cost passed on to the customer in the actual tariff).<p>Decommissioning costs are about 9-15% of the initial capital cost of a nuclear power plant. But when discounted, they contribute only a few percent to the investment cost and even less to the generation cost. In the USA they account for 0.1-0.2 cent/kWh, which is no more than 5% of the cost of the electricity produced.<p>The back-end of the fuel cycle, including used fuel storage or disposal in a waste repository, contributes up to another 10% to the overall costs per kWh, - less if there is direct disposal of used fuel rather than reprocessing. The $26 billion US used fuel program is funded by a 0.1 cent/kWh levy.</i><p><pre><code>  .\n</code></pre>\nDecommissioning costs can be reduced even further by extending the operating lifetimes of reactors (now planned to be 60 years (70 years in Japan), but potentially soon planned to be 80 or 100 years), and by deferring decommissiong activities by mothballing them (placing them in SafStor mode <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=safstor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=safstor</a>) for what is currently planned to be 100 years. Deferring decommissioning activities saves money because the cost of future capital tends to be less than the cost of present capital (i.e. future costs are discounted), and because radionuclides decay over time which makes decommissioning easier.",1223010852

There are many many successful software companies that start off as small shareware companies and grow to make lots of money and have 20 employees.
