1,536243,comment,535878.0,536027.0,0,0,wheels,,,"What language is your compiler written in?  Most languages have an off the shelf implementation of map / map-reduce or similar these days, which would seem well-suited to compiler tasks and greatly simplifies parallelizing jobs.  We use map and map-reduce patterns in C++ heavily which is quite nice since if you've got that relatively small core of code thread safe you can mostly ignore thread safety in the major portions.<p>You also can often speed up I/O that way since you can saturate both your I/O and CPU bandwidth, rather than alternating between waiting on them.<p>I also take it that you're not compiling to individual object files since usually compilation since usual compile parallelization is based on farming out single object file compilations to multiple machines or processes.<p>I wrote some small portions of ""icecream"" which is used for compilation parallelization by the guys at SUSE and there it would actually transmit over the network a full chroot environment so that even different Linux installs working on  compatible architectures (later cross-compiler support was added as well) could execute the compiler jobs of rather different OSes.",1238219509
2,536242,comment,536054.0,536208.0,0,0,crux_,,,"As counterpoints, first consider that blame for the current situation and the proper next steps are two separate issues. The myopic (to put it gently) decisions made by ""Wall street"" most certainly are the single largest contributing factor to the urgency and depth of this crisis.<p>Second, I think it's rather difficult to pin much blame on regulators. The two levers used that have made this so particularly awful, CDOs and CDSs, were almost entirely over-the-counter, unregulated affairs, and the extent of our economy's exposure was and still is cloaked behind regulatory loopholes that allow these firms to keep it at least partly off their books.<p>Funny, the language you use (financiers, corporatist, monopolists) makes me think of Lenin's ""Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism."" Saw it in a bookstore and flipped through, but I decided it would be too cynical for me to buy it.",1238219484

6,536237,comment,536181.0,536226.0,0,0,ajju,,,"Yes it would. Along similar lines, I don't know Haskell and have no time to learn it now and so dislike all Haskell stories. But that's a lesser problem than marriage stories (which, incidentally, I actually liked). Let me explain why with an example: The kind of people who like Haskell are much more likely to like Python or Hadoop - things that I am <i>very</i> interested in. So there is a very likely payoff to tolerating Haskell stories. I doubt there is a similarly strong correlation between people interested in stories on marriage and python or hadoop.<p>If 3 of the top 5 stories on HN were about marriage, childrearing and politics  (all topics relevant to many hackers) for a significant amount of time, a Joe random with no interest in hacking and lots of interest in 1 or more of the above who just happened to drop by would be very likely to stay and contribute more stories of the same nature and none about hacking. Soon HN will be very little about Hacking.<p>All of this ignores active killing by moderators but we really don't want to get to a stage where moderators have to kill stories with any regularity. Self regulation is the best kind.",1238218814

16,536223,comment,535797.0,535916.0,0,0,shimon,,,"In the shorter term, there might be some special sauce in this site that can imbue a potentially boring task (creating and reading decision trees) with enough emotional meaning to make it work.<p>For the decider, there is the appeal of having a system to approach a difficult decision; of learning from others; of mastering a challenge and having confidence in your decision.<p>For people responding to a question and refining the decision tree, there is the appeal of demonstrating expertise and understanding how other people think.<p>And there is a more abstract appeal for deciders, responders, and just plain readers: validation that you're facing a challenge that you shouldn't be ashamed of, that you can ask for help with, and that can be overcome.<p>I'm not sure if hunch really does appeal effectively in these ways (I've only just requested an invite) but the potential is there.  Starting with that sort of potential and really listening to users seems to be how flickr evolved into a product+community that is really prized by its members/customers, and another app made with that same level of attention and attentiveness could really earn a lot of devotion.<p>The large-scale analysis and AI could certainly be amazing -- but if you want to learn from this as a model for your own future work, pay attention to how well this app connects to the emotions of its users, and how they grow the community around it.  If you're making something that doesn't have a straightforward save-time/money selling proposition, making those things work is your biggest challenge.",1238218111

18,536221,comment,535912.0,535912.0,0,0,asnyder,,,"I would suggest the following:<p>Spend $25 or whatever it costs in your target region to post an ad on craigslist. This ad should say that you're a small startup, etc. Telecommuting should be ok.<p>Describe the kind of designer you're looking for as well as the work that they'll be doing.<p>You can say that it's an unpaid internship, assuming you're incorporated in some way, and have them work up to the maximum number of months allowed by your state's laws. If you're not incorporated in any way and prefer a designer for a longer period of time consider offering them equity in return for their work.<p>If you post the above ad properly you should receive hundred of applications many from talented designers, many of whom are recent graduates, or traditional designers seeking to switch to the web. Most of all they're looking for real world experience and this opportunity should provide them with that.<p>The only drawback is that it will require a bit of effort on your part to let them know what they're doing right, and what they're doing wrong. When they're doing something wrong try to point them to examples or resources that can help them learn. You'll be getting a designer, while they'll be getting invaluable experience.",1238218080

This is probably incredibly hard to do without <i>some</i> luck, but you should marry someone who would never consider monetary <i>gain</i> in a decision about the relationship. In more concrete terms, someone who, even at the point where your relationship is ending (if it comes to that), is fair-minded enough, has enough self-respect and values your time together enough to give you a fair share.<p>Many people try to counter this by saying ""People (and by this they mean, their core principles) change"" (in other words people abandon their principles).

You can't monetize some of the less tangible assets required to operate in formal markets.  This is something that Hernando De Soto has written a considerable amount about.<p>For an example - developing markets because of the lack of property rights, a lot of people don't have the ability to borrow against their homes - or even properly sell them.  And what prices they do get, are at a discount because they have illegal additions, or what have you.  Same thing for businesses that can take years to start and formalize (that's just for the paperwork!).<p>Check out the World Bank's doingbusiness.org - and the places that are most difficult to do business consistently have the largest thriving black markets.

The resulting legislation is completely reactionary and will create all sorts of unintended consequences not the least of which will result in restricting funds to support the growth of firms that create real value.

Perhaps even more irritating is the equivalency that critics place between criticizing Wall Street and ""free markets""/capitalism.<p>I don't think anyone would say that ""wall street"" did not play their role - but it was a role played on a field designed by regulators - many of whom are the same ones who now disclaim all responsibility.

All financiers are monopolists.  All financiers will grab a subsidy if they can.
