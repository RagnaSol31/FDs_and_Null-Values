I enjoy it rather... but I definitely prefer HN's current look over the OP's.  The current font size is perfect as it is.  I feel like larger fonts make sites look less professional... can't quite put my finger on why though.  Maybe it's because larger fonts require more scrolling and is less efficient when I can read 12px (or even 11px) font without squinting just fine.  There may also be a correlation (at least for me) with large fonts and say... children's books/sites and those with poor vision (typically the older generations who are mostly computer illiterate)... i.e., less professional and more casual.",1294898240

There are lot of outstanding questions.<p>There are different kinds of depression that manifest themselves with different symptoms (manic depression, sluggishness, suicidal thoughts). What causes some but not others? The type of treatment can depend on this.<p>Serotonin plays a big role in depression, which helps explain why SSRIs are so effective. Dut is depression caused by not enough serotonin, or is it because the receptors aren't as sensitive to it? Norepinphrine is used by the locus coeruleus, and a lack of it has been linked with PTSD, panic disorders, and depression. Why doesn't this new medication make a difference? Are the low levels of norepineprine a cause or just a symptom? Dopamine signals the pleasure pathway. A lack of it means a lack of pleasure, which is definitely a part of depression.<p>Those are the big three chemicals, but there are so many other variables. There's a genetic component to depression as well. What genes are responsible for hereditary depression? Even if you inherit the gene, it may require some environmental stimulus to cause it to express itself. What sort of role does childhood trauma play with this?<p>If you're interested in this stuff, read ""Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers"" by Robert Sapolsky. It's a really well-written, thoroughly researched book on stress and anxiety from a scientific perspective. The writing is approachable without pandering, and having a bit more insight into the science of our weird little happy/normal/sad system has given me some direction in managing stress in my life.",1294897784

TechCrunch and co are not corrupted, but their inboxes are overwhelmed with interesting stories. To sort through that they have only a few options:<p>1) They know you because you had success in the past\n2) You were referred by someone they trust\n3) Your story is compelling (with a bonus if you give them some kind of exclusivity)<p>The thing is, once you have achieved 1) and 2) you can consistently get covered much more easily.

22,2098987,comment,2097590.0,2097590.0,0,0,rusbravo,,,"The main thing is the quantity. if you need prototype to  small volumes look at quickparts.com. they have a $150 min order last time I quoted a rapid prototype. Next step would probably be Protomold, they do injection molds out of aluminum with high speed CNC machines and can do a 1 day turnaround if you have the money. There's another company I've worked with called Vista Technologies (vistatek.com) out of Minneapolis that did prototypes and then production parts. If you're going to higher volumes you can go to pretty much any injection molder and have them make you parts, some will roll the cost of the tooling into the per part cost. oh yeah, vista will also do urethane castings for low volumes of parts, like less than 100.<p>I would recommend getting a rapid prototype made out of a material that is close to what you want the final product to be. prototype early and prototype often, what looks good in our heads or on the computer screen often isn't quite right in the for-reals. Use quickparts, vista, or shapeways. Pokeno is still working the bugs out of their 3d printing, give them a couple of months. Shapeways requires you to submit a .stl file of your 3D model. Quickparts and Vista are a little more flexible. I would not recommend a home brew 3d printer, the resolution and the material choices aren't as good. Also, you just want your part not to screw around with a machine.<p>I've worked as a manufacturing engineer and as a design engineer, product development is what i do for a living. If you would like to talk things over some more, I'd be happy to sign an NDA and maybe point you in the right direction... at least a direction anyway.",1294897552

Google's initial success was probably from short loading times on 56K modems, not search results. Might be why they tout how quickly Chrome can load pages.
