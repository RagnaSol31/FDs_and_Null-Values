So I can point to my programming contest experience to demonstrate my ability to quickly determine the correct algorithm and deliver correct, bug-free code under pressure.<p>Additionally, in the ACM competitions, you get one terminal for three team members. The general strategy is that you code on paper when you don't have the terminal. At USACO training camp, we were did exercises coding on paper.<p>In general, an undisciplined coding instinct is to bust out code quickly, favoring typing over thinking. This can lead to a lot of pain when you need to change things, or need to debug. Coding on paper encourages good design, by privileging thinking over typing.<p>Coding on paper is very useful. I won't dwell on the job thing, but since a lot of job interviews involve coding on paper or on the whiteboard, it's a useful skill. The more important thing is that coding on paper enforces a certain programming disciplines, and teaches you to design things correctly the first time.

I can see how the deposit will thin out unqualified candidates more than qualified ones, but you will still lose good candidates who think that the deposit is just plain dodgy.<p>On the other hand, I can see why you wouldn't want to hire anyone who couldn't be bothered googling the company they are applying for.<p>Depending on the position, you could also leave the job ad off your website, and expect the candidate to cold call you. That wouldn't be great for screening developers, but it would be fantastic for hiring anyone who's expected to show initiative in interacting with people.

Don't underestimate the health impact of the lifestyle stuff I suggested.<p>- The projects/surprises angle is my version of mild psychotherapy, and if combined with some vigorous physical exercise and good nutrition will put his emotional system in tip top shape.   At best, this will help his body heal itself, at worst having the conditions he describes would be very depressing and it would help with that.  Planning nice things for others is a surefire way to cheer one's self up.<p>Generally when you go to a doctor and are otherwise young and healthy and you present with bizarre symptoms they take it VERY seriously.  So unless there has been some very poor medical decision making going on he's probably failed all the diagnostic tests for the most severe possible culprits known to his doctors.<p>And, if I had three months to live I could think of worse ways to spend it then with a few good books enjoying surf and sun, and rewarding my physical body with the sort of pampering few of us ever take the time to undertake.  Also, it's generally not all that hot right near the ocean.<p>Finally, I thing it's important to realize that medical science is just not very good and most medical treatments are scarcely better than placebos.  Also, medicine is often very narrowly focused and very rarely advocates nutrition or exercise because typically the 70 year old with a heart problem isn't considered able to make significant lifestyle changes.",1275542010.0
