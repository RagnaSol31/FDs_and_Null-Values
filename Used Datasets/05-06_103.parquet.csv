0,4311115,story,,,1,0,biopharma_guy,Ask HN: How to set up a landing page to collect email from a niche group?,,"I would like to start an Appsumo like web portal which will provide ridiculously cheap deals on instruments and lab kits to a bunch of people in a particular niche group. Say for the people who are in universities and Govt. organizations doing physics and astronomy. However, I have no technical background(coding) for launching a good landing page which can collect email address from these niche groups. Also I have no business experience how to collect enough numbers of email address to start with. So here are my questions.<p>Q1. How should I set up a landing page to collect required information.Should I go with any landing page template off the shelf to test the idea or hire a freelance developer to do it?<p>Q2. How do I go out and collect large number of email addresses from a particular niche group?",1343627996.0

I have zero clue why they're doing them again, they had tried them before and failed.  Short of industry wide collusion, if one paper in town charges, and the other doesn't, all the online traffic will go to the free one.

I like the experience of reading a paper.  It's almost relaxing compared to the constant distractions from screens.<p>Still they're massively laying off people and not publishing on certain days.

Suits at media companies have every incentive not to rock the boat, and so soften stories, or simply focus more effort on news that is unlikely to threaten ad revenue (ie, crime and celebrity news). Occasionally, this kind of self-censorship is blatant, like the infamous Fox/Monsanto milk hormone story, but usually the effect is subtle, like the warping of a gravitational field.<p>Admittedly, readers <i>do</i> create their own distortion effect on news, perhaps even bigger than advertisers. But since that's a factor either way, I still see reduced reliance on advertising as a positive trend in mass media.",1343627490.0

None of the component ideas in the iPhone were 100% new, but it wasn't possible to build one at a consumer price-point until certain preconditions, both technological and economic, were met.<p>I'd claim this: marketing more than most disciplines lives or dies by the state of communication technology.  The best marketers in any generation know how to use that technology to their advantage.<p>But communication technology is radically different today than it was even 20 years ago, let alone 120 years ago when PT Barnum was alive.  For one, it's more digital and more technological.  It's also changing at an accelerating pace.  10 years ago neither Facebook nor YouTube existed.  6 years ago Twitter didn't.  Tumblr, 5.  Pinterest, 2.  Instagram, 1.<p>Or, think of it this way (as a marketer might): the rate at which new marketing channels are being created is accelerating.  We're talking channels that can potentially reach 1MM, 10MM, 100MM people sprouting afresh every year.  That's not the world PT Barnum lived in.<p>Why is is so crazy to think that this new environment results in a new breed of marketer, more at home in bits and bytes than in creating hoaxes which spread through poorly fact-checked newspapers and traditional marketing ""stunts?""  And that therefore engineers -- the same people who are creating these new channels -- are perhaps best adapted to this new environment?<p>It's also presumptuous to think that growth hackers -- and I'd include myself in that lot -- aren't familiar with PT Barnum, David Ogilvy, Jack Trout, or other famous marketers.",1343626124.0

Each person in the book serves to demonstrated a certain set of weakness of the character, framed in a suitable circumstance. In each one I recognize myself (and sometimes people around me), and this creates a strange feeling - on one hand it's somewhat disturbing and disgusting when laid so baren in front of me, on the other hand it's a relief to know I am not the only one to feel or do X/Y/Z.
