Both companies show a steady growth but odesk is way more successful in the last two years. On top of that elance started the market entry in European countries. However odesk seems to grow twice as fast as elance.<p>Is the outsourcing market in USA and Canada still growing that fast? Seems that odesk is stealing from elance AND is drawing from network effects or a different market effect which could be a indicator that it is a winner takes it all market,1320213249.0

I understand that the value of a masters is highly suspect, but my belief was that I needed a stronger theoretical foundation before I got back into it. From my perspective, it seems that ""coding"" itself has always been something learned on your own time, since NONE of our classes teach practical coding. \nAnd as a result, I'm embarrassed. If someone asks me what language I code in, I can say that I've had a  good amount of experience coding in Java and C. But I have nearly no experience in Python, Javascript, you name it. Everyone tells me that this stuff is learned on your own time, but I have no time to spare.\nI'm becoming frustrated as I take these master classes, as I find my time being increasingly consumed by things I no longer find relevant. Everything I do now seems geared toward acing interviews at Microsoft or Oracle (even in algorithms, my favorite class, I have heard ""now this is an interview question so pay attn"" all too many times). I don't have the time to learn how to do something as simple as setting up a complete backend, or learning objective c to make a fun app without my grades taking a huge hit. This is bothering me.\nWhat should I do? I actually thought about dropping my masters and just learning what I want on my own, but I already paid for the (very) expensive tuition and it's nonrefundable. If I try to learn things on the side then I struggle academically and I probably will half ass the extracurricular programming too. If I  go all in on my masters classes I will end up not learning what I want but will hopefully learn the theory well. On a final note, I'm taking internet and web systems, software systems, and software foundations class next semester, which I think is more practical....",1320210051.0
