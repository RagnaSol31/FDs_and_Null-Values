Current speculation is that Facebook is on course to make around $1.6 B from 500 million users this year (ie, $3.2/user/year)[2]. If Google and Facebook can do this, than surely Twitter can make a comparable number - but lets say $2/user/year to be conservative. Twitter has ~150/million users, so they should be able to make around $300M/year. Google's P/E is ~20, but they are a mature company, and Facebook seems to be trading at a P/E of ~50. For out estimates we'll split the difference and give Twitter a P/E of 30. 300M * 30 = $9 Billion.<p>People seem to think that Twitter can't make any money from advertising. In my view, this is a pretty extraordinary claim - everyone else can make money, so why can't Twitter? They actually have a lot of advantages (eg, desktop & mobile installs) that most websites don't have. Many companies <i>pay</i> to be included on toolbars etc that end up on people computers, and yet to here people here talk you'd think having millions of people install your thick client is a disadvantage!<p>[1]<a href=""http://blogs.computerworld.com/17099/google_says_android_already_breaks_even_will_be_a_10_billion_business"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.computerworld.com/17099/google_says_android_alr...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2010/09/facebook-revenue-estimates-continue-to-rise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2010/09/facebook-revenue-est...</a>",1292479115.0

15,2011242,comment,2010208.0,2011103.0,0,0,evgen,,,"When you talk about ""subsidies"" for abstract ""resources"" and then try to decouple them from the available market in these resources (through such terms as ""other things being equal"") you are engaging in a bit of sophistry.  Yes, resource usage may be greater per capita in the suburbs, but the most expensive resource in most cases is space/land and it is very, very expensive in urban cores.  Urban space is so expensive that it often washes out the more efficient usage of other resources that density can offer.<p>You can claim that in a city people will have mass transit available, but with only a few exceptions in the US that mass transit is underutilized and really only serves to get a small fraction of the urban residents to work and back; it does not serve other daily needs quite as well, so after taking mass transit back from work you will hop into your car to go get groceries or go out for some entertainment in the evening.<p>If these magical subsidies truly existed at the level you are suggesting they would be both obvious and a source of growing political friction given the re-urbanization of the American population.  Could you point out some examples of these subsidies? [And before you start, ""fuel"" does not really count since it cuts both ways in this argument and urban residents to not lead significantly more fuel efficient lives than their suburban counterparts.]",1292478615.0

If someone had leaked the truth prior to the Iraq/Afghanistan wars, then over 100K people would be alive today who were killed, some of whom are American soldiers.<p>I'd argue that the wars and inappropriate secrecy have done incalculable harm to American national security by creating for us many new enemies, people who had probably admired the US until one of their friends or relatives was injured, killed, taken captive, interrogated harshly and inhumanely, etc.<p>The Apache helicopter video showed a couple of scared-shitless youth raging against anyone in their sights.  One can't help but feel sorry for them, and no sensible person blames them for the carnage.  But is that really what America is supposed to stand for?<p>The Afghan war logs show a nation that has supported a war largely due to vital information about conditions being kept from the American people.  Are we really supposed to be proud of a war that we only support b/c information is classified whenever it might make the war effort look somewhat futile or mismanaged?<p>Both the Iraq and Afghan war logs show us how weak the US really is and how under-leveraged.  We're negotiating with terrorists, thugs, and criminals left and right.  It's far uglier than any realist would have dared imagine b/c of the lofty regard in which we hold our leaders.<p>I am not persuaded by your argument that Manning poses a risk of additional secrets being revealed.  The very nature of his alleged actions (he smuggled out a CD-Roms full of information, less than 1% of which has been leaked via Wikileaks so far) suggest that he'd be able to recite any classified information at all.  Unless you tell me he has a flash drive implanted in his finger or an amazing photographic memory I'm going to have to say that your argument doesn't hold water.<p>They're probably trying to make an example of him or break down his psychological stability.

If it's the first one then I don't think the distance from camera to object is a problem - cameras can already focus on arbitrary objects, so you can get a clear image of the target on the phone easily enough.  The hard part is from phone to eye, which I'm not sure is even possible?  Can you create a distorted image that looks right when viewed from a certain point by someone who's short/long sighted?  I suspect you can't do it with today's displays - I think you'd need to be able to emit different images at different angles (since the angle between each pixel and my retina will be different and you don't know in advance where my eye will be relative to the screen).<p>If your eyes have different prescriptions it's not going to work, but maybe you could set it up for one eye and just close the other (but then maybe it would be easier to hold the phone closer to/further from your face).<p>I wish I could remember enough about optics to figure this out!",1292477214.0

Automobile-based transportation is heavily subsidized both through direct taxation paying for automobile-optimized roads as well as minimum parking requirements that essentially proscribe building anything resembling a walkable neighborhood in many cities. And those requirements mean that anyone who doesn't drive to a business is forced to share in the cost of providing parking for a business (which can be tens of thousands of dollars a parking space).
