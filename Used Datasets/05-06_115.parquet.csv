Here we are trying to find actual load time of every site, so we are getting each and every resource(css, html, js, images) in the HTML, not just the main HTML. Normally every site has page load time from 3 sec to 20 sec. Since we have one main site and one or more competitor sites, it takes us sometimes more than a minute to generate a report. Thats why we choose to send a report by email.",1443333515.0
