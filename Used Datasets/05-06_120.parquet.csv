Because security infrastructure has lagged far behind, on by default v6 encapsulation schemes like 6to4, teredo, and isatap amount to huge attack surfaces. When 99% of the world relies on v4 based network edge packet filtering these protocols essentially amount to automatic firewall evasion. Sure the ports can be blocked or DPI can be used by administrators, or users can turn off these services but the reality is a vast majority are unaware and vulnerable.<p>While they (generally) aren't an initial attack vector, they are easily and often used by attackers that have knowledge of MAC addresses ahead of time, to hide traffic in plain site after an intrusion, or to hijack traffic in one hop away scenarios. Look at any non-automated intrusions coming out of asia and you'll see 6 encapsulation in use two out of three times at least.<p>Unless the user has turned on these tools intentionally, or is operating in a legitimate native v6 environment, OS's should never pick 6 first if both endpoints can complete the route with 4.",1289541414.0

More ambitiously you could have the same codebase used for the server-side online portions of something like gmail and also retarget that to use for offline gmail. Basically the big divide between your server-side and client-side codebases would start to disappear.<p>Seems like Google's native client system is a great step in this direction. Soon enough it may be possible to target say Lua to LLVM bytecode and deploy that to a browser in a bundle of javascript. If the browser supports NaCi you execute the LLVM bytecode with the built-in VM, if not you have a fallback bytecode interpreter in Javascript. That way you get full coverage of browsers with only degradation of performance when NaCi isn't available. I'm not sure however how fast you could make the Javascript fallback.

There is no mystery as to how his mind works. Once we understand what he has done, we feel certain that we, too, could have done it. It is different with the magicians. They are, to use mathematical jargon, in the orthogonal complement of where we are and the working of their minds is for all intents and purposes incomprehensible. Even after we understand what they have done, the process by which they have done it is completely dark. They seldom, if ever, have students because they cannot be emulated and it must be terribly frustrating for a brilliant young mind to cope with the mysterious ways in which the magician’s mind works. Richard Feynman is a magician of the highest caliber.
