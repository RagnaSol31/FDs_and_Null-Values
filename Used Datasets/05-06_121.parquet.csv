Their study showed that keyloggers pretty much never paid attention to the mouse.

Don't Think Vertically</i><p><i>It's a mistake to think that a system can be grown by scaling vertically, that is, by buying bigger machines with more CPUs. Throwing more power at an existing implementation -- which is probably synchronous and most likely already suffering from lock waits -- is only going to make it 'wait faster'. By planning for horizontal scale-out, almost from the start, a business is already planning in the direction of distributed, asynchronous systems, which will make it easier to add more capacity later on.</i><p>Therein lies what I consider to be MySQL's greatest ""scale out"" failing: locking implementation. It also hints at its second-greatest failing in this context, being parallelism implementation, leading to CPU being a limiting factor.<p>Scaling ""horizontally"" is extremely expensive, if vertical scaling is still possible. For example, a $1k server might hold 6 spindles, while a $1k storage array holds 24. The situation with CPU and memory isn't quite as extreme, but it still tends to hold. It also limits one to network (rather than internal bus) latencies and bandwidth.",1254980764.0

24,868404,comment,868109.0,868343.0,0,0,bokonist,,,"Our perception of all public figures is a facade.  Walter Lipman's book ""Public Opinion"" comes to mind:<p>Great men, even during their lifetime, are usually known to the public only through a fictitious personality. Hence the modicum of truth in the old saying that no man is a hero to his valet. There is only a modicum of truth, for the valet, and the private secretary, are often immersed in the fiction themselves. Royal personages are, of course, constructed personalities. Whether they themselves believe in their public character, or whether they merely permit the chamberlain to stage-manage it, there are at least two distinct selves, the public and regal self, the private and human. The biographies of great people fall more or less readily into the histories of these two selves. The official biographer reproduces the public life, the revealing memoir the other. The Charnwood Lincoln, for example, is a noble portrait, not of an actual human being, but of an epic figure, replete with significance, who moves on much the same level of reality as Aeneas or St. George. Oliver's Hamilton is a majestic abstraction, the sculpture of an idea, ""an essay"" as Mr. Oliver himself calls it, ""on American union."" It is a formal monument to the state-craft of federalism, hardly the biography of a person. Sometimes people create their own facade when they think they are revealing the interior scene. The Repington diaries and Margot Asquith's are a species of self-portraiture in which the intimate detail is most revealing as an index of how the authors like to think about themselves.

It seems like the author picked an arbitrary variable to make a point without enough subject knowledge or citations to back it up.</i><p>I think it's unfair to focus on the lack of details in Glaeser's blog post, when it links to his 52-page paper[1] (which the post is a quick summary of). In the paper, he writes: ""the Buenos Aires data suggests that less than one-half of the population could both read and write in 1869.  By 1895, the next available data point, the literacy rate had shot up to 72 percent, which still meant that a substantial portion of the population was unable to either read or write. It isn’t until 1939 that more than 90 percent of the population in Buenos Aires is literate.""<p>It appears that he is focused more on the historical conditions of Argentina's education than on present-day conditions.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/glaeser/files/Glaeser_Campante_argentina_revised.doc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/glaeser/files/Glaes...</a>",1254980644.0

Deng may have not had the power to dissolve the communist system in China, but a recognition of the rights to free assembly and free political speech, combined with a concrete plan towards devolving power away from the Communist Party, would have been a better option than killing people for asking for it. Russia's economy has grown leaps and bounds in the last several years--while they had a contraction immediately after the fall of communism, this was mainly due to Soviet overproduction of unnecessary and unwanted goods.<p>The British monarchy was a constitutional monarchy with almost all of the real power devolved to the nobles and the commons by the time of the French Revolution, quite unlike the French monarchy prior to the revolution. It's a fallacy to compare the two. The American revolution was an issue of home rule, not an issue of democracy vs. monarchy. And not the first such conflict the British Empire would face.<p>The Wars of the French Revolution <i>were</i> monarchist wars, waged to protect Europe's monarchs from the seeds of dissension spread from the revolution. So, technically, were the Napoleonic wars, as Napoleon was an emperor. However, the Napoleonic Code was a step forward for civil rights in Europe.<p>The aggressors in WWI and WWII were either monarchies or dictatorships: Germany under the Kaiser, Austia-Hungary under the Habsburg monarchy, the Ottomans under their monarchy, Germany and Italy under fascist dictatorships, and Japan under a monarchy.

He liberalized the economy and increased freedom of speech, but he did not allow democracy.  Yeltsin introduced democracy, and what was the result?  A terrible economy, a dramatic rise in suicide rates and alcoholism, and now under Putin, even speech is becoming less free.  If only there could have been two Dengs, one for China and one for Russia!<p>The heel of monarchism?  What heel?  The fundamental problem of monarchy was not that it was oppressive (it wasn't), but that it wasn't a very good military Schelling point.  Were taxes higher under monarchy?  Was their less freedom of speech?  Were there more wars?  No, no, and no.  Where do you get your history?<p>Look at the history of free speech for example.  Pretty much every country that has gotten free speech, originally got free speech while under non-democratic government (Britain under the monarchy, France under Louis the XVI, U.S. under British Colonial rule, Germany under Allied military command, Japan under allied military command).

Our lifespans are what they are because they evolved to be that way.<p>That's incorrect. Our genes don't care if they carry on by reproduction or by living longer in a single individual, but we care. How a body ages after reproductive age is in an evolutionary blind spot. Individuals with mutations that promote longer life aren't passing those genes on so the selective pressure if very small.<p>We don't have a clock that runs out of time. We just keep accumulating long-lived damage (misfolded proteins, advanced glycation endproducts, etc) until its enough to cause pathologies, from which we eventually die.<p>You are not the cells that you were a few years ago. Most have been replaced. But there are certain types of damage that your body can't fix, which is where an engineering approach could come in (for example, say we could have a vaccine that would make your body target beta amyloids in your brain, so you'd clear those misfolded proteins before they accumulate enough to give you alzheimer's).",1254978617.0
