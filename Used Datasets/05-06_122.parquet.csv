While I might be more inclined to dismiss this, the Kindle Fire is only on its second iteration of devices. While the argument could be made for supporting several versions back, only the second generation back.<p>Subsequently, with the number of sales the first generation has allegedly received, it seems like a much larger issue if the app were to gain any popularity or be promoted on Amazon's storefront. Amazon has valid concerns and is just attempting to guarantee at least function on a very limited number of devices. It's hard to find fault with that.",1354773509.0

Rather than edit I'll just correct myself here.<p>What I should have said is:\nThe expected future profits of Amazon would have to be 283x their own current profit (sorry, not Apple's profit), to arrive at a P/E similar to Apple's now. (In other words, to match Apple's strategy of extracting max profits to cash.)<p>That is a smaller number than I implied above, but it would still require Amazon at some point in the future to make a profit of $178 billion in 2012 dollars--more than 4x Apple's current profits.<p>To achieve that with, for example, the profit margin of Walmart (the current dominant retailer), they would need to do about $5 trillion in sales, again in 2012 dollars--about one third of U.S. GDP, or 1/14 of world GDP.<p>If we spot them Apple's current profit margin, sales would still need to be about $670 billion--about $180 billion over Walmart's current sales (at much higher product prices).<p>So while I totally understand the idea that Amazon is reinvesting for future growth, I just don't think future growth could ever be high enough to justify the stock price now.",1354773163.0

Sometimes expanded demand, if filled with more marginally-qualified workers, brings down average wages, because workers are not uniform interchangeable cogs.

Doing whatever the RIAA and MPAA's lobbyists want them to do.<p>That's not so good, but the ITU's express goal seems to be to balkanize the internet into a collection of state-controlled networks.  One of the biggest benefits of the internet is that it shrinks the world and grants everyone, regardless of what country they live in, access to the same online community.  I probably sound like complete hippie saying this, but I believe the global community created by the internet really is bringing all peoples of the world closer together.  Reversing this trend would be far worse than anything ICANN is likely to do in the next decade!<p>Of course, as bad as the ITU's intentions are, the reality would likely be even worse. The internet is so interconnected that the power one state is granted over the internet in its own jurisdiction would likely translate into power they wield over everyone.<p>ICANN is, by far, the lesser of two evils at present.  I am very concerned about the decline of respect for privacy in the U.S., but things simply haven't gotten bad enough yet to make the ITU look good by comparison.",1354772345.0
