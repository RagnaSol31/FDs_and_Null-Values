43,8755981,comment,8754775.0,8755826.0,0,0,jzwinck,,,"Look at the hinge picture.  See how the two hinge pins are parallel?  Now imagine the blades turning 180 degrees.  The hinge pins will now be at the &quot;opposite&quot; angle to before, despite that the blades are symmetrical so identical at 180 degrees to 0 degrees.<p>So at 0 degrees, increasing torque will, say, increase pitch of the &quot;right-hand&quot; blade while decreasing pitch of the &quot;left-hand&quot; one.  But at 180 degrees it will be the opposite.  This has the presumably beneficial effect of allowing the craft to climb by simply increasing rotor speed steadily (it will &quot;wobble&quot; a bit but in a spiral fashion which will let it climb without too much inefficiency).  Put another way, this means that increasing torque at 0 degrees but decreasing it at 180 degrees allows an asymmetrical pitch to be maintained at a rotational speed which can be seen as constant (over the long term).<p>In other words, your intuition falls down because the mechanism is not as symmetrical as your brain wants it to be at first glance.  Symmetry is an intuitive and attractive for mechanical systems, but it is actually limiting in many cases, and this is a great example.",1418708040.0
