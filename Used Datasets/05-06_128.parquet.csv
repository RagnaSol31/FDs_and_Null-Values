No concrete advice was provided on how to improve said institutions except for a quick mention of how Salt Lake City and Phoenix have helped reduce homelessness by giving away homes -- of course the caveat that those places have far more affordable housing and far more units to actually give away was not at all mentioned even though ~22 paragraphs previously the author was talking about how expensive  1 bedroom apartments are in SF and other tech hubs.,1397022172.0
