A few months prior, I had announced my distributed computation of the quadrillionth bit of Pi, and the concept of doing computations using unused CPU capacity from around the Internet was getting a lot of attention.  A VC asked me to look at a company they were thinking of investing in and give my opinion as someone with experience in the field.<p>Stripped down to its core, the company was pitching technology which would allow it to do &quot;useful&quot; internet-wide computations once global communication latency dropped below a certain threshold.  Going along with this was a graph showing how internet round trip times had been steadily dropping for the past two decades, and projecting into the future that some time around 2006 the latencies would become short enough to make their solution work.<p>Unfortunately, their projection had communication becoming faster than the speed of light in 2004.<p>I pointed this out to the VC in question.  They decided to invest anyway.  My understanding is that the company raised $10M before going bankrupt.",1414820512.0

You point out the main difference in our models, which is exactly what makes our talent agency work: the key is the focus on contract/freelance placement.<p>Recruiters who do full-time placement optimize for the short-term -- a single transaction -- which leads to all sort of misaligned incentives and shady practices.  With 10x, we work with the same talent over the course of years, so we optimize for the long term and help the people on our roster for (ideally) the duration of their careers.  And the talent is more than happy to pay for our services.<p>>>> &quot;Agents make sense when it’s hard to find a job or when the opportunity cost of looking for work is high enough to justify paying someone else.... For engineers, because the shortage is in labor and not jobs, paying out a portion of your salary for a task you can easily do yourself doesn’t make much sense.&quot;<p>This reminds me of the &quot;adverse selection&quot; argument we hear a lot, i.e. the best programmers have no trouble finding work, so wouldn&",
