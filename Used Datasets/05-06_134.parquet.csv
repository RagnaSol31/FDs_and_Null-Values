Lots and lots and lots of practice with arrays and core math libraries, a smallish chunk with strings and even less file IO, but not a whole lot else.  The utility of PE for language testing / fluency drops off dramatically after a short while, and starts being almost exclusively about the algorithms, which translate almost identically across similar language types.",1292392734.0

One thing I've found, is that if you can't get them to reduce the price, you can often get extras thrown in.

Extra value to me, over $700. Cost to supplier, assuming reasonable markup, probably less than  $300. Win win.<p>Edit: few things:<p>* Most important of all - don't be a dick. Be friendly, honest and don't waste people's time<p>* If you can, hold of your purchase until you get the deal you're looking for. When I got my macbook, I when to a number of places and in the end got free applecare and a free case.<p>* If you're buying white/brown goods (except computers), a simple ""What price can you do on that?"" will almost always see a 10% discount, sometimes way more.<p>* Some stock is in constant demand, and you'll almost never get a discount. Black mens trousers, for example.<p>* If something on offer, the person selling it want's to get rid of it, and will most likely negotiate. Best example is food at the end of the day.

In US, it works similar but not 100% the same. Oracle filled suit in US, and they couldn't do it in EU anyway because there are no swpats in (most of) EU.<p>""If SUN would have chosen the Apache License or GPL ver 3 (which was already available at that time) this wouldn't have been an issue.""<p>If Oracle changes OpenJDK license to GPLv3 today, that would make zero difference to Google Vs Orale case. Dalvik is ASL, not GPLv3. When you release something to GPLv3, you don't give patent grant to everyone and their mother. Only to licensees of your code, that is people that ""convey"" it (GPLv3 word for ""distribute""), develop it, or use it in changed or unchanged form. Basically, patent license is granted under GPLv3 in a similar way copyright license is granted. Everything you can are allowed to do with GPLv3 code is covered. And that is pretty much same intent as GPLv2's, just that in some countries GPLv2 patent grant is not sufficient, due to law that requires license to be explicit. Some EU countries are like that, but not US, since there is practice of estoppel in US.<p>And since google avoided GPLv2 OpenJDK and made ASL'd dalvik, I am pretty sure they would do the same if license was GPL. So how would GPLv3 help google?<p>Now, Apache license has similar patent grant, except that Apache license allows proprietary forks. So it is still patent grant for those who use code and not whole world. It doesn't protect GPLv3 programs unless you incorporate code from ASL'd project in question. Except that everybody can take that code and take it proprietary, extend it, and patent extensions. Somehow, I think that is not that Sun wanted. I remember Jonathan Schwartz in 2005 (or so) saying that they don't want to opensource Java because of their previous experience with Microsoft. James Gosling said something similar recently, as the reason why they didn't go open sooner. So Java under ASL is something that Sun really didn't want to see, whether it be their Java, or reimplemented by Apache or Google. So I am really not all that surprised by this lawsuit. And I don't think OpenJDK is any less Free because of this. What is problem with OpenJDK are not patents, but control by Oracle. And Oracle's intentions are way harder to predict than Sun's, so I won't even try. I only can see that they have no plans of releasing Java under ASL or even letting anyone implement it under that license.<p>Please don't interpret this as support for Oracle suing Google or anything similar. I am just saying that OpenJDK is not legally problematic to use by anyone right now, which can't be said for Mono.<p>Mono has no patent protection other than small ECMA parts, and wording of Community promise is very explicit that nothing beyond those parts is covered. So it is very hard to pull estoppel defence for something that Microsoft never shown intent to license. And knowing Microsoft, they prefer extortion and intimidation, so they don't really need to go to court to seriously damage competitors.<p>Furthermore, it has been confirmed (by the Debian Mono packager) that even basic bits of Mono use non-ECMA namespaces, pretty much depend on them, and can't be separated to non-ecma without ""serious surgery"" (and Mono team don't plan on doing it).\n<a href=""http://www.the-source.com/2010/12/on-mono-packaging/",

What happened is that this man had his immune system almost completely destroyed to defeat leukemia, and received stem cells from a donor with the mutation CCR5 known for its reduced risk of HIV infection.<p>Basically they destroyed the HIV's food source, and likely (at least temporarily) changed the man's new immune cells to the CCR5 variant in them that reduced the effectiveness of the HIV's ability to replicate.<p>Again, from my lay understanding, HIV changes its cell protein markers to avoid being attacked by immune cells. Often there are multiple HIV variants with different protein markers at one time active in a person.<p>IMO all but the 'newest' variant likely died of attrition, leaving one or two HIV protein marker variants that the new highly bolstered CCR5 mutant immune cells managed to latch onto and defeat.<p>I could be way wrong, but from my understanding this is the closest 'model' I can think of for how this would work.

I also found another interesting pattern where the clients who treated me with the most skepticism or paranoia ended up being the ones who themselves were the most problematic or dishonest with me. Another pattern I've seen is that whichever side throws out a dollar figure first, almost always ""loses"" in the negotiations (meaning, gets a deal that is less beneficial to them in terms of dollar cost/income.) General trends, not without exceptions.<p>Also, there's no such thing as a single standard rate. Varies by skill set, by person, by project, by time/situation, by non-monetary factors (the strategic benefits or opportunity costs of doing a deal/project, etc.) So when someone asks me what's my rate, it signals to me that they are, at least somewhat, a newbie and/or unsophisticated (even if ""experienced""). Instead, you tell me what you (think you) want. I tell you whether (I think) I can provide that. We go back and forth. Then somebody (hopefully the other guy) throws out a figure.
