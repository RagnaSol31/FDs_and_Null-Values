If you want a great experience of the oceans and reefs out there, you could load up an HD video on YouTube of the Great Barrier Reef, and view something much more immersive.<p>I'm a huge fan of street view, and I love being able to virtually drive to where I'm going, and find landmarks to help along the way, like for example, a large orange building next to the shop I'm planning to visit. How is ocean street view practical in anyway though? If it's for the user experiencing the ocean or planning their trip, they could upload a quick video of common snorkelling and diving points around coastlines and islands. It would give the user much more information. As of now, it's like flicking through a slideshow, and the navigation is brutal. I'm scratching my head here trying to come up with one thing this does well. As someone else said, I'd like to see more trails added to street view, or even more streets.<p>Google, since you have free time, here are a couple of ideas...<p>1. Street view for different seasons. In certain countries, towns and streets look completely different depending on the month. I frequently use street view to browse areas I'm looking to live, or travelling. It would be useful if I could switch the images to summer, winter, etc.<p>2. Video street view. Much more time consuming to create, since the camera would need to stay in a single spot for a minute at a time, and blurring sensitive information would be more challenging. However, imagine choosing a location on the map, and feeling like you're in that area of the city, or on that quiet road in the middle of the forest where you rotate the camera and follow a bird flying by.",1348638735.0

31,4574325,comment,4574014.0,4574014.0,15,0,EvanMiller,,,"Sorry for the poor audio quality in the video. Some random thoughts that may be of interest:<p>1. I've been in grad school for economics the last four years. The program basically embodies all the things I've learned about econometrics, i.e. applied statistics. Wizard does about 1% of the things that R does, but it does them very, very well.<p>2. Wizard is fast. All the tight loops are written in C. Wizard will use all the cores on your Mac as well as the CPU's vector capabilities. This was achieved with a combination of Grand Central Dispatch and OpenCL. I highly recommend both technologies. For my research I am using Wizard on data sets with ~3 million rows, and it works like a champ.<p>3. The main weaknesses of the program is that it does not deal with time-series data particularly well, and you can't manually enter data. These shortcomings will be addressed in future releases.<p>4. The program is closed-source. I might make some of the libraries open-source. Or I might not. I haven't decided.<p>5. The non-Pro version will be released sometime next week.<p>6. I have absolutely no regrets about not writing Wizard using JavaScript and HTML5.<p>7.
