I'd also make sure it runs linux. use desktops for power that's what they are good at, notebooks should be portable, meaning comfortable to carry around in a bag for a while. Light as you can get.<p>About the only thing I would invest in is at least 1G of ram, maybe even 2G. laptops tend to ship with slower hard drives so if you start swapping you are really going to have problems. maybe benchmark your average ram usage on the desktop.<p>I've found that processor speed isn't as important as most people think, go light you'll be fine, this isn't a server.<p>last note.

5,271461,comment,271202.0,271441.0,0,0,un,,,"That's exactly my initial reason for posting this. In the singulariy enthusiast community artificial intelligence is the most important thing we as humans can create (post scarcity, immortality etc).<p>What I was suggesting is that a ""gold rush"" type situation form around the building of classifiers, such as that occurred with website creation. There are millions trying to get an income onlne creating content for adsense and affilate programs (and for free with wikipedia and open source). Most will fail at generating reasonable income but in the process a large amount of wealth has been created. The same could be done for classifiers/artifical intelligence. It would require just collecting a thousand or two pieces of data (image/sudio/text) to create a classifier, an effort similar to creating a small website.<p>The problem is that even in the past there really wasn't a large number of people working on artificial intelligence, maybe just a few hundred or thousand, and computing power wasn't cheap enough to make it work. Computer scientists that do work on it are trying to create more unique algorithms that can be published, rather than creating applications with existing working algorithms (after all they''re paid to create new things, not simply apply what's available). In Larry Page's lecture at AAAS he mentioned that there are less than a hundred people working on artificial (general) intelligence today. (you can see it on youtube).",1218261208.0

7,271459,comment,270991.0,270991.0,0,0,rtf,,,"I had a thought re: site quality -- which is that a community ends up with a focus whether it likes it or not, as the community hardens and desires a regular feedback loop -- so while Digg and Reddit opened themselves to a ""lowest common denominator"" and reaped what they've sown....YC started with a focus on hacking and startups. Which is good for YC content, since it means the people who are interested in it are predominantly optimistic, thoughtful, or both.<p>Lambda the Ultimate is another good example of this; even as it's gained popularity, it's preserved an agenda that avoids language wars and other noisy content. I would say that because of its narrow focus, its quality is even higher than news.YC!<p>One online community which has imposed some standard of quality from above, without topical limitations, is the Something Awful forums. The strategy there is to use fee-gating and heavy moderation with frequent and somewhat inconsistent punishment. The results are dubious - for some posters it becomes a game to see what one can get away with, and the overall quality is only increased in that a larger percentage of posters take time for spelling and grammar, and obvious trolls get banned, but clever ones do not. Basically, moderation treats only some symptoms of an underlying problem: people treating the online world as if they were sitting down at the bar with 30,000 of their best friends.<p>That said, the worst elements of YC in the long term will probably correlate to the worst elements of the startup world.",1218261021.0

The fact that he went to college early on comes up once in a while because a lot of posts on HN have to do with education and brains, but I have yet to see a post where he rubs it in anyone's face.<p>But there's a fundamental problem with anyone who admits to having gone to college at 13.  It's a lot like being 6'9"" at age 13.  In that particular field, you're better than everyone else, and it's plain as day.  However, unlike being really tall, people generally hate you for it.  Smart guys don't get groupies.  Smart guys aren't generally popular.  There's stigma regarding intelligence, and I'm not sure why.<p>With regard to Mensa, keep in mind there are only 50,000 members in US, out of a maximum of 6 million that fall into the 98th percentile for IQ.  If you tested Silicon Valley denizen, you'd find a lot of people on the right end of the curve. Woz, Sergey, Bill G, they're probably all in the top 99th percentile.  In fact, Bill Gates won a national math competition when he was young.<p>If you mean Mensa people don't rock the valley, you're right, but if you mean 98th percentile folks don't rock the valley, I'm pretty skeptical.<p>In any case, Colin's obviously a genius.  I for one don't hold it against him.  I don't really into buy social standards of arrogance and humility; I don't want to overestimate or underestimate myself.  I want to be accurate.

Why don't more of us get together and tackle this problem?' betrays a bit of an underestimation of just how tough this problem is.<p>That said, I would love for you to prove me wrong =) And as another poster mentioned, groups in the areas of surveillance and security (where the money is, at least initially) are making good headway on the problem.<p>The biggest problem with building predictive models, as another poster pointed out, is feeding them tagged training data. You could really feasibly load up a database with terabytes of data for most of the stimuli people react to these days (or will be able to in the near future), and even most of the basic combinations. It's a matter of tagging and classifying them in the first place that's the problem.
