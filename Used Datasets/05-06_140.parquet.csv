That way you can model it as a question x having a probability p_x of being correct. Then the total grade on problem x will be a binomial(N, p_x), which will converge to a normal distribution for large number of test takers. Then you are simply summing up a small number of normal approximations to get the final grade (and sum of normals is normal).<p>Did I model that correctly?",1431151181.0

The former gives you a reliable and predictable product, but it might be slightly lagging in tech or come at a significant premium. The latter gives you full control over your specs, but you carry the burden of fixing it and making drivers work together and that requires high tech skills and overheads.<p>Enterprise hardware aims to be predictable: large businesses have to minimise risks so they value stability and clarity in performance, costs, and technical know-how. Enterprisey products are never cutting edge or best-in-breed or efficient, but they are predictable and that helps large businesses to have a reliable foundation for planning and executing IT projects over 3-5 years with known budgets, risks, support contracts etc. This predictability is important for businesses that are not based on IT (for example, making frozen foods or assembling tractors).<p>Facebook/Google/Amazon and other software-centered businesses depend on agility and finely-tuned machines - they need their &quot;custom-spec&quot; equivalent, and they have the skills required to manage it. But many other companies have known needs and are happy with standard enterprise products - they are the equivalent of an office worker that needs a machine to run MS Office, and a standard machine from Dell/IBM/HP is a more appropriate choice for them (rather than tinker with building their own).",1431148233.0
