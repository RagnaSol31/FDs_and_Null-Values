You have to have a server that runs TeamCity - which means installing TeamCity and setting up a build config/environment. This is all well and good for most teams - it's needed to keep the team from checking in crap.<p>But you're using that setup to deploy your code - this is the missing piece to me. Why would you push from your Build Server? It has nothing to do with deployment (in concept).<p>Moreover you say that ""Rollbacks are trivial"" - which is hardly the reality for most people. How do you rollback a push from your BuildServer? Manually?<p>How do you alter your DB Schema? What if your deploy screws up your DB Schema?

Both my parents were teachers and youth group leaders.  We therefore interacted with more parent/kid combos than most people do.<p>Pick a sizable group of kids selected to indicate strong parental interest in how the children learn.  For example, kids whose parents at any point considered homeschooling them. You'll see above average scores, even if, in fact, the child in question ended up never being home schooled.   The selected trait seems to be simply parental interest in the child's learning.<p>Curiously, the Wikipedia article on Montessori claims among randomly selected/rejected applicants, the selectees performed better.  That would seem to eliminate other variables.  But it also says any difference was gone again by age 12, quite a few years before the successes cited in the link.<p>I suspect that given the right home environment, it's not that Montessori makes your kid smarter, but that generic grade schools make your kid dumber until the age children manifest individuality.

108,2418275,comment,2411500.0,2414743.0,1,0,bugsy,,,"Yeah I'm aware of that. Above I pointed out that the XX was possibly coming and would have Saturn V level payload capability. The Saturn V is a giant rocket and needed to be that big to ship a bunch of stuff in one launch in order to beat the Russians rather than longer term plans involving using smaller rockets with smaller payloads and assembling things in orbit. Right now there is less point to going to the moon again rather than Mars but there is still the issue of assemble a big payload in orbit from small parts sent in modest ships or send a medium payload in one big giant freaking rocket. The Mars rovers and such were very tiny lightweight payloads compared to sending a human contingent to Mars, and even with the XX's payload, it is still barely enough to send a Mars crew and ship. So the issue remains. I only mentioned ""without a space station stop"" because I thought that people were going to otherwise jump on me with commentary about ""yes but what about a space station stop then you can have smaller rockets"". By mentioning ""without"" I had hoped to avoid needed to have that debate. I was not expecting to have the opposite debate and sorely wish I had said nothing at all and kept the link to the XX to myself now.<p>But now that we are having to have this talk, personally I think multiple ships assembled are still the way to go. A one-shot XX launch means not enough weight for proper radiation shielding, and enough food and spare parts to make it all the way there is a problem, and enough space to prevent the astronauts from killing each other is also an issue. We still have to have enough fuel to get there and land even if there is a bunch of fuel on site waiting in pods both in orbit and on the surface. The Dragon capsule is not really big enough to prevent mission failure from mass homicide en route, something considerable larger, and larger than the XX can lift in one go with fuel and food and water is needed to avoid this.<p>The space assembly step doesn't have to be something done in a giant station over a period of months. It can be send 4 modules up one after another, dock them together and go. We assembled two space ships together en route to Luna using this method on the Apollo mission. Adding a few more modules isn't a big deal, if we could assemble (not build from scratch) stuff in space 40 years ago, we can do it again now.",1302153025

Should we decide to put it on the list, there's about 79 different ways we could do it; it would presumably be in our interest to choose an approach that works well for our developer partners.<p>With respect to (2), your description is incomplete; perhaps you missed the key phrase that demonstrates our real intent.
