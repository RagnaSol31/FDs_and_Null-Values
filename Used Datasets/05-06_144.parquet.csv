They just want to make enough money to provide for their family, buy a car, or earn their freedom. These people are the information economy's mom and pop business owners, just more technologically leveraged and profitable than their brick & mortar predecessors. Instead of starting restaurants and hairdressers they build coupon apps that are used by thousands of restaurants and hairdressers.<p>This is not a bad thing for the startup ecosystem or the economy. Quite the contrary. It means instead of only having companies at the fat head, there are tens of thousands of smaller companies fulfilling demand along the long tail. And sometimes they may even find the niche was much bigger than they thought. Ever thought air mattresses in living rooms would grow into a billion dollar company that would take on the vacation rental market and the hotel industry? I know many smart investors didn't.</i>",1344059831

It isn't even just a problem of production. You would need all kinds of control of poor post-colonial countries in order to do anything very significant about it. Even if you succeeded wildly, without development there will be a lot more people, they will all need other things like medical care which are now even more scarce, and in the end you will need even more food.<p>Once upon a time there WERE startups in charge of such things - for example, the Dutch East India Company... the development of civilization was one of the fundamental justifications for colonialism.<p>If you can make money on some kind of incubator for farmers near places with hunger problems and somehow make sure that the food gets to the poor who have no money to pay for it, then there are many government and NGO aid agencies which would like to talk to you.

My best guess is the reason it took 45 minutes to shut it off was due to a judgement call: burn through free cash, or take out all their customers too.

So given the choice of taking a cash hit (a potentially short term affair), or a reputation hit (a much longer term and most likely fatal affair), it's entirely possible Knight knowingly made the right decision.<p>It's worth note that the eventual deficit amounts to somewhere in the region of one year's net income, hardly insurmountable (and how many investment opportunities promise close to 100% return in a single year?).<p>Listening to the CEO on Bloomberg, it was clear that minimizing damage to customers was their primary goal (he made this point several times in the 5 minute interview), and that he appeared comfortable with the outcome.",1344058908

They all come in at 8:30am one morning, turn on their PCs, and the latest version magically installs itself (let's pretend there's some way that a whole bunch of clerical workers who might have access only to an intranet can do this, and that their bandwidth can support 15,000 simultaneous downloads of Chrome at 8:31am). Now, what happens if the latest version of Chrome happens to have a bug that disables some mission-critical web app that this bank uses?<p>If you're a hacker, you can use Firefox until Google resolves the bug and pushes a new update. But if you're an end user at a bank, your PC is locked down and you can't install another browser (even if you knew how). That little bug in Chrome 26.0.0.1 that got fixed in Chrome 26.0.0.2 the next day could cost the bank millions of dollars as 15,000 people sit at their desks for a day unable to enter transactions.<p>Businesses like this have to be able to install browsers using a controlled process in which all their web apps get tested with the new version of the browser. And installing a new browser on 15,000 machines takes a lot of IT man-hours (remember, the users don't know how or aren't allowed to install their own software), so there has to be a pretty good justification to upgrade.<p>Welcome to the grim realities of corporate computing...<p>By the way, you don't have to be a large bank for something like this to affect you. You could be some tiny business like a real estate broker that depends on a web app but is not big enough to be able to afford a full-time IT staffer to maintain your software for you.

It is always less optimal to have real competition, but it is always better for the economy as a whole.<p>Taken to the extreme of course, the economy might be best if perfect competition ruled everywhere, which would mean largely a nation of small businesses, artisans, and shopkeepers.

We poured a lot of money into improving the lives of the animals through the years. Things are definitely better than it used to be for the animals. The conditions in some of these modern barns are worlds ahead of the past. Are all things perfect? Probably not, but it is a process.<p>> The biggest reason is they must be separated from the mother otherwise the farmer is losing money.<p>I do not deny that the calf is separated from the mother, but that is quite different to being individually penned up for years as you claimed. I don't know of any dairy farmer who keeps the calves individualized beyond the first month or so.<p>> I have a very hard time accepting you didn't know any of this having grown up on a dairy farm.<p>The veal we raised, once they were weaned from the milk, ate mainly grasses, and corn in their final days. The same diet we fed the beef cattle. The only real difference being that they went to market as a smaller animal. If you missed that window, they got sent to market as regular beef cattle.<p>There is milk-fed veal that you speak of too, but it seems to be less common in my experience. I know that some farmers do kept them tied up in small crates, but you're painting a whole industry with a small brush again. One abusive farmer doesn't mean that all farmers are abusive.<p>For what it is worth, I'm in Canada. Maybe the US has stricter definitions about what constitutes as veal, I don't know.<p>I will amend that Canada has supply management for dairy. American dairy farmers are, on the whole, far less wealthy. Perhaps that's where the discrepancy comes into play? I imagine if you cannot make ends meet, the animals will suffer.
