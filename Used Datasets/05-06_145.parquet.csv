The whole reason we have the babble of management speech is people are avoid facing up to what they are really doing. When you fire some to save the company be honest about it and don’t pretend you are giving them the “chance to pursue other opportunities”.",1453528725.0

Not trying to be argumentative, just more of a thought exercise.  If a meritocracy chooses the best, and the wealthiest tend to have the resources and opportunity to make themselves better, then always choosing based upon merit means favoring less diverse backgrounds.  Additionally, we tend to always view ourselves as ‘having merit.’  So we will also be predisposed to choose people like ourselves further hindering diversity.  I personally have always favored the idea of being meritocratic, but am also leaning more toward purely favoring diversity, not diversity of superficial attributes, but the diversity of peoples background.
