And I say that as a guy who loved the product so much I still have boxed copies of the NeXT OS in one closet or another.<p>If the company was once priced at >$600m and the company sold for $429m (plus less than $10m in Apple stock) then it was a clear loser. Canon alone could have ended up with $200m in cash with a perfectly safe investment. In venture terms, that's a failure.<p>It was also a failure in terms of meeting any goal set originally. Almost nobody bought the hardware. Almost nobody bought the OS. Almost nobody bought their Windows development tools, their last gasp of a product. It was a brilliant product, but as businesses goes, it was one smoking crater after another.<p>Moreover, that was a pity sale. Nobody else in the world would have bought NeXT. Nobody needed Jobs or the OS; Apple, uniquely, was doomed without both. Without that, NeXT would have been out of business within a few years.

I think you might be on to something really powerful here...but it isn't articulated properly in the top 400px.<p>Maybe one suggestion might be, pushing the section that starts off with 'Recent Needs' and 'Unmet Needs' down and having a section right above it with 'Met Needs' - so it shows the solutions that have been provided to people's needs.<p>I think your approach to 'intent harvesting' is brilliant....and could be VERY lucrative.

The recording industry is not particularly profitable at the moment because many incumbent players are so utterly wasteful with their capital.<p>Many other industries are presently under pressure because they are inefficient. Retail is unsustainable and cannot compete with internet-based competitors. Newspapers are suffering a crisis of identity in most regions due to their editorial directions. Many newspapers have moved towards sensationalist tabloid journalism which turns many people off spending actual money on them because they are not as crazy as actual cranks on the internet or they are offering inferior journalism when compared to the news outlets that didn't race to the bottom.<p>Then you try to claim that torrenting is the problem and not the fault of the companies themselves. How many people who download media do you think would buy it if the price and service was right? I would say near 100%. Many people who pirate music, movies and tv I know do it because they have no money for discretionary spending. Think students, the working poor, and those who cannot afford foreign prices on local wages. Region coding is probably the second biggest reason I know of for people to pirate things. Either the content is not available because of censorship, or it is unfairly priced or media companies place long delays on making it available. I would say my biggest reason for getting all my content legitimately was getting a US credit card. Prices in Australia are often twice what the exact same product costs in the US. There is no justification for this. Companies are capitalizing on artificial barriers to competition to wring additional profits out of their customers.<p>Capitalism isn't a charity, corporations don't get money simply for existing. If they cannot compete they should pull their funds out and invest in something that can turn a profit.",1314336388.0

73,2927479,comment,2924731.0,2926628.0,4,0,redthrowaway,,,">I think karma works here at HN because it is a hidden score (to avoid the Reddit scenario)<p>That's only recently been the case, and the majority of the HN community still seems to be against it.  If anything I've noticed more low-quality comments that haven't been downvoted lately, but that could easily, as you suggest, be a result of changing demographics and not connected with hidden karma.  Unfortunately, as any community grows larger there will be a lowering of overall quality, though the number of high-quality comments may remain the same.  It's the <i>perception</i> of lower quality that drives away the best members, so a preponderance of low-quality comments obscuring a number of very good ones can have a disastrous feedback effect.<p>I recall reading that part of pg's decision to start HN was as an experiment in entropy-avoidance.  To that end, he has never sought to grow HN's traffic beyond that which the community could absorb.  Now that HN is constantly mentioned in blogs, techcrunch, on facebook and g+, that might not be a viable strategy anymore.  I eagerly await the changes he has in store for HN.<p>As for reddit's karma system being broken: that's not the problem.  It's the demographic.  The karma system works great in subreddits with a good community, and terribly in some of the larger subreddits with more of a 4chan/facebook crowd.  Determining visibility by voting is only a problem when the voters are idiots.  Also, as much as the HN community (many of them current and former redditors) may decry the devolution of reddit's overall quality, we really aren't the target audience.  Reddit is a business that makes money through growth, and the overall reduction in quality has coincided with a huge surge in popularity and profitability.  That's no accident.  We may not like it anymore, but that's not an indictment of their business model or strategy.",1314336211.0
