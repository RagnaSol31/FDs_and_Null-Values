The 2009 flu pandemic lead to hospitalization of ~200,000 people in the US alone within a few weeks [1]. Talking about the flu, you can somewhat guess the number of infected people to be much much higher. \nThe current Ebola outbreak lead to ~8,000 infected persons since its outbreak more than half a year ago in March.\nAs you see, Ebola is not very contagious when compared to the flu. Yet flu pandemics are usually restricted fairly well once they take off and people are aware.<p>I&",

30,8447629,comment,8444953.0,8446849.0,0,0,jongala,,,"The main thing that helps me is being interested in the technology itself.  The actual sport as it plays out is highly optimized/refined, as you say, but if you’re interested in what determines the performance envelope and how the different teams approach the problem of expanding it, then the whole thing takes on another dimension.  The teams design and build their cars themselves with a huge range of available resources, so there is a nice mix of scrappy ingenuity, dogged refinement and luck on display.<p>This, together with the huge budgets involved at the front of the grid, also produces a sport that features celebrity engineers who command multi-million-dollar salaries and have dramatic contract disputes, etc.  This may or may not appeal to you.<p>Crucially (for me), the teams are very secretive about what they are doing and why, so figuring out the mechanical and aerodynamic approaches that are in play, which ones are winning, which brilliant ideas are languishing on underfunded teams, etc. becomes a very interesting saga of nerdy armchair detective work.  Even the parts of the cars that they can’t hide — the bodywork — are sophisticated enough aerodynamically that you can’t necessarily tell what is going on (or copy it for your car) without a relatively detailed understanding of how it works within an overall aerodynamic philosophy.  There is a good and growing online community to get into with that.<p>Then you add the drivers; there are only a couple dozen to know about so its pretty accessible that way, and you get a sense as others here have said about who is under pressure, who has the talent but not the machinery and vice versa, and how they all interact.<p>Another interesting interaction is between drivers and cars, or driving styles and car characteristics — there are drivers that can uniquely exploit certain car characteristics, or cars that may be designed to suit certain drivers or styles, etc. and those will evolve as drivers move among teams and as the technical regulations change.<p>I realize typing this out that these things point more to enjoying <i>the sport</i> more than <i>the races</i> themselves.  I am a lot less fixated on watching the races than I used to be, but there are still some great moments and I catch what I can.  Today’s Russian GP was notably boring for the last couple of years, FWIW.  For more instant gratification Moto GP might be a better bet, and most of the technical drama unfolds over there too.  I still think F1 is pretty exciting though.",1413178983.0

These were the symptoms:<p>&quot;As a rule, however, there was no ostensible cause; but people in good health were all of a sudden attacked by violent heats in the head, and redness and inflammation in the eyes, the inward parts, such as the throat or tongue, becoming bloody and emitting an unnatural and fetid breath. These symptoms were followed by sneezing and hoarseness, after which the pain soon reached the chest, and produced a hard cough. When it fixed in the stomach, it upset it; and discharges of bile of every kind named by physicians ensued, accompanied by very great distress. In most cases also an ineffectual retching followed, producing violent spasms, which in some cases ceased soon after, in others much later.”<p>I wonder what this sounds like? The good news was it only killed between 1/3 and 2/3rds of the population.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Athens"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Athens</a>",1413176564.0
