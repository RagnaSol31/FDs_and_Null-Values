Below are my observations of the problem given what I know to be true from experience.  I do not fully understand the problem as described but I will do my best to drop some knowledge.<p>I would be very surprised if any ISP is still using routers and switches that buffer anything in software.  Even modern store and forward switches only use a very small hardware buffer for packets.  All major vendors use layer-3 hardware switching on their carrier platforms.  The ASICs and TCAM are designed to run at a high enough clock rate so that buffering in SW isn't necessary.<p>That said, wireless routers almost always use software buffers.  And so do most home CPE devices like DSL routers or something like DLink, Netgear or Linksys. \nThis article is strictly talking about buffering at the end-point.  Or host buffering.<p>There are a few quick and dirty solutions that involve TCP windowing.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_tuning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_tuning</a><p>But bear in mind most protocols that need very low latency are UDP so this might not help.<p>It's really really really hard to do any kind of latency testing without a hardware based packet sender and analyzer.  Without it you never really know if the problem is your OS or the network device you're testing.<p>If the problem really is because your CPE device has too bigbuffers than build your own.  Get a *NIX box and make the network buffer really small in the kernel.  If you no longer have bad latency than you found the problem.  If you still have bad latency then look for something else to replace.",1294637649.0

I can still ping remote hosts, with a latency of up to 60 seconds. The problem is, TCP doesn't understand what happens, because the packets get acknowledged after all. Only eventually my TCP connections throttle themselves, and it reaches a somewhat stable balance where the buffer still introduces about 10 to 20 seconds of lag.<p>The solution for me was to shape my own traffic on the edge of my ""network"" and to never let the buffer be filled in the first place.

Then they get a busy day and over-order for a week. That's an expensive mistake.<p>Next they decide to shrink the window to 3 days (more rapid feedback). Now after another busy day they find stocks dropping precipitously and order big to make up, follow by drops, followed by big orders. In an attempt to stabilise the system, they've made it worse.<p>The modern stock market has extremely short feedback times, on the order of microseconds. When a feedback loop forms on the market it can spiral out of control within seconds and minutes -- hence the 'flash crash'.<p>Two ways to deal with this might be to develop some kind of balancing feedback loop (for example, higher prices for more trades-per-second, or a progressive price for trade based on delta with the last trade) or to reduce the feedback rate.

Architectural optimizations, more cores, etc. The same game ARM plays.<p>I'm not holding my breath for 5GHz chips. It might happen, but the exponential growability of raw clock speed is well and truly over. We ran into that brick wall in 2003. We're slowly crawling the clock speeds up, but to rely on it as a competitive advantage is IMHO lunacy.<p>Also, I have to seriously challenge the notion that games to tomorrow are not optimized for multiple cores. This simply isn't true, <i>particularly</i> as more and more developers fall back onto common middleware like the Unreal engine, and almost no games are exclusively developed for a single platform (The Xbox 360 and PS3 both <i>require</i> extensive parallel programming support to really harness its capabilities).<p>Games coming out today already can take advantage of multiple cores, albeit there's a lot of work that can be done on that front still. Games of tomorrow are certainly not architecturally single-core.<p>> <i>""Even in 3-4 years, the amount of developers familiar with x86 and the sheer amount of software already available for it will trump the offerings of ARM.""</i><p>Who is actually ""familiar with x86""? Most programmers do not work at the microarchitecture level of the chain. Most of us write in higher-level languages and develop apps directly. Sure, in 3-4 years the number of low-level developers who understand x86 better than ARM will still hold, but for the majority of the programming world (the ones that never <i>touch</i> architecture-related issues) it makes no difference.

J.K Rowling is richer than just about anyone that's going to write an advice book.  She made something around 1 billion executing an idea she was amazed to see make 105k.  Her first book was rejected by 12 publishing company's for over a year. So, do what you love and double down even when it's not working.

All you need to do is find out how you can get a tiny slice of that.  Sell a 300 million dolor boat to one person or 300 million dollar soda's and they are still a tiny fraction of a single years consumption.  But, just 1% of those sales is plenty for most people to retire on.<p>JK sold entertainment and iwillteachyoutoberich sells a fantasy, they are vary different markets that need completely different approaches.  And when you start to look at the approaches to gathering wealth you can start to look at the people who where not successful.  And some times it really does just come down to luck.  So, find a nitch whose risks and lifestyle agrees with you and have at it.<p>PS: <i>Although Bloomsbury agreed to publish the book, Cunningham says that he advised Rowling to get a day job, since she had little chance of making money in children’s books.</i> Now, consider was it bad advice at the time?

Except in the rare cases (""think green"" crazies), Nobody checks the power usage of a computer they are buying at best buy. They check processor speed, memory and harddrive space.
