I also believe you <i>believe</i> you were accomplishing more than you would have at your desk for six hours a day.<p>It's been shown what actually happens in such a scenario is that your judgment quickly becomes impaired to the point where you are no longer capable of judging how impaired you are; it's the equivalent of being permanently drunk. To be sure, you can still press keys. If the work you're given is far enough below your peak ability, you may even eventually blunder your way into a solution. (Or you may not; last I checked, the failure rate of software projects is still several tens of percent, and stupid hours feature prominently in most of the failures.) But the calendar time to get your job done is longer, not shorter, than it would have been with an intelligent schedule. Degrading yourself like that is nothing to be proud of, and it does nothing but harm to your work as well as yourself.",1360130360.0

37,5175045,comment,5172897.0,5174083.0,7,0,jerf,,,"It concerns me that Go has apparently built up such a community of people who insist that there aren't any problems here and you just need to learn the Go way to do it, which nobody quite knows yet, and doesn't quite meet the bill when demonstrated, and seems to require an awful lot of copy & paste boilerplate even so. I don't think that solution addresses my concern, which is that I want to be able to take a channel, <i>and return a modified channel</i>. You can't do that by ""wrapping behind an interface"", because once you return <i>anything</i> other than another channel you've lost, because you can't ""select"" on anything other than a channel. You can't say ""Oh, I'll wrap the select behind something"", because there's no way to compose two selects together; if I want to select on this channel and that channel I must have them both in hand, as channels. So if I want to factor out a particular strategy for managing input on channels, it's just impossible as it stands now; the type system is sufficiently limiting that we can see that that is impossible to write such functionality.<p>(I haven't gotten around to coding this yet, since I've been taking a break, but the actual solution I'm planning is like this:<p><pre><code>    in the library;\n        func DoSomethingGeneric (interface{}) (interface{}) {\n            blah blah blah lots of reflect probably\n            return newThingy\n        }\n\n    in the module using the code:\n        func DoSomethingSpecific (Thing) (Thing) {\n            return DoSomethingGeneric(Thing).(Thing)\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI'd make it correct by construction, but that's annoying. Annoying is bad at scale, it means people do the lazy thing instead of the right thing.)<p>Further, I don't see any way to abstract out the pattern that you <i>do</i> have in hand; you wrote it, and if you want to stick a new type into it, you'll have to write quite a bit of code again.<p>It's <i>too soon</i> for the community to be this dogmatic about how Go has an answer to everything, when it plainly doesn't. And let me underline this: I'm not complaining that it doesn't have an answer to everything; it's young. I'm complaining that it's too early to be so <i>dogmatic</i>. This is the biggest turn off to me about the developing community.<p>I keep thinking maybe I'm just spoiled by Haskell or something, then I remember; I can do this in every other language I know in one way or another. In the dynamic languages, it's not any more type safe than anything else, but it works. In the stronger languages, I can get this done. Only Go has has a type system that is strongly typed, but forces me to bypass the system to get it done. (Perhaps C, though that's contingent on so many things it's hard to construct a fair comparison. One must first build a fair amount of structure to even approximate the problem I'm having with Go here.) And it's not like I'm a stranger to programming under very strong restrictions. I <i>like</i> Haskell.<p>(Also, I am aware that ""the community"" who is saying this is not everybody; those who are not should probably work on telling those people to tone it down a bit. And broadly speaking, I actually do like Go; this conversation is focusing on my two biggest pain points and is not representative of my full opinion.)",1360129151.0

But that can hold true regardless of whether security images are used or not.<p>What a phisher can do is emulate the 'clean' state. Not logged in, no cookie. Some users will get suspicious and leave the site, sure. It's like a sales funnel, you don't have to convert every visit to make money.<p>My problem with security images is not that they would never do any good, but that they will do more harm than good. They basically make a promise that they can't keep.<p>To deal more specifically with your example: I'm not sure what the most prevalent system is but the default one described doesn't involve an extra security question. The image is presented after the user enters their username but before they are asked for their password. If the site follows this flow, then we have a problem. Now in your case the flow is a little different.<p>It seems to me that showing users a different page based on a cookie is a good idea in that if a user hits the no-cookie version, they might be alerted.
