If the cost of a bitcoin rises against fiat, IE, the price goes up, then the currency is monetarily deflating - it is getting more valuable over time. Likewise, when the price drops - ie, after the 2013 bubble until the start of 2015 - thats inflating, because your money is worth less over time.<p>For pretty much every fiat currency there is, your money is always worth less over time.

Also, unfortunately, unlike college, it is not possible for me to sit x hours everyday to learn.  Currently, I am learning in bursts, sometimes followed by long passive time.  So I often have to revise and reorient myself when I sit to study again. I would like to avoid this.  Has anyone faced this?
