Apple making a huge profit says nothing about your ability to make a profit.  XBox wasn't profitable for a long time, yet game devs have made tons of money from it.  In contrast the Wii was FAR more profitable out the gate, but the attach rate is much lower than the XBox360.<p>So XBox360 has a bigger ecosystem, better attach rate, higher quality games -- yet was less profitable than the Wii.  How can that be?  Because profit != ecosystem.<p><i>Yes, ""true"" multitasking might be a desired feature for some people, in which case it should be weighted accordingly. But it's not anymore odd to consider a company's profitability as a decision factor.</i><p>Again, a company's profitability says nothing about the phone or the app ecosystem.  The ONLY thing it says is that Apple has huge margins which it has obtained through very good deals with the carriers.  End users buying phones are paying about the same price for Android or iPhone devices.  They all pretty much range from $50-$250 dollars on contract.<p>And while Android may not have the margins that the iPhone does, do you think anyone goes into a Verizon and thinks -- what if Google goes bankrupt?",1308290327.0

Familiarity with a specific weapon helps in terms of knowing how it flies, how it's balanced specifically, etc but you pick that up after a few throws.  Biggest piece of advice I can give is to not rush -- I have a tendency to get too ""into it"" and lose focus on my technique, so I had to slow myself down, take a few breaths, and think through the whole process.<p>If you want to get into it, I recommend two things: first, find someone who does thrown weapons and can talk you through the basics and point out mistakes in your form (SCA events are a great way to do this, and that's how I got into it), and the second is just to get a slice of a tree trunk and some weapons and start practicing regularly.<p>I found it to be a great way to relax and get my brain away from tech.

My take on it is that if you visit any one of those sites, it's typically SEO linkbait garbage where the person who owns the domain in question simply feeds the user/search engine exactly what they're looking for to gain rank. Then either a crawler will follow it to map or a naive user will follow the link and you'll see it in your analytics logs later.<p>Pretty sure there's a little more to it, but that's my best assessment of what's going on until someone else has a better explanation.",1308290246.0

Any specific manifestation of democracy is a tool for governing despite them.<p>Civil war is not more likely in a democracy than a non democracy. Civil wars (I'm perhaps controversially excluding revolutionary wars such as the current Libyan or Syrian wars because they are usually wars between a regime and the The People) are rarely over political disagreement.<p>Most civil wars are a result of either: (1) two or more competing elites  competing for power (eg James vs William; Augustus vs Anthony). (2) Ethnic/confessional divides that supersede everything else politically. For example, Lebanese Maronites are politically Maronites. They will not vote for a Druze Social-Democrat even if this is their political belief because that identification is much weaker than the Maronite one. Lebanese politics is about dividing political pies between sects.<p>China is probably in greater danger of 1 today than it would be if democratic and it probably wouldn't be under greater danger of 2, Chinese minorities don't want to be Chinese but they are too small even if they do identify politically entirely along ethnic lines.",1308288989.0
