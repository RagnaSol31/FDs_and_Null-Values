The graphic designers' comprehensive layouts become the source of truth for the design after my hand-off, because there's no easy way to flip back and forth between a wireframe and a design, nor between broken-apart, reusable visual components and their art.

21,2023475,story,,,1,3,EGreg,Two proposals for browsers - it's about time,,"I've been reading a bunch of stuff on HN about user privacy, etc. and trying to build something myself which lets the user feel secure and in control, but current web technology doesn't let me do it. So I wanted to propose two things on here, and maybe someone here would run with the idea.<p>1) I propose a simple mechanism to guarantee that a resource located at a certain URL is always the same. Similar to how we have https:// blabla, and the user agent warns us if the server's certificate is not trusted, we should have httpc:// blabla to indicate constant resources. Sites all over the world can download resources from httpc:// urls and store hashes to them in various formats, and your user agent can trust one or more of these authorities. When downloading, it would compare the hashes against the ones downloaded from these authorities, and if there is even a small deviation, it would give you a warning just like https://<p>I can see this being used in app stores for the web (curating apps and various versions of apps, like Apple does) and also for secure logins. I would like someone to make guarantees that my password is not being sent in the clear to the server that I am connected to. Right now, the web forces us to trust a remote server completely, when interacting with a website. For example, when I enter a password, I have no assurance that the server won't misuse it. (See http://xkcd.com/792/)<p>This simple change would make possible a variety of applications that we haven't even thought of, besides these two.<p>2) The second proposal is to have iframes that are on top of everything else in the containing window, no matter what. That would enable 3rd party logins (such as OAuth) do be done in the iframe, without worrying about clickjacking. The javascript inside the iframe should have a way of checking whether the iframe is of this type. At most one such iframe can be shown in any given window.<p>This would lead to much more pleasant interfaces, and once again, the user would receive the extra protection. Of course, this means that Flash and other plugins would have to play nice with this. We could implement this rather easily with a browser extension that causes a borderless window to appear (like Flash does) above the actual browser window.<p>Thoughts?",1292823947.0

Thank you for creating the tool.<p>In a probably unrelated question to vagrant, would you happen to know if VirtualBox virtual hdd can be shrinked and expanded? And if VB can, does vagrant support that?<p>Use-case: one 8GB (only use 2GB total) vm instance to be moved from Windows Server to Ubuntu Linux. Or for cloning purposes.

In that it has hooks and filters that anyone can use to build plugins for the engine.<p>So for example if you were developing a game with this engine and wanted Facebook connect support you could simply grab a plugin and use that and it would work with your game, or if you wanted Paypal to process microtransactions you could get a plugin to do that etc.<p>The problem is I'm still not sure how this system would work. I'm thinking it'd have to have some sort of PHP backend / control panel similar to Wordpress where users could add the plugins and change options related to the engine.<p>Then building a game would be similar to building a theme (but of course a lot more complicated) and it would run on top of this framework.<p>I know this is a big complicated idea but I'm sure there's quite a few smart minds on here who might want to flesh out and run with this idea and develop a truly awesome open source web game engine to make it super easy to build web games.<p>Thus my question is. Does anyone know of anything like this?

He's probably the only math teacher or professor I ever had who made math both fun and intuitive.  We had no homework, and regular quizzes.<p>He taught math by talking about the history of the problems we were trying to solve, and how people went about solving them.  It was the concepts that mattered; the equations were secondary.  He would put a problem on the board, and ask the class to solve it.  He would then give us pieces of the puzzle, until we had enough that we could figure it out ourselves.  I found the class participation to be key.  With most math classes in college, the instructor works through 3 or 4 problems for a given topic on the board, and the students spend the entire class furiously copying down what he writes.  It's pointless.  I get that it's driven by the need to cover a lot of material, but I'd rather the class work through two examples then the instructor work through 4.  Also, regular quizzes were a key part of Irani's class that made retention much, much easier.  Instead of the typical weekly homework, two midterms and a final, I would much prefer weekly quizzes, 3 (or 4) midterms, and a final worth a much smaller chunk of the grade.<p>Last semester, I took linear algebra.  We had weekly assignments that I did with a tutor (bad decision), two midterms, and a final worth 45%.  I went into the final with ~40% in the class, crammed for it, and ended up with a mid-60 in the course.  It was pointless, and I don't feel like I learned much.  I would much prefer the system Irani set up, but he's not a university professor, and he doesn't have a PhD.  He taught himself calculus with an inch-thick pocket book he picked up from a second hand store.",1292822073.0

You need to be motivated to explore an avenue by being presented with goals, milestones, structure and community, mentorship, and rewards as well as compelling course material.<p>Online learning for the most part is akin to being left in a massive library, where formal education is largely supportive.<p>The software required to disrupt education needs to be more supportive than a campus full of staff, handing out scholarships and creating lifelong relationships. That's not simple by any means. It has to take you by the hand, ask you all those questions you have horrible, inconclusive or delusion-riddled answers to and then give you a package and point you towards a goal while lumping you in a group with others and placing frightening consequences on failing to complete the job.<p>This would have to be done by creating the system to automate the process and bring the people together, sprinkling mentors into the mix with rewards for their performance, having 'tuition' in the form of reasonable payment plus a premium that gets donated to charity if the student drops out, and excellent rewards for success, such as company placements at the best employers. It could work as a pilot project with a single class and expand from there.<p>I think the real problem is, helping people find and commit to their passions.
