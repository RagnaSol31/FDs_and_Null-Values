I got an Evo 4G and was so appalled by the battery life -- clearly nobody in their right mind would ship the product knowing how poor the battery life is -- that I did a double take and sold the 4G and bought an iPhone 4.<p>I'm actually rooting for Google.  I'd just like to see them take the overall usability and build quality a lot more seriously than they appear to be taking it.  It's completely absurd that carriers are installing things like a clock with hands which prevent the phones from being instantly upgradeable when a new version of Android is released.<p>Android gives carriers a lot of perverse incentives, most of which they appear to be following quite religiously.",1302242363.0

It could be that the folks in charge of getting mobile apps made for their company just like iPhones more (not a stretch, given demographic differences) or see them as more hip or marketable and funnel more money that way.

65,2422583,story,,,2,3,lunchbox,Ask HN: challenging Google/Bing search problem,,"TL;DR: Google and Bing let you search for certain binary files like pdf, doc, and pptx; is there a way to search for lesser known binary file formats?<p>Details:\nI am researching several computer programs, and would like a random sample of ~100 real-world files made by users of each application. For example, I'd like to get a bunch of  .pub (Publisher) files, .vpp (Visual Paradigm) files, .eap (Enterprise Architect) and .vsd (Visio) files.<p>Google and Bing index a few popular binary file formats, so I can do searches like this:<p>mySearchTerm filetype:pdf<p>mySearchTerm filetype:doc<p>mySearchTerm filetype:pptx<p>However, they don't support these lesser known binary formats in the same way. As a result, searching for these other file extensions yields many fewer results; I suspect there are way more files with that extension on the internet, but they are just not turning up on my search. Maybe files with a proprietary MIME type are ignored by the search engines.<p>Also, many of the results are not in the file format of interest; they are just regular web pages that happen to have that string at the end of the URL. For example, searching for filetype:eap returns www.facebook.com/rachel.eap, which is not what I am looking for in this context.<p>My next idea was to search for a string that occurs in the binary file if I open it in a text editor. For example, Visio *.vsd files tend to have the string _VPID_ALTERNATENAMES buried in the binary. But that approach didn't work very well.<p>Any ideas on how I can achieve the goal?",1302240680.0
