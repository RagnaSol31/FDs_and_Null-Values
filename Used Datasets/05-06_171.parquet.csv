Mary Buffett wrote a book called ""Buffetology"" which is really accessible and quite good.  An author by the name of Timothy Vick has written several books on buffett. (How to pick stocks like warren buffet is a good one.)  For awhile there I bought all the ones I could find, and it was probably the best $100 I spent.<p>Eventually I created a spreadsheet that I'd use to do my net-present value analysis.  I'd take the stock's price, the historical growth, my estimated growth, and work back to figure out what my projected return would be in 5 years.<p>You know you've mastered investing when you're able to predict these returns pretty accurately, though it takes time to know if you were right or not. It is ok, there is no hurry, you can just put money aside and save it (though I'd hedge against inflation- I'd store it in gold or silver these days.)<p>Once understanding investment, economics came to play a huge role in my understanding of how things worked and where things are going.<p>The mises institute: <a href=""http://mises.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org</a> is the best source of daily informative articles on economics.  They were talking about the housing bust around 2000-2001.  Mises himself predicted the great depression, the invasion of Austria (where he was from, and where his fellow economists laughed when he said that by the same time the next year the Nazis would have control) etc.   I don't read it all the time, and just read articles that I find useful.<p>The Mises institute has a lot of books for free from Mises and Rothbard that you can download, and from many other economists.<p>But probably the best book on economics to read is ""Economics in one lesson"" by Henry Hazlitt.   You can get it in PDF form here, I believe: <a href=""http://www.hacer.org/pdf/Hazlitt00.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hacer.org/pdf/Hazlitt00.pdf</a><p>Studying Buffet is investing 101, studying economics is investing 201.<p>I also read a lot of books like ""The gorilla game"" and ""the wealthy barber"" and stuff like that.
