I'm getting a strong vibe that he's schizophrenic. I've known an unmedicated schizophrenic, and this is the way they talked and acted. Self-aggrandizing, convinced they have comprehended great secrets based on little to no data (schizophrenics often believe that have ""other ways of knowing"" or extremely heightened intuition), and a belief that once they tell the whole story of the truths that have been revealed to them the world will take notice and be amazed.<p>The coder in this story is an hero (OK, just a reasonably nice guy, not afraid to tell the moronic ""analyst"" to go to hell), and obviously prevented a lot of damage by actively working against Barr's insane plans.<p>I feel the tiniest bit sorry for Leavy and the rootkit guy, as they clearly weren't encouraging this stuff, but really, they knew this guy was a whack-a-mole and they kept him on anyway, I guess because his crazy ego managed to close sales. It's really hard to take pity on someone that knows there's a crazy guy using company resources to go on a personal jihad against random kids on the Internet, and doesn't do anything to stop it.<p>The level of invasion of privacy this guy was taking part in, against children, is pretty much inexcusable. He's not law-enforcement, and should not be allowed to act as though he has a warrant for rifling through the personal lives of dozens or hundreds of children. All 50 states have laws that cover cyberstalking, cyberharassment, and cyberbullying; in a just world, this nutjob would end up in prison. Whether these kids have done anything wrong or not is irrelevant. Barr is a private citizen, and adult, and he ought to leave law enforcement activities to the police or FBI.<p>Edit: I should point out that I don't think anyone should be arrested for browsing facebook or twitter or whatever. I was a bit rambling in this comment, and the entirety of my thought processes are not exactly made clear by the text. The stuff that I think is probably illegal is the stuff he was doing outside of his actual research: Dropping hints and threats in mainstream media and in IRC about the data he was gathering, using his fake persona to stir up a shitstorm by leaking that a security company was gathering data on the people he was talking to, etc. I had to google cyberstalking to even know if there were laws about this stuff (and there are, and in all fifty states). While I don't know if those laws are reasonable or not, I'm pretty sure he crossed the line into breaking some of them, particularly in the case of his underage targets.",1297316831.0

Bitcoins back to nothing and are only useful to the extent that you can fool another ideologue into taking them; for as long as they've been around, it is far, far easier to obtain goods or services with Warcraft gold or Microsoft Points, which aren't even trying to be universal currencies. (Just yesterday I was on a blog that cataloged the reasons Microsoft gave for various bannings, and selling services for Microsoft Points was a very common one. It's so easy Microsoft considers it a pestilence.)<p>Last time this came up on HN BitCoin's FAQ had a question directly asking what useful thing it backs to. I say ""asking"" because the answer was basically no answer at all. I see it is no longer there. This is because if they can't answer it, it is better for them not to bring the question up at all, so I guess it's a good move for them.<p>Currencies have to back to something. Dollars back to being able to pay the various governments of the US not to throw you in jail for breaking various laws (tax, fines, etc); a dollar is useful even in Africa to someone not subject to those laws, because you can trade it to somebody else who has that use. The way an economy works allows the value of a dollar to <i>appear</i> to become severed from its backing and just float in space, propped up only by mutual consensus, but this is an illusion. When the backing goes, so does the currency. History's full of examples, just look up ""hyperinflation"".<p>(Also note the difference between <i>backing</i> and <i>rarity</i>. Anybody can make something rare, backing means it's actually worth something even on its own.)<p>Bitcoins provide an interesting technology platform around which to build a currency, but trying to use them directly as currency is only slightly different than using Monopoly money, and the differences aren't relevant.",1297314005.0
