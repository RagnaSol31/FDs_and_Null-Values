You guys are typically not the ignorant masses, who gives a damn what lacquer is used on your notebook, do you use it so you can sit back and stare longingly at it or so you can <i>use</i> the thing? Who cares what it looks like!<p>I recently was given the opportunity as a reward from my employer to name my next notebook, it could be anything at all, I didn't have any set price limit, I specifically got asked to just pick whatever would be the ""ultimate"" in computing power for me.

Man I hate the world at times, you people are all f*cking crazy. It's like I bought a fork and spent all my time pointing out how it wasn't very well chromed and I didn't like the way it sat in my hand, and then just toward the end there mentioned ""but hell, it's really good for picking up food""<p>Eugh.",1248501484.0

If the business has been doing well, and those factors are present (and other explanations are absent), then it's a reasonable bet that those factors are the reasons for the the business's success. You can then examine each of these factors in isolation and assess how likely they are to continue in future.<p>With these qualitative factors settled, you can look at the numbers, especially the <i>rate</i> of growth of profit, and assume that they will continue (taking into account how sure you are of this), and calculate what the business is worth based on extrapolating that growth. Extrapolation is easy.<p>As a contrast, consider companies during a boom. Explosive growth, even in profitability, but... Another contrast is high tech companies, which can be extraordinarily profitable, but their long-term success has proven hard to predict. Buffett says he <i>won't invest in something unless he understands it</i> - as a programmer, this is great to hear from someone who is so incredibly successful.<p>Now you know the secret. When your grandkids ask you how you became so rich, you can tell them: ""it was all because of 10ren"".<p>BTW: Thanks for reminding me of all this! Now is the best time to buy stocks.

10,723028,comment,722517.0,722711.0,0,0,Empact,,,"> Whereas a higher minimum wage means some people can be dropped from the rolls entirely while others have to collect more.<p>You're falling prey to the fallacy that Hazlitt describes, focusing on some specific group, and for the short run, when in fact they harm the people generally and the poor substantially and indefinitely via forced unemployment.<p>In the minimum wage case, with people forced out of work by a policy essentially making it economically untenable to hire certain low-skill workers, or as many of them, you have fewer people engaged in productive labor.  Society incurs a loss to its productive capacity, and our general level of abundance is reduced, including for those on the margin who aren't forced into unemployment.<p>Meanwhile, those who would be gaining skills and experience in the course of work are instead unemployed and idle.  This too detracts from our human capital over time, by reducing the skills and thus earning power of the poor, the ostensible benefactors of minimum wage laws.<p>This isn't a judgment call, it's exactly the sort of thinking Hazlitt warns against.",1248500205.0
11,723027,comment,722517.0,722714.0,0,0,trominos,,,"The problem isn't that the book isn't comprehensive or fails to comment on certain issues. It's that the book's logic isn't always sound because of its author's biases.<p>Look at the first example, ""The Broken Window."" The author describes a situation in which:<p>• Some kid breaks a baker's window.<p>• The crowd that gathers notes that, although unfortunate for the baker, the broken window will provide work for a glazier.<p>• The crowd fails to realize that the baker was planning to buy a suit, and the work provided for the glazier is counterbalanced by the work lost by the tailor. Also the baker's out a suit.<p>That's all well and good, but the author never considers the scenario where the baker is wealthy and losing $250 will not affect his spending habits (over at least the course of decades). Then the broken window actually results in $250 of created work for the glazier without any corresponding loss of work elsewhere (by e.g. the tailor) or loss of value (by e.g. the baker, who in the book's scenario couldn't buy a suit because of the broken window). In this scenario, the broken window is actually a net win for the community.<p>Nor does he consider the scenario where the baker is poor but thrifty and tends to save what he has. This is a very complex situation: in the short run the thrifty baker's spending habits will probably be unchanged by having to replace a window (or at least negligibly changed relative to the $250 that he was forced to spend), but in the long run he probably will end up spending about $250 less because of what he shelled out to the glazier, and moreover will fail to procure some items of value about $250. So then the math goes like this: because of the broken window, the glazier gains $250 dollars of work today. But some other worker loses $250 of work down the line, and the baker, in the long run, loses some items of value $250.<p>The thing is, spending $250 today creates more work than spending $250 next year, because the money will keep circulating, so it's not easy to demonstrate that the broken window is either helpful or harmful to the community here. (Note: spending $250 today instead of next year has a host of other effects, like increased inflation, that I obviously didn't mention. I don't mean to make a full analysis of these scenarios, just to point out that the author didn't make a full analysis of them himself.)<p>And a more glaring failure of logic in the second applied lesson: the author says, ""No man would want to have his own property destroyed either in war or in peace. What is harmful or disastrous to an individual must be equally harmful or disastrous to the collection of individuals that make up a nation.""<p>That's just not true. (A slightly ridiculous counterexample: when a serial killer dies of a heart attack, the nation he lives in is probably bettered.)<p>(In spite of all this, I still kind of liked the book.)",1248499891.0

30,723004,comment,722855.0,722855.0,0,0,mediaman,,,"The problem facing the newspaper industry is a similar problem facing the airline industry. It is one reason why the airline industry has had terrible economics since Kitty Hawk.<p>At first, the newspaper business model was this: there were many competitors, and each competitor faced a mix of fixed costs (staff, printing facilities) and variable costs (paper, ink, delivery). All was fine, because nobody would give away product that had real cost associated with it.<p>But then the variable cost disappeared. No more paper, no more ink, no more delivery. Suddenly, the only thing left was fixed costs. And all the competitors realized they could start undercutting the next guy, while still making some infinitesimal incremental profit on each viewer. Of course, that incremental profit does not amount to enough to pay for all those fixed costs (staff) that still exist. And hence the problem we have today.<p>Airlines face the same problem. Fixed schedules and a low cost per incremental seat. So there are always price wars going on to ""buy"" seats from competitors. But then they can't make up for their fixed costs, and they go out of business.<p>Without the introduction of variable costs into web content, the newspaper industry will resemble the airline industry: it will rarely make money, and, on net, probably destroy most shareholder dollars invested in it. People will keep talking about erecting pay walls, or fixing the system, but there will always be the next guy who will be willing to provide the same thing for free to grab all those viewers.",1248498105.0
