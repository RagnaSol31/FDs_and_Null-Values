For functions that return values I need to use, I will be warned by the compiler if I forget to handle the error.  For those that don't, the compiler will happily let me accidentally ignore the error.<p>I'd rather require that all return values be handled whether I use them or not.  For the rare case that a function returns a value I honestly don't care about, I can just use _.  At least I'm not hiding the fact that I knowingly am ignoring stuff.<p>(Edit: despite the above, I still do enjoy using Go.)",1360475946.0

The peak in recent history appears to have been around 2000 at 67.3%. Currently, it's at 63.6%.<p>The furthest back I could find is 1948 for 58.6 at the start of that year. Last time we were in the 63% range was in 1980s. Guessing from 19th century, it has gone up.<p>Source: <a href=""http://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet</a><p>The key here is to understand what influences this rate. Many factors go into what percentage of population chooses to seek employment. For example, if my wife and I are rich enough, when we have kids, we may want to have one or even both of us take a few years off to raise them. This is a profound luxury in the current US society. Some countries have extended maternity leave that lasts for 3 years and includes some form of pay or other welfare payment. Such structures would easily drive the participation rate down.<p>Conversely, public daycares and other child-friendly services promote higher participation rates by freeing both adults to work.<p>These examples are meant to show that the ""machines are taking our jobs"" discussion to be a gross oversimplification of a much more complex system. So far, history tells us that we will adapt. That still leaves a possibility of a black swan event... In either case, I have faith in humanity :-)",1360475211.0

Compared with other Java web frameworks, Micro doesn't force you to use the Java language for creating dynamic content, nor does it pigment your code with Java syntactic metadata or anything like that. With Micro you can start developing your web application right away even if the only content your site has is plain text or Markdown documents; you don't need Java for that. Micro uses Java under the hood, providing you the support that is specific to the web development: localization, template languages, scripting support for more advanced use, and a modular way to extend your dynamic content with controllers written in Java or using scripting, such as: Beanshell, server side Javascript(Rhino), JRuby and more.\nMicro is distributed under the Apache 2 license and it is available as a Github repository: https://github.com/florinpatrascu/micro<p>Documentation: http://micro-docs.simplegames.ca, a Micro web application using Markdown for formatting the content; work in progress and available as an open source project too.<p>While still in beta, we believe you will find Micro interesting to work with and you are more than welcome to try it out and send us your feedback.<p>Thank you!",1360472437.0
