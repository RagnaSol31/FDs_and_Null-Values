Something like<p><pre><code>    H out in = out -> (FFIOperation, in)\n</code></pre>\nThe `IO` monad is nothing more than how operating &quot;inside of this function&quot; feels. The runtime thus <i>operates</i> the pure Haskell program evaluating its FFI demands and returning their results.<p>The AST POV espoused by this article is quite good as well, but a little bit less obvious how to &quot;step&quot; things forward or operate nicely in parallel contexts.<p>Also, in reality the above perspective is a good way to embed Haskell into other contexts.<p><a href=""http://comonad.com/reader/2011/free-monads-for-less-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comonad.com/reader/2011/free-monads-for-less-3/</a>",1412399022.0

While dairy costs significantly more in Canada I suppose the government is still quite happy with the outcome.,1412398837.0
