They have messed up the algorithms so bad that News Feeds tend to be more static than ever before, back in the good days, people checked Facebook a hundred times a day because there was something new all the time.  Today, if you check your Facebook 5 times during the day and you will probably get the same news as before.<p>They also pissed all their page owners off with Edge Rank, which was rolled out too aggressively for my taste. Since not every facebook page owner is a facebook or SMM genius, a lot of small pages lost a lot of engagement, which turns into less engagement on the site overall (from users and page admins).<p>I started using G+ a couple of months ago because of their Hangouts, but am gradually becoming more engaged on the site. \nFacebook will fall, and pretty soon I think.  Too much spam, horrible filters and crappy customization on your share settings make it a shitty service now.

It doesn't matter much how often people pass through and see the tumbleweed blowing around if they're not staying and contributing.)<p>First, they should not make people register for Google+.  They shouldn't even call it Google+.  It should just be a feature added to gmail: pages.  You create gmail pages and you manage access to gmail pages.  Access is not granted to other ""Google+"" accounts (there's no such thing), but to any set of email contacts.  Access may also be made public, in which case a gmail page acts as a lightweight blog post (though you might require login to comment).<p>That's it.  Rather than sending a friend an invitation to Google+, you'd send a link to an interesting gmail page.  If it's access controlled (not public), then when they click to retrieve it, if they don't have the cookie yet, they'd need to check their email and click the Google just sent.<p>In many respects, it should function just like Google+ does now.  Pages would have posts, pictures, comments, live chats, hang-outs, games, whatever.  And once you're on a gmail page, you could browse up to the author's profile page and see whatever other pages they'd made visible to you.  The major difference is that you could send content to anyone without the stupid ""are you on Google+?"" conversation that has to happen first now and thus can build pages without worrying too much about whether the ghost town will become a popular tourist destination.",1354859189.0

There are folks who don't even take a single day off every year in spite of having ""Unlimited vacation days"" because of a poisonous culture where people who take days off are considered to be slackers by peers. I think this is due to leadership failure because one of the reasons this happens is because the company is so ""lean"" that they can't afford to even miss one person for a single day. On the other hand, there are places where the CEO forces people to switch off their phones and GTFO because they are sick and have been working their asses off.<p>As an employee, I prefer the two weeks deal because it is clear and concise and there is no b.s. about whether I can take days off or not.

62,4885638,comment,4881831.0,4883774.0,3,0,obstacle1,,,">I have no idea where it came from or why.<p>It was very likely a product of the Reformation, and almost certainly had nothing to do with debt. Specifically, the ethic arose from the philosophies of Luther and Calvin in the 16th century. Prior to L&C, the dominant Catholic line held that hard work was a means to achieve salvation. Work was punishment. If you weren't performing good works you would go to hell. Working hard to serve your god? Good: perhaps you will be saved. But don't work too hard, because hoarding wealth is a sin. Pay your excess forward to the Church and it will help your cause in the end.<p>Luther didn't exactly turn this conception on its head but altered it, which opened the doors for later change. He believed that work was good because it served not only the individual but also the social whole. The main expression of this was a dissolution of occupation-based social hierarchies. For example Luther rejected that something like agricultural work was inherently less valuable than a monastic calling. All work had value, and all work had equal value in the eyes of God. The main thing is that each person was called to work by God, and to work was to exercise your <i>noble calling</i>. This is basically an inversion of the concept of work as punishment.<p>Calvin both carried Luther further and branched out. His was probably the first interpretation of Christianity to state that maximizing profit from one's work was not only good but also required. This wasn't a call to maximize profit in pursuit of an easy life, since even rich folk had a duty to perform hard work. Rather the duty was to improve the Kingdom of God (and one's society) through investment. This <i>doesn't</i> mean philanthropy or giving to the poor, rather something like modern capitalism where an individual's investment (sometimes, often) produces positive effects for those around him. Devoted, hard workers help to maintain a cohesive social whole, which in turn mitigates the chaos and disorder that might stem from idleness.<p>Underlying Luther's and to a greater extent Calvin's philosophies is the notion of predestination. Dominant Catholic thought posited that people were born sinners but could earn salvation over a lifetime. Predestination rejected this, stating instead that God chooses the saved at birth. That is, you're either saved or you're not out of the womb, and there's nothing you can do about it. During your life, you can't know whether or not you are one of the elect. However you sure as heck want to be, so you do your best to live in the way you think the elect would live. If you succeeded, this could be perceived as evidence of your having been chosen to be saved. Hence the social drive to work extremely hard and produce as much as possible.<p>The above is probably a bit rambling and somewhat of a bastardization, but it's generally correct. Given that, I'm not surprised that in a historically Catholic region you came across a very Catholic take on work, which is at odds with the conception of work you're used to in historically Protestant America.",1354858433.0

I open a thread with 30 new messages, select part of a message half way down, hit 'r', and find myself editing a reply to the very last message. Instead, I have to click an extra time to change the focus to the message (with no visual indication) before selecting it. Selecting text from a message should be sufficient indication to reply to that message, without needing to reposition the invisible focus. This bug costs me minutes per day.",1354856716.0

If my friends (who are they? :) and I wanted to trade with cocoa beans today we could.  Would it then be a crime for us to buy cocoa beans from each other using our country's fiat money?  One possible way of defining ""currency"" would involve fiatness, but Bitcoin doesn't have fiatness.  It would at least be debatable if such a law would apply to trading back and forth between bitcoins and local fiat money if ""currency"" isn't nailed down well for the purposes of that law.",1354856452.0
