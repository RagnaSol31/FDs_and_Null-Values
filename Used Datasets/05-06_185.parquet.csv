Is this wise?""</i><p>This isn't actually what happens.  Yes, release 1 gets pushed out the door asap, but then 'the business' expects release 2 to be done exactly as fast as release 1 was.  So 'the business' never consciously makes that choice.  All they hear is ""do you want release 1 now or later?"" and of course, they pick now (who wouldn't?).<p>Even if you try to explain to them about the concept of technical debt and how this will delay release 2, all they will hear is ""blah blah blah option (a) release 1 faster, option (b) release 1 slower"".<p>There is an element of delayed gratification to not accumulating technical debt, and large organizations tend to have amazingly short term view points.<p>----<p>But personally, I don't believe incurring technical debt makes you faster in the short term.  I don't see technical debt as 'getting a loan' e.g. it gives you more resources now but you have to pay it back later on... I see technical debt as pouring a bucket of tar over yourself.<p>Technical debt, and bad designs start slowing you down immediately.<p>Moreover, it is almost never the programmers who decide to incur technical debt, my experience is that it is some team of architects or managers who decide to incur the debt (e.g. by picking Vendor X's product that is a pain in the butt to integrate with your existing systems), and they are never the people who have to pay the debt back.<p>It is the programmers who have to pay the debt back, usually by way of unpaid overtime ... as the same managers who incurred the debt in the first place stand over them screaming about missed deadlines.<p>An example of technical debt handed down by the architects might be a particular toolset that doesn't <i>quite</i> work together, or some bondage and discipline around the methodology, or some arbitrary restriction to increase the difficulty (e.g. slapping everything with patterns whether they need them or not, or desgnating a particular database for persistence, but then telling the develoeprs they're not allowed to use SQL (yes, it's a silly and arbitrary example)).  Another example is that architects love complex abstractions, so if you give them half a chance they'll spend their time adding layers of indirection to your design.  This makes it much harder for the developers.<p>Hence my bucket of tar analogy.  It's bad enough when you pour it over yourself, but if you're already in a tar pit and the people on the sidelines are throwing it onto you... it's infuriating.",1301291017.0

How about accepting the connection but not displaying the normal visual cues that say ""this site is secure?"" (e.g. the lock icon) Is that a significantly worse alternative?<p>The argument that encryption without authentication is useless seems to be too focused on the security of the connection. The larger the percentage of network traffic that is actually encrypted the less 'suspicious' encrypted connections look. In general, this is a state of affairs that we want to get to. Using encryption shouldn't make you stand out from the general population.<p>How is connecting to a site using HTTP any <i>more</i> secure than connecting to a site with HTTPS and a self-signed certificate so long as the user is <i>not</i> presented with any indication that the site is now 'secure?' Even better, how about having an icon that is always in one of two states: ""secure"" or ""insecure."" So now the user is presented with something that indicates ""insecure"" even when they are browsing over HTTP. This more accurately represents the state of affairs. The way browsers present security to the user currently is more along the lines of:<p><pre><code>  HTTP => I can browse the web and login to Facebook\n  HTTPS (CA-signed cert) => I can now use my credit card\n  HTTPS (self-signed cert) => ZOMG!

I was just interested in your thoughts on comparing the two.<p>That's correct that ZeroMQ isn't a server. I tend to describe it as a sockets layer that has messaging semantics. If a host isn't up, you can still send messages to the socket. It queues them up, like you'd expect a messaging system to do.<p>So this also means you can open a socket to a host that doesn't exist. Imagine you turn a server on with no clients up yet. A PUSH socket will block. When you connect a client, by opening a PULL socket, the message exchange starts.<p>These socket types can be inproc, ipc, tcp or pgm. inproc is an in process queue. ipc is basically unix sockets. tcp is... and pgm is pragmatic general multicast.<p>To build a broker, you'd probably use something other than PUSH/PULL sockets. You would use REQ/REP (request/reply) sockets. These sockets give you synchronous communication. The request sends a request and is guaranteed a response.<p>I think their doc explains the rest better than I could, I recommend reading this: <a href=""http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all</a><p>I think this description offers the gist of how REQ/REP, and their nonblocking counterparts XREQ/XREP, can be used to basically script together your ideal broker for many conditions.<p><i>When you use REQ to talk to REP you get a strictly synchronous request-reply dialog. The client sends a request, the service reads the request and sends a reply. The client then reads the reply. If either the client or the service try to do anything else (e.g. sending two requests in a row without waiting for a response) they will get an error.<p>But our broker has to be non-blocking. Obviously we can use zmq_poll(3) to wait for activity on either socket, but we can't use REP and REQ.<p>Luckily there are non-blocking versions of these two sockets, called XREQ and XREP. These ""extended request/reply"" sockets let you extend request-reply across intermediate nodes, such as our message queuing broker.</i>",1301289009.0
