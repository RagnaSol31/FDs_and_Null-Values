Many people are now leaving comments that gush about the subject of the article in an overly sycophantic way.</i><p>I've never been a TechCrunch poster, so take my comments with a grain of salt, but:  duh!  All they've done is amplify the negative consequences of unpopular posts a thousandfold, because the stigma will attach to your real-life identity instead of an easily abandoned online identity.  The mechanism they chose deters people from posting comments that might engender personal hostility.  That isn't selective at all!  Everyone feels shame when they say something wrong online and a little twinge of pain when someone attacks them; that's only human.  Trolls just feel less than others.  Crank up the pain to get rid of the trolls, and you'll get rid of a lot of other people, too.<p>Compulsively positive people, of course, are safe anywhere because they don't trigger anyone to viciously lash out in defense of their favorite technology or company, and they feel even more welcome than they are because they're blind to any subtle negativity that is directed their way.<p>There's another breed of posters who will stay, too -- professionals in whatever is being discussed.  They're used to standing behind their opinions, but more importantly, they actually benefit from the positive impression they make, because it bolsters their professional reputation.  Sure, you won't lose those guys, but why would you be surprised at losing other positive contributors?  I'm only a professional at programming, so the consequence of connecting my personal identity with my words about <i>anything else at all</i> is pure downside.<p>Let's not turn every corner of the internet back into real life.  Every time you open your mouth with a critical opinion, you run the risk of personal negative blowback.  In real life, people spend their ""negativity"" budget carefully.  I use mine up in person on personal issues and work issues.  I have no desire to blow any of it online.  The nice thing about the internet is you can shut down your defenses and relax.  We're playing with Monopoly money here, and even so it still hurts a little!  I've built up decent karma here and at other semi-anonymous sites with my only incentives being my self-respect and the meaningless little number next to my id.  The anonymity that is allowed here doesn't liberate me from my morals and my pride; it just liberates me from the constant oppressive calculation of honesty versus risk.<p>When I comment anonymously, I get a chance to clarify my ideas, express myself, and receive feedback.  (Sometimes I do this by expressing opinions I'm not sure I personally hold, and which I am not ready to personally endorse -- does that make me a troll?)  Connecting my personal identity just adds personal risk and forces me to turn on all of my social defenses.  Ugh, that's tiring and paralyzing, and it isn't conducive to clear thinking.  It makes me feel tired just thinking about it.  No thanks!",1299477395.0

Without sociality -- and the maintenance of personas and ethics -- you don't exist, period.

Quirky, unique games and games that are very difficult just don't sell as well.  I think it was in GameFan (RIP) that I read the quote that summed it up:  ""The hard-core are never catered to.""<p>Game companies started to broaden their reach, to expand their demographic.  The same is happening with Facebook.  I watched my mother play game after game of Bejeweled.  Facebook's reach is huge, well beyond the demographic usually thought of as gamers, that 18-35 male collective cash cow.  I'm not on Facebook, but my mother is, my aunt is, the sort of person that kinda likes clicking cows.  Zynga's games are close to their tolerance:  easy, always there, not too deep.  The gaming equivalent of a Will Smith summer blockbuster, the type that upsets the people that really love movies.  A McDonald's burger, a Mariah Carey song, Marlboro Lights, Windows XP, Zynga: the suburbs of their industry. It may not be loved by critics, but damned if you can't make more money selling to a broader demographic than to a smaller group of devoted genre fans.<p>So, on a much larger scale, we're seeing the games market broaden and develop, the same way that we saw it happen 10 or 15 years ago.  There's hope for the future:  you can still get rich making an iPhone/Android $2 game or a Minecraft, so we still have some sort of vibrance, sparks flying from the souls of the passionate and creative.  But the way things are, there's more money in Farmville.  I've stopped being angsty and dropped my elitism:  you can't fight basic laws of commerce or Sturgeon's Law (""90% of everything is crap"").<p>I value my time, so I don't play social games (unless you count GitHub), but the customers have indeed decided what they want, or at least what they'll pay for.<p>...Where's my copy of Ninja Gaiden?
