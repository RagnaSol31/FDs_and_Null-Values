You are also what's known as a publisher. Portals host,\nfilter, select and promote games and take a cut of the in-game ad\nrevenues. In return, they provide traffic (eyeballs!).<p>I haven't heard of HeyZap before, so thanks for bringing them to my\nattention. I had a browse through their site, and saw some attractive\noffers, so if I can find more info on their system, I might be\ninterested to use them some day... What caught my eyes was their very\nattractive developer share of a whopping 70% of the ad revenue! From\nwhat I can gather, publishers get 15% of the ad revenue. Is this\ncorrect? Perhaps you could also comment on the eCPM of their offerings\n-- how much are you receiving from the in-game ads compared to the\ntraffic? I assume your traffic stats are daily numbers?<p>I am not sure why you were not keen on Google Ads, they've been quite\npopular among the portals that I have heard of. Google can now index\nFlash assets, so in-game text, tutorials, etc should get picked\nup. For more games, have you heard of: mochiads or CPMStar, or other\nportals like Kongregate, armorgames?<p>mochi: Developers get 50%, publishers 10%<p>Don't know about CPMStar (anyone?)<p>Kongregate: Developers get 25-50% (depending on features). No\npublisher affiliate system that I know of, they are after all a portal\ntoo.<p>When you say you haven't done anything recently, does that mean you\ndon't update those games on your page? There are portal software out\nthere (www.flashgamedistribution.com has a ""portal in a box"",\ndownload, click, and you're away [disclaimer: I haven't used it]) that\nautomate the delivery and distribution of games from source. All you\ngotta do is play a suggested game, and approve/reject them from your\nfront page. Sounds like a dream job for game crazy teenagers! (I'm not\nsaying you're a teenager here of course.)<p>I am sharing this as a game developer who's been pondering the pros\nand cons of having my own portal. If you subscribe to the Long Tail\nhypothesis, then portals benefit from the long tail. However, I feel\nthat the competition is intense, though I have no experience\nhere. Most portals are starting to move into proprietary\nmicro-transaction systems, but the revenue from this area is still\nrelatively small. It is definitely a growth industry, and the key is\nalways more traffic, though I wonder if it's possible to do better? I\nwould appreciate any experience you may share from your end (if you do\ngo further with this).  :)<p>Here's something that might interest other readers. Remember that this\nguy develops games and runs a portal, so the portal section of his\nanalysis is really only about 8% of the total.<p><a href=""http://mochiland.com/articles/developer-recap-badim-shares-two-years-worth-of-stats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mochiland.com/articles/developer-recap-badim-shares-t...</a><p>I should also mention flashgamelicense.com -- you might see Badim\nmentioning licensing deals in his blog. Lots of portal owners (I'm\nassuming you need to be a certain size first) sponsor games in order\nto be able provide their own branding and ads. Could be interesting to\ncheck out once you reach a certain size I guess...<p>I would appreciate any useful stats other readers may know about this\nnew and exciting (for me) area!",1268545916.0

12,1190331,comment,1188859.0,1189534.0,0,0,RevRal,,,":)<p>I mostly mean downvotes without an explanation, which you discerned. Technically, a drive-by downvote would be a subset of ""downvoting without an explanation,"" since you're not always drive-by downvoting if you're not giving an explanation. Some comments just don't belong, and those comments are normally obvious.<p>I often get the impression that the downvoters did not read a comment too carefully, quickly passed judgment without thinking about it too much, downvoted, then moved on. Hence, the other reason I call them drive-by downvotes.<p>It is annoying to see a reasonable comment downvoted to 0, or less. I feel like I'm missing something and what I'm missing is an explanation. Why was the comment voted down? Then the comment gets voted up. I'll never know why the comment was downvoted, and it feels like a small loss. What's happening here can play out in different scenarios. So, that's it. I wish there was more explaining going on, and perhaps people would be less disposed to pass thoughtless judgment.<p>It is what it is. The submitter asked for our thoughts about the downvote system, so if there's one thing that I'm going to complain about -- and I don't mean to say that this is a horrible, horrible phenomenon -- it's drive-by downvotes.",1268544909.0

(Ex-Majority Leader Tom Delay's home district in Texas includes JSC, e.g. <a href=""http://www.spacepolitics.com/2004/11/23/delay-at-jsc-and-other-budget-news/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spacepolitics.com/2004/11/23/delay-at-jsc-and-oth...</a>).  This calculus explains why, as I think you note, they didn't care about actually <i>getting to the moon</i>. ;-)<p>In particular, the VSE was not about using upstart private launch companies (such as SpaceX).  It was about JSC, KSC, and the large prime contractors (USA aka United Space Alliance, and ULA = United Launch Alliance, both Boeing/LockMart joint ventures) that are associated with them and that together employ over 10K people.  I believe SpaceX employs substantially less than 1000, even today.<p>In typical Bush fashion, the VSE was all slogans and no substance.  The officials involved believed in what they were doing, but there was not a coherent plan (actually there have been at least two phases of the VSE, with distinct strategies).  And of course, as others above have noted, not enough money.  The slogan for that approach was ""go as you pay"".  (I.e., we will do the best we can with what you give us.)

I flag locally, call for a pickup, as well as take cabs from airports.<p>I've done this thousands of times in ten years.<p>In _all_ of that time, the closest I've seen to an errant fare (keeping in mind, I make the same trip hundreds of times with dozens of taxis drivers, as well as having Google Maps give me detailed distance information) is low tire pressure on a Taxi that took what should have been a $35 taxi fare to $38.  It's amazing how little the ""waiting time"" charge varies a ride taken at a particular time.  It's usually within 30-50 cents on a $40 ride at most.<p>I've never had a taxi driver try and determine if I was a ""regular"" or ""out of towner"" - and I rarely do more than just give them an address.<p>So I find it, based on my own experiences, very, very hard to believe that Taxi Drivers are engaging in any kind of widespread scam - unless they pull it on the blatant foreigners.<p>If I ever had a Taxi driver charge me the wrong rate, I wouldn't even dispute it with him, I'd just call their administrative oversight (which, in most cities, is the local police) and let them deal with it.<p>So, as much as people want to suggest ""GPS Logs"" are uncovering something - I'd have to suggest that by and large there is nothing to uncover.
