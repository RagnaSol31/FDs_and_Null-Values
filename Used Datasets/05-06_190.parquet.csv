In particular, I used Gnome (2.14 through 2.18) for a few years, then OS X (Leopard through Snow Leopard) for a few years, and the way ""tasks"", applications, windows and workspaces are managed on Gnome strikes me as objectively better than the way they work in OS X -- with the possible exception that the OS X might be a little easier to learn for users that have very little patience for learning much at all about their computer.<p>But OS X is better at sparing the user from tedious admin hassles and has better aesthetics. Gnome 2 on the other hand allows the user to set the text size of almost all of the text on the system (the most notable exception being Firefox, which does not pay any attention to Gnome's settings), which OS X does not allow. (Some of the text on OS X, e.g., in the menu bar, window title bars and certain Apple applications like Calendar, cannot be changed with reasonable effort.)<p>Also, the ""annoying glitches"" on Gnome are worse. The annoying glitches on OS X consist mainly of the UI becoming unresponsive at unpredictable times (usually signified by the spinning beach ball cursor) whereas the annoying glitches on Gnome 2 consist of inattention to detail on the part of Gnome 2's designers and implementors, lack of consistency including ""gotchas"" like Ctrl-W having minor mostly-reversible effects in Emacs and in bash while having drastic irreversible effects in other Gnome apps (namely, closing the window). Also, Gnome would freeze, crash or otherwise need to be restarted an order of magnitude more than OS X does. Note though that Gnome and the graphical system on Linux might be much more reliable with a different video card: I only tried it with two old cards.",1320298271.0

Where are the login shells and basic file management tools to rescue the machine?  That problem exists as soon as you collect tools into one place, whether you choose /bin or /usr/bin to be that place.<p>But choosing (only) /bin has an additional problem, which is that you lose the ability to easily set up mounts.  If you have many machines to keep in sync, they could each have a relatively simple /usr mount; while you could set up root paths equivalently, you would need more of them: either symlinks or mounts in several places on all machines that all have to be kept in sync.  That is unnecessarily complicated.  The /bin option is only equivalent if you are in fact dumping everything on the local disk and not using mounts.

119,3190395,comment,3189525.0,3189525.0,5,0,ianb,,,"There's some justification in deferring to user interface designers with respect to the vision for the interface.  An authoritarian system can work, though you should be sensitive to how you present that authority.  ""wontfix"" is socially dangerous to use.<p>But authority only works if you use that authority to do the right thing.  Unity isn't doing that.  I am in part frustrated that Unity got _worse_ with the latest Ubuntu release, and I'm frustrated that it has lots of bugs, and the interface is neither traditional nor discoverable.  But even worse than these problems is the problem that Unity isn't pursuing a worthy goal.  It's a rethinking of how you manage applications and files on the Linux desktop, but the Linux desktop has never been particularly functional or filled out and it falls behind further with time.  The major trends we see is the desktop spiraling in on a single application, the browser, and files and media moving to the cloud.  Unity is messing around with something that will never win the hearts and minds of new users, while it alienates what users there already are.  I've never met someone who loves Unity!  There's a couple people who accept it, and a much larger group that hates it.  (Personally once I figured out to install gnome-shell I can like Ubuntu again, but Unity really did almost push me over the edge to get a Mac.)<p>It's not to say that a rethinking of the Linux UI is an entirely useless endevour, but Ubuntu and Canonical should not be pursuing a fantasy of a rich ecosystem of GUI apps.  There are maybe a dozen relevant applications on Linux now, and that number will only get smaller.  But the beauty of this is that if you just pursue an experience that encompasses those dozen applications, and you dive deep into those applications (which you can because they are all open source!) then something really neat could come out of that.  I think people could get behind an idea like that, even if those same people simultaneously felt annoyed with particular changes that came from that.  But it's hard to look past those problems when it feels like present usability is being compromised for a misguided fantasy.",1320296823.0

136,3190378,comment,3190307.0,3190307.0,16,0,yequalsx,,,Amazon is doing a very good job of enticing people to buy the Kindle Fire.  I opted to get a Kindle Touch instead of the Fire or an iPad.  What's interesting is that I don't even think about getting an iPad.<p>I would have gotten one had Apple upgraded the camera for the iPad.  But then the announcement for the Fire and Kindle Touch came out.  All other tablet makers have been trying to compete with Apple by copying Apple.  Amazon has created compelling reasons to consider it's devices and I think the strategy will be a great success.  They aren't copying Apple.<p>What's shocking is how much Google has dropped the ball.  They have Youtube and Google books and could have created compelling reasons to buy Android devices.  I don't think about Youtube when I want to rent a movie I can't get on Netflix.  It's clear that pretty soon I'll ditch Netflix and just go with Amazon Prime.  This is even more likely given that books will be part of Amazon Prime.,1320296431.0

I was checking it every 2minutes to read a new article, I had basically no life beside my rss reader (and before that I had no life because of IRC, another story).<p>The only way to go back to my normal life was to ditch my RSS readers. Now I'm enjoying a few websites and I realize I really don't need all those informations. Some websites I don't even need to check their new articles ""in time"".<p>And I found out I did care about the ""charisma"" of websites. It was like reading a different news paper, different texture, different layout, different feeling.<p>I understand both part, but I think very few people need a RSS reader (do we all read 100+ websites everyday? I was and I don't anymore). And I think a lot of RSS reader users would actually enjoy going back to the tranquility of reading directly through a blog's interface. I know it's less practical, you change the UI everytime and if you read a lot you only need the information. But juste give it a try, don't use your RSS reader for like a week, or at least a few days if you really need it. You'll see a difference :)<p>TL;DR:Internet doesn't have to be all about information.",1320296407.0
