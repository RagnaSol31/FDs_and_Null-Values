It's very error prone, very centralized, and thus fragile.  It depends on a central figurehead (the chairman, i.e. Bernanke or Greenspan).  If they make a human error, that will percolate through the global system.   We need more financial system redundancy, thus there will likely be currencies independent of government; we have lost faith in technocrats running our affairs.<p>- The nation state will be going away, with power reverting back to ""statelings"" and the city state.  It's Abu Dhabi vs. a large country like Saudi Arabia.  The nation state is very artificial, based on the French romantic ideal in the 19th century of the nation state, but went bankrupt because this lead to more aggressiveness and wars.   It's unstable in the current world because we've become too interconnected; when some parts of the world have the authority of a nation state they can't ""do"" anything other than fatten government officials.<p>- Mandelbrot discovered a law regarding life expectancy of technologies, similar to how actuaries in life insurance companies can guestimate a person's ""conditional life expectancy"".   A technology that is 25 years old is likely to stay around for another 25 years.   The implication is that most of today's technologies will fail, maybe a few today will survive, whether they make sense or not.   The bicycle will be there, the car will be there, the wall-to-wall bookshelf will still be there (the book is 500 years old). These things are very robust in the face of change. Something like an Amazon Kindle is pretty fragile.   Computers from 10 or 20 years ago have files that are very hard, if not impossible to retrieve - this is an illustration of the instability of technology.    Whereas a technology (like a paper book) that lasts 500 years likely has some properties that we don't quite understand; it fits our minds or our genetic makeup in a special way.<p>- Corporations won't survive; artisans tend to survive.   Corps follow the stock market and thus will take the BP approach of high-risk/high-reward, but this will greatly expose them to black swans.   The artisan model, like I'm wearing shoes from a French company that has been making shoes forever, companies that aren't listed on the stock market, and thus are not motivated by it, will tend to survive.<p>- Science has always been about revolutions, it has never been incremental in its progress.  Having said this, things have been depleted and we are running into some fundamental limits in some domains more than we realize [he doesn't really go beyond this]<p>- Black Swans will be a more common species of event, or more consequential, because the world is more connected, more efficient, and thus will have massive pockets of instability.  Unless we realize this & move to more robust forms of organization:  artisan, city-states, decentralized, as he prefers, the world is going to get more and more exposed at scale to unpredictable events.",1294034209.0

Though, I think that quantifying damages of a non-distributed copy written work might not be very easy in court, but lawyers are a crafty bunch.  It seems like there's a trend to remarket old copywritten material where there's a market for it, especially with new cheap distribution models you see like with Steam or Amazon's Ebook store, for example.

I calculate that a 160 pound man would lose about 250 calories to gut microbes each day if he were consuming sufficient protein, fat, and minerals to sustain efficient gut microbe multiplication activity. A diet poor in supportive nutrition would curtail gut microbe activity resulting in more efficient energy absorption into the bloodstream. That is, a higher proportion of the energy consumed would be available for metabolic needs and fat storage. In my own experience, if I consume extra calories, I just have more bowel movements and don't gain any weight unless the extra calories are carbohydrate.",1294033897.0

It is a legal status specifically granted by the IRS after a review.<p>Income raised prior to receiving the exemption is almost always treated as income earned through non-exempt (i.e., for-profit) activities.  There are exceptions, of course, but you need to consult a tax lawyer (specializing in non-profit/charitable tax law) to figure out if you qualify for those exceptions. There are very important reasons behind this (including, but not limited to, the deductibility of transactions).<p>State tax law may be more permissive, but that only affects your state tax status.  Federal tax law governs your federal tax status.  It may be possible to be a non-profit for state taxation but a for-profit for federal taxation.<p>Also, to address inaccuracies in your blog post:\n1) There are no age restrictions in any state on incorporation.  However, few businesses will enter into contracts with minors unless their parents guarantee the contracts because minors have very special rights under American contract law.<p>2) There is no need to incorporate a solo operation.  Incorporation is intended to simplify accounting for collaborative efforts.  Individuals can simply register a DBA (if they're making up a ""company"" name"").  In your case, incorporating is proper: you claim to be founding a charitable organization, so incorporation is a necessary step to receiving tax-exempt status.<p>3) It's humorous to see that you believe that a non-profit only needs to file 2 forms, online, once a year. Those two forms are just the start.  There's a lot more paperwork involved.<p>You need to consult a lawyer, immediately, because you may receive a call from the IRS in the near future.",1294032972.0

If Facebook is like Microsoft in that it can maintain a high profit margin due to continuing to successfully exclude any competitors from its market, just as it has so far (in Microsoft's case, through a combination of government-granted monopolies, criminality, and consistently not fucking up; in Facebook's case, perhaps not) then it could have profits like that with as little as $6B/year or so of revenue.  Presumably, within a couple of years, the majority of the internet's users will be Facebook users, which is something like two or three billion people.<p>Is it reasonable to expect Facebook to extract US$2 to US$3 per year per user?  It's hard for me to imagine how they could fail to extract several times that.  If nothing else, the blackmail value of the data they already have on hand ought to be larger than that.  (""Upgrade to Facebook Premium today in order to have the option to keep your past private messages from being visible to all your Facebook friends!"" But it probably wouldn't be done in such a public way, in order to dampen backlash.)  They can probably also sell preprocessed datasets of people who read subversive literature online to national intelligence agencies: not just the US and UK, but also Egypt, China, Pakistan, Syria, Italy, and Russia. If laundered through some kind of data broker, they could even get plausible deniability.<p>That would be out of keeping with the kind of privacy invasion Facebook is currently well-known for, though, so it probably wouldn't happen without a change of control of the company first.<p>So the mere $50B valuation represents an assessment that Facebook's popularity could be short-lived, or that it could become subject to much more intense competition than it is today, driving its revenues down toward their costs.<p>I hope to God that Goldman is right.",1294032753.0

If everyone is doing it, then there's not going to be anyone competing the monopolies out of business with their innovation.<p>I think the fallacy is that people think that democracy and ""free"" markets happen naturally (or organically). But the fact is that it's the opposite. Companies and people that pulled themselves up by their bootstraps do everything they can to stop other people from doing the same thing.<p>It takes a lot of hard work stop monopolies and keep things fair. That's what allows innovation. But since the US doesn't even believe in public education or public health, for the middle class; I don't think they care much about giving small businesses a opportunity over the big ones either.<p>It's the same way in Canadian telecom. Bell Canada has low caps and low bandwidth with HIGH overage fees. Their competitors offer the internet without bandwidth caps. So to stay competitive... Bell Canada made the government force the other ISP's to charge by bandwidth as well.",1294030853.0
