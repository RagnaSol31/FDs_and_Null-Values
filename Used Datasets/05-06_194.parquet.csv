I want a useful 3D printer with materials like nylon, not a MakerBot.  There should be people around in any reasonably sized city.  I believe that some of the Solidworks resellers now do 3D printing as a service.<p>One thing that people continue to underestimate are silicone molds.  3D print the positive--create a silicone negative mold from the 3D positive.
