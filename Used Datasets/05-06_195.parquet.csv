Even in the absence of medical treatment seeming terminal cancers can go into complete remission and never return (as a bit of an aside if anyone has any desire to become a saint the easiest way to achieve this is to go around blessing cancer patients. As long as you bless enough you will get the required two “miracles” you need from spontaneous remissions alone).<p>Since cancer is the consequence of the loss of the regulation of cell division it is axiomatic that in any cellular system given enough time and mutations the regulation will be lost in at least one cell of an individual. We don’t need to prevent disruption of the regulatory system, although this is good, we just need to be better able to identify and destroy those cells that are not regulated.",1408686652.0

Rather than looking at a best case or a simulated median case, looking at a worst case is pretty cool.<p>What would make this more interesting would be to look at a constantly rebalanced portfolio that is a blend of stocks and bonds. That would have performed even better.<p>@notastartup -- &quot;the best investors&quot; is a complicated statement. Usually investors are graded on an annual basis compared to the market. If you outperform the market and justify your fee (if your fee is 1%, you had better outperform by a lot more than that, or else an index fund would have been a safer way to go), you keep your job, are able to get more capital into your fund, and generally are more highly regarded as an investor. So while I think there is a ton of merit to using an approach like this (or using the rebalancing approach I mention above), this is not what makes successful professional investors successful. That can be ascribed to luck, a ton of luck, skill, nefarious dealings, or any other number of other good or not-so-good reasons.",1408686208.0
