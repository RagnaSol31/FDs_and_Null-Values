(that's not necessarily a bad thing)<p>They put 2 projectors on the glasses, pointing out.  These are obviously extremely weak because they're so small, but the trick is shining the light at a retro-reflector [1] which bounces almost all the light directly back where it came from.<p>So even though the projectors are so dim you'd barely be able to see the image normally, it's apparently bright enough since a significant fraction of the light energy is bounced directly back to your eye.  I assume they're using 2 projectors because the angle of return is so focused that it wouldn't be sufficient to use one projector between the eyes.<p>My only confusion is I don't get what this has to do with augmented reality.  All that cleverness just emulates what a normal monitor can do - display an image to a person.  The head tracking stuff is a completely independent system of camera and IR light, just like a wiimote sensor.
