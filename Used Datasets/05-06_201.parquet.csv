I went back and looked through the code and adjusted the post with more regarding this important point. In particular:<p>&quot;Now it is time to decide which ones of those selfies are good or bad. Intuitively, we want to calculate a proxy for how many people have seen the selfie, and then look at the number of likes as a function of the audience size. I took all the users and sorted them by their number of followers. I gave a small bonus for each additional tag on the image, assuming that extra tags bring more eyes. Then I marched down this sorted list in groups of 100, and sorted those 100 selfies based on their number of likes. I only used selfies that were online for more than a month to ensure a near-stable like count. I took the top 50 selfies and assigned them as positive selfies, and I took the bottom 50 and assigned those to negatives. We therefore end up with a binary split of the data into two halves, where we tried to normalize by the number of people who have probably seen each selfie. In this process I also filtered people with too few followers or too many followers, and also people who used too many tags on the image.&quot;",1445838839.0

One of the biggest problems in terms of learning to write, or teaching anybody to write, is getting it in your nerve endings that the reader cannot read your mind. That what you say isn’t interesting simply because you, yourself, say it. Whether that translates to a feeling of obligation to the reader I don’t know, but we’ve all probably sat next to people at dinner or on public transport who are producing communication signals but it’s not communicative expression. It’s expressive expression, right? And actually it’s in conversation that you can feel most vividly how alienating and unpleasant it is to feel as if someone is going through all the motions of communicating with you but in actual fact you don’t even need to be there at all.&quot;<p>&quot;Conversations with David Foster Wallace&quot; (Literary Conversations Series, page 113<p>A big thing that pg seems to be unaware is that most of us are expressive, not communicative, when we talk.
