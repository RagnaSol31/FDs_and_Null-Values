For the sake of argument, let's call it a Software Consultancy. Then the consultancy finds you Gigs (i.e. takes on projects and puts you on them), and you get money.<p>Companies, in fact, solve another problem that acting doesn't have - namely, actors are hired alone. Software, on the other hand, is much, <i>much</i> more likely to be built by a team. And having a team brings you all sorts of other difficulties that customers can't deal with:<p>* You need a team that works well together<p>* You need proper management of the team<p>* You need proper processes in place for building the software<p>* In some cases, even access to equipment is an issue<p>In short, an agent that can represent a single developer is not the right ""level of abstraction"" for most clients.",1345960732.0

17,4434467,comment,4431197.0,4431197.0,1,0,comex,,,"So, as someone who's planning to implement a game using Canvas, I was annoyed to notice that there seemed to be occasional frame drops despite the extreme simplicity of this script.  I went tested on Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, and although it used only a small fraction of CPU, it wasn't perfectly smooth in any of them: subjectively, Chrome was the best, Safari dropped frames a bit more often, and Firefox was quite laggy.  I added a trivial FPS counter to the JavaScript and the results sort of mirrored my impression - Chrome almost always got 60 FPS but sometimes 59, Safari got 59 more often, and Firefox was sometimes lower - but I'm not sure 59 FPS adequately explains the glitchiness I experienced, especially in Firefox, which was subjectively quite awful.<p>Anyway, I'd like to learn where this frame dropping is coming from.  I'm a real stickler about lag, and even though the effect here is pretty minor (except on Firefox), I find it unacceptable.  Maybe I should try reimplementing this in WebGL or even pure HTML with image tags.  Though, again, this game and mine are simple enough that all these approaches should be able to run at 60 FPS, the differences in implementation might be enough to push it over the edge and I have to make do with what exists.",1345959890.0

Lets go back to square one, I claimed  this was a blow to innovation because it would have a chilling effect on designers. And you responded with this argument:<p>""No, it's not a blow to innovation. The only reason Apple went after Samsung and not HTC or other Android handset manufacturers is because Samsung has gone into detail copying every small feature from Apple.""<p>You claim that innovation is not harmed, and the basis for that claim is an assertion that Apple's motivation for pursuing a patent infringement suit against Samsung was due to poor behavior (detail copying).<p>And yet in every patent dispute, and there are many to choose from, Microsoft FAT file system, Intel frontside bus, Unisys GIF file compression, where the exact strategy was to assert the patent against the biggest and most difficult possible defendant, so that a win would cause everyone else to simply follow that decision rather than fight. If you do it the other way and start with the little guys, each time you sue the next bigger guy he's going to assume that because he has more resources he can win the fight and you're back in court. Doing it this way nobody thinks they are going do better than Samsung did and they will all submit to Apple's demands.<p>I claim it has absolutely <i>nothing</i> to do with Samsung's ""detail copying"" behavior and <i>everything</i> to do with the fact that Samsung is the single biggest, baddest, richest, manufacturer of smartphones after Apple.<p>I realize that I didn't respond directly to your claim of motivation because I did not feel it was supported by your evidence. You don't provide evidence of Apple's motivation, you don't provide a definition of 'detail copying', and you don't provide a rationale why details like 'rounded corners', which is one of the claimed infringements, should be protected.<p>When you re-iterated Samsung's bad behavior I guessed you were going for the karmic angle.<p>You've followed up your claim by trying a reductio ad absurdum [1] argument about copying. However it is trivially easy to poke holes in that argument by looking at the market we live in without the Apple lawsuit. There are no $10 Chanel bags being made by an otherwise reputable handbag maker.<p>So do you still think Apple was just mad at Samsung? And so you or I could make a rounded rectangle tablet device and they wouldn't sue us ?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum</a>",1345959683.0

The only Mac I own is pre-OSX, from the the good ole days.  I'm aware the hoop jumping has worsened, but this is ridiculous.<p>I like freedom.  I never used my old Mac for internet and I would not want to use a newer Mac (or iPad or iPhone) for that either.<p>For internet related usage I can get the same performance, and in fact much better performance, as anyone would from an Apple computer using BSD/Linux/Plan9.<p>If I want to do something that is heavily graphics intensive and requires a Mac (e.g. audio/video production), then I just switch to the Mac.  I consider that ""special purpose"" computing.<p>But these days Apple is really aiming for the ""general purpose"" computer users, not just creative professionals.<p>No way would I agree to jump through hoops to do general purpose computing (email, web, multimedia playback, etc.).  The old Macs were terribly slow and clumsy for agile internet usage and the new ones are no different.

They might come up with some sort of concept and then hire an 'architect' (the moral equivalent of the director) and then working with that person perhaps the 5 to 15 core engineers.

In particular, here are some of the things that I find to be obstacles to the idea of living forever, or at least for a tremendously extended period of time:<p>-Population growth.  Right now it's pretty well established that three generations will be in the world at any given time, with around 25-30 years between each generation.  If we were to live to 150 (much less 750), suddenly that's five or six  generations instead of three, potentially doubling the world's population, and that's assuming that people still follow the custom of having an average number of children between the ages of 25-35 and then stopping.<p>-On that note, if we are given the capability to remain sexually active for hundreds of years, then one person will be capable of multiplying into far more new people, rapidly increasing population growth.  If we are not given that capability, then we'd all end up miserable as the period of our lives in which we have sexually fulfilling relationships becomes small.<p>-If we conquer diseases with such efficiency, then the tragedy of random, accidental deaths becomes greatly more pronounced.  People may die from heart disease and cancer at a far reduced or nonexistent rate, but people will still die from car crashes, drug-related violence and suicide at the same rate they do now.  Those deaths will become a lot more significant and difficult to handle, and we as a society will become either super-anxious and paranoid about the possibility of losing our lives or either perpetually in mourning (as our lives become longer we will have more connections and friendships and familial relationships, so we'll have more people whose deaths will affect us) or somehow immune or numb to the pain as a coping mechanism.  The idea of war will become far more barbaric as suddenly instead of taking 60 years and a family away from a young man, you're taking hundreds of years and whatever else he could have done in that time.<p>-Any disease we are unable to cure with the potential to permanently affect people will instantly become far more terrifying.  Non-fatal sexually transmitted diseases, loss of limbs or appendages, and debilitating mental diseases will be far, far more damaging given the greater lifespan that they will affect.<p>-Medical care will still, presumably, be as expensive and challenging as ever; however, we will have more people who need it and more reasons that those people need it.  Most of these reasons will probably be expensive - for instance, if cancer treatment ends up being very very expensive, everybody will still want it - so our society is going to have to find some way to handle that.  In a best-case scenario, most of the money we made would end up going to medical care, and we would never retire.  The proportion would probably be far from that though, with 99% of people being unable to feasibly afford to maintain their own lives.  Furthermore, we would need far, far more doctors, and therefore we would have to develop even more incentives for people to take that path in life and stay on it for as long as possible.<p>-Concepts that we have now (some of which I mentioned tangentially above) that are based on the idea of a 70-90 year lifespan and that we rely on will no longer exist.  These include the eventual death of all dictators/tyrants, fairly consistent sizes in the nuclear and extended families, the age-based progression of opportunities and decisions, life sentences for crimes, marriage (would you want to keep the same spouse for 500 years?), retirement, etc.<p>That's what I think, anyway.",1345957884.0

82,4434402,comment,4431630.0,4433288.0,0,0,corporalagumbo,,,"(apologies for the long response)<p>I see W8 as a reaction to a new world of computing: more powerful computers, a proliferation of device formats, ubiquitous connectivity, a dissolving desktop-cloud barrier, pervasive social/identity services, mass-consumer computing, mostly for a whole emerging range of novel, non-traditional computer tasks. <p>The WIMP desktop is a legacy product from the days of computers as workstations and computer-users as skilled specialists. The desktop is very static and rigid. Windows only move when clicked and dragged, only change size when their edges are pulled. The desktop can become as cluttered as you want with multiple windows and desktop folders and icons. This made sense in 1995, but now computers are far more powerful, and graphical display techniques are better too. W8 is fluid and dynamic where WIMP is sluggish and static. Tap or click on a tile and a whole new screen flips up, filling the screen. Even compared to iOS, Metro is far more dynamic, mainly due to its radically simpler design language. The basic fonts and block colours of Metro can squish and stretch and dynamically resize in a way which is largely impossible with the carefully detailed chrome of iOS.<p>This fluidity also extends to the way the tasks flow into one another in the OS. Talking mostly from my experience with WP7, it’s remarkable how wall-less the OS can be. The way you can move from a messaging thread to your messagee’s contact card, simply by tapping their name, and seeing all their latest social activity on Facebook, is great. Ideally, Metro is wall-less - the opposite of iOS’s carefully segregated app ghettos. The platonic Metro ideal is that all the parts of the OS flow seamlessly together (it remains to be seen how successfully Microsoft can pull this off - also this quite different model may be difficult for developers used to iOS to get their heads around and take full advantage of).<p>Furthermore, visually the Metro frontend is clearly the cleanest and simplest consumer OS ever. It's a massive decluttering effort to display only relevant info, and much much easier to understand than any previous OS. And Microsoft is aiming to make this design language uniform across phones, tablets and PCs, and their web presence. It has the most common net identity services baked in - and the whole platform is tied together with Windows ID, and all your files and info synced seamlessly across all of your Windows devices with Skydrive. So, for example, if I made an account on a W8 PC, it would prepare all of my contacts from Facebook and my calendar appointments because it knows me from my Windows phone. The aim as I understand it is radical flexibility - you can shift seamlessly from device to device and the environment is consistent throughout - it just works. Also part of the idea with Metro is to dissolve the web/desktop barrier - instead of just accessing web services through a browser and some dedicated programs (IM, torrent clients etc) and perhaps some desktop widgets, the web is baked in to the skeleton of the OS. Which makes sense.<p>Not sure if I'm explaining this well... As I said, it remains to be seen whether Microsoft makes good on this potential. I’m just trying to articulate what I think Metro represents, what I sense is possible here. And trying to do so without just sounding like Microsoft PR :)<p>It seems like maybe a lot of people are offended by W8 because it's too simple and potentially interferes with the quite complex workflows I assume average HN readers do with their computers. But for the average user, I think W8 is going to be great. Computers need to be democratised further - right now, the vast majority have almost no idea how to use WIMP. It’s just too complex. OS X is just as bad - in some ways even worse than W7! The value of W8 will be through hiding 95% of the compexity of computers from the average user, while preserving the technical backend for more advanced users. Normal users get a massively more approachable experience, allowing them to think less and spend more time doing the stuff they really want to with their computers. Advanced users can still go deeper (unlike Apple, which seems intent on locking down their entire system at the expense of advanced desktop users - and without giving any real gains in useability to justify it!)<p>People forget, I think, that Microsoft focuses a lot on useability. Metro is the result of a lot of hard work thinking how to make computers more useable. Apple focuses on products that wow people. But from my experience with the iPad, it seems Apple thinks less about useability than people might expect (non-resizable thumb keyboard, I’m looking at you...)<p>I think W8 is best seen as a transition product, making the first steps away from the old WIMP desktop. So yeah, right now, they haven't tinkered with the old desktop much. But a split is forming: between the simple easy-to-use frontend of the OS and the technical backend. Expect this split to become more coherent in W9.",1345957361.0
