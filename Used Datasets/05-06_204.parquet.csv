We use their DNS for our (dev and staging) servers that aren't even hosted on Slicehost and it doesn't seem to be a problem. It's the one reason why we continue to keep a few of our VPS servers hosted there since competitors such as Linode are so much cheaper now.,1291615074.0

You mean that you find it hard to find 'single word' or 'perfect descriptions' of common ideas, and that's true, but I'm fairly sure that you can find plenty of good domain names for exactly $8.<p>The value of a domain is directly proportional to the amount of time that you put in to it.

Also, sometimes someone says the same thing a little differently, and that's the one that actually reaches you.<p>My 300 page copy has 50 or 60 dog-earred pages and hundreds of red marks; it's that full of gems.

I've been an entrepreneur for almost 2 decades, and none of that stuff really mattered to me. Give me crap food, old clothes, beat up equipment, and an exciting project to work on and I'll be fine. Yeah, Swedish masseuses would be nice, but I don't understand how that can make up for a tough work environment. People are motivated by what they're working on, not the stuff around the edges that dresses it up.",1291611829.0

Most of the talk of 80 weeks is way over-hyped. Some times are certainly trying during a push, but it's by no means absurd.<p>Personally, I love all of the opportunities to hang out with other team members. We spend our working hours together, getting to know each other outside of work means that I get to work with my friends all day. It's awesome. You make a good point about that sort of thing become less enticing as you get older. We have a young team though, so it works out for the most part.<p>That said though, we have people on the team who never come to any of the outside events, and I wouldn't say that they are treated any differently. Everyone's free to make their own choices in this matter. At the end of the day, if they enjoy the work and we all get along, no one cares what you do when you go home.",1291611819.0

I once had to recover a .SE name due to a situation just like this.  I had planned to re-register a name, but fell within a strange situation where my domain was still mine, but outside of a 60 day window when I could actually renew the domain.  This was all in advance of the actual expiration date.  Because of this, the domain lapsed and I had to have the registrar recover the domain manually.",1291611807.0
