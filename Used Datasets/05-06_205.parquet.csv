Spreedly then redirects the user to you.  You validate the token (similar to catching someone from an OpenID provider) and, if successful, do whatever was required to effect your purchase.<p>From the user's experience, it sure <i>looks</i> like they were on your site the entire time, but their payment details only ever touch Spreedly's servers.  You interface with Spreedly on the backend to do any sort of charging logic that you want -- subscriptions, one-off charges, weird business logic specific to your application, whatever.  (This is the main value add over the regular Spreedly subscriptions thing, which works very well if your subscriptions work exactly like Spreedly subscriptions and, apparently, less well otherwise.)<p>Since the data never touches your servers, you never need to go through PCI compliance work.<p>The big win I perceive for my business is that my checkout forms will only ask for name, credit card number, and CCV, hopefully increasing conversions versus Google Checkout / Paypal.",1298438479.0

Or you could write the code and keep running a test until it works.  The test is typically faster for this because you don't have to deal with the rest of the program which is unrelated to what you're working on.

When I write my (totally legitimate) Japanese address and phone number combined with my American credit cards, it often ends up in an order getting held for purgatory for 48 ~ 72 hours until I can point them to the resolutions for the last four orders I did through them and the fact that none were chargebacks for being stolen credit cards.<p>Steam also does something similar.  You can thank your local pirate.<p>The digital backup fee is scamtastic, and (shockingly) isn't the worst thing they have pulled over the last few years (that would be automatically adding rebill fraud 'coupon booklet' subscriptions to the orders).  They split the fee $7 to DR and $1 to the software publisher, which means that for sales of $50 software they make substantially more from that addon than for the software itself at almost all of their (myriad) pricing schemes for the core DR payment processing experience.",1298437216.0
