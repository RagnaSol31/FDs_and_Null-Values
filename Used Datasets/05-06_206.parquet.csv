I post to twitter because I want a large follower base I can bounce ideas off and tell about things I'm working on. I answer questions on quora because there are a lot of wealthy, influential people on there and I want them to know I'm a developer trying to make his way in this world. The point is, I need to get something back from these services if I'm going to dedicate my time using them.<p>Foursquare gave me nothing in return. There's no value in being a mayor, and because theres only one mayor per location it's nearly impossible to maintain. None of my friends in town use it, so the potential value of finding out where my friends are and what they are up to at any moment is nonexistent.<p>I would use Foursquare if it would tell me if my buddy is going to the gym without him having to do anything.

17,1961197,comment,1958158.0,1958800.0,0,0,mkramlich,,,"one way of looking at it is, ask yourself how many new products/services has Google launched this year, due to internal development? And then compare that number to their total employee count of about 22,000. Do you think if say you split off just 50% of those folks, took them and spread them out between hundreds of small little startups each with a fresh and independent entrepreneurial drive and vision, and all legacy process/culture/tradition/rules stripped away, the end result would be way way more new products and services and innovation released into the market? For me, the answer would be yes, I'd expect that. Purely on a people numbers basis, and speaking in general terms. (Of course, it would depend on lots of other factors like the nature of the individuals, etc. But you get the idea.)<p>A software startup only takes 1-4 decent people to get off the ground, and sometimes it doesn't take a heck of a lot more beyond that to scale it up. Now compare that to Google's 22,000. Yes lots of hard-core optimizing of hardware and software going on there, which I respect. But most of them are just polishing corners on Google's legacy products/services, and minding the store, <i>not</i> creating or  bringing a fundamentally new and distinct product or service to the market.<p>Also, based on everything I've seen, I think Google <i>hires</i> mostly for highly academic engineering-focused types -- not entrepreneurs and not highly creative types. They mostly get those kinds only through <i>acquisitions</i> (or acqui-hire, as some have called it) lately, not hiring. This is my impression from afar anyway.",1291269237.0

It's good to learn and explore new things, but from this comment (""support both data and code""?) as well as other comments of yours on this thread and in your code (""I can't really explain it yet, but it works"", ""I didn't want to weird people out"", the assumption that building a data structure out of cons cells makes it different from most data types, supporting your asymptotic analysis by claiming that ""it works, at least on my computer"", or noting that the reason it works is ""mathematical"" (yes, mathematics is a language for reasoning about structure, including algorithm correctness), claiming that balanced binary search trees don't have ""predictable structure"", etc.) makes me suspect of your intuition about this data structure about which you are clearly very excited -- unless you can provide a reason why you have this feeling that doesn't just say what's good about your data structure, but explains what's lacking in Okasaki's<p>It's clear you don't have a lot of experience with the design of functional data structures. I think if you read some of Okasaki's work, you will be better able to communicate statement like ""trellises can support both data and code"" using prose that other programmers can understand.<p>In this particular case, I suspect my confusion about your feeling is the same as that of somnium in reply to your comment. Okasaki's random access lists are a polymorphic data structure. They can hold anything -- data, code, linguine, fettuccine, bikini. They support pushing an element onto (or removing an element from) the front of the list in O(1) worst-case time, even when used functionally (this has a special meaning here other than ""in a functional language"" or ""in a way that is not broken"". Compare ""confluently presistent"", which is weaker.) They also support lookup (that is, nth) and update of the ith element in O(min(i,lg n)) time.<p>I do not think your data structure supports all of these operations with the same time bounds, and it's unclear what is unique about its ability to ""support both data and code"".",1291267165.0

We're thinking of doing a bunch of practice sessions on Monday and Tuesday before the main event.<p>* re:tables, it really depends on the startup.  The main purpose is so that people can easily find you when they want to talk to you.  Some startups just show up with themselves and a laptop for demos.  That's totally cool.  Others bring a big shebang.  That's fine too.  It totally ranges and usually depends on where they are at in terms of lifecycle.  Honestly, this is more about susbtance than style.<p>* Additional company reps are $30 each although I'm considering of waiving that for the 1st attendee after the presenter (presenter is ALWAYS free to attend of course).  We might do more than that but it'll depend on what we can line up in terms of sponsor dollars.  Even if we can't, it's only $30 per person.  Compared to other so called ""inexpensive"" events, we're one or more orders of magnitude cheaper.  And company reps have an easy time getting approved to attend - we've never barred startup personnel UNLESS they are consultants (like PR firm reps or something) in which case we have a discussion about it.<p>Hope that long winded answer helps.
