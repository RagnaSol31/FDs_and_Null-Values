13,1144824,comment,1144659.0,1144659.0,0,0,mbreese,,,"One of the comments at the NPR site suggested the IOC not have an exclusive broadcast partner and just open it up for everyone to cover it as they'd like.  I think that this is interesting, but hardly a way to fund an event as massive as the Olympics.  In order to any changes to work, you'd have to be able to make up the $800+ million NBC ponied up for the games.<p>So, here's an idea: why not let others (even competitors) bid on individual events.  This could work from either the IOC doing to brokering or even NBC itself.<p>So, for example, if another network wanted to broadcast the USA/Canada hockey game, they could have bid for the rights to show either that game, or all of hockey.  I'm sure that would be worth something.  Why should a large part of the country have to miss out on a great event, just because NBC decided to show ice dancing?<p>Split the games up into smaller biddable packages, and I'm sure you'd end up with as much, if not more, revenue for the IOC, and more people could get to see a greater variety of events.  Imagine if ABC/CBS/NBC/Fox/ESPN were all showing a part of the Olympics?  Wouldn't this be more in the spirit?

19,1144818,comment,1142927.0,1144340.0,0,0,ajju,,,"<i>My general feeling is that immigrants should be tolerant, hard working and individualist. The second generation should be integrated into mainstream America, rather than clustered into a ghetto.</i><p>I am with you 100% here. The good news, if you want to ask an immigrant, is that the U.S. is partly immunized against ghettos. Ghettos are caused by (and often require) two vicious circle type factors: a) An insular culture amongst the immigrants and b) An exclusive (exclusionary?) culture amongst citizens.<p>The great thing about the U.S. is that from the first day you land here, most people will treat you as an American. In my experience, this is one of the most powerful things America has working for itself. If someone feels like a part of America, the chances that they will harbor ill will for it are negligible and chances that they will want to insulate themselves from it are also low.<p>I think it is hard to design a racism test, so with the caveat that I don't have a better solution, I have the following problem with your racism test:<p>There is a high correlation between race and some religions. For example, IMO, the proportion of Muslims who are white is very low, while the proportion of Muslims who are brown is very high. So, in measuring the bias of say people from Pakistan against marrying whites, you might actually be measuring the bias of Muslims against marrying non-Muslims.<p>Actually, I don't think that is bad. My (potential) children will (and should) be free to marry whoever they choose Muslims, Christians, Zoroastrians, whoever. (Hopefully they wont marry a Scientologist!) Legally, though, discriminating against a religious group for not marrying outside seems like it may fall afoul of some religious freedom rights. Having said that, IANAL.<p>Regarding (2), it seems that you are using strong family / social obligations as a proxy for testing how much more 'liberal' or open minded compared to the 1st generation, the 2nd generation will be. I think this is such a warped and complex thing though, that it is really impossible to test.<p>Coming from a background with strong family and social obligations, and luckily from a family with negligible social pressure, I can also tell you it has many positives.<p>I also think it would be interesting to see how middle and southern United States measure on (2) vs most of the world. I suspect you won't see as much of a difference here as you  expect.<p>Good discussion!",1266904198.0

The buzz picked back up again once Google finalized the deal; they spent a while in negotiation.<p>One of the barriers to adoption of Theora has been the quality issue; why would Apple or Nokia take the extra risk and cost of going with Theora if they already implement a superior codec? There's a chance that VP8 would help with that, but it's still an uphill battle. It took years for Xiph to take VP3 to something that they wanted to call a stable standard. Google has more resources than Xiph, for sure, but they likely can't just dump VP8 as-is as a new standard. There's also the issue of submarine patents, the hardware issue, just getting this implemented and as widely deployed as H.264, and more, so yeah, it would be tough for this to become a standard.<p>On the other hand, what the heck else is Google planning on doing with On2? Why would they get into the proprietary codec business, when H.264 seems to be winning out in most places in the market, and they've already bought all the licenses, encoded most of YouTube in H.264, and so on? Of course, those questions also apply to an open codec, but Google has been a big proponent of open, freely implementable standards, so at least that route makes some amount of sense.",1266904111.0

Determination, desire, competiveness, a willingness to take risks, etc, are all far more important.  Of the long course of human existence, something like 40% of men have reproduced, while 80% of women manage to reproduce ( <a href=""http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/20/is-there-anything-good-about-men-and-other-tricky-questions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/20/is-there-anyt...</a> ).  Thus for a woman to reproduce she basically has to not take risks, and not screw up.  But the proper reproductive strategy for a man is to take major risks so he can be the top dog with 5 wives, rather than the median man with no wives.  The result is that men are by nature far greater risk takers.  Startups require a lot of risk and a lot of sacrifice, it's not at all surprising to me that it is so male dominated.  All the most risky activities, throughout the entire course of human history have been male dominated.<p>And also, being good at programming is not just about having the smart genes.  It's also about liking programming.  I'm a nerd, I like spending most of time dealing with abstract logical concepts rather than with people.  Most women are not like this.  We have several women on our team in QA and product management.  They have undergraduate degrees in engineering from top schools.  But they don't program.  Why? Because they don't like it.  Whenever I talk with women about career plans, and mention programming, the usual response is something like, ""meh"".  On the flip side, I'm pretty sure I would hate working in PR.<p>Men and woman are different.  And you know what?  That's OK.  I don't see what this obsession is with putting all of society in a blender until every job as a perfect distribution of every demographic component.  Celebrate and embraces differences!",1266903401.0

The right question to ask is ""What would have to be true about the underlying population to support the observed result that a particular startup is 100% male?""<p>Let's assume that there is significant ""differential average programming ability between gender populations"" and that this has a combination of biological and sociological causes. Even so, I think we can agree that the two populations are probably normally distributed around each average, right?<p>Now, is it safe to assume a roughly equal standard deviation for both curves? I'm not aware of any data to suggest otherwise.<p>So now we can be specific: how large would that differential have to be before we find ourselves in the part of the curve that has many men but basically no women? I haven't done the math, as it seems intuitive to me that this is going to yield an absurd result, namely, that men would have to have an overwhelming advantage.<p>At that point, it seems more reasonable to me to infer that we have a selection bias in our filter, than that the curves are so far apart in reality. My personal, albeit anecdotal, experience has given me no reason to doubt that conclusion, either.<p>So, I don't think the argument depends on an equal pass rate, and I think it stands up even if you believe in substantial gender differences, regardless of cause.",1266901230.0
