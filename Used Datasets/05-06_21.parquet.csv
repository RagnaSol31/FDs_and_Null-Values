Maybe they have more maturity when it comes to handling the occasional bug.""<p>That's not a constructive way to handle criticism.

The title reminds me of an old Calvin & Hobbes comic, Calvin is talking about Einstein getting bad grades and he says something like ""you heard Einstein got bad grades in school? well mine are even worse!""<p>I don't think not attending college was good or bad for me but I'm going to do what I can with what I've got.",1272517307
