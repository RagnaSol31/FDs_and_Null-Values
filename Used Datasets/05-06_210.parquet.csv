5,5684850,comment,5672643.0,5678558.0,1,0,rdl,,,"Yes, your out of pocket is premium + out of pocket maximum.<p>No, HSAs no longer have caps (at least policies signed after a certain date, or in some states; I think pretty soon they'll have no annual or lifetime maximums at all); they're essentially ""you're at risk based on your deductible for non-preventive services up to the out of pocket maximum, but excellent essentially-free care for the rest of the year once you hit that cap"").  (there are some weird edge cases, like Rx drugs outside the hospital, potentially non-covered services, etc., but essentially a $500k hospital bill for some serious trauma would all be covered after you've paid the $5-7k out of pocket maximum (probably met on the way to the hospital or within seconds of entering the ER, if it's a serious trauma)<p>You can solve the ""poor have no use for tax deductions"" by <i>giving</i> them the out of pocket maximum into the HSA; it's free money in a personal allocated account.  Or by making some deductions refundable or credits (similar to the EIC, which is most of why Puerto Rico wants to become a state now...most citizens would earn a federal tax rebate!)<p>The quick fix is probably to make personal purchases of health insurance <i>also</i> deductible, rather than removing employer health insurance deductibility.  And push people into HSAs, with some people getting HSA account filling by the government.

Most people aren't aware data relevant to them is collected and when they discover data they want, it's in a format that is difficult to use or full of noise. And even if you get clean data in a format you want, it can be hard to find official definitions and criteria describing the data, so it's not uncommon for two agencies to appear to collect the same data, but it's not really the same data because those agencies are working under their own varied definition or criteria.<p>When I worked as a financial analyst in Brazil, I was amazed at the data that was available from IBGE and various other governmental agencies. Despite the availability of data, it was rarely in a format that was useful without constantly having to writing a special scraper/parser.

It is really hard to teach yourself to code if you lack any foundation in coding, let alone teaching yourself X or Y technologies.<p>There is really nothing these bootcamps can offer you except for a boost in your motivation (such a boost is not worth $12-17k+). To give you a sense of what I mean, Dev Bootcmap, for example, spends half of its time on teaching their students Ruby and programming fundamentals, which makes sense if you've never/barely coded before, but does not make sense for someone with experience who can teach him/herself Ruby and most of its advanced concepts over a (focused) weekend. Even Hack Reactor, which bills itself as being more intensive and faster-paced, spends a lot of time on basic language/CS fundamentals.<p>These programs don't really improve your job prospects beyond the improvements that are due to a beginner learning new concepts, nor do they really provide any sort of networking opportunities beyond the kind of networking you can achieve by hanging out at engineering meetups once a week - the average wage at these programs is almost universally in the $85k area, which sounds like a lot but is essentially entry level for the SF area.<p>The same applies to most online course material out there, which is geared towards beginners.",1368163186.0

So if an employee tried to view their ex's info, or their friend's roommates info, etc. the system would auto-flag them and an investigation would likely result in that employee being immediately terminated.<p>2) Much of Google's data is accessible by many production services. This is a security weakness, however, there was a project to make the data layer enforce security constraints so that applications could only access data relavent to them, and additionally also enforcing security on a user-level (so an app could only access that user's data if it had an access token for that user).
