This is not a valid argument against vegetarianism unless you think we should do things just because other animals do (I’m not currently a vegetarian, but a lot of their arguments do make sense). The easiest way to do this would be to kill all the carnivores (as opposed to trying to create and feed them all nutritionally-complete tofu-based meat substitutes), and while that would be an unusual action to take from the perspective of usual environmentalism with the goal of protecting species diversity, it might actually be the case that it would reduce the total amount of animal suffering, if we had a way to measure and quantify suffering.",1407045313.0
