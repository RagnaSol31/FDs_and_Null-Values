Is the course going to be dumbed down for the degree-seeker?""<p>There are a few issues. First, for a school to be accredited they need to meet certain requirements, many of which are orthogonal to actual learning. Second, it creates a misalignment between what's good for the school and what's good for the students. Third, it tends to create zero-sum dynamics. Fourth, there is the issue of extrinsic motivation undermining intrinsic motivation. And fifth, it attracts students who are extrinsically motivated.<p>I'm sure it's possible to create a good program that's accredited.

21,4052150,comment,4050988.0,4051798.0,5,0,quatrevingts,,,"Well, if you're using Java, you don't have map in the JDK.  You can use Guava (or write your own) to get Iterables.transform().  But then, anything you map turns into an Iterable.  So often you have to iterate over the whole thing once again to get the data structure you actually need.  You could write Collections.map(), Lists.map(), Sets.map(), etc, until you get tired.  (Guava does not include these.)<p>But at this point you're still way behind Scala.  What about flatMap, filter, slice, drop, scan, etc?  Every collection in Scala has a huge set of methods that work on it.  But they're not implemented again and again, because the type system is powerful enough to prove that the generic code that works for Set can be used for List.  In contrast, every Java program is full of innumerable primitive operations expressed again and again, so you have to keep reading the steps of every for loop to determine, ""oh, this one is doing forall.  This one is map"" rather than simply reading ""forall"", ""map"".  Which is why, thanks to the above complexity, Scala can be much more readable than Java.<p>What about Haskell? The existing standard library is fairly weak on collections.  There are not that many implementations, and there's no typeclass that quite captures the idea of a collection:  you've got Foldable, Functor, Monad, and possibly some others, which all get slightly different aspects of it.  Small typeclasses are nice in that they allow more instances, but often you need some functions that aren't there.  There's no typeclass which captures the size() function, for instance.  That's mostly a library design issue, which is more tractable than a language issue, but still pretty hard to fix.<p>There's one additional cool feature of Scala collections which I haven't touched on yet:  transformations can result in collections that are different from the original collection type, and the most specific collection that is compatible is used.  What does that mean?  Say I map a TreeSet from an ordered element type to an unordered type.  The result type can no longer be stored in a TreeSet, so you get a more generic Set collection instead.  I'm curious what it would take to implement this in Haskell.",1338529717.0

However, the idea is to rate your skill with that particular language.  No matter what the most advanced state is of a language, a 5/5 (or whatever the scale is) means that you can accomplish the most advanced task possible in the language.  That doesn't mean that someone who is, say, 5/5 in Perl, will have the same skillset and capabilities as someone who is a 5/5 in AT&T syntax assembler.

And I understand that Meteor gets very positive feedback here on HN due to their great communication skills and YC affiliation<p>But it has severe drawbacks:<p>=> While employing Node as core they surprisingly ignore the well established npm package manager which is one of the best package managers around. This is bad and there's no excuse because it leads to fragmentation of the still young JS server-side landscape dominated by a lean and modular-driven Node which is just the smartest way to establish a real ecosystemthe one-size-fits-all approach is aged and that's Meteor. I assume they did their own package manager due to their upcoming business model (which will be introduced very far in the future if their ecosystem is once established), maybe they'll take license fees or demand support fees or whatever of everyone who wants to actively participate as contributor in the ecosystem. They couldn't do this with the npm. And by choosing this path the can lock out competing frameworks: if Meteor would just be a package in the npm ecosystem the opportunity costs of changing to other realtime frameworks in the npm world wouldn't be that high because changing the framework wouldn't mean changing the entire ecosystem.<p>=> As long client-side JS is delivered unprotected to the browser you will never have the one-code-base-or-name-space-covering-front-and-backend approach. This approach doesn't provide any securityclient code could do any shit to the server sideand others who tried made great products too but couldn't get any traction (nowjs i.e.). You will need always to separate both. They promised to come up with solutions like authentification or signed data, but then we have again more communication overhead than we would have if just separated those layers. This drawback isn't as huge as the first one, it's a technical challenge and thus, I appreciate any efforts to solve this problem.<p>Meteor was at the beginning a great tech demo, now they want to get serious and I doubt (and hope) that they won't succeed. Mentioned drawbacks are the main reasons I won't use, support and even advise against Meteor (as much as I like these guys and YC but sorry). They do not seem to contribute in any way to a great and existing ecosystem called Node but using it as their core to build a new competing one with monetization reasons in mind and a severely flawed architecture. Now, they obviously need and will use the money for PR and paying/incentivizing devs building the ecosystem and this competition between ecosystems (pure Node/npm vs Meteor) which is basically about winning the best devs will lead to further fragmentation and at the end no large ecosystem could be established and server-side JS failed.

There's an opportunity here to step out of our privileged bubble of tech startups and make a difference for the world as a whole.<p>I was watching Charlie Rose's last interview with Carl Sagan recently. He cited a NY Times article, ""Americans Flunk Science"" that said less than half of American adults understood that the Earth rotates the sun yearly. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/24/us/americans-flunk-science-a-study-finds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/24/us/americans-flunk-science...</a>\nCarl Sagan pointed out that ""if we (the general public) don't understand, then who is making all the decisions about science and technology that are going to determine our future?""\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jod7v-m573k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jod7v-m573k</a><p>When the general level of education suffers in a society, you get superstition, xenophobia, anti-intellectualism, bigotry, and many other things. It's in everyone's interest to raise the educational level of the human race.<p>If open courseware is viewed as something that's only for those that already have a love of learning, it will remain elite and cloistered among a small segment of society. If it becomes available as a formal education, it could go mainstream, and suddenly anyone with access to a good internet connection will be motivated and able to pursue higher education.<p>If we want to make quality advanced education mainstream and widespread, most people will need to see OCW as an opportunity to earn degree credits, not just as an opportunity for ""personal growth."" Sure, I think everyone ought to love learning just for the sake of learning, but I'm realistic, and I know that if you want to bring everyone in, you have to entice them with tangible benefits. They'll catch the love of learning once they are exposed to the kind of things a service like Udacity offers, but first you have to get them in.<p>Another commenter was worried about services like these becoming ""Phoenix University wannabes."" There will be some OCW services that will cater to the less ambitious or less intellectually capable. That's not a bad thing. For the impoverished or otherwise disadvantaged student capable of Stanford or MIT-level academics, though, there will be more challenging OCW services.<p>I can envision no scenario where making quality education and formal degrees available to anyone willing to step up and take advantage of it could be a bad thing. It's important for us to remember that while a formal degree might be unnecessary for someone with the right connections and opportunities, for most people in the world, it's still a very important thing to have.",1338528651.0

If those code snippets were Blockly that might be better for learning.<p>A maybe better example is Unity3D. You add a 3d object, attach a Script and start editing code to move that object by supplying an Update() function or something along those lines.
