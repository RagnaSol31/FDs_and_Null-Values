I agree that there's been a decline but the examples you pull out to support it don't help you much. The comments on the young girl who died were deplorable but I think that's a very rare case and I wouldn't say that happens often around here. But even that doesn't hurt your point as much as going after Dextorious like you did. You make a good case for him being a great example of the problem but this article comes off as you being disgruntled by him and going off on a personal attack. I don't think it's right to name names like that unless the person being named has a certain degree of notoriety. You could have left his name out of this, still used the quotes, maybe pull out some more quotes from other users exhibiting the same pattern and then this article would look far more like the commentary I'm sure you meant it to be rather than Mr. Siegler getting pissed off at and attacking someone. I'm disappointed. I'm not disappointed in your opinion, because there's a lot of truth to it but I'm disappointed in the way you approached it. Hopefully most of us will see past the flaws and really dig deeper into your real point. Other than that, I thought you were right on.",1326693593

4,3469565,comment,3469453.0,3469453.0,16,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Hmm. There's a lot to unpack here.<p>First, I'm still on the fence in regards to the quality of discussion here. I think there's a tendency for familiarity to breed contempt (the more familiar you become with HN, the more aware you are of things like mean discussions, and the more rose-colored your glasses will be when considering what it was like ""before""). There have been a few attempts to objectively measure any degradation of the site, and so far they haven't found anything conclusive, as far as I know. So, it might not be as bad as you think.<p>Second, you start out with a really general point, but then halfway-through fall mostly into a single example. If that's the example that got you thinking about this, then you've let yourself turn a wasted moment reading a pointless comment into quite a large waste of your time. The friendliest way I can think of to respond to that is that it is a very silly thing to do. :-)<p>What are you even doing online, anyway? I mean, for me, at least, being online makes me feel pretty miserable afterward, especially compared to anything else I could be doing. I'll look at my threads page sometimes and the older my most recent comment is, the happier I am with myself. That means I've been spending time on better things -- and anything other than commenting on a website is a better thing. I don't want to chase you off, but at the same time, sometimes I sit back and think about all the time wasted worldwide since the invention of the online forum, and <i>how little real positive impact there has been from all of that</i>, and it kinda bums me out. I must've blown entire months on Slashdot way back when, and all I remember from that now is ... uhm ... Hellmouth? ... and ... hmm. I forget the second thing. I am literally a happier, better person, for every moment that I'm not online.<p>Thirdly, although your intentions are good, you are criticizing behavior which leads naturally from the design of the site. How much thoughtful discussion is really possible on a site like this one, where most threads come and go after just a few hours, never to be read again? Hell, I wrote about this 9 months ago (<a href=""http://robsheldon.com/conversations-online"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robsheldon.com/conversations-online</a>), submitted it to HN (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2423975"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2423975</a>), where it got a little bit of discussion, and then that was it.<p>Forums like this one are <i>designed</i> to be topical, not thoughtful. With the invention of internet points -- yay, karma, and all that other nonsense -- people have had more incentive than ever to quickly bang out a single-line joke, get a point for every chuckle, and move on. (One of the things which has gotten me the most yummy internet points was a joke -- <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1102126"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1102126</a> -- and, although it was pretty funny, it wasn't nearly as meaningful to me as, say, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3132576"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3132576</a>).<p>HN is <i>not</i> a good place for thoughtful, meaningful discussion. It maybe says it wants to be, but the most important things about its design say otherwise. So at some point, you have to ask yourself, ""What am I doing here?""<p>...Every time that I look at this comment for the next few days, I will be ashamed of myself, because I will know that I wasted 15 minutes writing a thing which would be read by a few people for a few hours and then never again, and I could have played a good game of Go instead.",1326693509

If you are talking about having 2 children just to renew the generations, I have no problem to follow you on that path, but more is questionnable when you already have massive unemployment, a crumbling debt on the whole of society and an education system which has become the synonym for disaster. Growth comes from solid standards, not from loose ones.<p>About your second comment: maybe it's just about words, but technically speaking you do not ""agree"" with your citizenship, you are just born with it.

In fact, most everything people create isn't art per seif it were, there wouldn't be good art nor bad art, just art and lots and lots of it. Spend a few hours on some photo-sharing site and see what people shoot. They're photographs, but rarely art.<p>But there are grades of art. Look at this search: <a href=""http://goo.gl/2mLVI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/2mLVI</a>  a thousand sunset pictures, while maybe pretty, aren't generally art and not because it's the same sun in each picture. Most of these pictures have nothing to say. Now, some object lit by the sunset or silhouetted against it gives a lot more potential to be art. A carefully crafted study of a sunset in the form of a photograph <i>can be</i> art, but it requires finding certain constraints first, finding a certain angle that makes the photograph a message, and eventually conveying through the lens <i>something that makes</i> the viewer stop for a moment, to give an idea, to give a feeling, to give a confusion.",1326693278

It really isn't that unreasonable, in my opinion.</i><p>I don't care enough about Groupon to hit the link, but I absolutely, completely, and categorically disagree here.<p>Aside from the fact that expecting ""payment"" upfront in the form of watching an ad before getting any info isn't necessarily the smoothest way of doing it, I think 10% is <i>a lot</i> of time.<p>It seems there are really are only two kinds of people, those that understand that time is money, and those that don't. If I had to ""give away"" 10% of the time that I spent absorbing information online, I would probably stop using the internet altogether. The signal:noise ratio online is already in some places ridiculously low, especially in video content (which is why I read and not watch the news, weather, or whatever) and taking an additional 10% premium on that is ridiculous.<p>I surf ""free"" sites for work to gain knowledge and find ideas up to twenty hours a day. 10% of that time is <i>two hours</i>!!!! That's <i>a lot</i> of time. That's enough time for me to drive to the next state and come back. It's enough time for me write a simple open source utility and stick it up on github. It's enough time for me to bill a client five or six hundred dollars easy (depending on the client and assuming a job is available, etc.).<p>My problem is this: time does not scale. If you demand something as universal as ""10% of your time"" from person A and person B, that's possibly asking dramatically different stuff. 2 hours of my time can never be directly compared to two hours of someone else's. Two hours of Bill Gates' time or Obama's time is worth more than I make in a year, if used correctly. At the same time, 10% of my time is more than a month of a junior high students life is worth.<p>/rant",1326692994

It's totally possible to believe that the finance industry provides valuable capital allocation and risk management services, but to also believe that the companies running these services have become corrupt (and that said corruption happens at the expense of the ""99%"").<p>I don't think one can reasonably blame the population at large for suspecting something fishy. Between bailouts of ""clearing house counterparties"" like AIG/Fannie/Freddie, below-inflation Fed Funds rate to which finance elites have exclusive access, a revolving door of GS alumni at Treasury, etc., one could easily be forgiven for suspecting systematic corruption. The only way to overcome this predisposition is an open commitment to transparency and ""taking your lumps when you deserve them"", which, in my opinion, has not been demonstrated by the finance community vis-a-vis the taxpayer.",1326690379

I don't think this is actually possible as I don't think you can have a subfolder of a site hosted elsewhere (not in a 'performant' manner at least).<p>The only solution that I know of is to host it all on the one box which makes it trick if you want to use Heroku to host your app.<p>I am currently wrestling with this problem as I want to host a new app on Heroku, but have the marketing side of the site powered by wordpress to take advantage of things like third party themes. The app will also generate linkable content, so it is important to me to have it on the same domain, but there seems to be no way to achieve what I want to do with heroku :-(<p>So annoying!",1326690184
