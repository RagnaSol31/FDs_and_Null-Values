Every extra table join hurts performance - typically filters are implented as joins against a filtered sorted limited subquery returning ids, so fewer different table joins means less data to pull in when evaluating filters even when all the data is needed for the results page.<p>Point being, I had to compose complex dynamic queries and SQL was not a particularly pleasant target language to target directly.
