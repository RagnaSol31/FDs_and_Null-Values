The fact is, copyright was never meant for creators. It was invented by distributors for distributors. The first copyright law was a censorship law to limit the amount of books printed when the printing press was was getting widely available in England that gave a total monopoly on publishing to a guild of publishers, without even attributing a book to the original author, but instead to the guild member who registered the book, attaining its newly invented ""copyright"".<p>You know what's the funniest thing about this? The content industry hails this as a stepping stone for authors and their rights, and what's worse, the public believes them. It's a lie, simple as that. Authors never asked for copyright. There was no collective push to stop the copying of their works. On the contrary, they wanted their works to be read.<p>The internet has made copyright obsolete. Moreso, it has made it harmful, and it needs to go away. The internet's here to stay. Copyright, by any means, isn't.",1319694661.0

We're deciding what to do next so wanted to hear opinions from here.<p>Options would include:<p>- Free Plan. We don't currently have a free plan (just a trial) and our model doesn't really fit with that, but is that how other web connected apps get approved, i.e. is Evernote and Dropbox type apps available because they do in-app purchasing or can you argue if you have a free level of service?<p>- Do In-App billing. We use Recurly and have a great subscription service with lots of options.

In a few years I expect most people will just subscribe directly to HBO.<p>As for Dreamworks, 20th Century Fox, MGM, Paramount, and every other movie studio having their own service, the economics won't work. They will make more per subscriber than they would from an aggregater deal, but they will have less subscribers.<p>A few other providers might be able to do what HBO can do. Niche providers, like Crunchyroll, will likely do very well.<p>I expect all of the movie & cable players will make moves on their subscription services.
