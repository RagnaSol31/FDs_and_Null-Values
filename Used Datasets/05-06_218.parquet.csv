With log-then-checkpoint writes and MVCC, there's no interruption of the database at all to reclaim page space used by deleted rows.<p>Cassandra also has a write-ahead log, and flushes it's in-memory representation of data to immutable files on disk, which actually was a pretty brilliant decision. Dead rows are removed during a minor compaction, which can also merge data files together. The compaction is very fast because the files are immutable and in key-sorted order, making it all lock-free, sequential I/O.<p>In theoryland(tm), in-place updates seem better because you're only writing data once. In realityworld(R), the need for compaction, cost of random I/O, data corruption problems, and locking make it suck.",1308806883.0
