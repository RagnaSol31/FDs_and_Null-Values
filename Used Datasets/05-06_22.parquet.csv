If HTTP and HTML didn't exist, we would be compelled to invent them... as we were fifteen years ago when we <i>did</i> invent them.<p>However, HTTP and HTML <i>do</i> exist. And all these other tools are already built on that common platform. So exactly what are we trying to further standardize? What remaining problem are we trying to solve?<p>Because the remaining technical barriers to publishing the same text on (e.g.) Twitter, Flickr, and Blogger are very few: A bit of login hassle (ameliorated by persistent cookies), a bit of copying and pasting. You can automate even more of these keypresses away [1], but I suspect that such efforts are approaching the point of diminishing returns. Because the ultimate bottleneck to publishing the same content on multiple platforms isn't really the time required to paste it.

They're using the stick on the wrong people altogether! That creates an entirely backwards incentive scheme.<p>Meanwhile, DRMing a game through Steam makes it more convenient for the consumer rather than less convenient[1]. They turned the protection scheme from a hindrance into a feature, and a desirable one at that. Most importantly, the carrot wasn't just stapled on to sweeten the deal, the features of Steam are leveraging the DRM itself. I have never heard anyone say ""man Steam is awesome, but they should take out the DRM""--it's an intrinsic part of the additional features.
