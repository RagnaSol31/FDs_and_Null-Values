Of course monetary stimulus only works if the banks decide to actual lend all this cheap money. If they don’t then the money just piles up on their balance sheet and has no effect on aggregate demand.,1437369489.0

And how is Japan not a relevant example?<p>Of course you can always “cure” deflation by printing money. If you gave me control of the printing press for a few weeks I would print up a few billion dollars for each person (or maybe just a few trillion for my friends) and give it away. You can be sure that a dollar would be worth nothing after this exercise.<p>To answer your second question you can’t create inflation unless you actually get the money into the hands of consumers. The central banks have not been printing and handing the money out to consumers, they have been printing and giving it to banks. If the banks don’t have anyone they want to lend to then the money just sits in the bank and has no effect on demand. If I printed off a few trillion dollars for myself and just left it in a huge vault there would be no inflation - we would only get inflation if I went out a started buying every asset under the sun.",1437369224.0
