27,4696536,comment,4696214.0,4696214.0,31,0,beloch,,,"There are a couple of interpretations that makes this article interesting 7 years after it was written.<p>1. Is MS now ""risking it all"" with Windows 8?  Windows 8 is certainly ballsy, but no, MS is not risking it all.  The worst case scenario for Win8 is another epic marketing fail like Vista and slow adoption, followed by immediate uptake of Win9.  Unlike companies such as RIM that have been largely banished from their core markets by Apple, MS's core market hasn't gone anywhere and isn't going anywhere.  MS has expanded their hardware division somewhat (e.g. the Xbox), but to nowhere near the same extent as Apple.  MS has not been pushed to the brink such that they need to risk it all to survive.  MS hasn't shrunk in fact.  The company just looks small now that Apple has shot past them to become so big.  Win8 is not a desperate bid for survival, but rather, a new foray into areas MS hasn't been successful in to date.<p>2. Is Apple now in MS's shoes from half a decade or so ago?  iPod - 2001, iPhone - 2007, Ipad - 2010.   While Apple hasn't exactly disrupted any industries lately, it's not as if they've had a long dry spell.  Still, there are some worrying signs.  The iPod was immensely profitable for Apple because it took so long for halfway decent competitors to arise.  The iPhone was under siege by Android in a much shorter period of time and the iPad in a shorter time-frame still.  The iPad mini actually arrived after it's competition, with inferior specs and a higher price to boot.  The only thing it has going for it is branding.  Was this a fluke or is Apple losing ground?  What is beyond question is that Apple is now a giant with everything to lose rather than the nearly bankrupt company of the late 90's that had just two choices: innovate or die.  Apple is sitting on such a giant pile of cash that, instead of trying to innovate, they could easily decide to just keep making their stuff smaller (or bigger) and sue the pants off of anyone who makes anything similar.  They could do this, but it's very premature to say that they have.  Apple is leaking more product info these days, but it's not like a retina 13"" macbook pro was such a surprise that it had to be kept secret.  Apple may still have disruptive stuff under wraps somewhere in the dark recesses of Cupertino.",1351144205

I wrote this before, eventmachine had pure Ruby reactor. Non blocking calls were introduced in Ruby 1.8.5 IIRC and my library made heavy use of them, and they were buggy. Some issues I found:<p>* select() call used to segfault. \n* the non blocking read/write behaved very differently under different OSes and I am not talking Windows. There were differences between Linux and OSX for example.\n* Again frequent crashes when reading/writing when nonblock flag is set.<p>I am sure, situation is lot better now but for building a reactor library, native Ruby IO primitives fell short. There is always lack of advanced selectors (Epoll/KQueue) as well.<p>Now as I replied to thomas(?) below and since you yourself have wrapped libevent for Ruby 1.9, there were severe limitation in interpreter back then for even libevent wrapper to work.

That's about 0.01%. In a town of 10,000, that's an average (lambda) of 1. About 36% of such towns will have no centenarians, 36% will have one, 18% will have 2, 6% will have 3, 1.5% will have 4, and there's a long tail with 5 (0.3%), 6 (0.05%) or more.<p>It doesn't seem logical that most towns will have 0 or 1 centenarians, and some will have 5 or more, but it's just the way the numbers work.<p>If you pick a higher lambda (for example, the number of 50 year olds) it looks like a normal distribution. If some place has 2X the number of 50 year olds, there will be a good reason. If you pick a higher lambda (the number of people who survive incurable cancer) it looks even wackier, and it's very hard to draw conclusions.<p>What I'm saying is, it's hard to draw conclusions when you are looking at rare events, because there can be so much variation.",1351143226

So I share your bewilderment about why they chose the things to highlight that they did.<p>The lock conditions it has are for particular workloads at particular throughput/utilization, so 99% of the people using it won't hit those conditions initially (and a lot of people aren't writing systems that will ever reach those limits).  However, we have a particular service that acts as a TCP multiplexer/router/load balancer to provide high availability for some of our mission critical applications.  A little over a year ago, I initially wrote it using EventMachine in a couple of weeks, then spent almost a month trying to find what I thought was a bug in my code where a full deadlock would occur if 3 or more connections were established in a small enough time frame.  Turned out to be a bug in EventMachine.  After fixing that one, I found another where if 5 or more open connections fired the same event within a small enough time frame, all 5 would hit livelock and given enough connections hitting the condition, the whole process would deadlock.  Once I hit the second bug in EventMachine itself directly related to concurrency handling, I switched to Netty and rewrote the whole thing in Scala in about a week and it's been rock solid since.<p>I've been doing some development on the side in Go because its particular flavor of types and concurrency model is fascinating.  It's not that Go is anti-event, it's that it's overwhelmingly stream oriented (not low-level streams, but data streams).  Once I finally hit that moment of clarity that goroutines/channels was all about connecting streams of data and not connecting raw streams, they became a much more natural solution.  However, don't get me started on the difference between a non-blocking read on a channel and a blocking read on a channel.",1351142632

Once you say this then you get a free run to depend on the 'rich' for anything and everything. And if they deny any help and ask on what merit you ask for help, you can brand them straight evil.<p>If there is one thing people like this need to learn its that no body gives it to you in life, you have to go and get it. People who started AirBnb are not descendants of aristocrats and kings, they have not inherited billions in wealth to start new businesses on zero risk. Those people bit by bit have built their own success. Do they have to give back something to the society? Yes- Taxes. But they are not responsible for all wrongs going in the society.<p>Besides what is Ayn Rand saying anyway? All she is saying is we must not make up a few pay up for everybody else. Are you as a millionaire responsible if somebody else isn't. How the hell are you responsible for it? Laws and Regulations are supposed to make to help everyone get rich, not to make every one poor on average.<p>When a disruptive business model makes it debut a lot of pain ensues. Automation replaces people, new model of supply chains eliminate middle men etc. Our job is to move to new productive level of work, instead of fighting new trends. Its futile to fight disruptive trends, because the inherent benefits they offer means there is nothing stopping them.<p>Expecting a stranger to worry about your financial well being is the most ridiculous way of living your life.

Android tablets are munching on the periphery.  I just don't see the market acceptance of the Surface.  It is not ""better"" than the iPad. It is a different vision and direction.  But why would millions of users follow that vision when iOS and Android offer a compelling enough platform already?",1351141602

I know they probably can't take it away from him, but that it happened in the first place is a joke. I hope that this never happens again.<p>Why laughable?  If the owner of the bridge does not provide good enough value and operational efficiency, then competing bridges will be received with favor instead of skepticism.  If the government owns the bridge/infrastructure and does not provide acceptable value or efficiencies, it would likely be even harder to create an alternative.",1351141510

If an Uber driver behaves badly, his low star rating will soon push him out of business.</i><p>Well-said. This is the point of view I've come to agree with, so I was eager for the counterpoint. But then came this:<p><i>Its a compelling message but also one with dire potential consequences for public safety, particularly for those who cant afford to take a $50 cab ride to Whole Foods.</i><p>What? We're talking about Uber Taxi, not the black car service. In theory Uber Taxi should lower the cost of a cab since there's presumably less overhead. What I really want to see is a bigger discussion about government regulation being forced out by tighter feedback loops, which is the main point of contention I see with things like Uber, Sidecar, etc.",1351141322
