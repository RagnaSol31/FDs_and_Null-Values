Most of these are not available in the US due to ""safety regulations"" unique to the US, proposed and written by oil company lobbyists, which effectively require that cars sold in the US be very heavy.<p>On the electric car side, the electricity is coming from things like burning coal and oil, or natural gas which we will run out of in a few years. The cars use batteries that contain highly toxic chemicals that are somewhat difficult to extract from the earth, and are done using strip mining. And the batteries lose their capacity after a few years of use and have to be replaced with a new set costing $30-$50,000 at least every five years. But bring up any of this and there is a lot of handwaving and claims that battery technology is getting better. Sure it's getting a tiny bit better, but it's not in the direction of batteries made of air or water or harmless inexpensive materials, and the charge capacity and lifespan are not so dramatically changing that it changes any of the basic dynamics of this technology.<p>In short, even the super green techs don't seem so green when you start really looking at the details.<p>In addition, we have a fetishization of things like electric cars, when the issue of efficient public transport, or getting rid of suburbs so people don't have to commute, are completely ignored even though the gains from this would be massively higher by several orders of magnitude. No, we must have electric cars for each person to drive alone by himself 30 miles to and fro work each morning. That is the only option.<p>I have preferred to live close enough to walk to work and have often managed this. I am often told this is an unrealistic expectation and I need to get real or get with the program. Including by people claiming to be environmentalists, many of whom drive giant gas guzzlers because of some perceived need.<p>Someone walking to work each day is getting infinite miles to the gallon and is going to live longer and have fewer health problems and costs as they age.<p>This is universally considered a non-solution compared to toxic batteries and recharging them using non-renewable resources.",1285653506.0

17,1734719,comment,1734221.0,1734221.0,0,0,cjlars,,,"""While the highly indebted and the newly “asset-poor” have good reason to spend less than before the crisis, creditor households have no reason to spend more. Indeed, the collapse in interest rates in a slump lowers their incomes and so is quite likely to make them want to cut back on their spending, too. The aggregate effect of these changes in behaviour is, of course, a rise in the desired household rate and so the desired financial surplus of the household sector.""<p>Read this carefully, because I'm fairly certain the author is trying to disguise something. His argument is this: Households cut spending and drive down rates, therefore creditors have less income and cut spending, therefore, creditors demand higher rate and more household debt.<p>You can see the sleight of hand, creditors desiring a higher rate does not force a higher rate. In fact, as he already admitted, debtor payments have pushed down the rate. What the author fails to admit is that rates stay low AND debtors pay down their balances. Debtors do not need to somehow 'outsave' their creditors in order to pay down their debt. They simply pay down their debt.<p>There may be arguments for stimulus packages and other counter-cyclical govt spending, but the author doesn't make a fair point for them. I certainly don't see why it would be necessary for govt borrowing to offset an increase in the private savings rate.",1285652979.0

In this case, creditors are forced to write down their loans to the value of the asset. That is clearly an important part of any de-leveraging. But since highly leveraged financial intermediaries stand between the ultimate creditors (households) and the ultimate debtors (other households), mass bankruptcy is going to wipe out the capital of intermediaries. That is likely to trigger panic, as losses cascade across the financial system.<p>Organising such a bankruptcy procedure, to allow for a mass adjustment of claims, is indeed one of the necessary conditions for managing a financial crisis efficiently. But it is going to be politically and technically complicated. In the end, however, a substantial part of the debt and the corresponding credit should be eliminated in this way. The big policy decision is how far the state wishes to socialise the losses of creditors. The answer will certainly include some socialisation, since governments insure deposits in financial institutions.</i>",1285652705.0

I'm in my thirties and from what I've observed so far in life it is extremely hard/rare for them to carry out any single plan regarding Federal spending consistently for more than 2 years or so, before making significant changes, adding loopholes, gutting it, making exceptions, making a total 180 degree turn in direction, etc.<p>To give just one example, if you follow US Congressional news you'll periodically hear about something called a ""debt ceiling"" that supposedly Congress has to follow, which puts a limit on how much debt/deficit is allowed to exist at the Federal budget level.

63,1734672,comment,1733219.0,1733368.0,0,0,dasil003,,,"This article is complete garbage, and I'll tell you why.  Being a competent programmer is about being good with logic, constructing a detailed mental model of a system in detail, and thinking across multiple abstraction layers.  The problem is there is no litmus test for this.  You can glean something from clever interview questions, or coding tests, but even other programmers won't know for sure until the person cranks out code for a while.  The problem with using design pattern knowledge as some sort of test is that it's too high level.  It's just some observations about things that tend to work in certain situations.  But anyone can read about them and if they are moderately intelligent they can talk the talk even if they can't code their way out of a paper box.<p>My other problem with this article is that the author starts off sounds like he <i>almost</i> understands a bit about programming, but then he veers off unforgivably about the divine superiority of design patterns.  ""They are worked out for you and bestowed from on high by geniuses so much smarter than you that they solved all problems at once better than you will ever solve your specific problem, and therefore your code will automatically be better if you use them, and suck if you don't!""  That's a ridiculous overstatement at best.  Knowing design patterns is better than not knowing them, but only if you have the chops to apply them properly.  If you don't then you may just be adding complexity without solving anything.  Furthermore, design patterns are actually just an emergent property of working systems; just because you don't know what they're called doesn't mean you're not using them.  To work with code, such as to make bug fixes, or to extend it you need to go to a much finer level of detail, and to make a large scale system you need to think about overall data flows that are far higher level than the design patterns used in individual components.<p>Design patterns are to programming as literary devices (allegory, simile, onomatopoeia) are to writing.  If someone knows them you can tell they have studied literature, but it doesn't mean they can write worth a damn.",1285651427.0

""Similar to Yammer, users sign in with their corporate email address and can then search for information by keyword. You can also ask questions, and answer directly from the platform. There are a variety of uses cases for the platform. For example, an engineering firm could use the platform as a way to sort through commands. And because most companies are tied to email as a main communication platforms, questions and answers can be distributed and answered by email as well.""<p>That definitely sounds like PG's voice.",1285650104.0

110,1734623,comment,1734353.0,1734353.0,0,0,jsz0,,,"I think the publishers are probably factoring in the effects of piracy. In the past they couldn't stop people from lending/sharing printed books but they could stop mass produced counterfeit printings. Now it's the exact opposite. They can't control the digital counterfeits in the form of piracy but they can stop digital lending/sharing. Maybe they hope to break even in the end. I can see from their perspective that having both sources of lost revenue combined is a nightmare scenario. I think as readers we probably need to accept that $10 or $15 for a book that is going to bring you many hours of enjoyment isn't a bad deal. We have the Internet to research books, fairly generous samples to read, social networking to spread the word.",1285650026.0

The only use-case for a portable library  would be writing a scientific paper at the restaurant or coffee shop. I have my doubts though that this would improve the quality of the paper.",1285650015.0
