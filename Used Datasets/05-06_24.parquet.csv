After close to 4 weeks now of trialing Chrome, I'm 99% certain that I won't be going back to FF for development and certainly not for everyday web browsing. I've now installed a total of 10 extensions into Chrome that well enough duplicate everything I had in FF (supporting my web dev and typical browsing activities). And bear in mind this is from a guy who has used FF for many years and was really looking for any excuse not to make the switch. But I gave it a chance and am actually quite surprised that Chrome has won me over.<p>The clincher for me was looking at Chrome extension development. The extension system for Chrome seems really accessible and well thought out and I feel like I could make some Chrome extensions for myself without really any hassle at all.
