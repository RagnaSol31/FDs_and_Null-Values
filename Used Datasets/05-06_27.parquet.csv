1,8938942,comment,8931431.0,8938845.0,0,0,donavanm,,,Ok... So looking at IFG as 96 bits or 12 bytes of &quot;overhead&quot; thats 0.8% or 0.13% for 1.5k and 9k frames. Why do I care about 0.67% of throughput? And pretty much all silicon in over a decade does line rate at 1k anyways. Or if its latency a hypothetical higher clocked lane would be something like 1ns instead of ~3ns per frame? Thats the difference between 2 clock cycles and 6 cycles of latency.<p>So what is your shorter/faster ifg buying in practice.,1422079142.0
