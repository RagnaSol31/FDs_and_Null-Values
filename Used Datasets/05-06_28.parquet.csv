MP3s can easily do 32kbps - they sound like crap from a musical standpoint, but they do it just fine.  Heck, mp3s at 8kbps still sound significantly better than my cell phone - you could run <i>7</i> audio streams at the same time on dial-up with that quality.  Similarly, uncompressed video is <i>huge</i>, when a <i>high</i>-quality h.264 pass will look almost identical with <i>massive</i> size savings.  From the several charts, it looks like CELT could be a very large improvement over the encoders they compared against (I'm assuming a relevant sampling), especially where speed is concerned, and I'll definitely poke at it and see what I think.<p>I very much liked the spectrograms, that looks to be a <i>massive</i> improvement.

Once and for all English has been established as the universal language to communicate.<p>India as an example, has majority of its websites targeted towards English speaking audience (which is a huge lot in India) and its not because no body wants to do a regional website, its because the regional websites have very less number of readers.

And there is no hard feeling about having ""English"" as a pre-requisite because that helps you in reaching to a wider audience.<p>Niche cannot be denied and we will always have regionally targeted products but that won't replace English at a global level.

However, I can give you a command line you can run which will plot a very nice graph of throughput vs. number of selector threads in a specific system that I've been working on.<p>Yes, it will bring you back to ""concurrent madness"". What you _want_ is having primitives that make it possible to deal with this madness, not handwave it away. In Erlang they're actors themselves, optimized for efficient delivery of message within a single node and remotely, supervision of processes that fail, ETS, mnesia; in Java they're Doug Lea's beautiful concurrent collections (java.util.concurrent). You're assuming multi threading pthreads or synchronized/notify/wait (Java before java.util.concurrent).<p>Note that there are two models for this: one is Erlang's as well as traditional UNIX IPC -- message passing; the other is shared memory multi-threading with concurrent and lock free collections (Java), which also goes nicely with the idea of minimizing mutable state (Haskell, Clojure, Scala). One is good for one kinds of applications which optimize for worst case latency (Erlang shines there), the other is good for another, which optimize for average throughput (JVM shines there).",1293168317.0

48,2036620,comment,2033840.0,2033899.0,0,0,ndl,,,"This is an attitude that some recruiting startups like us all to believe, but even as a naive and inexperienced 22 year old, I think it's dangerous.  I've had a startup implode, and it's nasty in ways one never expects - joining a startup is one of the easiest ways to ruin a relationship.  You may love the work you expect to do, but a startup will throw you curveballs until you are sick of them.  If you are willing to take crummy compensation because you love the team, think about what happens when they have an opportunity to discard you like used tissue - if they don't think you're worth a decent equity stake, they probably won't hesitate to.<p>You have to ask yourself if you couldn't gain better experience by a) working for a big company b) going to grad school c) founding your own startup.  There might be cases in which the underpaying startup job really is the best next-stage career advancer.  Even if this is true, read any non-compete agreement very carefully.  I've had people shove non-competes in my face before telling me what the company actually did (so I could not compete with the entire industry?  No thanks).<p>I would also not go in assuming that the company will be the next Facebook.  Find out how the founders and investors plan to exit, and decide if that's acceptable to you.  Furthermore, make sure you can deal with failure.<p>I think going in with realistic expectations and a clear head is just as important to the startup one wishes to join.  I suppose there are some startups (many in NYC) whose goal is to suck in naive techies and dump them when they burn out, but most probably want to build a real team.  If you sign something based on unwritten expectations, you are setting up for resentment and conflict when those expectations go unmet.<p>I probably sound overly pessimistic now, but I don't mean to be.  Joining a startup can be a great opportunity in innumerable ways.  I still intend to launch, even after some of the worst months of my life.  Many of my friends who shared this sentiment no longer do.  I think some had naive expectations about the lifestyle, how quickly we'd all be rolling in money, and what being an ""entrepreneur"" would look like to the rest of the world.",1293167852.0

61,2036606,story,,,19,16,nikz,Rate my startup: 200 Square (100% online real estate agency in NZ),,"Our new startup is called 200 Square, and we're trying to change the way real estate is sold in New Zealand.<p>200square.co.nz<p>Basically, we manage the whole process online - you list your house for sale, order marketing and even negotiate with potential buyers all online. The legal environment here means you can even digitally ""sign"" agreements using a credit card!<p>There's no human ""agent"" in the process - 200 Square manages it all, although you can get in touch with someone for help if you need it.  We also charge a fixed ""success fee"" instead of the usual commission paid to an agent (2% - 4% of the sale price here, depending on a number of things).<p>I'm really interested in what you guys think of the concept, and the home/info pages - we are trying to explain a complicated process as concisely and simply as possible.<p>Appreciate anything you might suggest however!",1293167425.0
