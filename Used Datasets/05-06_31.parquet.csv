Isn't this a security risk if you install an app that tries to look for passwords in your Sqlite DB?,1311397931.0

The evaluation of students who had honor code violations were not reported.<p>From his original blog post he mentioned that he did not refer all his students to the university's ""honor council"". He even gave the student who copy/pasted another student's work a chance to redo the paper without referring it to the administration.<p>It's a very reasonable thing for him to do given the consequences of being referred to the honor council. Having cheating on your college transcript is a scarlet letter if you're thinking about graduate school. You get an 'F' in the course and will not be granted admission to any medical, law, dentistry, or pharmacy school. The consequences are disproportionately severe given how pervasive cheating is.",1311397280.0
