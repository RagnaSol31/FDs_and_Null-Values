71,1920494,comment,1920155.0,1920432.0,0,0,nspiegelberg,,,"Facebook is rated higher for a number of reasons:<p>1) High impact.  Most team sizes are 5 people or less.  Those 5 people are handling big systems like photos or memcache.  You know you're doing important things.<p>2) Move fast.  Example: Facebook Groups went from concept to release in 3 months.  In other companies, it would take 3 months just to get through release engineering.<p>3) Hackathon!  People here love to code, and the environment encourages you.  A lot of managers have switched back to SWEs, reinforcing that it's not demeaning to stay technical.<p>4) Still growing.  It's true, new hotness normally trumps old & established.  However, where Google started doubling every 6-9 months; Facebook tries to maintain top quality at the occasional expense of slower growth.  This is helping the company retain most of its original culture.",1290143249.0

Everything you do automatically has an audience.  People care about the software you write and use it in their daily lives.<p>2.) You get social cachet from working there.  Say ""I work for Google"", and a bunch of people will say, ""Oh, that must be nice.  I wish I was smart enough to get in there.""  Outside of a few nerds who are too cool for FaceBook, saying ""I work for FaceBook"" gets the same reaction.<p>3.) Being in a younger, game-changing company gives you the chance to work on cooler, game-changing technologies.  Many tech workers are attracted by hard problems; young, fast-growing companies tend to have lots of hard problems.<p>4.) When companies are younger, they've accumulated less legacy code and fewer bureaucratic procedures.  If you ask a bunch of Googlers what they hate most about working for Google, I bet a large portion will say ""legacy code"".  This is a maintenance tax that isn't fun at all, yet has to be dealt with whenever you build something on top of it.  Being younger and smaller, FaceBook has less of this.",1290142819.0
