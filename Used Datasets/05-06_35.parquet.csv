For starters:<p><i>who is Google to dictate what other companies do with their own data</i><p>It's our data, not Facebooks, not Google's. Google is providing a benefit for Facebook and it's users and in return want's Facebook to provide the same. This is a good business decision for Google, a relatively very small nuisance for Facebook (since they do have a feature to export data), and a great BIG step in providing us, the USERS, with simple ways to use out data wherever/however we see fit. They are not dictating what other companies should do with their data, they're asking for the data stream to be importable/exportable by means of a two way sync in which the user is the one in control of their information.<p>Also, ""substantially fast"" and ""easy"", means ""in a non crippling way"". They don't want to get screwed over by Facebook adding what Google requests but maiming to a point it's not useful to anyone, in which case both the users and Google suffer from it.<p><i>How is this going to affect us - the small startups and independed developers</i><p>How is it going to affect you? Easy, after you leverage Google's API for years to get a gazillion users and a 25 billion dollar valuation, Google is going to expect you to play nice and share your data with them, but only if your users want to so anyway.<p>You know what sounds borderline evil to me? That you want to leverage the users data the resides in Google's servers and also take advantage of the API's Google make accessible, but don't want to have to go thru the trouble of giving them the same treatment. I find the company that doesn't comply with such a simple request more evil than the company that provides such a service and wants to build a relationship based on reciprocity, but is forced to close it's doors because someone doesn't want to play nice.",1288936318.0

For our example, we'll suppose you can invest somewhere and get a 10% return.<p>The formula for a growing perpetuity = PV = c/(r - g), where PV is the present value.  This formula only works if the growth rate is less than the discount rate... following this rule, we have to use a higher discount rate, so we'll assume you can get 100% somewhere else (let me know if you have a place where you can do this.)<p>If you take the series of system payments, then you would have:<p>PV = c/(1 + r) + c(1 + g)/((1 + r)^2) + ... + c((1 + g)^n)/((1 + r)^n)\nwhich ultimately equals PV = c/(r - g)<p>PV = 200,000 / (1.00 - .80) = $1,000,000<p>So $1,000,000 is the amount someone would be willing to pay for all the present values of all future earnings on the perpetuity, assuming you have an r = 100%.<p>If g > r, then the growing perpetuity would (theoretically) have an infinite value.<p>edit: added value = $1,000,000 assuming r = 100%",1288933845.0

There are plenty of fun multiplayer games on the Wii that just wouldn't work with traditional controllers.,1288933767.0

I am curious which services out there have open APIs that one can use to create mashups (and just generally query).<p>I ran across an old HN article -- http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=216112 -- which is an interesting start, but being over 2 years old is a little dated.<p>I guess my question is simply -- what services out there allow location based queries to their data, what rates/limits do they put on them, and are there ways to getting greater access (for instance w/ Twitter -- the firehose vs. normal account query limits).<p>If there is already a good list, please share that.

I've had my Google account since it was in Beta, and it's 48% filled.<p>Gmail has been so unbearably slow for me that it forced me to switch from Firefox to Chrome on a Mac. In Chrome, it's much better, but still very slow.<p>In fact, I just got Office 2011 and trying out Outlook.. I've used to be a devoted Outlook user before I switched to a Mac and went 100% Gmail for all my personal & professional mail.

Apple quickly quashed this, so perhaps these apps are looking to benefit from word of mouth, or to gain a number of reviews. As I mentioned earlier you need 5-6 reviews before you even get a rating and having more certainly doesn't hurt.<p>On a similar note, I believe Apple's charts may now be weighted to take price into account, at least in some form. I occasionally play around with app prices to see how sales/revenue/in-app purchases change, and last week I upped the price of one app from $1.99 to $2.99. Sales dropped from ~400 to ~250, but my chart placing was virtually unchanged (I think I dropped once place). I don't believe the ranking is based on sales over a period of days, though it may be a factor, since my ranking does increase/decrease with normal sales fluctuations.",1288933551.0
