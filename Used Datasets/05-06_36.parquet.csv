It's even more amusing because what he turned in was even more amateurish than the original. It's titled ""Magna Carta's <i>Affect</i> on the Class Structure in London"", even though it scarcely discusses the class structure in London; he misspells ""dimensions"" in the header, even with the aid of a computer; it's white on crimson with gratuitous visual aids; the typesetting changes erratically between double and single spaced; finally, what few sentences of original writing there is to stitch the thing together betrays not so much any actual thought so much as a vague assertion that the plagiarized paper was somehow about the topic he was assigned to write about. That it was even accepted as college level coursework is a stain on the reputation not just of Aaron Kerzner, but of Drs. Michael Swanson and Debra Mulligan (who, even put together, couldn't catch this clown) and Roger Williams University.<p>By the way, this guy is in our industry: <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pub/aaron-kerzner/1a/b96/3b0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/pub/aaron-kerzner/1a/b96/3b0</a>.

15,3410271,comment,3409809.0,3410067.0,0,0,droithomme,,,"$200k isn't a rock star salary.<p>You are correct that paying market salaries for competent engineers does not ensure competent engineers.<p>However it must be noted that <i>not</i> paying market salaries for competent engineers definitely ensures that one employes substandard talent. The market is working well right now and competent engineers have no problem receiving market rate. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever why competent engineers will not find a job paying the market rate for their talent, and that is exactly what happens. As for the companies that can not pay market rate, well they are simply not competitive and will fail. That's how the free market works and it is a very good thing.<p>Any company that requires being competitive in the tech domain needs to be willing to pay for key talent. Companies like Target definitely need to do everything they can. Arguments that incompetent developers are good enough are absurd. Obviously what they have now is not working.<p>Building a site that can handle a nationwide retailer the size of Target, second only to WalMart in brick and mortar stores, is completely non-trivial. The top 2 engineers there need to be paid at least $1.5 million annual salary. Sorry. I know many companies don't like this but there it is. Now obviously there are many levels below this, but this requires a pretty large development team and several below this level are going to be getting $200k-$400k. At the bottom, the losers that are just out of college and don't know anything, those guys are going to be making $75k to start. Because that's the starting salary. Companies don't want to hear this. Only the fatuous useless ignorant executives that have run the company into the ground should be paid these salaries, in their opinion. Well, they can keep thinking that and see where it gets them. Many will lobby Congress, that is a popular tactic. Pay a lobbying firm $25 million and maybe you'll be able to flood the market with cheap engineers from overseas who are willing to work for $21 an hour, and are able to do the same things that any other $21 an hour retail employee can do. Because the overseas guys that really know their stuff are not looking for $21 jobs, they are making the same salary as everyone else with their skill level. Because that's how the market works.",1325310347.0
