This effect is actually the worst in Japan, followed by Italy.<p>re: lack of women<p>The nice possibilities are polyandry, in which one female marries multiple males.  Another is the the devaluing of males.  I.e. because of the rareness of females, males may some how compensate  their families, and girls could become more valuable for parents to have.  A third ""nice"" possibility would be to import females from other countries, or for males to emigrate to higher female areas.  This would diffuse the problem, although if China's population becomes high enough it will just spread the problem to everyone.<p>The not-so-nice possibilities include increased male-male competition for mates (which happens in all species, including humans; single males are much more likely to be murdered or be murderers than their married counterparts/women in all cultures.)  In history, it would be quite common for violence to occur at least in part for the purpose of procuring more females.<p>We can't predict it, but there's likely to be some sort of fallout.

He was a brilliant programmer, had a much better short-term and long-term memory than I do, and was well-versed in numerous other topics.<p>I also knew another person that was mostly average, and then started smoking marijuana, and lost all drive to do anything or the ability to recall conversations from the previous day.<p>And I knew yet another person that wanted to get something done in life, so he quit smoking marijuana and felt a lot better, much sharper, started studying again, etc.<p>It depends. The important part is that you spend enough time in introspection to understand what's good for you and what isn't.<p>There's nothing intrinsically good or bad about marijuana.",1260335154
