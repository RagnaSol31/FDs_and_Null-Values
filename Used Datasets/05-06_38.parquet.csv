In most jurisdictions, a corporation is required to have a ""records office"" where various corporate paperwork can be consulted during normal business hours (rules vary about who is allowed to consult what, but often a member of the general public can walk in and ask to see your articles of incorporation and list of directors).<p>If you want to be strictly legal, you should pay your lawyer to do this; google reveals lots of lawyers who provide this service for a modest (e.g., $100/year) fee.  Some people are less concerned with such details, and just list one of the founders' home addresses as the records office; at which point they're <i>technically</i> breaking the law if they leave home during normal business hours (because at that point the records office isn't open) -- but for a small company, the odds of anyone ever turning up and asking to inspect documents is usually minimal.<p>Of course, I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice, and jurisdictions vary -- but I think it's safe to say that if you're paying a lawyer to help with incorporating your company, he can help with this.",1249883362.0

Even Atlanta is quite cheap compared to almost every other American city, especially the first-rate one, with very sane real estate prices except in areas like Buckhead.<p>But, if that's too much, head over to a college town like Athens.  Can easily get a 2 or 3-bedroom apartment for $500-$600, $700-$900 if you want a rather upscale one.  Salaries are low, and no shortage of college talent pool.  There are a lot of townies, too;  the charm of Athens seems to rub off on a lot of folks that finish college here.  The University of Georgia is here - 32,000 students or more.<p>The broadband is good, and the living generally cheap.  Real estate is by far the most expensive thing in Athens.  It's somewhat annoyingly suburban outside of downtown and older historical areas, but that can be dealt with.<p>Honestly, I think that's a lot easier than trying to go through all the trouble of moving abroad.",1249882560.0

Because I feel like you need so much less of that than you think to be really happy.""<p>In my case, it's not the money, it's the information.  I work at one of the large tech companies in the valley, as a full-time employee.  I spend about 20 hrs/week (out of about 50 hrs/week spent at work) actually coding, and most of the rest of the workweek reading & studying.  After all, I can't write my code without understanding how it fits into the rest of the system.<p>The thing is, I can't learn the stuff I'm learning now <i>anywhere</i> else.  Universities don't have it.  The open-source world doesn't have it.  It's all proprietary & confidential, and the only way to learn it is to work on systems that require it.<p>It was the same way for my last salaried job - I wanted to know how the financial industry worked, so I took a job at a financial software startup.  As it turned out, I <i>didn't</i> want to learn how the financial world worked ;-), but I'm glad I had that exposure, even just as a high-level overview.<p>The money is just an added perk - it's nice to get paid 4x more and have a 401k and health coverage, but really, the only reason I care is that everyone else is getting it and I don't wanna feel like I'm being ripped off.  I work for other organizations because I want to work on interesting problems, and I wouldn't have the opportunity to do so without the help of others.<p>I was a voracious reader in high school and college, and kinda feel like I've ""read out"" what's available through the public library system.  A lot of books I check out now just feel shallow & superficial compared to what I've been exposed to in a professional context.  University libraries are still somewhat interesting, but again, they often have the problem of being access-controlled to people enrolled in the university.

A part time computer job anyway, will totally kill your focus.  There is something big to be said for full timing it.  It sounds like he's talking about saving to go full time out of the US, and the bottom line is that he can do the same thing by living in poverty IN the US - and still have access to the networks in the bay area.",1249881016.0

Nice relaxed environment for when youre not working.<p>I was previously living in Australia.  Made a decent living from consulting work which may have been one of the reasons the product side of the business didn't do terribly well.  Once I was out of the country consulting work got harder to get so I've had to devote more energy to products and that seems to be bearing fruit.<p>Apartment rent is maybe $300/mth inc net connection, water, electricity.  Can get a good thai meal for $1-3.  Net connection is pretty quick although the infrastructure is a bit dodgy so there is an outtage probably once a week for generally no more than an hour or two.  Dont think Id host here but for your own connection its fine.",1249881004.0

I'm trying to think of what my friends are doing that's more interesting than a startup, and I can't really think of anything.  Grad school.  Law school.  A second bachelor's, because the first was in something unemployable.  Unemployment.  Living at home with parents and working at a coffee shop, or as a dog-walker.  Spending 5 full days/week working for a big corporation, with the commute not allowing any extra time during the day - well, at least they get weekends.<p>I can really only think of a couple people doing interesting stuff.  One spent 6 months on a boat in an Alaska working as a salmon fisher.  Another is on a boat in the South Pacific as part of a grad program in geology in Chile.  A third is in the Peace Corps.  All of those have downsides (eg. salmon fishing is incredibly physically demanding and stinks, literally, and the girl in the Peace Corps gets sexually harassed wherever she goes).  And in all cases, it's at the cost of not being able to build up any savings at all.",1249880881.0

Someone here on HN, or someone somewhere else?<p>Just yesterday, writing a review of a different book, I came upon this interesting quotation from Thomas Sowell:<p>""The taboo against discussing race and IQ has not left this an open question. On the contrary, it has had the perverse effect of freezing an existing majority of testing experts in favor of a belief that racial IQ differences are influenced by genetics. No belief can be refuted if it cannot be discussed.""<p>Agreeing with Sowell on the endorsement of open inquiry, I would love to have people discuss carefully, thoughtfully, and without name-calling what they mean when they talk about genetic influences on human intelligence and all other influences on human intelligence. This is a much-researched issue, and I have taken care to meet some of the eminent researchers in person and to read the peer-reviewed journal articles and major monographs of many more researchers on the issue for more than a decade. Facts are established by careful observation and experimentation, and the implications of those facts are discovered by considering yet more facts.",1249880605.0
