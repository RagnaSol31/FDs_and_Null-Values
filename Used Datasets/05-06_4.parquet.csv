If yes, which ones.<p>Oh, and if you would like to point out this already exists - feel free to flame me and mock my ignorance.<p>Context:\nI was working in the garden with my girlfriend and we were discussing (putting it politely) planting a tree without blocking the morning sun. It was evening so we could not verify our claims. This issue remained unsolved until the next morning when we could verify the sun's position. (I won.)<p>Idea:\nCreate a mashup of google maps and sun/moon position data.<p>Usage:\nWhen a user goes to street view (or similar) at any point (long/lat position) in google maps on earth and gives a date, they would be able to see the arc the sun/moon makes through the sky.<p>I have some development experience but do not have a broad knowledge of best-of-breed tools out there.<p>Thanks for any suggestions or refinement on the idea!<p>PS: Feel free to steal this idea and make it happen - I'd be happy to use your app.",1242799174.0

While it sounds like an adventure, please be advised before you try this out- even though you will need a pittance compared to US salaries to live lavishly in India, a lower salary does mean that you wouldn't have enough saved in USD to be able to come back after a few years and feel ahead of your peers. A lot of infrastructure is just missing other there, meaning people used to just heading out over the weekend for skiing would have to say goodbye to a <i>lot</i> of livestyle options<p>Worst thing is, wherever you go, you would look american - which makes you a ripe target for getting mugged, pickpocketed or swindled.",1242798610.0

With creationism/ID, it is expected that you do not question the nature of the creator/designer beyond what information is provided in texts or by religious/ideological leaders. With evolution, the principles are based on math and chemistry, which is in turn based on physics, which is currently being probed down to the smallest scales possible.

29,618128,comment,617503.0,618081.0,0,0,thoughtidsay,,,"Free spirit, free thinker, thoughtful, radical are some descriptions of the same idea. I guess it depends on the vantage point. A radical opposition to an oppression that catalyses a positive outcome, is viewed as a positive deviation by some, and of course viewed as a negative deviation by the oppressors. I basically try as I can to evaluate most ""big ideas"" on their merits, to the extent of my ability. I don't have neither the time nor energy to evaluate everything so some things I take at face value. So in my view, the more people who choose to think outside of the boundaries of a given established ""norm"", the more healthy the society in general. This is an enormous topic, so what I said is not even a splinter of it.<p>> That's one option but there are lots of others. Richard Feynman made a game out of not cheating on Arline with tempting girls. He enjoyed the challenge. If you don't want to cheat, there are rational ways to accomplish that.<p>Basically I view change of heart as a normal occurrence. It happens, there are far worse things in life. But I also view betrayal in some of the most negative light possible. Divorce/separate and off you go. I just don't see a solution to suppressing one's urge. If one is convinced they've ""finally found the right person"" then what next? I don't know, but I do know that to exercise that urge while feigning ignorance is pathetic example of a human malice and weakness. At least hold it until you can separate and inform your former ""loved one"" of your intentions. Otherwise, if it's a fleeting ""crush"". Drop it like a hot potato and move on. Why betray? Because it feels good? I don't know. Why make your loved one jealous? Some do it out of spite -- it becomes an endless game of getting back at each other.<p>> I think it's bad to betray people. I also think it's generally wise not to make promises that are hard to keep in the first place.<p>There are civil and fruitful means of dissolving a contract. It's just my view that conniving and lying and otherwise being unfaithful is an anathema to reason, trust and a healthy society. That's my view of course, and I don't plan to impose it on others in any way, but I will go to the utmost of my ability to abide by it.<p>It's just so happens that jealousy is the central emotion that runs through the veins of the aforementioned beast. Human interaction is built on jealousy and it can be either good or bad. I think few other emotions, except perhaps fear, have more influence over our lives, or are as central. I remain suspect when people claim immunity to it.",1242796149.0
