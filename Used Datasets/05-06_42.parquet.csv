The whole idea is to skip the polling of the database.<p>Java has some useful classes but what about other web languages? \nOr am I approaching this in the wrong way?

I have a queue of projects that I would like to get to and when I have an interesting thought about them I document it in a project document but I never do development on them until I am done with my current personal project.

This allows me enough time to really decide if this is the one I want to focus on.<p>The nice part about being disciplined in this manner, is that ideas that are nebulous in my mind are usually concrete by the time I get around to them. you would be surprised how much stuff gets worked out by just having a project floating around in your mind for a while.<p>Almost every time I go through my notes when starting a new project, I think ""wow I am glad I let this one roll around in my head for a while"" because the notes create a very clear and coherent idea, by the time I get around to working on it.

I'd assume that taxes are already included since that's part of what'd you'd consider when moving between areas, and is another area where you'd save by moving.<p>If we assume that taxes are included: Moving to Austin costs $20.9k in total salary. Total expenses would have to be $79,167 ($20,900 / 0.264) or less for the Valley to win out. If the hypothetical person saves more than $20,833 a year (after taxes since we're assuming those are part of the cost of living), having higher earnings is preferable to having a lower cost of living to increase the size of the savings. Many people don't save that much.<p>You also chose San Jose as the city for the comparison, when most people I know prefer to live in San Francisco, where the cost of living is even higher. Moving to Austin from San Francisco supposedly results in a 42.7% decrease in cost of living. You'd have to be saving $51,053 after taxes for moving to be a bad idea financially.",1280728138

It's cheaper than other cities and provinces to hire people, especially programmers. From everything I've read so far about the city, I think starting out is around 45k, then sr. positions is 60, and tops right out at around 70k for level IV guru coders. So, it's definitely not the Valley in terms of developer salaries.</i><p>The corollary is that the great programmers in Vancouver all move to the USA so that they can get paid effectively double what they would make in Vancouver. If you're good, it's also very easy on a TN-1. (I've worked with a couple dozen programmers from BC (Vancouver, Victoria) throughout my career)",1280725582

It's the same sentiment espoused by people who don't have time to design software properly, or test it, or do exception handling. The tool is an important part of solving problems, but having an elegant tool helps keep the tool itself from becoming a problem.
