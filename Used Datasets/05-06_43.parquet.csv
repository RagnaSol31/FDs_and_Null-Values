Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is difficult to suppose that the treatment of such a thing is going to be a mere outpatient clinical procedure with a high success rate and few side effects.<p>It is precisely because cancers are a broad category of runaway cellular processes (united only by their invasiveness and lack of negative feedback into the growth process) that are highly distinct in every which way that the concept of a ""cure"" for ""cancer"" as such is an absurd one to anyone who has the slightest clue about how cancers operate.<p>It does seem that targeted therapy is the most successful avenue to pursue, but I don't think the author has any idea of the sheer amount of even the most common and relatively simple ""targets.""  I think he's imagining that there are a dozen, maybe two;  liver cancer is cured one way, brain cancer another way, retinal blastomas another way, prostate cancer yet another way... that's just not how it works.  Each one of those corpuses of tissue can develop many kinds of tumours, and some of them can develop practically innumerable kinds.<p>But hey, far it be from me to rain on anybody's parade - I'm not an oncologist, and have no life sciences background.  Let's hope I'm wrong viz. my opening sentence and that I'm just a pretentious, know-it-all twit, and that he's right.",1263361458.0

Not sure how many can be queued up and cached, but I've done two no problem.<p>Also, you'll want a task killer app, since you'll find that apps never ""go away"" until the system runs out of memory causing android to take over and kill some programs.  My favourite so far is ""Taskpanel"".  Additionally, for recording a GPS track, use ""My Tracks"" which is simple and enjoyable enough to use, lets you email the file to yourself when done.<p>""gpsstatus"" is fantastic - the must have for a tinkerer!  Also usable as a level, so no need to get one of the trillion level applications.<p>Believe it or not, the flashlight apps are very handy to have on the desktop, as they keep the phone from sleeping/dimming too soon.<p>HANDS DOWN the best application if you do any amount of texting or MMS, is 'handcent sms'.  It is a fantastic program, and one of the nicest Android programs I have used.  Can't praise this enough!<p>For twitter, 'twidroid' is my favourite.  I don't do too much twittering, so am not sure the competition, but this one is speedy, feature filled and never bogs down my phone.  You'll find that isn't always the case with android apps, so twidroid gets a nod for this (as well as handcent, it is rock solid).<p>If you use ampache at all, my buddy Kevin created an android app to stream from your ampache server.  It's called 'amdroid' and is pretty decent.  It's definitely a work in progress but it's fully functional.<p>'phonalyzer' is cool for seeing stats on your phone usage.  Much better than any carrier specific graph on a webpage, and it's small enough to not worry about having it installed and taking up space.  It's definitely what I call a ""toilet"" app, because that is about when I use it, however, it's nice to know my usage here and there!  I guess that is praise, because it means I don't have to spend hardly any time using the app to get benefits from it.<p>depending on the android version/carrier/handset manufacturer, you may want to install 'spare parts'.  It's a few more settings not found in the settings menu, but I think this only supplements handsets running android 1.5, but I am not sure off top of my head.<p>Finally, root your phone and install 'wireless tether for root users'.  I kid you not, it's the most useful app i've used.  You can't find it in the market, but a simple google search will get it for you, and you can just click the link from the android browser to install it.  It has access control lists, WEP (better than nothing) and multiple concurrent client support.  I love this application, but of course, use at your own risk as you have to root your phone to use it (not a problem for most handsets), and you may run up data charges fast if you don't have unlimited.<p>That's my main list, anything else has been tinkering.
