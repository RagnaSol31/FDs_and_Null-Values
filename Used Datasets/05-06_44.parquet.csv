Suddenly, the practice seems much more acceptable, to the point where I wonder why I'm instinctively against it.<p>I guess the answer is that we should consider a stark difference between bribing someone for 'services' that aren't at his discretion to provide, such as a police officer dropping a bill or a government employee granting a permit, versus bribing someone for services that really are at the discretion of the person being bribed. The rules for being seated at these restaurants are informal rules and no laws are broken in bending them a bit.<p>As a result of this article, I feel much less unfavorably about 'bribing' random personnel of companies.

19,1658736,comment,1657143.0,1657143.0,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"My recollection of John Holt's writings -- admittedly somewhat fuzzy, but some 25 years ago I read all his books and even did some volunteer work for him, so I think I got the gist -- certainly doesn't include a recommendation to abandon one's kids to their own devices.  He did argue that we could trust kids' instincts about things like when they get interested in learning to read, but I don't think he would ever have told parents not to pay attention to their kids or spend time with them -- which, though you don't say so specifically, sounds like part of what's going on here.<p>John believed in children very much -- believed in the wisdom of the natural unfolding of their interests and abilities.  And he encouraged parents to believe in them too.  My recollection is that it was not common for parents who had read his books and were corresponding with him and one another through his newsletter (Growing Without Schooling) to have kids turn out in the manner you describe; quite the contrary.  While I'm wary about putting words in John's mouth, I suspect he would have agreed that there's something wrong in this situation, even if he might not have completely agreed with you about what it is.<p>I do recall occasional stories of kids who showed no interest in reading until they were quite old -- around 10, as I recall.  But the usual ending of the story was that at some point they did become interested, not just casually but quite voraciously, so that they more or less caught up with other kids their age.<p>As for the ""manipulation"" -- I certainly don't think reading to your kids, to take an important example, would be outside the bounds of unschooling as I understand it.  I don't think unschooling is supposed to be like the Prime Directive in Star Trek, where one has to strive to have as little impact of any kind on one's children as possible.  That's nuts and I don't think John would ever have endorsed it.",1283492620

Twice actually.<p>One of the contacts I made today was the only technical recruiter I've ever met that understands the industry he caters to.  I'm looking on my own, but he has a nose for finding much better than average gigs.  I'm not relying on him, but he has exclusive access to a fair number of decent companies which quickly broadens my search.<p>Managers can't complain.  Heck, one of the partners went out of his way to write my review.  Partners don't write reviews.  He did it to make a point.  However, constantly going the extra mile has me physically and emotionally exhausted, and I see no chance for relief until mid-2011.<p>-----<p>I keep my foundation expenses to a minimum, and normally save 30-40% of my paycheck, but numerous mishaps this year have effectively wiped out most of this year's efforts.  My health is currently of concern (despite being in my late 20s and reasonably good physical fitness), so that's what's giving me pause as I investigate those options.  That and sacrificing my bonus and 401K match (7% of compensation), though at this point I'm willing to eat that.<p>-----<p>The intention is mobile games.  It's something I can do entirely by myself, save for paying a college student for help with the first year or two of getting my tax nonsense in order.  No direct customers to deal with.  Tools and hardware that doesn't suck.  Development costs are negligible.  I have a detailed concept, and overall complexity isn't much more than something out of the NES era -- much of the effort will be re-learning my drawing skills, and incessant polishing.  The overall scope is very realistic for a single person to push out in 4 months.<p>Originally the plan was to release on the side with the hope of eventually covering most, if not all, of my foundation expenses so I can save more aggressively.  However stress has me past my breaking point -- I'm already broken.  I doubt more work is an ideal solution, but a relaxed pace and being able to release something that meets my standards is a change of pace I sorely need.  So either I continue to crank for the office while cranking for myself, or I tell them I'll build my own lunar lander... with blackjack... and hookers!",1283492340

Their pixels are consequently a bit bigger. If Apple made the right decision Canon, Nikon and Panasonic must have, too.<p>They get it and they know that at least their best informed customers (those who actually buy high end small sensor compacts) will also get it. They are probably only (unnecessarily) afraid of the general public, all those who buy the cheapo point and shoots. If you are willing to pay you get appropriate pixel densities.",1283490763

Most would not say that the immersion school is better than all other schools, but that doesn't mean they believe they believe it is worse. Likely they are sending their children there because they want them to learn to speak French fluently, not because they believe other schools are worse.<p>Here's a more recent study from the US Department of Education:<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/homeschool/TableDisplay.asp?TablePath=TablesHTML/table_4.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/homeschool/TableDisplay.asp?Tabl...</a><p>This 2003 study is considered to be far superior to the 1999 one cited for reasons discussed in this article:<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/homeschool/parentsreasons.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/homeschool/parentsreasons.asp</a><p>For example, on the 1999 study two flaws listed are ""when faced with an open-ended question, parents may not have recalled or responded with all of the reasons for homeschooling that were applicable to their situation"" and ""parents were not specifically asked to report their primary reason for homeschooling"".<p>As you can see the 2003 study addresses these procedural errors and breaks out factors cited at all separately from those cited as primary concern.<p>The most listed factor for both was environmental factors in other schools, meaning ""safety, drugs, or negative peer pressure"". This was a concern of 85.4% of families, and the most important factor for 31.2%.<p>Dissatisfaction with academic quality of other schools was a factor in 68.2% of families, but a primary reason in only 16.5%<p>Regarding the assumptions made previously that any included component of religious or moral instruction implies isolationism and a lack of socialization, that claim is not supported by studies.",1283490055
