6,2745127,comment,2744514.0,2744514.0,22,0,drewcrawford,,,"Sorry for the long comment.  I've been involved in several ""anonymous data routing"" projects ranging from wireless mesh networks to route-over-internet to sneakernet projects, in areas where authorities opposed deployments either moderately (vandalism / hacking the network) or severely (you get shot).<p>The tl;dr is that security/anonymity is hard and it comes at the cost of: money, speed, configuration, user experience.  Only in really rare circumstances (oppressive regime or similar) will people choose to use a system that costs more, is slower, and requires programming experience to configure and install.<p>As I understand it,  their plan is to build a wireless mesh network, which sounds great, but it flat-out isn't feasible for this scale.  Unless things have changed significantly since I was working with mesh, the cost to route a packet across a largish , dense (best-case) city is millions of times more expensive than the existing infrastructure, and dozens or hundreds of times slower.  <i></i>maybe<i></i> you could do a little bit better using non-FCC-licensed tech, but obviously the FCC won't like that, and now you're way outside what Newegg will ship to your door to hack with.<p>Cost and speed are irrelevant if the mesh network is competing against no internet or shoot-you-in-the-head-if-you-read-bbc internet.  If it's competing against Comcast 20Mbit, though, it's dead in the water.<p>If you insist on not relying on the existing infrastructure a much better approach would just be to run cable everywhere; that's worked out great in developing countries.  But here you have zoning boards and HOAs and such, so good luck.  Successful projects in developed countries are generally neighborhoods or municipalities, and even then, good luck.<p>The next option is a sneakernet; physical geographical dispersion of flash drives or similar; routing software to instruct people to physically move packets along routes; mail can be used for longer routes.  They're cheap to build: flash drives and lockboxes cost nothing, they can be totally invisible to others.  The bandwidth rivals current fiber installations; I've built sneakernets that routinely move 50TB per day.  The trouble is latency, nobody wants to wait a week for their packet to arrive. If the incentives are there (get in big trouble for accessing certain information), it can work, but you have to offer a COMPELLING reason for a user to routinely walk away from the computer and route a packet.<p>If you don't like any of those, you're stuck with something like tor/WASTE/I2P2, i.e. leveraging the existing infrastructure.  Even then, ordinary people are never going to use any of those projects, the pressure isn't there.<p>The only thing I can imagine that would be feasible on a wide scale in the US (barring a huge Orwellian apocalypse that would make the Patriot Act look like a birthday present) would be along the lines of replacing DNS and using HTTPS more.  But people have been trying to do that for ages.  You or I with the benefit of hindsight can sit down and write a better DNS in ten minutes.  In fact, lots of people have, but we still use DNS and HTTP just the same.  That's because a more-secure internet isn't <i>at all</i> a matter of technical will--just a matter of <i>will</i>.",1310190844

It's much, much worse than that.<p>The entitlements side (sorry, but it's definitely that side), first saw lending as a way to get their votes without the corresponding loss of spending power, where the problem of repayment was delayed until after an election.<p>Then the entitlement side (the taxbreaks side actually tried to repay these debts) screamed that ""it's not fair we have to pay it back, someone else made the loan !"". And this argument was more-or-less accepted. So the principle was started to take out new debt to repay obligations of the old debt.<p>Is this associated to a particular party ? Perhaps, but it doesn't really matter since all of this happened before WWII. Few of the politicians that first created this disaster are even alive anymore, and I believe none are still in office. You really want to know more ? Yes, it was the democrats.<p>So government loans have the worst of all possible loans as a result : they're interest-only loans with two extra very bad properties\n1) the bank can foreclose whenever it wants (by not extending a new loan at all)\n2) there is a variable rate interest, which can raise ver fast (and lower, in which case the windfall is immediately spent by the entitlements side).<p>But the problem is not particularly bad in America you know. At least, not compared to Europe. America can take something around an interest rate of around 5%, and even the worst predictions do not involve a default before 2020 or so. Europe cannot possibly hope to survive with loan interests exceeding 3% and might default this very year. Most muslim countries are <i>much</i> worse off than Europe, and have the big issue that sometimes 80% of their population is dependant on state support <i>for food and water</i> (as in, they wouldn't be able to remain alive without government opening out new debt) (in Gaza/West Bank this is 100%, but that's an exception).<p>So don't worry : yes the US is screwed. However the only thing that really matters is who is screwed first, and that's not us. Even Europe might escape if the middle east implodes first.",1310188964
