All the countries you mention that have high GDP per capita and high GDP growth have high economic freedom scores.<p>Trying to argue against freer trade for economic growth is like trying to argue with someone who says the Earth isn't round.

Economists across the aisle support free trade; for example, read Paul Krugman's views on free trade in his Wikipedia entry (or research Goolsbee's, Geithnner's, Stglitz's, DeLong's, Sach's, Summers', etc, etc, etc, -- not to mention the plethora of economists' from across the other aisle -- views on free trade's effects on economic growth).
