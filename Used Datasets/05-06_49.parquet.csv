I write down the number and call the person.  Not ideal, but I am reminded by the medium that I must act now or else I lose the info of the ad.  Same with tv ads.  But even to ensure people <i>can</i> follow up you have to have the ad repeated over and over.<p>With print ads, I can cut them out and save them.  Less urgency, and a lot of durability.<p>Online advertising, with the possible exception of advertising on search engines, provides the illusion of durability without delivering it.   So it's an inferior medium.<p>I am not saying that online advertisements are doomed.  I think we haven't figured out how to do it, and borrowing print analogies isn't sufficient.  Or perhaps, if we are going to borrow print analogies we ought to take them all the way (selling ad space on specific pages on a non-rotating basis for example).",1342850392

They are mostly web views and no one would even know if you didn't tell them. I will admit the performance characteristics of javascript are much more complex compared to objective-C, but the tradeoff is that you can share most of the code across platforms, and you can iterate much faster without app store approvals. On the other hand, if the mobile web was ready, phonegap would not exist at all. At the very least, it's more nuanced than one platform being superior than the other for any category of application, barring games.",1342850362

At first I thought there must be a technical reason for this, until I realized that it was all psychological - the smaller images hold less information, and therefore my brain has to try harder to fill in the gaps, tricking me into believing that the low-res faces have more detail than they actually do. To prove this to myself, I scaled down the larger images and - sure enough - the (imagined) faces became much more believable.",1342850170

31,4274059,comment,4273886.0,4273886.0,5,0,jacques_chester,,,"The key problems for online advertising are:<p>1. Advertisers can see if it worked. In traditional advertising you accept that a lot of your money will be ""wasted"" on people who will never buy your product or service. In online advertising you can track a customer from first viewing an ad to purchase. This gives advertisers a <i>lot</i> of leverage in price negotiations -- ""your site only has a 0.05% conversion rate, why should I pay that much?""<p>2. Inventory is growing faster than demand for inventory. In advertising terms ""Inventory"" means ""I have a place to show your ad"". Well every new web page can contain inventory. Given how fast the supply of webpages is growing, compared to the total pool of customers and businesses ... well let's just say that the supply-demand curve on this does not favour the sellers of inventory.<p>I am of course fascinated by this problem and my startup (currently in stupid unfunded single-founder mode) aims to resolve this exact economic problem with a different model.",1342849023
