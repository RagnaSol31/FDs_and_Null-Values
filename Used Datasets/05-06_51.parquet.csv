The sorts of people who do hiring in this industry seem to really want to see that.</i><p>Put yourself in the place of a hiring manager, or, better still, the person setting hiring policies for large companies. You have hundreds or thousands of people competing for jobs, sending you resumes, and the like. You only need to make one decision: hire or no hire. When you're weaning down those resumes, you're probably looking for shortcuts, and one way to get there is to filter out a college degree -- which isn't <i>that</i> high a bar, especially for hyper competent technical people. If you're setting hiring policies, you want to stop people from hiring their incompetent brother-in-laws or wastrel friends. And so on.<p>PG actually wrote an essay about this kind of thing in Two Kinds of Judgment: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/judgement.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/judgement.html</a> :<p><i>But in fact there is a second much larger class of judgements where judging you is only a means to something else. These include college admissions, hiring and investment decisions, and of course the judgements made in dating. This kind of judgement is not really about you.</i><p>Anyway, this isn't an attack on the parent poster, but it is an attack of the thoughts I often see on HN and other tech sites about the lack of importance of a college degree. If you start your own company or can get others to pay you... great. But degrees are often there not only to show that you've learned and provide learning, but also as a heuristic for people who are hiring. False positives and false negatives exist, but not so much as to abrogate the usefulness of the entire system.",1275717419.0

In the US, if your family is poor to ""middle income"" your decision tree is 1. get into a top 5/10 (at least by endowment) school 2. get into best public university (preferably in state) you can 3. learn a trade, and by all means avoid anywhere private and expensive (unless you can get a substantial outside scholarship). If your parents are eff you rich, then eff the cost.

But Apple is a business and they have business interests when it comes to these outsider platforms.<p>My understanding is that  Apple doesnt allow Java ,Silverlight , Qt or any of those, because these platforms could gradually in-signify the need for a walled garden of apps. App Store is a real cash cow with a lot of potential and Apple clearly doesnt want to purge it off(and that is a good business move.)<p>IMHO, the same even applies to html5. Apple runs huge campaigns and invests in Safari development to make sure that webkit could gradually insignify the need for a plugin to run interactive content. But try running most of these html5 apps on an iphone/ipad.The rendering framerate is very low and is almost not usable. While native apps run real good, the discrimination against webkit could be that Apple is purposefully delaying the iDevice users' dependency on web apps .<p>I believe Apple's all-control policy is more of a business move than a security related one",1275716471.0

Not a very informative article.<p>One thing I've never understood about the whole degree v no degree debate is: don't people learn on the job? That is to say: I think the educational value of things other than college are often overlooked. It's the information age! You don't have to go to a university to learn.",1275714868.0

If you have access to those terminals, the reasons you gave for using gVim don't apply. Though I'm not really sure that being able to use the mouse for copy and paste in vim is an advantage.

If the bank had allowed the pound to fall instead of trying to prop it up though, Soros wouldn't have had a buyer. Moreover, if Soros had lost his nerve or his solvency selling shorts before the BoE ran out of reserves, the pound would have stayed high and he would have lost his shirt fulfilling the contracts.<p>Once Soros sold his contracts, he stood to lose if the value of the pound stayed high. The Bank of England could keep it high even after their attempts to buy up pounds had failed, by drastically raising interest rates and keeping them high. That would have thrown the British economy into a recession so Soros was betting that the BoE wouldn't go through with it.<p>In the end, the BoE didn't have the nerve to jack interest rates, so they let the value of the pound fall out of the ERM-allowed band, and Soros was able to fulfill his contracts with cheap pounds and pocket the difference.",1275714378.0
