I use the WHS as a shared server (for photos and videos), that both the iMac + W7 machine use to access the main repository.<p>The truth is that I have been meaning to convert all the raw iMovie project files to some 'smaller' size and resolution single video flat files (like .mov or .avi or something) and delete the larger iMovie project files to free up some space. Haven't gotten around to doing that yet though. Do you think this is a good idea?<p>Do you have any suggestions on how I can maintain a relatively high quality versions of my memories - doesn't have to be extremely high quality (as I said, I am saving my images as a 1MB jpeg, not the multi-MB RAW files). I am looking for something similar with the video.<p>Also, any ideas on how to manage the backups of everything. So not only do I want to have a central repository that all my network connected devices can connect to (e.g. including my ps3 for the videos), but I want to have backups of those.<p>Right now my WHS server does a backup of the Windows machines just wonderfully, as does Time Machine for the Mac Machines - but that doesn't include backing up the main bulky files (the videos - I put the pics on my main rig first before moving them to the server, so those get backed up) stored on the WHS server.<p>Also, how do I handle backing up the large videos offsite? I use Mozy for my machine and the wife's machine + plus dropbox for the really important files (documents mainly). How do I do remote for the videos in a sustainable/affordable way?<p>Sorry...I know this is long, just wanted to paint as accurate a picture as I can.<p>Thanks.",1273470761.0

Facebook gave us one ""contract"" at the start and then after people were sufficiently invested in the platform, it changed the rules when it was very hard for them to leave.  People see this as a breaking of the core pact of trust that you have with an online service when you sign up.  We instinctively react to punish a company that does that, because our whole digital lives rely on the integrity of companies <i>not</i> to do such things.<p>The second thing is that the changes seem deliberately targeted to take advantage of people who are technologically ""vulnerable"" - those whose understanding of technology is limited.  The people being exploited here are your mother, your children, your friends without great technological sophistication.   These are the people who will be totally incapable of understanding and revising their settings.   Most likely many of them are right now publishing photos and other content for the whole world to see without any idea they are doing that.

(she's the type who doesn't know what a browser is, so i had no idea how she knew about this tech company relationship. i wondered if zynga was telling their users.)<p>she explained how her and her farmville friends have been protesting facebook. she was happy because once they ""got facebook to change something by a certain deadline."" (not sure what facebook change this was, but obviously it was a coincidence.) then she explained why -- ""it's so annoying when you go to facebook and it's all of these things about people being friends with friends. who cares? i have to click something like 'see related stories' to see all my farmville notifications. it's a total mess with all that stuff about friends in there.""<p>basically, my mom doesn't think anything of facebook's core product. it gets in her way. (""some of the people in our farmville/mafia wars groups have left facebook because of how annoying it is!"") she doesn't know that friends are supposed to be people that you know, or that it's a site about keeping up to date with people. she just knows that it's a place to play farmville and mafia wars, and the rest is the fluff.",1273468613.0

These sorts of proofs can be daunting at first but they become easier, even delightful, as one becomes more familiar with their kind. If you studied the foundations of math in school for as long as an American student takes English literature courses then these proofs would be second nature to you. They aren't really hard, just written in a language unfamiliar to most people.<p>Then there are the long, hard slogs. Lemma after lemma, with no clue as to where the author is leading, until finally, after an exhausting march, he bludgeons the reader into accepting his conclusions. These are pretty hard for anybody to understand because you can't hold the whole thing in your head. You just have to convince yourself of the truth of each step.",1273468478.0

There's as much fiber in a russet potato than there is in a half-cup of brown rice.<p>It might be that the cause of diabetes is glucose level spikes and therefore insulin spikes; the video that was posted here last month with the Robert Lustig from UCSF talking suggested it actually something other than insulin that contributed insulin-resistance -- free fatty acids precipitated by the liver. It's not as simple as saying this thing that has spikey behavior is going to become ignored by the body if it keeps spiking. Things that seem analogous aren't always, as much as it would make knowing good from bad so much easier to distinguish.<p>I won't tell you it's bad for you, but I'll tell you with a pretty damn high amount of certainty something else: both and I and you don't <i>know</i> it is bad for you.<p>Might there be a risk? Sure. But then we've spent the last thirty years believing something else, saturated fats, were more of a risk than they now appear to be. It <i>might</i> be possible that we are leaping too quickly from possibly correlative to sufficiently causal yet again.<p>There's a lot in common between the saturated fats craze of the preceding few decades, and the fervor of our new dietary crusades today. I'm not convinced that we've learned a damn thing from that experience, and thus worry we are destining ourselves to looking back on this craze the same way in 30 years.
