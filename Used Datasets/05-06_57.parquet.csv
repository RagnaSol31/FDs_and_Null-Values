On one hand, HTC is trying to position itself as a top tier manufacturer, independent of carrier branding.  On the other, it has Android and WinMo handsets already... is it going to try to add WebOS to the mix?<p>I doubt it.  If HTC goes for Palm, it will be a patent play.<p>However, what if Google bought Palm <i>for</i> WebOS interface?  I've always seen Android's interface as a little clunky.  And Palm has some great design people...  so if you married Android and Palm, then you'd have a better chance of unseating the iPhone.  If it was just HTC, then I fear you'd just get a jumbled mess of handsets.",1271051989.0

Palm's been doing the smartphone thing longer than almost anybody, and they've built up quite a bit of IP along the way.<p>Palm also has sales channels with the three biggest US carriers (Verizon, AT&T, Sprint), as well as carriers in Europe like SFR and O2. Bell (Canada) gets tossed in for flavor.<p>Finally, there's WebOS.  While WebOS launched rather immature, it's been developing incredibly rapidly.  The OS in its current state is incredibly capable, and a joy for both developers and users.  It's more usable than Android, more capable than the iPhone (even after OS 4), and blows Blackberry out of the water in almost every respect.<p>What Palm's missing is solid hardware and enough runway to get developers online.  They won't have all their developer tools up until this summer, and it's questionable whether they've got enough cash to get past fall.<p>I hope that whoever acquires them doesn't kill WebOS.  I'm an <i>extremely</i> satisfied Pre owner, and I dread the prospect of having to jump to Android or the iPhone (shudder).",1271051885.0

Both are probably more comfortable selling Windows Mobile/Android handsets. HTC makes sense as a company with experience developing their own software but I wonder how WebOS fits into their crowded line-up of Android & Windows Mobile devices. I wouldn't be surprised to see RIM get involved. They seem to be struggling to modernize BBOS. Hasn't hurt their sales too much yet but you gotta figure eventually it will. They're probably one of the companies most capable of quickly absorbing Palm. Time is a major factor given the growth of Android, continued strong iPhone sales and WM7 lurking around the corner. I could see RIM getting squeezed if they don't make a move.",1271051882.0

Of course there are reasons, both ""moral"" and practical.<p>One important one is that when courts and politicians get involved, manoeuvring in the system is more important then manoeuvring in the market. This becomes the central focus of managers. Managers without talent or experience in this area give way to managers that are.<p>Remember, this is not just a matter of flipping a switch. The case against Microsoft took years. During that time, the beginning of the PC revolution, the most important thing the most important company could do was win a court case and preserve a public image.<p>This is damage that happens so long as the system stays clean. Another problem with this sort of action is that it creates terrible incentive for corruption. Fortunes can be won or lost depending on a political decision. The owners of those fortunes will try to influence the process.<p>On the flip side, it isn't obvious that there is much return to this sort of ""intervention.""  Microsoft & IBM, the two great monopolies of the computer industry both failed to do much harm. The both were clearly affected by competition. The markets stayed competitive. New products appeared. Innovation happened. They made high profits (MS still has great profits), but no obvious damage happened.<p>To see this at work look at telcos and other infrastructure owning companies around the world, where government intervention is usually highest. Look at the CEOs of these companies. These are guys who know how to oil the system, not lay copper wire and certainly not how to answer a customer service call. It is not uncommon for corruption to be present. Many countries have telcos owned by members of a political elite.",1271051682.0

The rest is just self promotion of something completely different such as a conspiracy theory. Its really interesting that this actually got this far.<p>From the website (The actual thing being promoted)<p>QUANTUM FUTURE<p>This name came to my mind in Florence on a sunny Saturday of June 9, 1990, while walking along Viale Niccolo Machiavelli up to Piazza Michelangelo. Together with the name, Quantum Future, there came a feeling of weight and of urgency. I decided that I should not waste my time any more doing what others consider important. I felt that certain ideas that were waiting some place in my mind for so many years must not be postponed. That there is nothing more important than them. And so I decided to venture a new project. I knew from the very beginning that such an excursion into unknown territories is better undertaken in a company rather than alone. And I remembered discussions that I had with Philippe Blanchard a few years ago in Bielefeld. I wrote to him, and my proposal was met with a most friendly response. The project has started.<p>It is about Quantum and about Future. It is about Potential and about Actual.It is about Space and about Time. I want it to be also about Knowledge and about Mind, about Determinism and about Free Will. And about knowing and understanding of ourselves together with the outside world. I have chosen the picture by Rene Magritte to symbolize the project. There is an ocean, and over the ocean and under the sky, there is floating a granite rock that carries a castle on its top. The rock seems weightless. Or better: it is heavy, but gravity does not apply. I wish that one day the project will bring us closer to an understanding of our hidden powers that can make rocks float in mid-air.",1271051633.0

He does say things like the excerpt you quote quite frequently, but he also has a number of comments lamenting the immoral behavior that profit motives cause, like an encouragement to fraud and collusion. He does worry that some attempts to solve the problem would be worse cures than the disease, but he doesn't think that no problem exists, or that self-interest always produces moral outcomes, or that government regulation to mitigate the immoral effects of self-interest is always wrong.<p>His policy proposals on that latter point are pretty pragmatic, and he endorses regulation when he thinks it has relatively large gains for relatively small downsides. For example, he proposes that the government ought to require employers to pay their employees in hard money, and not permit them to pay in promissory notes or in goods. His reasoning is that this prevents unscrupulous employers from tricking employees, either by paying them in goods whose value has been misrepresented, or by convincing them to work for promises of payment that the employer doesn't really intend to keep.",1271050745.0

The close relationship between Adobe and Apple was <i>the</i> reason to be on the platform then.  Graphic designers and creatives were one of the few markets that Apple had left.  Believe it or not, but Apple owes a large part of it's existence through the 90's to Adobe's support of their platform.  In fact, Apple and Adobe signed an exclusive deal to only ship Photoshop on Mac's in the early years.<p>Steve Jobs left, the company floundered and almost went belly up.  They sued Microsoft for patent infringement, and Microsoft settled by investing $150 million in Apple, and  becoming one of Apple's largest shareholders at the time.  That helped Apple survive, and it gave Microsoft a reasonable competitor, so it wouldn't have to fight as many charges of being monopolistic.  Ever wonder why so much Apple advertising punches Microsoft, but Microsoft doesn't really punch back?<p>So, with the second coming of Steve Jobs and a fresh infusion of cash from Microsoft.  Apple decided to completely rewite their code base from scratch based on what he had been doing at Next.  OS9 died, and OSX was born.<p>And, while those were great moves for Apple as a company, Adobe was faced with a very difficult choice: whether or not to port millions of lines of code over to a new OS that represented less than 3% of the computing market.  Apple was making a ""bet the farm"" move, and expected Adobe to come along for the ride.  Then Apple was pissed because Adobe didn't jump on the band wagon immediately and pony up the millions of dollars it would have cost to port their entire suite of apps to the new OS.<p>Three years after the launch of OSX, Apple made another ""Bet the farm"" move, and decided to migrate OSX from PowerPC chips to Intel processors.<p>Again, not only did Apple expect Adobe and the rest of their developer ecosystem to port their applications to a new OS, but 3 years after the new OS launched, they expected another dramatic round of rewrites to accommodate Apple's business and technical decisions.<p>But, Adobe did begin porting their software, and in the middle of all those changes, Apple chose to start competing directly with Adobe by launching Final Cut Pro at roughly the same time that Adobe was launching Premiere Pro.  A year or two following that, Apple purchased Shake a video compositing app that directly competed with After Effects.<p>Needless to say, relations have been a bit strained between the companies for the last 10 years.<p>As far as I've been able to tell, Apple makes decisions that help Apple.  They tend to have a ""love us or leave us"" approach to their developer ecosystem.<p>Microsoft used to play hardball like that all the time with their developers and with companies that ran on their platform.  But they got slapped with anti-trust lawsuits.  They play much nicer with other kids than Apple does these days.  The only reason that Apple can get away with this, is because they are still seen as the ""under dog"" by many.  I suspect that perception might be changing.<p>It's been so strange to hear a lot of arguments coming from Apple fans that Microsoft advocates used to use when defending it's platform decisions.  ""Why shouldn't Microsoft bundle Internet Explorer with their OS. It's their platform.  Screw Netscape.  Microsoft can do what they want.  It makes for a much better experience""<p>People often ask me why I use Windows 7 as a development platform instead of OSX.  My response is usually a joke and a quip ""someone beat me with a Mac when I was young"".  Frankly, it was seeing the history of Apple's treatment of it's developers.  Yes, they have great products if want to tow the line and follow Apple's rules.  But, beware. When Apple decides to change the rules on you mid stream, you're not going to have much recourse.<p>ref:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Apple"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Apple</a> especially <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Apple",
