(Which actually takes the wind out of the sails of those who use DARPA as an argument against cutting defense spending.)<p>I don't know the details of A123 or its target market, so I'm not qualified to comment on the ex-ante logic of the investment, but given the WSJ article it doesn't sound like a wise investment to me.  The idea that the likely better investment (in terms of net social gain) in a research project is harder to sell politically is perhaps an indication of why the political process may not be the right one for this type of research.  I just don't think the Obama administration was capable of rapidly creating something on par with DARPA as part of the stimulus and I think we would have we would have been better off if they had used that money to pay down the debt.",1350539661.0

The way I understand it, the taxi is still a normal taxi in operation but essentially has hooked into Uber to give it a new way to find fares and to have people pay.  If this is the case, then the rate is the same with or without Uber and you still need to pay the gratuity and Uber just automatically selects that gratuity to be 20%.  It's actually appreciably different from Uber choosing a rate and then adding a 20% automatic gratuity on top of it.",1350537284.0

Probably totally off topic for Hacker News though.<p>Summary for those who don't have time to read (it's long): she was raped, when she tried to report it was discouraged and told to go for counseling instead, did so. Since no one was listening to her she was upset and depressed. She was then declared mentally ill and forcibly institutionalized. The college then tried to use the hospitalization to block her from returning, claiming substance abuse (which wasn't true), until someone at the hospital pointed out to them that they were punishing the victim while the rapist goes free. So she was allowed back, but administration thwarted all her academic plans, while continuing to use the forced hospitalization as an excuse to control her life. In essence she was raped a second time.<p>It's not isolated either, a couple of other former students confirm similar handling of their own sex assaults in comments in the original published article. 'Daniel' reports the school trying to send him to a psychiatric hospital after reporting an assault. 'Kirby' reports similar attempts to shame her into not pressing charges. These reports suggest this is not an isolated incident but is an unwritten policy. <a href=""http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=article%2F2012%2F10%2F17%2Faccount-sexual-assault-amherst-college"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=article%2F2012%2F10%2F1...</a><p>These stories are similar to other accounts I have heard of how rape victims are treated. It's clear many institutions have policies of containment, and disenfranchisement, and will use forced institutionalization as a weapon to create someone who is then quite easy to completely discredit, by simply bringing up that they had been institutionalized. Makes the nasty rape statistics go away and the college gets to maintain its record of low crime incidence.<p>Worth noting Amherst is named after Lord Amherst, who was the insidious individual who approved the idea of giving smallpox infected blankets to indians as a form of germ warfare. (for skeptics, here is an actual letter in his handwriting saying so: <a href=""http://www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/amherst/34_41_114_fn.jpeg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/amherst/34_41_114_fn.jp...</a>)<p>Amherst lives up to its namesake, but unfortunately many other colleges work the same way.",1350537110.0
