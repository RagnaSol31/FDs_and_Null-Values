It'd actually be most accurate to say we built a couple solid products, pivoted/reengineered, and finally have some good traction in our new target market.<p>I covered the seed round myself based on previous startup success, we raised a couple million in series A from a variety of angels (mostly well-to-do real estate folks, who mostly are not-so-well-to-do these days). I now have a terms sheet for $5M from a high net worth individual who I respect for his sales skills and past business success, but who honestly hasn't a clue about the technology market and is definitely an aggressive personality type.<p>I am seriously considering going and shopping this deal to traditional VCs. I'm not in the Bay Area so my choices are probably limited since my understanding is that Bay Area VCs won't invest outside Silicon Valley. What's the community wisdom as regards ""smart money"" - am I going to get more value out of the connections VCs have as compared to the bird-in-the-hand value of let's take the growth capital and immediately start executing?<p>(New throwaway account for probably obvious reasons)",1289798407

Hand-rolling an XML parser is a pretty sure sign of a certain kind of incompetence.  Wouldn't the same be true of hand-rolling a JSON parser, unless you're one of the (rare) first guys to solve the problem for your language or language platform?  To put it another way, wouldn't this only have been an advantage before XML libraries became commonplace?

FWIW, as far as I can foresee there will be no standard JS bytecode. Commenters here touch on good reasons:<p>* divergent, evolving VMs can't agree (not all NIH, see third bullet);<p>* IPR concerns;<p>* lowering from source over-constrains future implementation, optimization, and language evolution paths;<p>* view-source still matters (less, but still).<p>A binary encoding of JS ASTs, <i>maybe</i> (arithmetic coders can achieve good compression; see Ben Livshits' JSZap from MSR, and earlier work by Michael Franz and Christian Stork at UCI). But this too is just a gleam in my eye, not on TC39's radar.<p>Meanwhile, we are making JS a lot better as a target language, with things like ES5 strict mode, the ES-Harmony module system and lexical scope all the way up (no global object in scope; built on ES5 strict), and WebGL typed arrays (shipping in Firefox 4).<p>We have a Mozilla hacker, Alon Zakai, building an LLVM-based C++-to-JS compiler. Others are doing such things (along with good old SNES emulators and the like).<p>So being a good mid-to-high-level, memory-safe compiler target language is on TC39's radar. Not to the exclusion of other JS desiderata, and never in a way that compromises mass-market usability or buy-by-the-yard rapid-protoyping ""scriptability"". But one among several goals.",1289797537
