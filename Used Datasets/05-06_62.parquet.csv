Very little.<p>I've was the primary developer on an at-one-time popular site, and have been working at web startups for awhile.  I don't recall a single malicious user on either (there were quite a few stupid users or users angry at me, but not messing with the site). Until you get big, people won't mess with you.  Until you get big, you have little to lose if they randomly do mess with you.  Writing robust secure apps is harder.  Unless you deal with money or credit cards, just figure it out when it is actually a problem.  (Protip:  you will probably never be big enough for it to be a problem.  I would spend all your effort figuring out how to get big, and then welcoming malicious users and script kiddies as one of the trimmings of success).",1277013302.0

And I mean full-sized -- as in 30 inches tall.<p>I built the last and final home-built computer in mid-2007.  I probably spent about $100 extra in eliminating noise despite having a powerful setup.  I was spoiled at the time by my Mac Mini which was silent.  A lot of fellow raiders never seemed to ""get"" that.  I guess your computer sounding like a jet engine is fine if jet engine computers are what you're used to.  They didn't understand the difference having that same computer being silent makes.<p>Still, cables.  The big box that has to be put somewhere.  The power draw.  More cables.  The switching between it and the Mac.  Wireless cards that never seemed to have fantastic range.  Not being able to get built-in bluetooth and resorting to annoying dongles.  More cables.  Forking over more money for a beefier UPS.  Another $10/month on the electric bill.<p>Desks have shrunk over the years as I've shrunk down.  From a massive corner unit, to the current 4x2.  Next, I'm building it into a slightly smaller than a 4x2 closet with nothing getting in the way of my legs.  Whenever I look at old photos, or visit someone, I'm still taken a bit aback as to how much physical space was allocated to the computer.  A large desk, large chair, plus the room for ingress/egress, etc would easily eat up 40 square feet.<p>For now I'm down to a new Mac Mini (with 8GB of memory) and an older, aluminum 23"" cinema display until the 27"" iMac is refreshed with a better GPU.  It's dead-silent.  It does nearly everything I need.  The 7 1/2 square feet of desk space is barely occupied by it giving me tons of room to spread out documents, notes, etc.<p>Enthusiasts will always be enthusiasts.  That's fine.  There'll always be a burgeoning market catering to them.  Though for me, I'll gladly pay extra -- considerably extra -- for something that minimizes its intrusion in my environment.",1277013035.0

21,1445952,comment,1445570.0,1445570.0,0,0,johnwatson11218,,, I want to repeat a point that I read in one of Jim Roger's books. He was in favor of repealing all capital gains taxes simply to allow individuals an option in the fight against inflation. The example is of a person who has enough cash for 100 cheeseburgers. They decide to put that money in something like gold. The government prints lots of money causing inflation and the nominal value of the gold is now much higher. If the investor sells the gold he still has enough money to buy 100 cheeseburgers. However the government will say that he has a net capital gain and must pay tax. \n Jim Roger's point was that without capital gains tax people could put their money into any form that they thought would preserve their wealth better than fiat currency. With capital gains we all become speculators trying to beat inflation and still realize a net profit after taxes.,1277012044.0

24,1445949,comment,1445500.0,1445500.0,0,0,siglesias,,,"This comment applies to non-engineer college students who have ideas for complex websites, big ambitions, and are looking for programming help. This doesn't apply to those looking for spot jobs and minor features.<p>Personally, I've gotten burned big time hiring ""talent"" abroad, even utilizing a bidding and feedback system like that on getafreelancer.com, primarily due to the fact that (at least for me), it's impossible to get a foreigner psyched on a predominately American consumer product. I found that these programmers are constantly striving to provide the bare minimum, they constantly recycle code from other projects where they think it might fit (even if it doesn't), and they are desperate to close the ticket on your project and move on to the next as quickly as possible.<p>In my opinion, my observations fall in very closely with what Marx describes as ""alienation,"" wherein workers (or in this case, foreign programmers) are to the extreme out of touch with what they are making. Sure, you can provide detailed documents specifying the exact nuances of what you want implemented, but you will NEVER anticipate the misunderstandings that are possible when traversing across complex language barriers, and secondly, you will never get the fit, finish, and craftsmanship that only somebody passionate about the product can imbue into it.<p>The second trap, of course, is to think that you can hire American freelancers, or, better yet, the ""hacker"" at your particular university. This, of course, comes with other disadvantages. It is often the case that university undergraduate ""hackers"" have several pet projects, and even in the case that they are open to discussing programming your idea, they often eventually begin to doubt whether it is worth it to essentially build your website for you (as they see it) as you sit around and tell them what to do. After all, did YOU spend the time, sweat, and endure social ostracism honing the valuable skill of computer programming as they did for years? Look no further than what happened to the Winklevoss twins at Harvard when they tried to get Zuckerberg to do ConnectU.<p>These arrangements almost inevitable fall through, consistently. Having been very close to entrepreneurship circles at an elite university, I can tell you that I have never once seen a non-hacker recruit a hacker to build a product successfully, though I've seen, and made, multiple attempts. The hacker's pet project ALWAYS comes first, followed by school and internships. And too many hackers, in my observation, are trying to chase the Zuckerberg dream by precluding any strong non-coding liberal arts thinkers from their teams and making all business and user experience decisions themselves. I can't speak to the success of this trend because I haven't seen the opposite case even attempted due to the pervasiveness of this hacker-centric startup attitude.<p>My pessimistic conclusion (though it might have a silver lining) is that unless you have a really trusting programmer friend who will help you out of your preexisting relationship, it is both not worth it to pursue hiring a programmer for your startup from abroad and not worth it to pursue alliances with your local college hacker. The best way to go is to bite the bullet and learn to code, and that way you actually have a means of effectuating your own ideas, which are liable to change, multiply, grow, etc. at a pace that you will want to control. Once you learn to code, you'll gain more respect of the hacker types anyway, and from that point you can build meaningful alliances of mutual understanding and respect. This is the route that I have taken, and I don't regret it one iota. A year into programming, I've got three iPhone applications in the store, with several more coming. The only limit for me, now, is time, and that's the only limit you really ever want to confront when building a startup. Depending on a stranger who is just doing it for money? For the birds.",1277011888.0

(Of course, it's not really all healthy/sustainable/whatever, but it's certainly harder to go wrong at Whole Foods than it is at Safeway.)",1277010479.0

It seems to be a good service so I'm not sure why they're not promoting it on their website.<p>You have to use Azure Storage, which isn't that much of a problem because the whole service is very similar to Amazon's offering - I was just able to modify existing S3 code. The pricing is also about the same, but what Azure CDN has over CloudFront is a greater number of edge locations, most notably in Australia and South America. I'm really happy with their Asia/Australia performance.<p>Interestingly, the Azure CDN servers claim to run ""EdgePrism"", like LimeLight, although they seem to be hosted by Microsoft themselves.",1277010374.0

Unfortunately, conserving v4 addresses probably won't help given the rate we're burning through them (10 /8s this year already; compare with a total of 8 /8s in total in 2009 [1]). Transitioning is probably the best thing we can do now. Note that the v6 transition process (which has been theoretically going for about 12 years now) should be a case study motivating the design of backwards-compatible protocols in large, distributed, and decentralized computer systems, in case we ever have to do something like this again.<p>While I don't run/work at an ISP, the biggest claim that seems to be made against v6 is that there is no business case for implementing it -- it's simply providing (at best) the same connectivity with added capital and operations expenses. While I think this is awfully short-sighted, it may make sense to management of some ISPs. Regardless, how can you create incentives for the entities that you depend on for internet access?<p>As a consumer you can start by asking your residential access ISP about v6. If they're on the ball, like Comcast, you should participate in their trials [2]. If not, ask them what their strategy is and/or when you can expect to have some form of IPv6 connectivity. If you want to be an early adopter, turn on v6 on your own equipment and use Teredo or a tunnel from Hurricane Electric or another tunnel provider. Be prepared for things to be slightly broken, and to need to navigate to special urls like ipv6.google.com in your browser/etc. But you should keep doing this even if things are broken, to help sites you care about work through the transition. If you need to buy new home networking equipment, consider looking at v6 support (though you may want to hold off until residential providers announce their plans regarding their transition technology of choice (ds-lite, 6rd, etc.))<p>As someone with purchasing authority at a smaller business/etc., you might consider doing much of the same as noted above, though you may have the additional option of switching providers if you feel so strongly about it. You will probably also want to think about experimenting with and eventually deploying v6 internally so you're ready to go when the v6 Internet comes knocking.<p>Finally, if you're a software developer like may readers of HN are, you should make your application IP-version agnostic by replacing calls to v4-era functions like gethostbyname() with getaddrinfo(), etc. and not store IP addresses as ints [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ipv4-address-space.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ipv4-addr...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://comcast6.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comcast6.net/</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://people.redhat.com/drepper/userapi-ipv6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.redhat.com/drepper/userapi-ipv6.html</a>",1277010074.0
