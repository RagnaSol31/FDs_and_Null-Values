Comcast has to know darn well that broadband traffic trends upward, and within a couple years this ""data tax"" is going to be sucking money from everybody - Bill Gates to Aunt Edna.<p>If the rest of the telecoms follow suit, it will soon put an end to the concept of the Internet as a democratizer and turn it into another class-based system.<p>Because customers' monthly fees go into R&D, there's an implied contract that their services will continue to improve.  This is a violation of that implied (not written or legally binding) contract.<p>It'll be a scathing indictment of the state of U.S. capitalism if a competitor doesn't step in and offer customers better service for lower costs.",1220334483.0

They're debating the best move in a game that Apple stopped playing two or three <i>games</i> ago.<p>Apple doesn't care much about desktop marketshare. That game is old. They care about desktop hardware <i>profits</i>, which are doing nicely -- they've got one of the most profitable segments of that market sewn up, and it's a nice cash cow. And they care about <i>control</i>, the control that enables them to coordinate their hardware and software better than anyone else in the industry, and to ensure that any new thing they bring out (like the iPhone) fits seamlessly into at least one major operating system in its first month of release.<p>But the focus has long since moved off the desktop OS. First it moved to the music hardware and content business, but by now even that has arguably become a cash cow -- Apple owns the most profitable slice of the music hardware market, and is one of two or three major content players, and they're running out of music industry to dominate. Growth is slowing. So, having sewn that up, they're on to game ",

In fact, I think the Wii-mote is much LESS efficient than traditional analog controls, because (a) there's a lag time - ""latency"" - and (b) it requires more motion than an analog stick.<p>Nintendo's always been at the tip of the tech spear in gaming, particularly with controllers (first D-pad, analog stick, and now the Wii-mote), but, when push comes to shove, this is an incremental advancement, not a revolution.<p>I think the next MAJOR controller revolution will be when we control game data via neurological sensors.",1220333300.0
