Bezos chose books because it was (a) accessible (catalogs existed), and (b) he got 6 months to pay back booksellers, which meant he could afford to grow the more he sold, by using the money owed to the booksellers as float.<p>Books are fantastic for other reasons: easy to ship, relatively non-perishable, mass-produced, and even affordable.

The point being however that even once you have had a liquidity event, it might not make sense to invest in startups, it might make sense to build wealth via <i>another</i> startup, but reserve your capital for less risky investments. I think there's a tendency for founders who have had an exit to immediately transform into angel investors.

10,4557241,comment,4557023.0,4557023.0,8,0,simonsarris,,,"Wow. I completely agree with this.<p>I went to a private high school that prided itself in its English (writing) classes[1]. I didn't know it then, and I wish I had found out sooner, but I loved writing.<p>I started to realize this in college. I went into university as CS and picked up a Philosophy dual major after one semester so I could write more.<p>During my final year, in every single interview I had I made the argument that mere communication is massively underrated in engineering fields and that my Philosophy degree (or rather my writing skills) made me a better communicator than most other software engineers. I think I can safely attribute this to at least a few job offers, as the argument seemed to take a lot of interviewers by surprise.<p>After my college experience I certainly think the two majors (or any STEM major plus a writing-heavy major) compliment each other. CS and PHIL as a combination seems only natural from the get-go, especially with the intersection of Logic. But I especially think PHIL compliments CS because in my opinion the largest deficiency in every other CS and engineering grad I've met is that they have a hard time communicating their ideas and debating others effectively. Philosophy (all writing really) helps with that. A lot.<p>I think writing out anything, even just your own thoughts on a subject, makes you a vastly more empathetic person, something most engineers I've met seem to desperately need. It's mind-boggling the amount of extremely smart people I've come across that nonetheless seemed to simply lack the concept of <i>not-them.</i><p>-----------<p>[1] The article says ""The program would not be unfamiliar to nuns who taught in Catholic schools circa 1950."" I had 12 years of Catholic school, though not in the 1950's, I graduated HS in 2006, so I imagine some of the curriculum theory stayed put.<p>[2] I've found myself considering the humanities majors I've met far, far more socially capable than the engineer majors, almost to an embarrassing degree. I've always been quite the introvert, supremely shy as a child, but was totally unprepared for just how shy I would find others. My college (RPI) was known for being an introverted place and I met so many great people who almost literally never left their rooms. Great minds and personalities who were self-sequestered from the world.<p>It felt tragic sometimes. I met and found a lot of people that wanted to meet others but had a great fear of simply being in public spaces more and exchanging pleasantries. Others still, and this was not an uncommon opinion, would disparage the idea of small talk as useless. It's funny but, of all places, once I came to college and met enough varied and amazing people I became vastly, vastly less shy. It just wasn't worth it to be shy when there were so many great people to meet and listen to.",1348293279.0

15,4557236,comment,4556838.0,4556838.0,2,0,philwelch,,,"> But the two connections are distinct and in principle one could start a startup that was neither driven by technological change, nor whose product consisted of technology except in the broader sense.<p>Arguably Netflix was one of these. DVD's may have been the ""technological change"" driving the company, but in principle  you possibly could have done the same thing with VHS.<p>Most logistics-based big companies, like Fedex, Walmart, or even Costco, could be cited as examples. Jetliners predated Fedex by decades, for instance. Aside from the novelty of selling PC's, Dell was a similar instance.<p>This indicates that, just as in war, solving logistical problems often provides the biggest wins in business as well.<p>Combining innovation and logistics was powerful enough to make humble Apple erupt into the world's most valuable business. In fact, Apple's growth rate during Jobs' tenure as CEO was ultimately exponential despite the company's age--does Jobs-era Apple somehow qualify as a startup due to this?<p>>  I once explained this to some founders who had recently arrived from Russia. They found it novel that if you threatened a company they'd pay a premium for you. ""In Russia they just kill you,"" they said, and they were only partly joking.<p>I remember that in the 90's, many of Microsoft's acquisitions had this same sinister undertone to it.

In reality, merchants and artisans tend to form into guilds and then demand new entrants to that market be licensed. Adam Smith noted this phenomenon in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> in the famous passage: 'People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary.'<p>A more recent treatment of the subject appears in nplusone magazine, but the site is down just at the moment: <a href=""http://nplusonemag.com/death-by-degrees"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nplusonemag.com/death-by-degrees</a> Another recent example from NPR: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/06/21/154826233/why-its-illegal-to-braid-hair-without-a-license"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/06/21/154826233/why-its-...</a> (you'll be happy to know that Clayton recently won her court case, and plans to reopen her business).",1348292878.0

It is almost fractally wrong.<p>And if you really have a problem with this case on economic grounds, let me reassure you, there is no mass imbalance of people from Canada who moved to the US when they were kids, then moved back to Canada to go to university, then left to work in the US, when compared to kids from the US who move to Canada, leave to go to university in the US and then come back to work in Canada. Issues like this are just noise in the system, monetarily speaking they tend to cancel out.<p>Also, this guy is only trying to get a work visa and temporary migrants regularly move back to their country of origin after a while. Which is likely to be better for the Canadian tax office in the long run, depriving him of education and therefore a job and therefore making sure he will probably never pay much tax and possibly even end up on welfare, or on the other hand educate him, despite that he has not managed to pay much tax yet, mainly for reasons of being a kid at the time, then let him work at Microsoft in the US, with a reasonable probability of him at some point moving back to Canada with a first class resume and tons of money to spend?<p>And if the argument about tax is that his mother didn't pay tax in Canada while he was a child being educated in the US while living with her, or that he should somehow be stopped from emigrating for an offer of employment at Microsoft until he has worked off his university bill, then I think the appropriate response is ridicule.

Don't you think Samsung will want its engineers to go over the design extensively to see how it'll work with their manufacturing process, etc, before committing to buy? Without IP protection, how does ARM give Samsung the blueprints without giving up any leverage they have in the transaction? What's to stop Samsung from just taking the blueprints and not paying? What keeps Samsung from turning around and selling the blueprints to other people at a lower price?<p>Moreover, sure ARM might be better at designing microprocessors, but once ARM does the heavy lifting, it's much easier for Samsung to hire its own people to do updates. They might not be as good as ARM's people, but its hard to argue with free.<p>I worked for two tech companies that sold only IP. We were in the business of developing the software that was incorporated into heavy-duty networking equipment and military radios. Our customers were companies like Raytheon, etc. Our competitive advantage was our expertise and our size. We could do experimental stuff much quicker than the big companies with more internal bureaucracy and more risk aversion. But there is no way we could match their manufacturing, distribution, and sales expertise. That wasn't up our alley. It's very difficult to conceive of working relationships like this without being able to transact in IP. The type of work we did was kind of like crypto in the sense that it took years and millions of dollars to figure out what worked, but it was pretty straightforward to verify the working solution. Without being able to patent the product of that research, we'd have no leverage against the companies that had the big manufacturing muscle. As soon as we showed them our designs they could just run with it. If we shipped them binaries, they could easily just reverse engineer them.<p>I think peoples' opposition to IP really stems from the fact that most of the patents people are exposed to are pretty crappy. It causes them to think of the average software patent as something they could stumble onto accidentally. But that's more of an opposition to the bar used for software patents rather than an opposition to the concept.

Most of what I've read falls in one of two categories:<p>1) Criticism of Twitter for implementing a policy that has generated so much ill-will for the company, and essentially prevented 3rd party devs from solidifying Twitter as a kind of a microblogging platform of the Net. Clearly Twitter believes this will serve them better. Most people disagree.<p>2) Warning for trusting closed platforms.",1348291249.0

That is, my defense is that your patent is written such that it doesn't teach me how to do what you did, therefore it is invalid, no matter what the content.<p>I think it would be great to see the courts adopt that standard. It's there in the law, and repairs the problem of the obviousness standard, which is to say that the patent troll just pays some expert to say ""it isn't obvious to me!"" and done. But teachability is a much more defense-friendly requirement: the jury typically won't be able to understand it, so if the defense brings a line of smart people who say ""this is gibberish"" that ought to be very compelling.",1348290912.0
