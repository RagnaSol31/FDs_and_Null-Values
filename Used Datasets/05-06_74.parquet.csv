Thinking back to the true &quot;reality&quot; of addition, he rejects the design of the adder on the grounds that nand gates have no apparent connection to the sensible reality of having 5 apples and 3 oranges and 8 fruits.<p>This would be considered a ridiculous objection in every field but physics, where misunderstandings following from it have become the basis of many bestsellers.

14,8933581,comment,8933218.0,8933218.0,0,0,Ologn,,,"Warren Buffett said Bitcoins are a mirage and I agree.  They are worthless hashes.  Why do they have any value?  The answer is they have no value.  I said so here when they were worth over twice what they are now.  If there is any sign of a bubble in tech, it would be Bitcoin market cap.  Which is $3 billion at the moment.<p>Who are the fools who exchange cash for them?  Why do they have any value? Some people say you can use them as currency.  You can use dollars as currency.  Or gold.  Some say it can transfer money, but so can wire transfers.  Perhaps it is decentralized (who cares?  Not I.  Wire transfers work for me) etc.  But gold has value, while Bitcoin has nothing.  I remember during the dot bomb days when there were commercials for Flooz and Beenz.<p>The leaders in the Bitcoin community are being sued and jailed for fraud, the price has gone from $1100 to $230, yet suckers are still bamboozled to trade cash for these worthless hashes.  It will go to $115, then $57, then eventually $0.  I doubt all those who already lost money or who are being jailed will learn anything.",1421992055.0
