I can't speak authoritatively about GAE, but this is how I would design the system.<p>The problem is that while your instance may only use 30MB now, it could grow to 100MB in an instant without warning.  Tipping a box into swap would effectively crash all instances present.  Oversubscribing RAM is a dangerous game, and I suspect Google doesn't try to play it - they have enough trouble debugging performance issues as it is.<p>So basically, an instance represents a fixed about of RAM.

They're not going to let you near the bottom of the AWS stack without you proving that you're towards the extreme of the smart side of the bell curve and signing an employment contract with them.<p>Amazon provides its platform to anyone that wants to develop on it: last time I checked there was no obstacle in the way of signing up for AppEngine, using Google's many APIs to build a sexy looking searchable dynamic local social mobile website which you can then distribute via their webstore, or as a plugin for their browser or app on their mobile operating system. Maps are really cool and useful for that sort of thing. Perhaps you'd like to borrow their semantic matching technology and bidding platform to acquire some customers or make a little money on AdSense; that's not too difficult either and plenty of people have made millions on the back of both. Just want to make your mark on the web? There are many neat <i>little</i> things your average web-savvy teenager can get creative with like their web fonts. Their free code hosting and tutorials go a lot further than just helping you use Google services more effectively. Show me a successful online startup which has never used anything from Google and I'll show you a liar.<p>But yeah, web hosting is a little further from Google's core business than Amazon's or Rackspace's.
