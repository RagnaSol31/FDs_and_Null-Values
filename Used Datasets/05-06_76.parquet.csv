Many analyses that I have seen do a check for logical completeness, but forget to rigorously check that you have scalable and fully accessible memory, even in the most generalized cases. Even if you assume that some resource is unbounded, your other mechanics might not actually allow you to interface with it, even if they do work on a constant/small scale (locality of computation does not necessarily imply this). You could take a turing machine its infinite tape, but forget to show that you can move it left or right an arbitrary number of times. On the flip side, another ridiculous assumption involves including the power of human operation. Yes, an abacus is &quot;Turing Complete&quot; if it is infinitely large and you, as a human being, do the logic in your head. Pen and paper is Turing Complete by the same reasoning (this is ridiculous). Yes, we know that humans are capable of computation.
