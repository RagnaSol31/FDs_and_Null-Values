About the only thing that is right is that services will be moving to the application layer in the long run because there are benefits the abstracting the network. But the idea that the people providing the data link upon which every service you care about depends on are becoming irrelevant is so absurd it makes me laugh.

That requires firstly knowing about the edge cases, and secondly seeing the problem (the commonality of those cases). The final step is a solution, which is where the maths comes in (or might).<p>Anecdotally, it seems fairly common that maths is independently re-invented by people applying it - famously for relativity, IIRC. That's because the maths guys don't actually know about the applications.<p>It's a truism for our industry that if a new approach really is significantly better (eg. x10) <i>in practice</i>, it will be adopted. You don't need to convince people; you just beat them. OTOH, there's a common wish to over-automate: to spend a week saving a second, and then it turns out to not handle the very next case. So, some people don't like to use frameworks because they are too constricting (don't handle all the cases <i>in practice</i>); and some (Alan Kay) even say if you <i>can</i> build your own infrastructure, you <i>should</i>.<p>Mathematical ideas usually only work on their own assumptions - a difficult part is matching those assumptions to an application. Though maybe this isn't a problem for the generics example.<p>There's also incidental practical issues, like the need to ship, then of back-compatibility, resulting in a current Java implementation that can't express <i>List<Circle|Rect></i> (you need an explicit <i>Shape</i> interface/superclass).
