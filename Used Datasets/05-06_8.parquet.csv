6,153678,comment,153080.0,153080.0,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I'm calling FUD.  There's a lot of press out there talking about what rough shape the economy is in.  It makes for good copy, and it sells ads.  But ultimately, I think we're just in a correction.<p>Iraq:  We've got to stop spending money on it period.  I agree.  It's just silly and artificially inflating oil prices.<p>Dollar devaluation:  It's actually a good thing for the US economy and the US consumer, but it's going to cause the rest of the world to suffer a bit.  A weaker dollar means that US goods will be cheaper relative to foreign imports.  This will be good for the US tourism and manufacturing sectors.  Cheaper US products, mean that more people will buy them over seas.  Other countries are going to have a harder time selling to the US, because their products just went up 30% in price because of the exchange rate.  The dollar is being devalued on purpose in my opinion.  It's the only way to correct the trade deficit.<p>Expensive Oil:  This is going to make us tighten our belts, and it will spur growth in other energy sectors aside from fossil fuels, which in the long run only makes sense from a geo-petro-political perspective and a environmental perspective.  I'd love for oil to be at $200 or $300 a barrel.  There'd be a lot more economic incentive for electric cars and nuclear power plants.  Short term pains, long term gains.<p>US schools:  I don't see tons of US students going to Europe, China or India to study.  I still see many students trying to get in to US schools, however.  And, it's not so much the quality of education available, it's that pretty much anyone can go to any school (aside from the 20-30 highly selective schools).  Education in other countries is heavily subsidized, and it's hard for people to go back to school.  In many countries, you're told what schools you can attend, and what majors you are able to take.  You don't have the flexibility that we have here.  It's one of the essential strengths of the US economy.  I've been an ER nurse for 14 years, and I'm going back to school for software engineering.  I've attended the University of Maryland online while moving to 2 different states and 4 different cities.  I haven't heard of any other country that has that type of educational flexibility.  I work with a number of nurses that use to be engineers, or flight attendants, or ministers.  The average US worker has 7 different careers in their lifetime.  You simply don't have that fluidity in other countries.  It's that fluidity of labor markets that gives the US a big part of it's edge in the international market.<p>Foreign investment:  If a US company invests in a manufacturing plant in India, and the Indian manufacturing plant succeeds, where do the profits end up?  On the balance sheet of the US company.<p>Foreign competition from India/China:  I have a friend who's job is to ship servers to India/China.  The bureaucracy is so convoluted, it takes them 2-6 months to get a server or a SAN through customs.  Many other countries aren't used to working on Internet time.  I have another friend who worked for Big Internet Co. here in the valley, and he's planning to leave to go back to India in the next 2-3 years.  He says that salaries are pretty much at a parity, when you compare the costs of living.  In other words:  outsourcing is no longer cheap labor, it's just finding available engineers.<p>US as a bad place to invest:  Okay, when you buy a stock, say GOOG.  Do you want to buy your shares of GOOG stock when the price is at $800 a share and hold it, or do you want to buy those shares when it was at $87 a share?  You want to buy it at $87 a share because then the price will appreciate.  The idea is to buy low and sell high.  Too many people buy when there's hubris and giddiness in the press (e.g. buy a house in 2006 or Internet stock in 1999) and sell when there's panic (e.g. sell a house today or tech stocks in 2001).  Phil is falling in the same mistake.  He's encouraging people to sell their US stock when it's low.  This is a great time to invest in the US.  It's a great time to be here. It's a great time to buy a house, if you can afford it.  Why?  Because things are going to appreciate after all this FUD dissipates.<p>Finally:  Compare the number of posts on Hacker News and elsewhere that say:  ""How do I move to India/China/Europe to start my startup"" vs ""How do I move to the US to start my startup""?",1207201851

9,153675,story,,,1,3,sam,What naming convention do you use for S3 keys?,,I'm (re)doing our naming convention for our S3 keys. We have many (millions) of objects to store on S3. I'm planning on putting them all into one bucket and naming the keys to be the MD5 or SHA-1 digest of the files. I'll keep this synced with a database table which maps an auto-increment GUID (globally unique id) with the digest of the file.<p>Then I read this:\nhttp://paltman.com/2007/05/29/amazon-s3-and-filename-magic\nbut I don't really understand the advantage of storing an object on S3 whose key is the hash and which points to the GUID.\nOne thing I don't want to do is store the GUID as the S3 key (to prevent massive scraping of all the assets).<p>How are you all dealing with this? Is anyone using  a MD5 or SHA-1 digest as the key? A salted hash of the GUID as the key?,1207201173

12,153672,comment,153487.0,153487.0,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"If you're serious about learning web programming, here's a few thoughts before you pick up the Django book and start wading through it:<p>Take a look at the HTTP protocol, and learn what it does before you start diving in to web frameworks.  You'll understand what's going on inside the framework before you get started.<p>After looking at HTTP, try some basic CGI programming.  Just google:  Python CGI Tutorial.  CGI is a bit archaic, but it helps to understand why frameworks developed, and what they're making easier.<p>Pick up MySQL or PostGress and learn some SQL and databases first.  Web frameworks are essentially an ""easy"" way to develop a GUI for a database.  If you don't know what the database is, or what it's doing, you'll be chasing your tail learning a framework first.<p>It's worth mucking around with some *nix and apache.  You don't really have to do this first, but you're not going to be able to do too much with your web app, because I don't know of too many companies that serve Django apps off of Windows.  It's all Linux or BSD hosting for Django pretty much.  That means knowing at least the basics of shell scripting and apache config files.",1207200950

25,153659,comment,153298.0,153638.0,0,0,DocSavage,,,"I believe in freedom of contract, but I also believe in fair business practices.  Credit card companies have a lot of incentive to craft agreements that look OK on the surface but are littered with land mines.  They are the ones that craft the (not) clearly stated policies, and I suspect they've tuned the agreements to maximize profits from slip-ups and timing.<p>Case in point: sending APR change notices, setting effective APR change dates, and requiring written responses all within one billing cycle. It's not obvious that a line in the original agreement leads to retroactive billing at arbitrary APR if a written response wasn't received.  The written response requirement was only mentioned in small print at the end of a large amended agreement.<p>You said ""Free of regulation, markets will choose the firms that provide the highest value to customers.""<p>That may be true of efficient markets, but I don't think there's nearly enough transparency in the credit card market.<p>I'm for regulations that prevents excessive interest rate hikes for no cause <i>coupled</i> with insufficient grace periods to reject the rates and close out the account.<p>We had used the cash advance to bypass a liquidity issue with other assets, so when sufficiently motivated, we were able to payoff the sizable advance within two weeks after talking with Advanta reps.  Even then, we were hit with these elevated charges. Lesson learned.",1207199716

Those same people see one hacking  at html and wonder aloud how you can have any idea what it all means.<p>I can explain REST to my mother and it just makes sense, but her ""programming"" experience stops at a spreadsheet.<p>I make the point about the spreadsheet intentionally. A spreadsheet to manage what furniture goes on a shipping container, and in what order based on the distance to deliver is quite a complex set of requirements for an application.<p>But my mother, partner in a small furniture company, does just that sort of thing regularly. I do think there is something to be said for the amazing feats one can undertake when it is required. But I'd really like to make a point about the importance of spacial thinking.<p>When I program I only get one dimension for my instruction set. It goes from the start of the file to the end of the file. I may have some tricky control flow structures, but I still have to represent them in a wholly linear fashion.<p>Whereas my mother, with her spreadsheet gets two spatial dimensions to think in. She can even put multiple planes right next to each other.<p>Our minds are wired to interpret spatial(visual) information. Thats why my mother can easily solve complex, unique problems with a spreadsheet and wouldn't even want to read a ""real"" program. And yet, if we can allow oureselves some perspective, they are really the same thing. A human's instructions to get a machine to solve problems.<p>I would never expect my mother to create space-shuttle software or anything like that.
