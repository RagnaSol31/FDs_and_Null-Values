Sure, you need good testing and code coverage to make sure you did it properly, but that applies to any change.<p>It doesn't mean that the people implementing it 15 years ago were idiots, no, it all made sense at the time. But after years of maintenance some parts grew into an abomination (losing any touch with the high-level design), and other parts are not needed because the specific gadget it was supposed to support no longer exists.<p>If you don't refactor, you'll eventually have a landmine-ridden place where every change has impact on 10 different unrelated places. A company I worked at had this problem. They had to keep adding developers to handle bugfixes and feature requests, and it only became worse instead of better because they never made available time for refactoring.<p>""Removing code that you don't understand"" is indeed wrong and shouldn't happen, but at least if you use SCM can always look back to understand why it was added. And then remove it anyway.<p>Believe me, that process makes sense for a factory but for source code you eventually end up with voodoo programming.

Older guitars that are well taken care of sound as good if not better than shiny new ones, but after a certain age your computer begins wasting your time.<p>Most programming time is spent sitting and thinking, but when I act I want the computer to respond as quickly as possible, whether compiling or running tests or opening a website.<p>That's not to say I don't share the sentiment about computers becoming less hackable and more consumer toys.

These days, most client development is web stuff, so you don't often have the excuse of compile times.<p>But if you're working on software that's supposed to run well on high-spec machines and servers, or targeting machines a few years in the future, then you're better off with a higher spec machine; one with lots of RAM and CPU cores, so you can play around with the various tradeoffs of time vs memory vs parallelism. Or if you have a big source tree - the one I have is perhaps 10GB in size, and takes about 14 minutes to build today - then it makes lots of sense to reduce turnaround time by throwing hardware at it.<p>For example, I work on a compiler that is used by the build tree. I can't really be sure the compiler is ""good"" unless it builds the whole tree, and the tree's tests run; if I checked it in as is, the integration server could find the problem, and then I'd be in everybody's bad books. Reducing the build time by 5 minutes, iterated over perhaps 5 or 10 builds in a day, and it starts adding up to non-trivial productivity advantages.",1319260744.0

The fifth chapter fits in with the latter portion more than with the rest of SICP.<p>Also, MIT doesn't teach SICP at all in its intro course any more, as far as I know. They've also switched to Python, but I don't think they've kept the book, structure or material from the Scheme course (unlike what Berkeley is doing here).",1319260503.0

I was very surprised when it had the value of just $1 back April I believe. A currency needs to be supported by <i>real</i> economy, not just speculation. It seems all the speculators are gone now, and Bitcoin will continue its normal course of growing at the pace of its own economy. I believe one of the catalysts for Bitcoin will be NFC payments, because that would remove a huge obstacle for Bitcoin, and it would allow  many merchants of real products to sell them for Bitcoin very easily.<p>Of course, it would help if merchants wouldn't have to be afraid that FBI will come knocking at their door questioning them about it, or if the Government wouldn't immediately freak out about it if its usage explodes in the marketplace. You'd need a president that supports currency competition, too, and might even allow something like this in the market (Ron Paul could be such a president).",1319260493.0
