The customers know what needs they have that are not being met - that's not the same.<p>See also:<p><i>The customer lacks the imagination to ask for what they really need. This is often encapsulated in Henry Ford's apocryphal quote: ""If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."" Now this is not to say the customer is stupid; it just means that everybody wanted to get from A to B faster, but since they only can imagine doing so on a horse, that is what they ask for. And, had they talked to a horse breeder, that is what he would promise them; and when they got their 10% faster horse, they would have been happy. The ""project"" would have been a success.

28,3089769,story,,,2,2,cpt1138,An open letter to NetFlix (or how to treat your customers),,"About a year ago, I finally bought a big TV. I did quite a bit of research and one of the top requirements is that the TV had to support NetFlix streaming.<p>About 5 years ago I finally got sick of Comcast and switched to DirecTV. Getting the channels I wanted from Comcast meant paying more and more whereas, at the time, DirecTV had 1 price for pretty much everything. I signed up and never looked back.<p>When my big TV arrived, I called DirecTV to get HD. To my extreme pleasure the representative noticed that I had been a good customer for 5 years, and that my current plan was no longer available so I was grandfathered into it and got HD, everything, for the same price. I was happy to pay for the HD PVR receiver and I am a very happy customer.<p>At first I was happy with NetFlix too. Then they decided to split DVD and streaming. I cancelled DVD since we hardly ever watched any. Getting Blu-Ray is more. Now I cant stream to all my devices. I don't know what's next in their plans, but I started looking for other options.<p>Now I don't expect NetFlix to treat me special but by the same token, NetFlix is no longer a service I like very much and I won't treat them special either. I do very much like DirecTV and especially how they really made me feel like a special customer that they ""cared"" about.<p>It may be that the price DirecTV charged me five years ago was enough that they could offer me HD for free. Or maybe it was worth another 60 payments (5 years * 12 payments). I guess my advice is: try to treat your customers well if you can, it goes a long way.",1318138718.0

Likely the declining relevance of instant film cameras made Polaroid's own decline more or less inevitable. And it seems even more likely that if there was some change of direction that would have returned Polaroid to glory, then Land - the man who stubbornly pursued Polavision beyond the point of reason - didn't know it and wasn't the man to discover it.<p>And to be honest, I think that something similar is more likely what will happen to Apple. Technological changes are coming that will make the Jobs/Apple approach less lucrative than it has been, and I think they'll probably arrive before Apple really starts to drift from that approach and those standards. If and when that does happen, people will definitely talk about how Jobs maybe could have turned things round, but I wouldn't have bet on it. Like Land, I think Jobs had one big idea and one strategy when it came to computers and consumer electronics, and all his successes in those areas came largely from his skill at executing that one plan. And like Land, I don't think he could have simply pulled out a new approach - and really, a new set of values and talents - in response to a change in circumstances.",1318138393.0

Now, for a variety of reasons including the new burden of complying with Sarbanes-Oxley, founders are waiting much longer to go public. So they are cashing out by selling some of their founder shares to private investors.<p>This is in the interests of the investors because it aligns their interests with those of the founders. Say you started a company, it's kicking ass, and you face a choice. Plan A is a $100MM acquisition offer. But there's also Plan B, an ambitious expansion. Plan B gives you a 50% chance of $1B in two years, and a 50% chance of failure. If you had no assets before you started the company, the only sane thing to do is to sell out. (Not that I am suggesting that sanity should always rule the day.) But your investors probably prefer plan B. If they let you cash out $5MM or $10MM of your stock, then  they make your risk tolerance more like theirs, and you can both get excited about Plan B -- which, assuming your startup is actually producing something of value, is better for the world, too.<p>And it's probably also better for the investing public that tech startups don't make it to IPO until they are a bit more fully baked.",1318137498.0

What's bad about the balance of power shifting toward founders when it was so unbalanced the other way for so long? Let's remember where the pendulum is swinging in from: a few months ago there was a video of Silicon Valley in the 70s with stories of entrepreneurs giving up 98% of their companies in order to raise any money at all. The real story here is the long-term trend.<p>Is there evidence to support the claim that these deals diminish companies' long-term prospects?

He popularized the technology to the masses  and thats what causes the technology to make an impact. If Xerox invented the GUI, but they sold a couple of computers using it, which flopped, and also had on some terminals for controlling their printers, thats it. The technology was going in waste. Steve recognized the technology had potential to be used for personal computers for everybody, developed the technology a lot, and marketed a computer that a lot of people bought or atleast was noticed enough for the mass-marketer Windows to copy it and spread it further. I think Steve played a very very key role here in popularizing the GUI and developing the GUI. The PCs that were sold were better because of it.\nSimilar in the iPhone  I have never used the Dagger or whatever it was  but most people I know havent heard of it, or used it. It would have remained a model, which a few people used  what impact would have. It is the typically fallacy of scientists that they recognize invention as being the most valuable activity  but they forget that unless the invention is used by the masses, it could be limited to none or very little impact on the world. I dont know how the UI of the hiptop was  but the iPhone was the first smartphone to be really easy-to-use and powerful in surfing the internet, and brought in popular use of multi-touch touchscreens (they were not invented in the iPhone, but were hardly in use before it). It also brought a popular App Store to the market. Thats where in lies the contribution of the iPhone. Thats why all the smartphones borrowed a lot of ideas from the iphone over the next years  including your favorite android  (please dont deny, ask Andy Rubin)  and all the smartphones that are available in the market are better off because of it. Also it popularized smartphone and made it accessible to the masses  earlier smartphones were so clumsy to use, they were used only by a few. Today they are popular with everybody, and have apps that can do powerful stuff  which wouldnt have been there without the iphone. Taking a single minded view that just because Apple controls the app store (but keeps safari uncontrolled), it is bad is almost childish in my opinion. Most people who use the phone dont want the fear of downloading apps from an app store like the Android market where nobody has checked the app out before you, and has routinely malicious software.\nClaiming that Steve Jobs made locked-in products, so he did more harm than good  is craziness. I have lost all faith in your judgement reading this article. He did not hypnotize anybody. He marketed the products. If people who bought it first wouldnt have liked it, it would have never become popular. But the fact is, they liked it. Millions of people liked the iphone. And thats why Android is also as good as it is today. iPhone made the average smartphone available in the market Smart, and hundreds of millions of smartphone users today are better off because of it.",1318136429.0
