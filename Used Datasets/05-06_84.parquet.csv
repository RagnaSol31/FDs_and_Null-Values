So, I am going to echo one of Greg’s picks because it was on my list but for a different reason. ‘Seeing like a State’ is an amazing book. And I think it’s drastically changed the way I look at software, not for the same reason as Greg talked about but because it shows why what we do is hard. ‘Seeing like a State’ talks about all the subtleties of human systems and human interactions at the local context level. It talks about all the improvisation that everyone does on a day-to-day basis and how in real human communities, we’re constantly changing the system to adjust to a slightly different reality, to corner cases we hadn’t seen before but now we have. It’s shifting and it’s not well-defined. And suddenly it makes complete sense that the hardest part of software is figuring out what we want to do. That’s it. It’s a great book.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp...</a>",1419486655.0

The majority of industrial labor was free men.  I would imagine working conditions varied greatly, but interpreting things through a modern lens is fraught with problems.<p>I do think people overlook the importance of the Mississippi in the growth of the US.  It is an amazing route for goods right in the middle of the country.  Even today, barge traffic is a huge driver of export goods.<p>// on a side note - I am pretty sure I will disagree with this book if the article is any indication, although I will have to read the book first.  The 1800s (laws & transportation) were very important for the US and it could be said the early 1900s did a number on economic freedom.  The one line in the article can be argued.  Also, 1945 was not as important as 1946-48 for the baby boom.",1419483942.0
