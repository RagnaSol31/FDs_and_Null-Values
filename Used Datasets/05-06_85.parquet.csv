The $700 is what we get to hold onto most often, unless we are saving towards big repairs like new roof, outside paint, etc.  And (crucially) I left out that we had enough first year expenses to legitimately lower that perceived income, as well as the interest that we get to deduct (interest being far higher at first in a mortgage payment).  Next tax year will have different numbers, since we will have had different expenses and different occupancy (unfortunately they do not stay 100% occupied).<p>I am just trying to get out round numbers that show that it can work.<p>Most people have this concept that their house is their biggest asset, when a residence is really a liability for the person who lives in it.<p>I should not have taken the shortcuts in my math, but regardless, we do well.  We have used the profits to invest in more education, and have recently purchased another unit in Florida that will start cash flowing in about two more months.  Well, actually it cash flows now, but we had to pay for some new appliances, so in my head, we are negative for two more months, then we start paying off ourselves for the down payment.  Again, I am more conservative.<p>So it is a slow path to wealth, but a valid path, nonetheless.",1432360698.0
