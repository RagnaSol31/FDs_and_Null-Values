May be a lot, even.<p>It is why you care about folks plagiarizing. It is why your former student cares about his grades.<p>Again, I don't think you would take kindly to a student who plagiarized complain that you are still stuck up about that one incident when the student has demonstrated he's learned a buncha stuff from your class that is as reflective of him as the plagiarizing.",1310968659.0

Performance is not the only metric by which to quantify the performance of a system.<p>Any engineer worth his salt knows that everything is a trade-off, and there are many, many projects where embedding an interpreter is a good choice. It can buy you things like design agility, memory safety (robustness, security), run-time linking (remote code updates), garbage collection (robustness), green threads (maintainability due to separation of concerns, memory-efficient if done correctly)<p>In terms of cost, an interpreting JVM will typically be 20x-100x slower than equivalent C code depending on the application (although technically C doesn't do automatic bounds checking and isn't type safe, so it's not really equivalent). Garbage collection often introduces pause times as embedded GC tends to be less complicated than server-grade, but you can still implement time-critical stuff in C. For example, the .NET/TinyCLR based Fez Panda board has no problems doing one-wire because of this. Finally, you tend to be less memory efficient because your high-level language might be OO, doesn't know about bytes/shorts/ints but rather just has the type 'Number', and because of GC.<p>If you blindly follow the 'performance is everything' mantra, you forget that there is a whole slew of applications where you really don't need 20MHz, and where things like robustness and security are way more important than real-time. The few extra K of memory for the micro might cost you a couple of extra cents, but it can save you a lot of development time. Depending on the volume this might be an appropriate choice.",1310968519.0

Group think; hive mind; worthless.<p>Additive sum, I think academia is doomed.  It's done a worse job adapting than politics and religion, equally baroque and antiquated fields.  I long for something like Ars Digita or Kahn Academy to become the norm.  We need to push education out to the individual and get rid of the institutionalized cookie cutter bullshit.<p>People either want to enhance their understanding of the world or they don't.  A credential or piece of paper doesn't do that, and that's all the vast majority of people in education are going for.  We need to cut down to the root and find ways to instill genuine thirst for knowledge and then let people pursue that in much less rigid ways at their own pace.<p>--<p>As an anecdote:  I went to The Citadel.

Outside exams by an unbiased third party is one idea, but I'm sure there are others.<p>What surprised me more than anything was the lack of mention of any sort of organized protest on the part of the professors.
