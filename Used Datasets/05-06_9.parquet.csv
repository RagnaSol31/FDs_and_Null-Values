3,362761,comment,361868.0,362097.0,0,0,keefe,,,"A lot of people (at least at my current employer) would point you to the semantic web and RDF. One of the big focuses is model driven development - defining application state and behavior in an abstract data model (ontology). I think RDF is a pretty good standard for representing abstract data models because it is general (being based on graphs), simple (triple = (subject, predicate, object), and self describing. There is a lot of bleeding edge work in this area and most of it suffers from severe performance problems at the current state of the art.",1226555422

And I'd agree that no amount of testing is going to turn an O(n) algorithm into an O(log n) one. There's no substitute for sitting down with a pen and paper and doing some old fashioned design sometimes.<p>I do think having a suite of repeatable test cases you can run against developing software is a useful thing to have, though. Not only can you test for correctness, but you can also run benchmarks against each modification to see if your performance or memory usage is going up or down.<p>It probably depends on what you're trying to do...",1226554956

29,362735,comment,362029.0,362712.0,0,0,cabalamat,,,"Surely my argument is more general than that? I.e. it applies to more things than just limiting the number of taxis.<p>A regulated taxi system will differ in some ways from an unregulated system. (If it doesn't then the regulation is so light-touch as to be virtually non-existant.) For example the regulated taxis might have safer drivers, or be less likely to rip off customers, etc.<p>Because regualted and unregulated are different, people will have preferences one way or the other. If an unregulated system is allowed to operate side by side with a regulated system, then each customer will be able to choose which one they buy from, like choosing which supermarket they shop at. (Obviously for this to work it must be easy to tell which is regulated and which unregulated).<p>So if people prefer a regulated service to an unregulated one, they'll continue to choose the regulated one even when there's a choice, won't they?<p>Perhaps you'd like to elaborate on why you think I'm making a gross oversimplification, because I think my argument applies to any differences between regulated and unregulated taxis.",1226553318

I think cost factors trump most other considerations for the bulk of people making college decisions.<p>When I was at GT (late 80s) we were on the quarter system, they've since changed to semesters.  If you wanted to finish a BSEE in 4 years, you needed to take 7 or 8 classes a quarter.  6 was a common load and hence the average time to graduate was 5 years. There were no ""crib"" courses.  Every class made you work for your grade; every one.  If you had a bad week, your grades would suffer as there were tests and graded assignments every single week.  I was told when I was there that there had not been an EE student in anyone's memory that finished with a 4.0 GPA.  Even the most gifted student with perfect study skills would eventually get taken down a notch.<p>Most all classes were graded on a bell curve.  Even in your junior or senior year, you were reminded by professors that 40% of the class would repeat the course.<p>Schools like GT have a social obligation to take on more than they can handle.  That means doing more (more students) with less (less faculty, less support structure).  That said, I think they do a great job.<p>If they had more funds to provide students with more tutors and more private scholarship money to allow students forgiveness if they needed to take a quarter off to rest, the graduation rates might improve.  Keep in mind that most students at a school like GT are at least half operating off state and federal support funds.  These systems do what they can, but are unforgiving if you need to take a break or require some other support like a tutor.<p>I'm a proud alum.  I support my school scholarship funds through alumni channels.  I think if people want to see things improve, look at schools that are working hard and doing things right and throw more money at them; they always need it.",1226553057

43,362718,comment,361730.0,362046.0,0,0,anamax,,,"> The issue I'm imagining with batching is that I cannot send any data back to visitors until the next batch is processed -- because if I do they won't see how their last post has changed their positions in the hierarchy, and they will interpret this as a system error. In other words, every time a member receives a response from the server, that response must indicate his last post's position in the hierarchy.<p>You're making this much harder than it has to be because you're assuming that users can see things that they can't.<p>Suppose that the system had two users, A and B, and they each issued two commands, A1 and A2 in that order from A and B1 and B2 from B.  Suppose further that system responds to each command with something that it says is the global state.  To keep things simple, I'll use the command, such as A2, to refer to the response as well.  (In other words, A2 is the response that A gets to command A2.)<p>A knows that she issued A1 and A2 in that order, so the A2 response must reflect commands A1 and A2.  However, the A2 response need not reflect B1 or B2 unless A has some way to know that B issued them before A2, regardless of when B1 and B2 were issued in relation to A2.  In fact, it's probably okay for the A2 response to reflect command B2 and not command B1.<p>Now let's throw C into the mix, issuing C1 and C2 in that order.  As with B, the A2 response need not reflect C1 or C2 even if they actually occurred before the A2 command.  Moreover, even if the C1 and C2 commands both occurred before B1, the A2 response can reflect B2 and not C1 or C2.<p>The easist thing to do is to periodically produce consistent views of the data.  This process will take a while so while it is happening, you'll have to use a past consistent view.<p>Three views, call them X, Y, and Z that the system updates should be adequate.  At all times, one view will be ""current"", one will be being generated, and the third will be a source for stragglers.<p>Here's how the update process works.  While X is being generated, from Z and all data received since Z's generation started, Y will be used to produce results to send to users.  While Y is being generated, from X and all data received since X's generation started, X will be used to produce results to send to users.  And similarly for Z (using Y).<p>Suppose that user A sends a command while Y is being generated from X.  The response to A need only reflect X and commands that A sent since X was generated.  As long as that can be finished before the system finishes generating Y and Z, everything is copacetic.",1226552467
