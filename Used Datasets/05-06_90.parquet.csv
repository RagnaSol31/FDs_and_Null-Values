(Even at the age of ten, kids will get into console wars citing which has the faster processor, etc.) Having that technical background from an early age, however rudimentary, makes gamers more likely to feel comfortable with programming.",1280210275.0

18,1550354,comment,1549860.0,1550188.0,0,0,Empact,,,"One reason to be a bit more optimistic is Texas (<a href=""http://www.thsrtc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thsrtc.com/</a>).  Their equivalent plan to California's is loads cheaper thanks to their more agreeable geography (plains, mostly).<p>More importantly, the lighter touch of the state government means rather than do a full-on government build and operate (ala California/Amtrak), they're looking at private build & operations under a long-term lease, with the government providing liability limitations and eminent domain, in return for owning the infrastructure after the lease expires in some decades of operation.  This means the builder is subject to market forces: they can only recoup their build costs within the lease window by getting to operations as quickly and efficiently as possible.  The incentives are the opposite for government construction: the milk flows during construction, so there's a disincentive to ever finish, and when things go over budget, it almost always means more money, rather than anyone cutting their losses.<p>To get a sense what a difference this makes, consider that the NYC subway system was built by competing private concerns under the long-term lease model (ala Texas), between 1905 and 1940.  In 1940 the system was unified under government control (ala California), and basically the system was frozen in time, with no expansion happening in the 70 years since (see: <a href=""http://www.diametunim.com/shashi/nyc_subways/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.diametunim.com/shashi/nyc_subways/</a>).",1280209709.0

This led to resignations of senior management members at the time including the then Director General, Greg Dyke. In January 2007, the BBC released minutes of the Board meeting which led to Greg Dyke's resignation.[19]""<p>I followed the events very closely back then. It's interesting that you should mention the dodgy dossier. It was a dossier that the government presented in parliament as an intelligence report when in fact it was lifted from a thesis paper and then sexed up by government officials. This was a clear case of fraud. But none of the so called independent inquiries even looked at this dossier. They preferred to look exclusively at another dossier that was less troublesome for the government. I watched as much of the inquiries as was possible and I came away thinking, what a farce, what a complete farce. The government ordered the inquiries, they defined the narrow mandate of the inquiries, they appointed the people who conducted the inquiries, everything. And the inquiries didn't ask the questions that would have been tough for the government.<p>Instead they used a minor note taking mistake by a small radio reporter to pressure the BBC leadership into resignation.

His conclusions:<p>- Separating a cold thread from its underlying hot thread is not without performance overhead...<p>Of course cache misses dominate performance. This is basically the first vector that work stealing queues attack. For eg. erlang tries to tie erlang processes to the same run queue (which maps to a kernel thread), for as long as it can as long as it maintains reasonably balanced run queues.<p>- Lack of preemptibility based on time quanta creates performance problems...<p>Well yeah, but either that is part of the model already (thread pool), or that is taken into account by the user level scheduler (ie. run X instructions or time then automatically yield to next runnable user level process).<p>- Nondeterministic LWP creation can have an appreciable and unpredictable impact on performance. The nondeterministic nature of the SIGWAITING mechanism makes performance debugging difficult...<p>Mainly because the SIGWAITING mechanism hes described (which sounds like it is based on solaris) is pretty bad for implementing user level scheduling. Windows 7 and MAC OS X Snow Leopard both seem to do significantly better (Maybe that's because they've had 10+ years to fix it...). In any case thread pools have generally worked around this by handling LWP creation based on the number of waiting threads and have seemed to be reasonable in performance.<p>That he even brings up his 14 year old outdated thesis is pretty sad when talking about the state of the art today. STM is no panacea but it is not worthless either.",1280208122.0

Differences exist in and between (recognized) ethnic groups and are enforced by strict social phenomena (slavery for dark skins; liberty for lights). If we eliminated the entire historically privileged white middle and upper class from America, this would render the remainder of the population with much of the same social problems that plague the Black and Hispanic communities today. In this case, after a few generations the ""gap"" would very likely be as good as gone.<p>However, what this, and your comments in particular, have to do with immigration as it relates to Founders is beyond me. Your post basically just degenerates into one of those racialist garbage tediums (see paraphrase:""we've tried to fix blacks for 150 years""; slavery was abolished in 1865; segregation in the 60s; one can't right wrongs by not actually doing anything about them) that litter much of the white supremacist blogosphere nowadays. Hispanics, I might understand some frustration to do specifically with immigration, but what the state of Black America has to do with regards to Founder immigration I cannot discern.<p>Your tangent on how Blacks and Hispanics, two disadvantaged but otherwise tasteful groups, are figuratively destroying America is an example of practiced misdirection.Neither of these two groups objectively stand in the way of adjusting immigrations practices to allow more Founders.Hence your entire rant exposes itself as racist fear mongering drivel written by a someone with very little to say on the germane issue at hand.",1280207243.0

However, based on my personal experience, static type languages are much faster than dynamic languages and use much less resources.  They used substantial less servers to maintain the same SLA throughput.  You don't have to take this advice and keep paying for the high cost of hardware.  There's a belief that developer cost is much higher than hardware cost and thus it's justified.  However, when scaling out, hardware cost is much higher than developer cost.  Developer cost is a fixed sunken cost at initial development.
