X succeeded so he/she must be great. HN sees these people as masters of business: smart, ambitious, persistent, etc. What if they were lucky? Unscrupulous? Manipulating? I'm not saying it has to be all one way or all the other, but I often think only one point of view gets seen here.",1286085526

It's just that OSX isn't a moving target with respect to what is expected to be in the system in it's 'base' state of a specific version. So you dynamically link against everything that should be in the system in the 'base' state, and then all other libraries need to be self-contained in the .app directory. The problem with this on Linux is that: 1) the 'base' configuration is a moving target that varies across vendors and 2) most of the libraries/etc that would make up that 'base state' are things that people would want to upgrade/modify/whatever (thereby messing up your 'base state' that you were supposed to be able to rely on) (You don't have this on OSX because Apple is the one that controls most of the things in the 'base state').",1286084972

Your problem of having a lot to do offline and feeling guilty about your progress in tech sounds more like you feel like you are ""wasting time"" or procrastinating on both fronts. Try this to start out small. Pick one task around your house that needs doing that is small and can be done in short order and go take care of it. Then pick one ""real"" high tech task such as looking into some new platform or language that can be done relatively easily and do it. From there, keep picking tasks or parts of tasks with the goal in mind to accomplish one thing each day. The Internet is only a problem when we use it to avoid doing other work we know we should be doing. However, it is just as easy to find offline distractions to substitute for the online ones. The most important thing is to take a long term perspective on what you are doing even as you work diligently on each sub-goal or minor task.<p>You might find that the book Getting Things Done has some helpful advice on effectively managing your time/efforts.

Mostly, it helps to not let things build up too much. If there's a week's worth of dishes sitting by the sink, there's not much chance I'll get through them all at once (I'll usually stop once the drainer is full), but if I take an extra couple of minutes after each meal I won't produce such a buildup.<p>With regard to keeping up with professional development, I put too much time into school to feel guilty about not putting enough time into it. There is a lot of stuff out there that I think would be interesting to learn, but I am under some time pressure to get my thesis done, so most of it's going to have to wait.

I'm saying this as someone who is currently unemployed and unable to take out unemployment because, well, my previous employer hired me as an 'independent contractor' and didn't pay into my unemployment insurance.

You made a pretty incendiary charge that those people are selfish and want to take the credit of helping without actually making the money to do it. That's an entirely different story. Also, I think it is a bit much to say people who want the rich to become philantropists are wanting to enslave them. That may be accurate if you make a cartoon of the whole thing and make caricatures of everyone but it is a bit naive. Sure, maybe people should just shut up about telling others what to do with their money but it's hardly comparable to slavery to state that people with obscene wealth should, if they are to be good people, use some of their money to help people. Now, some might argue that actually helping people hurts them - that's fine. But that's not the point I'm making (by the way, that's pretty ridiculous as well!)",1286082345

However, this may come about in two different forms.<p>One way is akin to the ""wheel of reincarnation"" effect where social features centralize, then fragment, and then centralize again. One can easily see this in the lifecycles of most online discussion venues - a focused start, and then a gradual change and dilution of the site's character that hits a tipping point at some critical moment. Facebook has already gone far, far away from the ""college facebook replacement"" angle it started with, but it hasn't yet hit the landmine that might cause its own self-destruction.<p>The other way is the emergence of a dominant open system that is pound-for-pound similar in purpose and usability, and simple enough to run that it becomes a commodity. This can take eons of ""internet time"" to happen. Desktop Linux remains a work-in-progress(but one getting closer and closer to its competition), and Jabber, as a pure instant messaging platform, is still just one of many systems. So if a standard emerges for social networks(and we haven't <i>really</i> settled on one) it will still probably take decades.",1286082314

Projecting growth based on past earnings and current growth rate is one thing. But imagining hypothetical revenue streams of yet-to-be validated products  is batshit crazy. It doesn't matter how obvious or inevitable people think it may be or what the trends are. There's no track record with any of these if-they-wanted-to-they-could-do-this-tomorrow-and-make-billions products.<p><i>""Facebook Credits are poised to be this generation’s American Express""</i><p>Am I the only one that thinks Facebook isn't as omnipotent and in total control of its user-base as people like to think?  Everyone is making these projections about users just falling inline with Facebook's potential revenue models, but they forget the shitstorm that was Beacon. Clearly, Beacon was a direct grab at a sustainable business model and it violated many of their user's trust. Facebook may act like its a benevolent dictatorship, but there's always been an element of democratic decision-making at the behest of angry users. And those concessions always occur at the boundary between potential profitability and privacy.<p>So many are quick to use Google as a benchmark when Google itself was an extraordinary circumstance. It was recently mentioned that Larry and Sergey were willing to part with their company for $750,000.[1] Now, you could argue if Bill Gross never existed, Google would never have be Google because they wouldn't have developed Adwords and have a perpetual license to Overture patents. And Google's advertising is its flagship product, accounting for 97% of its revenue.[2]<p>Google was a net win for the internet. It helped structure and organize the majority of information available on the net, and combined the best interest of their users (accurate, quality search) with the best interest of businesses (targeted advertising, purchasing intent). They unlocked tremendous wealth on a new platform and reaped the rewards.<p>Facebook has clearly had a social impact. Just like text-messaging and AOL Instant Messenger did. But the question of if it has unlocked any huge wealth the way Google has is yet to be seen.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312509150129/dex992.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/0001193125091...</a> \n[2] <a href=""http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/09/29/excite-passed-up-buying-google-for-750000-in-1999/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/09/29/excite-passed-up-buyi...</a>",1286082296
