I work for a large company and my manager stays green for a long time ago after and seems to message me when I go idle. I am becoming exhausted from the anxiety of having to always be online.,1350799109.0

27,4679095,comment,4678649.0,4678751.0,3,0,Jach,,,"I am not blaming the victim, just offering a solution for the victim's discomfort. It is not equivalent to the type of victim-blaming usually done against raped women--precisely because what a woman wears isn't strongly correlated with whether she is raped or not, few decisions on her part could have helped her situation before or after, so she can't reasonably be blamed for failing to e.g. never leave the home. (And discrimination triggered by a piece of clothing is recurring, meaning one's behavior can change before and after.)<p>I did notice my advice has similar forms, except I wouldn't generalize to middle-class or Christian. Another piece of advice I'd offer anyone in America is to learn how to speak Standard White English if you don't know already. But I'm not nearly the first to offer this:<p>""In class - in my English class - you will have to master and write in Standard Written English, which we might just as well call ""Standard White English"" because it was developed by white people and is used by white people, especially educated, powerful white people. [RESPONSES at this point vary too widely to standardize.] I'm respecting you enough here to give you what I believe is the straight truth. In this country, SWE is perceived as the dialect of education and intelligence and power and prestige, and anybody of any race, ethnicity, religion, or gender who wants to succeed in American culture has got to be able to use SWE. This is just How It Is. You can be glad about it or sad about it or deeply pissed off. You can believe it's racist and unfair and decide right here and now to spend every waking minute of your adult life arguing against it, and maybe you should, but I'll tell you something - if you ever want those arguments to get listened to and taken seriously, you're going to have to communicate them in SWE, because SWE is the dialect our nation uses to talk to itself... And [STUDENT'S NAME], you're going to learn to use it... because I am going to make you."" -- David Foster Wallace, Authority and American Usage<p>Another piece of advice I'd offer is: grow a thicker skin. Not always a good piece of advice--I would recommend it to an atheist in the US struggling with discrimination from their family and local community, I wouldn't recommend it to an atheist in Egypt--they should get out as quick as possible.<p>I'll explain to you the core of where my position on this matter comes from. I'm an engineer, and if I see a problem, I look for a feasible solution. The problem expressed by the submission is ""people are being discriminated against--whether they deserve it or not, whether they're even muslim or not--because of a piece of clothing that in American society gives off a bad first impression."" There are three obvious solutions: stop wearing the hijab, force away the concept of first impressions (not really a good idea) from human minds, or force everyone who harbors resentment towards muslims in general to stop it and love them. Only one of these is easily accomplished. Furthermore, it opens the door for real cognitive dissonance that can actually change people's minds. ""Oh, you're a <i>muslim</i>? But you don't wear the thing!"" ""Not all of us do, and those that do don't just wear it for religious reasons..."" Very few people ever learn to notice themselves completing a cached pattern of thought, and even they don't always notice consistently. People typically have to face with premise-defying reality to really change their minds.",1350798103.0

36,4679086,comment,4675741.0,4676510.0,1,0,mkramlich,,,"That phrasing is not, agreed. But it's pretty well known among serious historical scholars that it was a principle held in esteem by the Framers.<p>But let's go directly to the Constitution itself. To wit, the 1st Amendment:<p>""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.""<p>Any reasonable person just can't believe this Amendment is truly and effectively the law of the land, as practiced, if you see all the references to the Judeo-Christian God in government documents, ceremonies, speeches and buildings. Also there are any number of religions, both actual and possible, whose free expression is prohibited by one or more other laws enforced by the government. The counter-argument is to say, well, the government honors this amendment by not explicitly forcing anyone to be Christian, and by not explicitly respecting Judaism/Christianity over others, and not explicitly and directly forbidding any given religion in particular, etc. But in effect, it clearly does these things, in effect, if not at a superficial level.<p>A better argument you could make is to say that the principle of the separation of Church and State, taken literally, is honored by the government. And taken very literally, it is. Because the government is not a religion and does not operate any churches. But the counter-argument there of course is that the US national government is a religion (there are hymns, myths, icons, rituals, blind obediance to external authority lest you be punished, patronization, you're forced to tithe, etc.) and that the government does operate churches (buildings you visit regularly, or feel obligated too out of moral/civic duty, with anachronistic architectural styling, icon imagery, rituals, tithing, authority submission, explainers of exotic and sometimes seemingly anachronistic and overly detailed codes of morality and punishment and how they apply to your life, etc.) Just because something isn't <i>called</i> a church, doesn't mean it isn't, goes this kind of argument. And I think it's a pretty enlightening one.<p>Any non-profit, that otherwise follows the rules, and is approved, can be tax-exempt. But you can't just create any arbitrary religion and have it recognized by the legal system and approved. The State has to approve your religion, else you don't get the tax exemption. And I'm not speaking as someone who personally wants to do that. The point of fact is important for understanding the relationship of the US government to religion, in actual reality. Not in theory, not in some ideal world of words. But in reality.",1350797914.0

You had a job to learn a trade, and/or get schooling where they were lacking. You had people of all sorts of crimes around, many a time with heavy machinery. Yet one thing was certain: if you treat people like animals, they shall act like it. This 'experiment' proved the opposite: treat them like civilized humans who at one time erred, and they will act like civilized humans.<p>But I live in Indiana. Even despite the restriction of making laws towards or against another religion, this state makes rules that are undoubtedly ""Christian"".

If you go to the cops and courts and say, ""but it's part of my religion, we do animal sacrifice"" you then are at the mercy of the courts to decide which law takes precedence. the Constititional law saying the government shall not interfere with the establishment of any religion, or, the ability of states and local jurisdictions to enact laws regulating what citizens can and cannot do. If any given Constitutional clause or amendment was somehow always and without exception enforced, US society would be very different because individuals could make excuses left and right to excuse otherwise illegal behaviors as being protected by the Constitution.

Heck look at the clause that says Congress must declare war -- yet the government has engaged in hundreds of military adventures across the world, without a declaration of war ever being made or even requested, by the Executive branch. The Constitution is truly ""just words on paper"" and the government effectively just does whatever it can get away with. That's what the historical record suggests anyway.",1350796921.0

It always felt forced and unnatural for page-based web applications, so it was disconcerting to see controllers getting railed on as inappropriate to single-page apps because they were dragged down to the client from the server world.<p>However, while I think the incorrect history should be ripped out of the book (if for no other reason than there are people who will write off the book because of the inaccuracy), I've always felt that the controller part of MVC wasn't defined explicitly so much as surveyed to see what was left after the model and view, so I'm ok with the book not liking it.<p>It has surprised me for many years that we haven't found an architecture better than MVC for apps, because I've <i>never</i> been comfortable with any controller code in any app I've worked on.",1350796899.0

That's because the NFL and NBA are essentially cartels anyway. But soccer will take the hit even harder.

The Norwegian prison system has a far better rehabilitation rate than most, and this to a large extent has followed a gradual softening up of the prison system from one that was every bit as inhumane as the US system, but is now regularly described as ""holiday camp"".<p>Imprisonment is used far less, and the tendency is to reduce it further. For those who do end up in prison, sentences are generally far shorter, coupled with education and work (you can choose, but you need to do one or the other) in prison. Prisoners often get granted early limited parole (you can start getting weekends out of prison etc. long before a full parole, or monitored time outside the prison - e.g. a famous convicted murderer was recently interviewed at a cafe while she was out on parole, accompanied by a police officer...).<p>The result is a system that fits far better with the reality of the psychological effects one would presumably <i>want</i> a criminal justice system that cares about rehabilitation to have on a prisoner.<p>A large part of the problem with most prison systems is that they are based on emotions and demands for vengeance rather than an evidence based approach to actually minimizing harm to society.<p>Sweden has similar success with rehabilitation, though Sweden and Norway also unfortunately shares similar flaws to Sweden when it comes to pre-conviction detention.",1350795607.0
