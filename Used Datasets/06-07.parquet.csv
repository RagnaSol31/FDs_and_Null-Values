The Dell lights out management is overpriced and crappier. One way or another is's very nice if you later can add exactly similar machines to take any Linux hardware surprises put of the way (if that's what you're running).",1211007154

Vitamins, too, the whole long list. Mineral suplements. Alcohol, mostly low quantities of red wine.<p>I think we as a society (and I don't talk about americans only, i'm european) have a huge alergic reaction to using medicine for non-healing purposes. I never really understood why. Of course, there are the rational risks, but it looks too much like a gut reaction. Maybe is related to the fact that people avoid doctors in general?<p>Some day we are going to have safe drugs that can make us live 20 years longer and a lot better, and we're not going to realize it. And if that day was in the 80s, we wouldn't know it.",1211006928

Despite Cringely's self-congratulatory sense that he is ""attacking the temple of IT"" and ""alienating an entire industry,"" everything he says about Gartner et al could be applied to any type of consultant, and nothing he says is particularly surprising or revelatory.<p>I was hoping for an article exposing the fact that Gartner et al are actually pay-to-play extortion rackets run against enterprise software vendors. The software vendors need their products to appear in Gartner's supposedly objective reports, but, hey, surprise surprise, Gartner only covers those vendors who pay them for <sarcasm>totally unrelated</sarcasm> research services, and, hey, surprise surprise, the vendors that pay Gartner the most money somehow end up with the most favorable <sarcasm>objective</sarcasm> research coverage.<p>There is a symbiotic relationship between Gartner et al, enterprise software vendors, and corporate IT departments. The IT department managers have no incentive to find simple, cost-effective solutions to their problems because that would mean cutting their own budgets and headcount. Rather, they need to justify their bloated budgets and headcounts -- Gartner provides such justification. On the other side, the enterprise software vendors need to justify their overpriced, overly-complex software -- again, Gartner provides the justification. All three sides of this unholy trinity know that this is a racket and that providing real value and usability to the actual business users is beside the point -- the real point is to provide money and jobs to the IT departments, the software vendors, and, of course, to Gartner.<p>Will the real Robert X Cringely please stand up and point out how naked this emperor really is?",1211005221

You may even want to hold off on the premium version for a year or so. There's some conflict between being non-commercial and buzzworthy, and pushing your premium version to get subscriptions.<p>Learning about your customer is crucial. The easy and cheap way to do this is run a survey on your site, while your service is still in the free phase. You can promote this survey aggressively to a portion of your user base and expect around a 15% response rate. One of my businesses had some obvious quantifiable differences between a free and premium version, so the survey included these 3 questions:<p>* Would you be willing to pay more for an enhanced service?<p>* How many Xs, Ys and Zs would you want?<p>* How much would you be willing to pay for this per month?<p>After collecting thousands of responses, I ran them through a Bayesian clustering algorithm (which can handle missing answers) and it spat out a bunch of service levels and price points that made a lot of intuitive sense. These were $5, $10 and $20/month, and later we added $40/month. Interestingly there was one big cluster that wanted the world for $1/month, whom we naturally decided not to cater for. We also learned that some features, such as RSS, didn't correlate at all with people's willingness to pay, so we added them into the free version.<p>Net result after a few years is about 1.5% of active users are on one of the premium levels, with the number approximately halving as you go from each price point to the next. Since the price doubles at each level, the total revenue from each price point is about the same. And it's a very tidy living for me and my partner.<p>One last thing: pay a lot of attention to what happens when people's subscriptions end involuntarily, because their credit card expired or stopped accepting payments. This happens a <i>lot</i>. You want to target these people with reminders about the premium service's benefits, and a discount promotion to sign up again with their new card.",1211004515
