1,323956,comment,309300.0,310196.0,0,0,bbgm,,,"It's probably worth your while to take a loop at Hadoop them.  When you can fundamentally map your problem into many small problems and then reduce the results (true for most sequence alignment, etc problems), then Hadoop is very viable.  Not exactly common fare these days, but getting more popular and perhaps increasingly so.  Plus you don't really have to learn new languages, just a distributed computing framework.",1223189852.0

Up until now we've been mostly focused on creating a clean API, and keeping the internals simplified.  I would expect the gap to widen much further once the API stabilizes, and the spec coverage gets nearer 100% (it was in the low 90's last I checked).",1223189776.0

If you haven't signed anything, and haven't been paid for anything, then the code is yours, and you can walk with it. Understand that contracts don't require papers, but it helps when things go wrong.<p>The key here is <i>consideration</i>. It's what you've given up and what the other person has given up in return. You've given up the code (IP, time, development), and what have you gotten in return? If you've been paid, that may be all that matters in court. If you haven't been paid, and if you've been promised equity and haven't received it yet, the contract is unenforceable and you can walk with your code.<p>I would use that last bit if applicable to leverage your position and make your case to the founder. You want the equity up front, before an NDA. The NDA keeps you from taking your code elsewhere, which is probably what the founder, his lawyer, and the investors want to keep you from doing.<p>Also, don't settle for a wimpy stock agreement. If you're in a position to take your year's worth of work and bring it somewhere else, and that year's worth of work is substantial, use that to get a substantial bit of equity. I would be ready to take my work too. In fact, it might be better to go ahead and do that since things are pretty shaky with this founder.<p><i>Disclaimer: Like most other people here I'm not a lawyer, so don't sue me after taking my advice.</i>",1223189741.0

7,323950,comment,323164.0,323164.0,0,0,manmanic,,,"Energy is the big challenge of our generation, not computer technology. Climate change is part of it, but it's not the main issue. At some time during the next few decades we're going to hit crunch point in terms of oil and gas reserves. Not only because few new resources are being found, but also because their depletion is accelerating, especially due to China and India's stellar economic growth.<p>Humanity will get through the energy crunch, probably with a 20-year depression and government commandeering of manufacturing resources to build renewable energy capacity. During that time there will be huge unemployment, war, and for many poorer countries, likely starvation. The food chain is deeply dependent on fertilizer, made from oil.<p>So the key for the next two decades is to do as much as we can to prepare for this period. Ideally we'd completely wean ourselves off oil and gas, like Sweden or Norway, but that seems unlikely to happen. But at least, it means investing in renewable energy capacity and technology, so that things don't completely grind to a halt.<p>Trouble is, this isn't really a computer problem, so how to help?",1223189256.0

Probably the first lesson I learnt as a product manager was how to take what users asked for in terms of features and then try and understand ""why"" they wanted it. Especially useful when you listen to a number of feature requests and try and distill them down to the reasons underlying them.  Many disparate ones can often be coalesced down to a few actual requirements/issues which you can then try and address instead of just implementing features",1223188378.0

I think Meebo's mostly written in C++, for instance, since they're always looking for C++ and JavaScript people but they never mention scripting in their job ads: <a href=""http://www.meebo.com/jobs/openings/server/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meebo.com/jobs/openings/server/</a>  I think they mention in one of these blog posts that they wrote a lighttpd module.<p>I've written a C++ Apache module for a simple web app before.  It's definitely harder than using a scripting framework though, not so much because of the language, but more that frameworks have functions that help you do just about anything (e.g. sanitize input, construct safe SQL).  In C++ land you're more on your own since most people aren't crazy enough to build a web app in C++.<p>Also, if you go down this route and you're particular about C vs. C++, check out mod_cpp for building Apache modules: <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/modcpp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/modcpp/</a><p>I echo the advice that if you have something performance-sensitive, build it in C/C++, but proxy it through something built with a better-known framework.

26,323930,comment,323863.0,323863.0,0,0,jhancock,,,"There are two approaches:<p>1 - build your app as an extension of an existing http server.  Start with lighttpd or nginx source and build out from there.  nginx has a nice module structure.  Perhaps your app can be just a new module.  Both of these code bases are C and use event driven sockets.  You might be able write your extensions in C++.<p>2 - Use a known solid http C++ library to roll your own server.  Depending on the complexity of your app, you may end up spending a lot more energy going this route.<p>My relay server for <a href=""http://shellshadow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shellshadow.com</a> is C++.

You've signed or >>cleary<< declared that you are relinquishing ownership of it to them, they own a patent to the work you're doing for them and thus they have priority over it, or you've been paid and on the terms of payment was that you were providing them with code.  The last one about being paid is still arguable but worth noting as you can argue that they were paying you for a license to the code you were writing and you just happen to be more open to share information and listen to their opinion on the matter.<p>In a situation like this, if the idea is stellar enough (and you understand it enough) that you could do the idea without them and it would likely be successful, I would take it and form your own company, potentially file for patents on anything new, and look immediately for investors.<p>In the world of business there are two key things which separate one from another, and both must be present.  The first is material, code, visual/displayable proof of concept, prototype, or product.  The second is money to execute and grow the material and code.  With those two things, you'll have the upper hand against them at any time.  Some will argue in the long run, if they manage to survive being beaten out in the beginning by product and money, that they may have a greater vision or business sense to execute it more efficiently, but the success would be unlikely.  From your description of them I would think they would quickly crumble under the matter and the fact that you did what he's so scared of and he drove you to do would render him utterly useless/dysfunctional.<p>THAT IS JUST MY POSITION AND TAKE ON IT.
