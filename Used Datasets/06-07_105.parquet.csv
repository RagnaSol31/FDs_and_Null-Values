They put some money into this company, those dudes work extremely hard for a year, while the investors chillax, then they sell off. The investors make a nice chunk of change, while these dudes transfer to another company where they will continue to work extremely hard for another year or more.<p>To me, 'startups' are not really companies. They are vehicles for speculative activity by a certain class of people. All those drones being encouraged into spending so much time working in these companies so that investors will make money could also work on creating real businesses that they own and that will make them real money.",1309244306.0

35,2704319,comment,2704071.0,2704071.0,2,0,bimbly,,,"Calling this the ""Netflix Model"" seems naive. When Netflix initially launched, there were two major drawing points.<p>1) Access to a large library/inventory. Traditional rentals were limited to mainstream/popular film and newly released films required luck to rent. Netflix made cult films easily accessible (Eraserhead, Cannibal, etc.).<p>2) Price savings in comparison to traditional Brick-and-Mortar Rentals. Netflix Subscription fees were equitable to two movie rentals a month. Two movie rentals a month seems like a number not outside the norm.<p>The service they discuss would require seeing approximately 5 movies a month just to equal the subscription fee. That is  a large number.<p>Secondly, they aren't giving access to any more product. Just the same movies that weren't worth watching before. With the exception of oscar season I think watching five newly released movies a month would be more of a punishment.<p>Their shameless promo integration (pre-selling DVDS, ""early access to trailers"", merchandise sales) only serves to further devalue the user experience making $50 seem far too high.<p>As a final note, I do believe the pricing structure/experience of theaters should be re-examined and this is a start. Personally, subscription concessions could be a cool place to start. I would really consider paying $30 a month for 5 large popcorns and drinks (and that would still leave a huge margin).",1309243396.0

Not sure what the distribution looks like, but I'd guess it's a pretty thin tail of people who go more than 4-6 times per month.<p>So either they're hoping people think they go a lot more often than they really do, or are giving a great deal to a small portion of the population.<p>Pricing seems quite a bit off for this to be attractive to 95% of the populace (though given theaters need to pay a cut for each body that comes in to the distributor, they probably wanted to be on the conservative side)... maybe should have done something like $25-30/month, and hope the users buy enough concessions to make up the difference. Or do the $50, but throw in a free massive bucket of popcorn for every trip, which costs virtually nothing to the theater anyway (and presumably, the customer's usually going to want to buy a drink, which is basically 95% profit).",1309243314.0

I'd be curious to hear if you've tried a) using a DocumentFragment, b) detaching the node using removeNode, manipulating, then adding it back, and c) simply working with a node (createNode) and then adding it in after manipulations are done. The basic idea is that working with the live DOM is slow, while working with detached nodes is fast. Note that I haven't really tried this stuff out that much.
