But the truth is that rooftop solar shouldn’t be saving them money (though it often does), and it almost certainly isn’t green. In fact, the rooftop-solar craze is wasting billions of dollars a year that could be spent on greener initiatives. It also is hindering the growth of much more cost-effective renewable sources of power.&quot;<p>He then goes on to explain that the costs are low only because of unsustainable federal subsidies. He does not mention what source of renewable power it is that is so much more cost effective than solar. Nor does he mention what the &quot;greener initiatives&quot; are or why solar is not green. No evidence provided whatsoever. Solar is in fact &quot;green&quot; and sustainable. And in my opinion it is the best source of renewable energy available to us. The rest of this article is spent talking about the subsidies and why they are bad. And he says that if the utilities erected solar farms, we could have sustainable energy at 5 cents per kWh. This is true, but the utility companies have refused to implement solar in any meaningful way. Whether it is because of greed or red tape does not matter. Continuing to burn fossil fuels to generate our energy is out of the question and if the utility companies do not reform themselves people are going to buy those panels and eventually prune themselves from the grid entirely. And everyone knows that the utility companies are going to drag their feet until the brink of disaster.",1431930199.0
