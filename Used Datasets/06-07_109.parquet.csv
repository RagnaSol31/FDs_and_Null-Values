[1]<p>Programs written using a deterministic-by-construction model of parallel computation are guaranteed to always produce the same observable results, offering programmers freedom from subtle, hard-to-reproduce nondeterministic bugs that are the scourge of parallel software. We present LVars, a new model for deterministic- by-construction parallel programming that generalizes existing single-assignment models to allow multiple assignments that are monotonically increasing with respect to a user-specified lattice.<p>LVars ensure determinism by allowing only monotonic writes and &quot;threshold&quot; reads that block until a lower bound is reached. We give a proof of determinism and a prototype implementation for a language with LVars and describe how to extend the LVars model to support a limited form of nondeterminism that admits failures but never wrong answers<p>[1] <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4823"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4823</a>",1439880731.0

However, keeping the final result undercover for a few days is actually against Dutch election rules.<p>So, a critical web site organized a nationwide system where people could sign up for their polling station, to stay around during the counting and then report the results back to the web site. They got about 70% coverage I think; in the large cities it was near 100%. It was quite interesting. It was a close vote, and their result was slightly off, but close.<p>I am considering to alternate each election between being an official election helper and unofficial self-appointed monitor.",1439880419.0
