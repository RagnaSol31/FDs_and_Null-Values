But irrespective of time, there are a few annoyances compared to at least Ruby (I wouldn't say it's worse than Java though).<p>The pointers aren't such a big deal, as long as you don't try to use the math operators on them. You just have to remember the ""*"" in declarations. Remember, objects in most dynamic languages are ""pointers"", you just don't have access to the raw bits.<p>BTW, Objective-J solves the problems you mentioned (no raw pointer access, no header files or needing to declare things multiple times, the ""+"" operator does string concatenation and regexes are built in). Of course it's mostly for client side web apps, rather than native apps (though Cappuccino works in Adobe AIR...)",1229582449.0

Much easier than having to create an NSString subclass just to add one method, and then having to remember to name all your NSString's something like MyString* str;<p>I also like that I can just throw a chunk of c or c++ code in there, and call it as a method.

I used to fall into the same camp as you, but prolonged experience to Objective-J and then going back to Objective-C, I realized that even though I knew how to solve the problems, they weren't worth wasting cycles in my thought processes. All that to say, reference counting works really well, but there's no good argument not to just use garbage collection (at least 99% of the time).",1229582137.0

16,401881,comment,401788.0,401861.0,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's easier to control.  The cure for hyperinflation is to just keep raising interest rates and buying currency in open-market operations.  Eventually, the supply of currency becomes tight enough that firms can no longer raise their prices without losing customers.  It's painful (just look at 1980-1982), but it works.<p>When countries don't do this, it's usually not because they can't or because they don't know how, but because there's another factor that will threaten the stability of the state if they do.  For example, if a country has a large standing army, they can't shut off payments to those soldiers without risking revolution.  Or if there's a large foreign-denominated debt, they can't stop payments without inviting war with the creditor nation.<p>In past comment threads, I've gone looking for various instances of hyperinflation, and they <i>all</i> fell into one of the two categories above.  I'd welcome counterexamples, but nobody's provided any yet.<p>[Edit: Interesting, I found one.  Bolivia in 1985.  Like every other instance of hyperinflation I know of, it was caused by the government printing money to support expenditures that its tax base could not justify.  However, in this case the expenditures were non-essential (things like subsidized gasoline), and so when the government eliminated the pork and committed itself to a balanced budget, the hyperinflation ended.]<p>The problem with deflation is that interest rates can't fall below 0%, and there's no guarantee that infusions of currency will reach the people that will actually spend them.  Once rates are at 0%, banks and savers will just hoard currency instead of circulating it, so even if there're lots of unemployed people that desperately need the money, it won't get to them.  ""Pushing on a string.""<p>I think that Bernanke's ""helicopter"" comment may have proved prophetic, and it may shortly become his best option.",1229581959.0

While I was thinking, I hit on a novel idea. Distributed computing using javascript piggybacking on unsuspecting browsers.<p>It occurred to me that a site like youtube, if they parcelled out the DES key space to their browsers in leisurely 10,000 key increments such that you could check them in the background while watching a 1 minute video without making a dent in the CPU, could crack a DES key in something like 3 years in the average case (assuming a zero growth rate in audience.)<p>I going to have to think about how to manage the key space such that I don't chew more CPU doing that than I would checking the keys personally, however I think I'm going to implement this little experiment in distributed computing and see if I can attract people to paste some javascript on their personal blogs and suchlike.<p>Anyone interested in joining in, either as a developer or eventual cracker?",1229581005.0
