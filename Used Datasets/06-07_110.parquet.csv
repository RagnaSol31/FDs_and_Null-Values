Moving into more rural areas, getting off the grid, setting up water-catchment, and growing more of their own food.  They are really preparing for the worst.<p>I find myself unable to really do much for myself like they are right now, so I continue to focus on my business, building luxury items that are highly dependent on petroleum products.  I love what I do, but sometimes it's concerning when these people around me are so wrapped up preparing for collapse.<p>Are you doing anything to prepare for these types of scenarios?  Are you steering your business towards sustainability?  How do you justify your path in entrepreneurship when the growth has to stop someday?",1314946576.0

Students who don't show up tend to miss a lot of the material and don't do especially wellhence the attendance policy. And the stuff that's done in class (discussion, close reading, sentence construction, and so forth) is stuff that can't really be made up outside of classas I tell students, if you could do it at home, I'd say, ""Do it at home"" and I'd do something else in class.<p>Yeah, there's a correlation != causation problem with weak students who tend to miss class being the ones who most need it, but the overall idea of class doing things that can't really be done otherwise still holds. There are also a certain number of students who say or believe, ""I'm already a good writer; I don't need to take a composition class."" Out of the ~300 I've taught, that's probably been true of one to five, or so, but far more seem to have believed it.<p>A school like the one listed sounds great. It also sounds like it'll work best for the highly motivated. One problem with the HN posts about how universities are wasteful, unnecessary, and so on, is that a pretty small percentage of people are willing to do university-caliber work without the structure of the university.
