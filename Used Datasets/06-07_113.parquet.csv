36,5405934,comment,5405371.0,5405730.0,2,0,graycat,,,"It's simpler than that:  Fred knew in fairly good detail just what he was doing.  All the early money in FedEx (Federal Express then) was from Fred's family's money, basically Fred's personal checkbook.<p>Also should count Fred's time at his Little Rock Airmotive where he did the engineering on the special cargo door and got the FAA approval.  So, FedEx really grew from a going business, Little Rock Airmotive, and was not started with just an idea.<p>By late 1972, White-Weld was supposed to have done a good private placement, but they didn't get it done.  Although later one of the guys from White-Weld, Phil Greer, did invest as part of Weis, Peck, and Greer, now Opus.  The service went live in early 1973 and was chronically short of money from then for at least some months.<p>The fuel crisis hurt:  FedEx was buying jet fuel for 16 cents a gallon in Memphis but 55 cents a gallon in Nashville with the other cities scattered between and with limits on how much must/could buy.  Right:  Buy fuel where it's cheap and fly it to where it's expensive.  Hmm ...<p>The more important questions were:  How fast can bring the 33 planned planes online to serve the planned 90 US cities?  E.g., had to find and buy the planes, get the special cargo door installed, get the pilots, be sure there is enough maintenance staff and facilities.  During this growth period, how fast will the package volume and revenue grow?  How much does FedEx need to charge, for over-night and for next-day, and how much will the customers pay?  Where should the early marketing efforts be aimed -- law firms sending ""time-critical documents"", lab animals, manufacturers' representatives sending samples, e.g., decorative bricks, spare parts suppliers, suppliers of inventory for just in time inventory manufacturing that just ran out of a crucial part, clinics sending samples for medical testing, fashion, e.g., loads of dresses for a big sale, movie film, both unexposed and ready for showing, etc.<p>How fast the service would grow was, if you will, an exercise in 'the network effect' because the more cities served, the more opportunities to get shipments from a given city.  Further, of course, there was a big 'virality' effect:  Each shipment was, in effect, and ad to a good candidate customer.  All up, 90 cities, great publicity and reputation, sure, but just 15 cities, no publicity or reputation and the billing sucks?  So it was a bit unclear just how fast the service would grow from 15 cities to 90.<p>In broad terms, the need for the service was quite clear.  But some of the planning was not good:  E.g., the early planning arithmetic said that could fly the planes half full and print money.  Then soon the planes were flying packed full, the rates were doubled, and they were still losing money.  We're talking some bad arithmetic.",1363761584.0

I also take care of my girl (she's doing her PhD and has no income whilst she focuses on finishing it... matter of weeks now). We have very little savings (few hundreds, not thousands).<p>The way I did it was to cut all costs, everything. 2 people living in London on barely £1,000 per month covering everything.

65,5405905,comment,5403988.0,5405418.0,62,0,csallen,,,"I don't think there has to be merely one single solitary reason for the popularity of diamonds. Whenever you see profound effects (in this case, a massive number of people people grossly overpaying for a useless rock), it's worth considering the possibility that you have several strong forces all pushing in the same direction. In this case, yes, advertising doesn't hurt. But there are plenty of other factors that may be contributing:<p><i>Social Proof, Envy</i> - You're 28. Many of your good friends are married or engaged by now. All of them got diamonds. Your mother got a diamond. Your sister got a diamond. All of your celebrity idols got diamonds. Surely, it's a normal thing. There's nothing wrong with you wanting one, too, right?<p><i>Doubt, Insecurity</i> - You're dating the man of your dreams. You love him and want to spend the rest of your life with him. Marriage is a big step, and you want to know he's committed. Sure, diamonds are useless and overdone, but it's expected of him to get you one. And a big one, too, if he can. You know it. <i>He</i> knows it. So if he doesn't, surely it's a subtle way of him saying, ""You aren't worth it.""<p><i>Fear of Loss</i> - You've been looking forward to this your entire life. By the time you were old enough to consider the possibility that diamond-giving is a dumb and arguably immoral tradition, you'd already spend 15 or 20 or 25 years wanting one. You'd already accepted that you <i>would</i> get one. The fear of loss is a powerful force, even when you're ""losing"" something you don't have yet.<p><i>Inconsistency Avoidance</i> - Refusing to accept a diamond would undoubtedly and repeatedly put you in the position to explain yourself. In a way, it's a silent judgment of all those who <i>do</i> accept diamonds. You've never denounced them in the past. In fact, you were right there with all your friends joking about how big of a rock you'd get some day. So denouncing them today will seem inconsistent, and you don't want to be inconsistent. Nobody does. (If you doubt this this a major psychological factor capable of influencing behavior, read Cialdini's ""Influence"".)<p>Etc.<p>Advertising spend in and of itself isn't a reason people buy things. Nobody ever said, ""I want a Coke because Coca-Cola spent $3B on marketing this year."" Instead, people want things for primarily carnal and psychological reasons. Because it's hot outside and you know Coke is cold. Because you're craving stimulation and you know carbonation tickles your mouth. Because you know your friends with their big expensive rings will think less of your relationship if you don't get one, too.<p>Good marketers understand human psychology and play to its weaknesses.",1363760300.0

You are not judged on your social status and income, but how hard you work for your grades and goals. Children and teenagers are not restricted when it comes to applying to schools and universities. You can even apply to the top universities of Finland if you have studied hard and have good grades. Tuition fees? Nope. And how's your income? - The schools don't care as long as you've proven that you're hardworking or talented. System takes care of the funding, students can focus on the studying.<p>Maybe in some countries, changing to this kind of system might be considered just an idealistic nonsense, but I believe that's what has made the Finnish schoolsystem as strong as it is - equal chance for everyone to be whatever they want to be and work hard for.",1363760129.0
