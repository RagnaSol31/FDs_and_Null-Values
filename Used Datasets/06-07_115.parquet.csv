I do not work there but know many that have that speak so highly of its foundations. Like some  sort of new form of knowledge discovery and expansion of thought. While it may be infantile this could just as well be seen as an advantage, at least for a while to come. It is one of the frontiers of innovation for company building (and nation building for that matter): keeping people feeling, thinking and innovating like children.

Part of the reason the process staled was because I explained &quot;I consider programming like hammering nails. I program. I am not a programmer&quot;.
