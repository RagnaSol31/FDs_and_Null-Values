The key here is 'moral and psychological problems'.<p>To cite just one example, there was a lot of ruckus about the 2G Scam and the Lokpal bill recently. We believe that the guy who got 17200 Crore rupees in kickbacks is a corrupt SOB and should be punished to the maximum extent, but when it was revealed that a leading anti-corruption crusader was actually stealing money from the sponsors who invited her for talks, we dismissed it as a 'small amount'. This kind of 'it's not a crime if its done at a small scale but it's a crime if its done on a large scale' mentality is present among nearly everyone.<p>Also, another huge problem with Indians is that we as a people do not wish to risk anything. As a result we will never fight for something that should be rightfully ours (like a Government that does it's job). Urban voters are generally brainwashed by the charisma of our politicians or are bought wholesale with a few thousand rupees and a bottle of liquor. Rural voters don't really care who they vote for.  As a result we keep alternating between the same two sets of thugs. Will we get out on the streets and protest for better governance like the arabs did? Never.<p>So, the West can paint many  pretty picture and call it India, but this is a country in massive disarray, and the fact that it hasn't already collapsed is purely by chance.",1331449126.0

This is an unfair position.  There may be corruption, apathy and so on, which impede progress along these lines.

So it would a double standard to say the least to criticize Indians in this connection on one hand and, implicitly, to rest satisfied with one's own government, on the other.  If you are criticizing both them and your own society simultaneously (assuming you're not Indian), this hardly provides support for what seems to be your point that Indians aren't doing enough.

I think you are mixing things up a bit about how our genes work from generation to generation.<p>I understand perfectly well the distinction between mutations and crossover, but I stick by my original language - to a large degree, competing alleles <i>do</i> ultimately arise via mutation (including insertion/deletion/other funny business), not crossover, which primarily just randomizes selection between different alleles rather than altering them in detail (human crossover probabilities are roughly 1% per million base pairs, which is too infrequent to be doing much bit twiddling within genes themselves, though it will occasionally happen).<p>> tl;dr Someone who is a long-living nobel prize winner is IMHO, a genetic success, regardless of procreation.<p>That's fine, but ""genetic success"" in the context of evolution means quite specifically that copies of their genes are more likely to be present N generations down the line than copies of competing ones.<p>In this sense, if your particular set of genes enables you to help all humanity equally in some significant way, you're doing your own genes no particular favor unless you somehow help your own family out more than others. That's not a moral judgment by any means, but it's the nature of the game of evolution...",1331446774.0

Will it be a SAAS?\n2. Will there be a free version on the web? If yes then how will it be different from paid SAAS service?\n3.
