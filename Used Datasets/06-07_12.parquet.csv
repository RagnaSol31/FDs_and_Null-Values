He's not just giving a tiny bit of money to fresh college grads and making you move to San Jose for 3 months, it looks like it is going to be an actual co-op where each group accepted gets part of the pie from everyone else, and its not only limited to 10k.

The challenge is what audience can you gather to sell to your advertisers. If they are undifferentiated then you have to have millions because they are not of much value. If it's presidents of Fortune 500 firms then you only need an audience of a few hundred to be able to make a lot of money.<p>So I would suggest it's not ""people"" but a well characterized audience at an acquisition cost that allows you to mark them up to your advertisers who will in turn make more money from the purchases your audience makes.<p>The YC mantra of ""make something people want"" gets interpreted in ways that cause a lot of startups to overlook the value of a niche focus.",1208328427.0

My question is: how important is an RSS reader's ability to display the content of the RSS feed? Since many feed doesn't include the full content and you have to visit the main site anyway, it is better to just display the title as a link? The reason I am asking is that in order to personalize, you would have to gather data, which is impossible to do unless the user is using your RSS reader, and I do not have the expertise to write a (full featured) RSS reader.",1208327724.0
