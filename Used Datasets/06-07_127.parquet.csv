But the way your body processes the burger is different depending on the digestion rate.<p>A couple of things can happen after a given amount of glucose enters the digestive system.<p>Consider when the digestive system releases the glucose into the blood rapidly, much more rapidly than cells are able to absorb it. The pancreas releases a lot of insulin. Muscle and fat cells both significantly increase their blood glucose absorption rate.<p>Alternatively, consider when the digestive system releases the glucose into the blood gradually. Cells are able to absorb more of the blood glucose as it is coming in, so blood glucose levels do not rise as much. There is some insulin signaling, but there is less of it. High-need muscle cells already have increased their blood glucose absorption rate due to increased energy requirements, while insulin signaling to fat cells is minimized.<p>In the alternate scenario, high-need cells muscle cells, while fat cell growth is limited.<p>Statement: &quot;not eat the burger in the first place.&quot;<p>Cutting out something I like is not a sustainable way to eat healthily. Food intake is not just regulated by energy homeostasis; the reward system, e.g. the mesolimbic pathway, is also potent.<p>Statement: &quot;improve your insulin resistance/glucose tolerance&quot;<p>Agreed.<p>There are two ways to avoid excessive insulin signaling. One, you can decrease the rate at which glucose enters the blood. Two, you can increase the rate at which glucose leaves the blood. My article talks about one, and you seem to be an advocate for increasing insulin sensitivity, which is advocating for two. I think most people should do both.",1438410840.0

One part of the optimization comes from the use of binary encoding and the other from using offset tables to optimize random access. Offset tables also allows to modify random data in the structure without having to reencode the whole information.

Harlow next \n    chose to investigate if the infants had a preference for bare wire mothers or cloth \n    covered mothers. For this experiment he presented the infants with a clothed mother \n    and a wired mother under two conditions. In one situation, the wire mother held a \n    bottle with food and the cloth mother held no food. In the other situation, the \n    cloth mother held the bottle and the wire mother had nothing.[10]\n\n    Overwhelmingly, the infant macaques preferred spending their time clinging to the \n    cloth mother.[10] Even when only the wire mother could provide nourishment, the \n    monkeys visited her only to feed. Harlow concluded that there was much more to the \n    mother/infant relationship than milk and that this &quot;contact comfort&quot; was essential \n    to the psychological development and health of infant monkeys and children.
