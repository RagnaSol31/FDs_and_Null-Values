Doesn't one imply the other?<p>(Note: we're talking about wants here, not needs.  It's quite possible to believe you need something and be mistaken.  But wants are subjective beliefs, so almost by definition, wouldn't believing you want something mean that you do want it?)",1243234693

Automation doesn't make kids useless.  It actually makes them more useful.  A ten-year-old girl without automation can't do nearly as much as a 17 year-old boy.  The more automation, the closer they are in productivity.  (Having actually worked on farms, I'm often amazed by what people say about working on farms.)<p>If you want to keep farmers from breeding, don't have family farms.",1243234317

8,625132,comment,625049.0,625117.0,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>What about some re-distribution of wealth....</i><p>Which merely exhibits a superstition about money, as though it is separate from what it represents.  Merely redistributing money does nothing about the disparity in wealth.  Modern wealth is a derivative of education, natural and human resources, ambition, hard work, the rule of law (wealth won't exist for long where the nearest thug can walk away with it unhindered), and other factors.<p>Merely telling governments to force people to ""redistribute wealth"" won't solve the problems that lead to the wealth inequality between third and first world nations, and the money will merely evaporate, as most aid money evaporates today...into the pockets of local banana republic leaders and their supporters.  Fix what's broken about government, education, and ideology, in those third world nations, and you'll solve the wealth gap.<p>There is no way to ""redistribute wealth"" without redistributing the engines of wealth.  And most first worlders, particularly those most successful at creating wealth, aren't going to jump at the chance to live in third world nations.",1243233777

As you'll see, the definition of a genes as being an explanation for heredity is somewhat dated.<p><a href=""http://genome.cshlp.org/content/17/6/669.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://genome.cshlp.org/content/17/6/669.full</a><p>I do like the definition in that article<p>""The gene is a union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products.""<p>Personally I've always had issues with the idea of patenting basic biology, and genes are fundamental biology of a species, since no one manufactures genomic sequences.  How that biology can be controlled, modified and used for all kinds of purposes is a different story.<p>I would also argue that patents break down completely in modern science, where there is too much complexity for any one organization or people to control what you can do.  It hampers science, it hampers innovation, perhaps even to a degree that it's harming human health.  This from someone who believes pharma companies should get more control over their patents with the caveat that ""me too"" drugs should be thrown out once an extended patent period is in place.",1243233618

By all means, disagree (I'm not sure I agree with it myself), but brushing it aside as some random statement with the usefulness of ""wearing yellow pants"" is not really fair.<p>Since I dealt with its substance later on, I didn't brush it aside.<p>That said, when the only support given is ""lots of folks believe it"", is brushing it aside unreasonable?  Does it matter if they're Dutch?  Should I have argued about the number of people who believe that position, whether they're Dutch, or whether the Dutch are authorities on this subject?<p>I thought not, so that's why I argued against a valid reason for their position and disussed its implications.",1243233572

Of course, in reality, there is a very good reason not to make the minimum wage $50 an hour - it would cause much of the country to become unemployed.<p><i>So should we lower the minimum wage even more so that businesses can hire more people and thus lower unemployment rates?</i><p>Not to lower unemployment rates; you should lower it because a marketplace of individuals making voluntary exchanges is much better at deciding the value of someone's labor than the government is.<p>The bottom line that for some reason people refuse to accept is <i>just because you legislate it doesn't make it so.</i> Wal-mart greeters don't make $50 an hour for a good reason - their labor doesn't generate anywhere near $50 an hour in extra revenue, and many people are willing to do the job for much less.
