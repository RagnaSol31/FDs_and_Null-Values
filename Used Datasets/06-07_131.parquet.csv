And also agregates some recommended content on their own site. They even do voting. So it is basicly all there.<p>I am currently working on a feedly alternative that also integrates the ranking of the aggregated site and design wise looks a bit more like Medium. But the main Goal would be to implement something I would call a smart group courating feature. I am yet undecided if I really should integrate dicussions.

Level-oriented progression. Resource harvesting. Terrain types. Unit speed as a key differentiator. High level weapons with the capacity for massive remote destruction. NPCs on the map.
