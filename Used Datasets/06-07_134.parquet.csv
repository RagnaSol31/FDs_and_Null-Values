11,3508664,comment,3508354.0,3508557.0,10,0,bermanoid,,,"No love for Zynga here; the bulk of my rent for the past reasonable stretch of time has been paid for by a Zynga competitor, and a lot of office time has been spent ripping on them for their various tactics. There are many things to hate Zynga for, especially if you've actually talked to people that work there (or that have jumped ship, or they've tried to recruit).<p>But I really don't buy the idea that gamblers are the target market. I know that demo very well, as my previous life was spent running numbers for an online gambling company (my experience with market analysis in that context got me most of my recent work), and I've always been a bit of a poker junkie myself. The Facebook crowd is far more casual, far more female, and far less into tangible, liquid rewards than the gambling crowd.<p>Mistaking the motivations of this crowd is a serious mistake, and if you are under the assumption that the Facebook gaming crowd is made up of Pokerstars castoffs, for the sake of your business I strongly encourage you to reevaluate the situation. While there may be surface similarities in the addictive natures of these games, the people that spend money on gambling are almost always looking for real life gains; this stands in strong opposition to the typical motivation of a Facebook gamer, who is in it for the fantasy alone.<p>I'm not saying that Facebook would not make a great market for real life gamblers, but at the moment, it's not feasible because they don't allow actual gambling. And the real gamblers know the difference - they won't even play on fake money poker sites, for the most part, even the ones that are quite badly addicted to poker. I seriously doubt that they're the same people that sink money into Facebook games to buy virtual goods that let them decorate their farms or give their avatars new haircuts...",1327474287.0

They also did it with the App Store, then the Mac App Store (they sold access to third-party developers).<p>That's three major forays they have done into the 'cloud services' business, but they have not unified the branding - like Amazon has done. Doesn't mean they are not a heavyweight player.<p>Also, just because they are not competing head to head doesn't mean they aren't competing.<p>GM made trucks, Yamaha made bikes. They don't compete for the same customer, but they do compete for some customers in some market segments. So that makes them indirect competitors.<p>Right now, as it stands, there are some customers (technically oriented) that might have rolled their own iCloud solution on AWS - but now they might not because they can use Apple's. Sure, that's a very small % of the market right now...but my point is that at some point - within the next decade I think - Apple will be more direct.

Back in 2007, my game was the second game Zynga ever copied.  I've been there, I know what it feels like.  It sucks.<p>What I'm saying is that Zynga is aware of their past and is moving towards less copy and more creativity.  I think their <i>actually released products</i> in the last 6 months are a testament to that.  Dream Zoo is a great example of coming into a genre, ""Zyngafying"" it, and coming out with a hit product that's better than the competition.
