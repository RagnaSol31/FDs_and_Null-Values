Complex applications are the problem. People not knowing how to structure complex applications are the problem.<p>Let's see the context there: jQuery is wildly popular, but it <i>is</i> the right tool for the job in most cases. Not all web pages jQuery is used on are webapps. Not all webapps are GMail. Yup, jQuery is ""DOM, AJAX and effects"" library which is great for trivial tasks. A lot of tasks <i>are</i> trivial.<p>But there is no ""jQuery divide"", like there was no ""Prototype divide"" some six years ago.\nThese are just tools that can be misused. Sorry, Rebecca, but if dojo were as popular as jQuery is the JavaScript land would not be any better than it is now. It would be just a different tool misused, that's all.<p>The second point she is way wrong (again, IMHO) is the API. Don't you ever underestimate\nthe importance of the good API. When you have tools X, Y, Z which more or less do the same with more or less the same performance, API is the main differentiating factor it's the think you write and look at the whole day. jQuery's API\nis awesome for many reasons. Dojo's is not.<p>Structuring complex applications is hard, no matter what language you use, it's not some trouble only JavaScript has. True, JavaScript comes with a couple more complications in that regard but these are minor in the context of the problem.<p>What she is right about it's the lack of good examples going beyond the basics. But I think the reason for that is that we are just on the way to find out what works reasonably well. It will come, I hope.<p>So my point is: stop talking about jQuery and dojo. Talk about the core of the problem (and any js lib is not the core).<p>Oh, and I would like to see Rebecca's take on backbone.js.",1302937108.0

I think this is a genetic thing so it's not a simple change, like all the early risers like to claim. All my life people said ""when you are older, you will start waking up earlier""--they said this about college when I was in high school, about work when i was in college, etc. Well I'm nearly 30 and it hasn't happened yet.
