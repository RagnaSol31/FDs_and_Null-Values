Hejlsberg and a few other Borlanders received justifiably high bonuses, but the absurdly rich enticements were extended much further down the line.  \nAs an ex-Borlander at the time, I heard all kinds of inside stories about the Microsoft offers.  For a compiler engineer, the bonus represented a life-altering financial event that Borland didn't have the resources to match. Many never had their heart in the move to Redmond and left Microsoft after a few years. If you understood how Borland's culture of software craftsmanship compared to the churn of second-rate engineering packaged and sold by Microsoft on a regular basis, it's no surprise that the flight of talent wasn't driven by the dream of working on Microsoft products or exposure to Microsoft's business culture.<p>On a brighter note, Borland may have lost but silicon valley ultimately won when Google's incredibly fast growth prevented Microsoft from pulling a Borland on Google's search engine team.",1326437923.0

15,3459486,comment,3458611.0,3459287.0,2,0,eropple,,,"How well-rounded are you outside of computer programming? Hard sciences, humanities, etc. I ask the question because to me it seems like hyperfocus is a significant danger to the unschooling concept.<p>In particular, I can see a real possibility that an unschooled child with a heavy computer focus and a lack of parental guidance could very easily lock in on computers and neglect potentially ""boring"" but incredibly helpful topics. I'm thinking largely of the humanities here; you can get away without understanding, say, chemistry [1], but it seems difficult (in my circles, at least) to be taken seriously without a decent command of English--a skill that I think is refined largely from reading, because I've never met someone who could speak and write well who didn't enjoy reading--and it seems like it'd be difficult to really understand the world around you without a decent grasp of history. In neither case does Wikipedia really cover it; I think that a level of internalization of such things is necessary (it becomes harder to evaluate political statements without at least a high-level understanding of where they come from, which has driven my own recent forays into economics and sociology).<p>For similar over-focusing reasons, I'm generally but not completely skeptical of the ""don't go to college"" argument sometimes espoused here on HN; the focus on matters of immediacy--the get-a-job skills--strikes me as a good way of turning out someone with a few strong skills in a few areas and a generally fuzzy understanding of topics unrelated to their focus area. I am, however, even less fond of the idea of ""max out your subject matter, take the bare minimum outside your degree area""--I have a hunch that a self-directed person is more likely to stumble into well-roundedness than somebody whose academic drive is constrained to do-your-job topics.<p>[1] - Not to say chemistry's a useless subject by any means, I actually draw on it sometimes in my day-to-day life. But knowledge of the hard sciences, physics possibly excepted, are a little less impactful overall.",1326437610.0

This is a desired result of the standards process, exactly the opposite of what you seem to think it is.<p>There has to be a way for browsers to test new features in the wild. That's how it's always been and will always be, which also has the nice side effect that the standards body (or single vendors inside the body) cannot slow everyone down. If everyone could only implement features when they are really done and part of the standard the world would be a dreary place indeed.<p>The problem with this is that when two browsers implement a feature with either a different syntax or different results you would be forced to do browser detection and have two stylesheets or use hacks. That reallx used to happen and it sucked. The prefixes avoid this problem altogether. When everyone agrees about a feature the prefixes can be dropped  in this case (if the syntax doesn't change) nobody even has to change anything. All the designer has to do is delete lines as more browsers adopt the standard.<p>What you are seeing is the necessary result of a standards process with many vendors.",1326437454.0

A recent case in point is an old friend who told me that he liked the chances of his startup because they were all engineers and so made rational decisions about their business.  I threw back at him that there are also tons of engineers I've met who fall in love with their technology and make blind stupid decisions because of it.<p>More cases in point.  Many an engineer crashes and burns if ever promoted to management because he doesn't know how to communicate with people.  Any quality manager would be able to resolve conflicts easily, and the required people skills can be justified quite logically.  This isn't to say that all engineers are idiotic non-people people.  This is saying that there's a selection bias that just because someone was good at something, they must be good at other things.<p>I see many more cases in situations of crisis, deadlines looming, etc.  Bet if you up it to a situation of war, no engineer's brain would be able to survive and continue to think logically; only those who are properly trained for thinking will getting continuously mortared would be able to continue functioning.  Still more examples out there in areas like marriage relationships, anything that involves dogma (whether political, religious, or scientific), etc.<p>My point is not that other people are smarter or more logical about the rest of life than engineers.
