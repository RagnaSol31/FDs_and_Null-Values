That a significant number of the currently unemployed have decided to remain unemployed because welfare is good enough?<p>That's certainly an effect to consider, but I really wonder whether it's actually significant in the US - welfare in the US is not particularly generous compared to a lot of developed countries, and I don't know that so many people really would find it a good enough alternative to working that I can believe they're really turning down reasonable jobs in favor of being on the dole.  If this was, say, Ireland, where the government will literally put you up in a house and give you spending money if you don't have a job, I'd say it was reasonable to blame that for a lot of the unemployment problems, but here, I just don't see it - the unemployment rates have been pretty closely aligned with the economy as a whole, which makes me think it's the availability of work that's the issue, not the willingness to take it on.",1315205904

I have many, many fond memories of halo.bungie.org and the like in fact, I remember seeing sneaky Halo-related hints on Bungie's website before they even did the famous reveal during a Macworld keynote (with you-know-who): <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2obYHzJ3n8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2obYHzJ3n8</a>.<p>Then, Halo 2 came out with off-the-shelf Havok physics replacing the (wonderfully) ""buggy"" penalty springs-based physics from H:CE. Because Havok was ""more-realistic"", it was extremely difficult to do the sort of insane physics-stunting the first game allowed. It was this single change that turned me off of the rest of the Halo series.<p>Like Super Metroid, H:CE was a magnificent case of the weaknesses in code allowing for brilliant system-breaking ingenuity on the part of users. And as long as video game devs are forcing themselves to the very bleeding edge of technology under a merciless deadline, we're bound to see more ""glitchy"" games offering plenty of opportunity to enterprising and creative sequence-breakers, speedrunners, stunters, and the like.",1315205563

In Starcraft, it is not uncommon for players to attempt to force a win by going for an all-in strategy that sacrifices long-term income for lots of first-tier combat units. The chance aspect is that there are more starting locations than there are players.

Is that body's brain creating your real consciousness. If science points to that consciousness, then there is a strong possibility of it being the wrong consciousness. The consciousness of the sleeping person is the real one. The same applies here too.<p>Normally, since the conscious state is one of low awareness, one is not aware in deep sleep and swoon. However, when one practices being aware and raises the level of awareness, one is conscious in all states. All this becomes very apparent as one raises one's awareness and comes out of ""mind consciousness"" -- continuously living in thought.",1315205191

27,2961413,comment,2960973.0,2960973.0,24,0,bz,,,"The concepts outlined are pretty good, but I want to make a counterpoint against heuristics in general. Distilled ideas like these are certainly useful for trying to grasp a complex system, but they do not, for the non-expert player, represent game knowledge. Let me explain why.<p>The pitfall for the average viewer/player is to take these mantras and apply them directly to what they see. They see a game where T apparently overcommits after winning an engagement at his 3rd, and wonder why he didn't take a 4th instead. Surely, this is a mistake of not getting more ahead!<p>An expert player might look at the same scenario and see an entirely different picture. The problem was that he scanned a 15m timing instead of a 17m timing for the Hive, so he was actually behind in that engagement (he should have decisively won with the Z's gas locked up elsewhere!). And that Broodlords would be due out in 2 production cycles, but it takes 3m for him to break-even on the new mine, and he would miss the window to secure enough of an advantage to push the game into a low-econ trade phase.<p>My point is that real game understanding is extremely specific. It's all about the actual state and timing. To go back to the article, that's where the marginal advantages are gained - by understanding and controlling how these extremely specific scenarios play out. The larger ideas about strategy that everyone loves fall out from the analyses of these interactions. But ""getting"" the general idea isn't the same as actually _getting_ it when you work out these scenarios and timings yourself from extensive playing/testing. So heuristics are really only part of the picture, the much larger part is a precise understanding of the system at work.",1315205076

34,2961406,comment,2960235.0,2960235.0,4,0,yason,,,"I have barely noticed the color schemes. I do recognize different color in films from different ages--for example, I like the warm colors of 70's and 80's film--but generally I don't care much because it doesn't distract me from enjoying the film.<p>However, there's a huge issue that has practically stopped me from watching the recent films, or nearly anything made in the 2000's.<p>It's how cutting the film and camera tracking have changed. It used to be more about long takes and cinemaesque dolly shots that also give time to get immersed in the film. But there's a newer trend that started in the late 90's and developed fully a few years later: extremely short and rapidly changing cuts and excess hand-held filming with the camera shooting from within the scene, rapidly turning and changing positions. To me, it feels like watching a strobo light: I literally have no idea what's happening in the film. It just all flashes in front of my eyes.<p>The problem is that it's not just action-packed scifi films or anything: many films in all genres have become more fast-paced. You can barely find a romantic comedy or a drama without several scenes that enable this ADHD limbo. To make it worse, even European films have begun to adopt this style in the last decade.<p>I watched some old action films such as Rambo or Terminator recently and I must say that even they were more moderate in tempo than the last few, and not necessarily action, films I've seen in the cinema in the last five or so years. This is just terrible and I hope cinematography will recover soon or that these tricks will move on to the 3D videos.<p>Similarly to reading books, a good film gives you the essentials of the plot, characters, and the visual scene only and leaves the rest to your imagination. And giving space to this imagination is crucial to make a good film.<p>A good film must not give you everything because it can never be as good as if you had imagined it yourself. In opposition, these youtube flicks with 50M budget are only trying to make a first impression on you.",1315204811

The only thing needed for evil to succeed is for good people to do nothing about it.<p>If you work hard enough bringing out proofs of his toxicity - even to the employees and the future people who will work under him, I can say for granted something is bound to happen to him. I know this because I have done so with reasonable success in the past. Here's my story, if you're interested.<p>I joined a startup I was excited as hell about, and had the happiest times of my life for the first 1 year. It was a win-win - they loved me and I loved them. However, once it went profitable, the founders ( 8-10 years our seniors ) began hiring their college buddies as VP this, VP that.<p>It was around this time that the people I had worked with to build the entire system from scratch had started quitting. I should have taken the hint, but I stayed on.<p>When they hired a 'CTO' from their college who had dubious credentials at best, I should have known better than to stay. VPs with 0 management chops are still okay, but a CTO with no vision is a suicidal move. To make matters worse, I was put under direct management by him. He had no new ideas, and was quick to shoot down through intimidation any new work I tried working on as 'too optimistic'. Deep down, I knew that was not the problem - deep down he resented the fact that I was the go-to guy for the problems the newer employees faced, and try as he did, he couldn't solve problems to save his life. He resented having to come to me whenever something crashed, and there were instances of crashes he didn't even tell me about, and I only came to know of them through other employees who thought I should know.<p>I brought this into light at several meetings with the founders, the people who i had worked with since the beginning to build this system almost from scratch, and then rebuild it. However, the founders seemed more interested in reliving their college life than chiding the 'CTO' about his \nmisadventures.<p>This left a bad taste in my mouth, and I quit - but not before humiliating the 'CTO' at every public gathering with the team that we had, during my notice period - to the point that he stopped organizing these meetings. I was supported by the employees who knew who was to blame.<p>Soon after I left, two of these 'VP's were let go, and the 'CTO' had to make amends to accomodate several whims of the employees. They perhaps can't let the CTO go because he has had sexual harrassment charges against him, and wouldn't be hired anywhere else. This was probably the reason he went jobless for 2 years before the startup was founded.<p>I wish the startup succeeds, but I also wish he is not there to reap the benefits of the success he so doesn't deserve.<p>The point is - I could have just rolled over and taken it, and simply quit - but like I mentioned before - "" The only thing needed for evil to succeed is for good people to do nothing about it.""<p>So let it go, but not before you've done him enough harm so that he knows better than to mess with anyone else like he messed with you.",1315203326
