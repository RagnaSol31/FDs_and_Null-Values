It's true that very original thoughts come out once you have the time to establish context, a connection with the audience, etc. And this enables a sort of learning and communication that may be impossible or difficult to transmit via short form content - be it blogging or micro-blogging. That being said, I actually see a ton of insightful, one liner comments on Twitter all the time. And the ratio of time taken vs. learning absorbed is far better than I think a book has ever given me. Maybe in the next 5-10 years books stick around via new e-readers, and one day, a chip in our body that lets us read anything any time but just closing our eyes. They may never totally go away. But just like live theater dominated the sphere of 'entertainment' long ago, it has retreated to a niche, and I think with the rise of short form content, mass video production/distribution, and other media shifts, that is where books are headed, too.",1328856791.0

By ""this crowd"" you must mean the handful of people who aren't scrambling to sustain their invulnerable self-image by cobbling together some half-assed theory from the little bits of pop-psych they've read.<p>What is your big upset about? If someone introduced you at a conference as the ""guy who has never been laid"" instead of ""the guy who did brilliant thing X,"" you'd have no problem seeing why that would be hurtful. Shit, at least not being laid is the result of your own (in)action, and therefore something you've arguably earned; being ""sexy"" is an artifact of an organism's constitution. Perhaps by hurting you, I've sidestepped the intellectualizing process that prevents you, or someone like you, from understanding that there are fundamental emotional wounds involved, not abstract intellectual concepts.<p>Unsolicited advice to any man who still doesn't get it: when someone says ""that hurts me"" don't come back with ""no it doesn't, here's why...""",1328855027.0
