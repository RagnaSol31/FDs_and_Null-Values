Of course many groups have found ways to interpret this scripture in more benign ways, but the scripture itself is pretty hateful.<p>Sure you can always cherry pick the things you like and discard the rest, but then you are using another moral compass to direct the picking. E.g if you discard the OT then you also discard the ten commandments. But people tend to think it is still wrong to murder and steal, so then end up picking some of the rules in the OT but ignoring others. &quot;Love your neighbor&quot; is from the OT also, btw.",1446620135.0
