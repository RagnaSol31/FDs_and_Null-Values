I actually made something with the same exact intent (except that it was more geared toward sharing your ideas with friends) but not being a writer myself it never really made it that far usability wise (although, it did have a name generator ;).<p>I watched the screencast and it looks actually useful! However, navigation looked a little clumsy, and having signed up and played around some, that's proven to be true. For example, in the chapter list there's no direct way to get back to the book except via the book menu. Also in navigation: having to click ""Show"" is unintuitive to me. I naturally want to click anywhere in the row.<p>As for features: I wish it were possible to interlink the various bits of the book together with each other. For example, going back to your screencast, being able to go beyond just saying ""This is Sherlock's house."" and linking Sherlock and the setting together. Perhaps more useful would be tying everything together in chapters (Sherlock and Watson and Arbitrary Character do something at Sherlock's house in chapter 3!).<p>Those are my main thoughts. I'll have my 5 users check it out and see what they have to say about it since they've actually used my site fairly extensively (over 200 characters amongst them). They're used to everything being public (I know how terrible that is, but they like reading each other's stuff), but they should still have some decent feedback :)",1286953108.0

All of this is possible without even touching the ~50% of the budget that goes towards military spending or raising payroll taxes significantly. My personal opinion is we shouldn't even consider cutting a single social safety net until military spending has been slashed. Even China is now limiting the growth of military spending yet in the US this topic is totally off the table.,1286953066.0

Now it's only a matter of time until the next, far more serious crisis.<p>If you want to plan for the future, don't assume American politics is somehow going to become more rational on its own.

I chose the dentist with the highest ratings (well, one of the only dentists with any ratings at all).<p>Interesting fact: in 5 years, I apparently accumulated 5 cavities, none of them very serious. I got all 5 filled in under an hour, with no anesthetic whatsoever. Then, when I went for my checkup 6 months later, I had 2 new cavities. (Btw, if anyone is wondering, there is a low-power laser that reflects off your tooth enamel based on tooth density to determine which teeth need attention, and then there is a different high-power laser that actually gets rid of the decay).<p>Being my usual skeptic self, I started wondering if dentists didn't embellish reality a bit (or even create cavities while they're in there... ok, even I'm not that cynical, but I'd be lying if I said the thought didn't occur). Then again, my dietary and health habits probably did change considerably that first year after graduation.<p>In the end, I trust this particular dentist for a couple reasons.<p>1. He readily explains every step of every procedure he's doing, including how the tools work and why they work, even edge cases in which they wouldn't work. And he does so with enjoyment, like it's pleasant for him to have a patient interested in what he does. This appeals to the engineer in me.<p>2. He has said things to me like, ""Well let's wait and see on that tooth. There's no reason we need to do anything to it just yet, it doesn't seem to be getting any worse."" Also, when doing the laser fillings, he's asked, ""Do you want anesthetic?"" I responded, ""do you think I need it?"" And his answer: ""Well, we can start without it, and then do it if things get too painful. No reason to numb you up and mess up your day if not necessary."" Realizing that he'd get more money from me and my insurance if he used anesthetic, this alignment of interests was refreshing.<p>3. Given that every procedure I've had with him has been without anesthetic, I can say with certainty that he is extremely attentive to any pain I may have.

I read the free online version of the Programming in Lua[1] book and was basically set.<p>Lua feels like a simpler, cleaner Javascript.<p>--<p>You have lexical scope, anonymous and first class functions, and dynamic typing.<p>The parser is as simple as possible (LL(1), ie top down, without backtracking), and doesn't do any magic like declaration hoisting or semi-column insertion.<p>The only falsy objects are `false` and `nil`. `==` doesn't do any type conversion.<p>The addition `+` and concatenation `..` operators are different.<p>Some infix operators do automatic type conversion ( +, -, *, /, %, ..) between strings and numbers, but that's about it for weak typing. There's no octal to decimal conversion for strings with prepended zeros.<p>There's only one way to define objects.

Some notes which may or may not already be on your todo:<p>You need to spend some time/money on design/designer. The top left icon should always be clickable. Ouch, favicons scaled up that large are terribly pixelated, especially Wikipedia's. (Also, no reusing icons, but you knew that)<p>On the toolbar itself, the Google category looks poor (align those boxes!).<p>The toolbar itself should have an 'add bookmark' button for the current page.<p>On the page itself home vs. toolbar is too confusing a distinction at this stage (it seems the toolbar is really the point right now).<p>The intro page could actually have the toolbar loaded, and point at it, and describe things you can do with it, starting with the 1-step install procedure (Drag [this] to your bookmarks bar, and point to where the bookmarks bar is by default).<p>The 'windows' that come up, green vs red square top right is a bit confusing, also should have a button to actually go to the page inside the iframe. (extra credit if you detect browser OS, and copy that on the fly). Actually, the window/iframe feature shouldn't be a separate function (eg. why is clicking 'search my bookmarks' different, menu/window-wise, compared to the google menu.) Closing the toolbar itself should close the iframe in any case.<p>Also confusing is clicking on the icon on the toolbar vs. floating and having the menu come up anyway.<p>I would be less conservative about using screen real-estate if the toolbar has already been activated. (Eg. instead of clicking reference, then urban dictionary and <i>then</i> entering the word, clicking reference should allow me show me a box for urban dictionary). The user has expressed intent to see the toolbar, take advantage of it.<p>The analytics section should be redone (have the name somewhere, tooltips shouldn't all be the same...)<p>Maybe have a split button for tools? eg: [   Readability    | (cfg icon)]\nClicking readability on the left would activate it, so it's 2-clicks to run it instead of 3. Clicking on the right would bring you to arc90's config page for it.<p>Maybe the bookmarklet could toggle the toolbar?<p>The page timer is cool and all, but too noisy on an already busy page?<p>""Customization:  Intuative drag and drop interface."" (Spelling)<p>You need a punchier tagline, something like Dashler: Your web, when you want it, wherever you want it.<p>Also, push that the customization of the toolbar, and the shared-ness:\n""Add your own toolbar to any page. Includes tools and bookmarks you choose, and is shared between your computers. What's more, it's free!""<p>The 'Useful Shortcuts' section (<a href=""http://www.dashler.com/toolbar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dashler.com/toolbar/</a>) mentions stock quotes and weather, but neither of those are actually on the linked page (also those section headers should be links if possible).<p>Are you planning on running your own bookmarking backend?",1286950488.0
