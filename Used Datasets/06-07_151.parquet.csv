So you need to plan your systems in such a way that they're elastic under load; response times <i>rise</i> within these limits, but you won't see outright failures.<p>You use a DNS failover service to provide each client with the appropriate DNS. There are various issues around caching and preferred A records--for instance, some name servers or DNS clients will pick the <i>first</i> A record, sorted, which can send all your traffic to one datacenter. Typically you hand out different combinations of A records depending on locality, so clients are hitting, say, the two closest datacenters to them.<p>When a DC fails, you remove the DNS entries which pointed to that datacenter's IPs, and lookups start returning only the known good ones. Clients which already have your multiple A records can detect the failure and fail over immediately. Where client software doesn't support that, they have to wait until DNS caching expires to get the new records.<p>The datacenters themselves need to contain enough of your infrastructure to function autonomously, but also should share state. Cassandra, Oracle, Riak MDC... there are lots of options out there. We were on MySQL at the time, and maintained a slave in the secondary DC which could be promoted in the event that the primary DC was, say, nuked from orbit. This system was <i>not</i> partition-tolerant; if the mysql link between datacenters failed, one DC would become functionally read-only. We proxied DB traffic back and forth over SSH tunnels managed by upstart init jobs. This was shockingly reliable. We actually started off using mysql's SSL support but as it turns out mysql <i>will</i> segfault if it gets more than, say, 8 ssl connections in a short timeframe. So we tunneled everything--redis, mysql, stats, over SSH.<p>The rest of the infrastructure had little shared state, so we ran the typical web stack: two identical boxes running nginx (static content) -> haproxy (load balancing) -> rails and ramaze apps spread across various boxes. Each nginx forwarded to both haproxies, both haproxies forwarded to all the app servers, so you could lose either machine in a given DC and service would keep running. We used heartbeat to manage a shared virtual IP interface between the two forwarding boxes, so you'd drop TCP conns but failover switch time was generally in the tens of milliseconds--however long it took to ifup and gratuitous-arp the rack's L3 switch.<p>We ran memcache independently in both DCs--since user sessions almost never switched between DCs it was OK for us to just have two distinct pools. Queues were split up as well. Some services weren't critical enough to split across DCs so we just accepted that if the primary DC died they'd be down for a few hours, until we could deploy another copy on the backup DC. Non-critical things like statistics, garbage collection, etc. Automated deployment made that a lot less painful.<p>I wouldn't recommend doing this at an early stage--dual environments, especially on different hardware, takes a lot of testing to get right. You have to worry about doing everything twice--two DNS zones, two Redis clusters, etc. You also have to worry about asymmetries if you're doing master-slave replication. All of this comes with operational and development overhead; your app needs to be aware that might might running in a partitioned state, that writes might take much longer than reads if you're doing master->slave across DCs, etc. I'm a strong believer in <i>planning</i> for that stage of your growth--but you always have to strike a balance between the ultimate reliable configuration and getting other things done.<p>Does that help answer your question? :)",1329373298.0
