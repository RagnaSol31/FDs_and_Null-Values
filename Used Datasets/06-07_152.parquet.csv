He was one of the early developers at Onfolio, a startup and product that Microsoft acquired and out of whose ashes Writer arose. IIRC Brian was long gone by the time we started working on Writer, but plenty of his code ended up shipping in it.<p>I imagine there must have been scores of more colorful comments by Brian and others that got scrubbed before the open source release.",1449814703.0

Granted the founder role may come with different class of shares or bonuses which may be something to consider. But at the same time, those shares are probably worth minimum now and will be that way for an extended period of time or at least until fully vested. Either way, you are giving up immediate, guaranteed income to take a bet on the value of the company down the road. If you are not financially and mentally prepared to take that gamble I would not recommend doing it.<p>I am not sure I understand why a CTO role would be a 50% pay cut from your current role? It sounds like they are trying to pull a fast one on you hoping you like the title over the salary.",1449813755.0
