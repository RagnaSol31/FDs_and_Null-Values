But I DIDNT care! For the first time in my life I was doing something meaningful, to me and to society.<p>4. met tons of babes (locals, other asian babes, europeans, americans) by going out every single night for 1 year straight (averaging 4 5 clubs per nite). Plus did tons of traveling around asia, south america and north america. Trust me you are forced to socialize when EVERYONE at the hostel was happy go lucky young backpackers. And the bookstore also attracted lots of girls (which was NOT the reason why I opened the store :)<p>5.

58,2531603,comment,2530863.0,2531557.0,3,0,jsz0,,,The details are a bit murky at the moment but if Google is going to launch a music service that does not offer any method of purchasing or subscribing to music it will probably alienate a lot of users. Music sales may be down but they're not nonexistent. Lots of people don't pirate music for whatever reason. The whole experience will have to be pretty seamless in the way it scans and updates any music you bought from other services. For Google that's problem because you're probably buying that music from Amazon or Apple. Why not just use their cloud music services instead? It makes things a bit too complex. Amazon is in a better position but it'd be kind of shocking if the labels don't retaliate against them.

Those authors that need development very often turn out to be the most profitable in the end. They're also far more common than the ""home runs,"" meaning that by losing the ""home runs,"" the publishers are only losing a small fraction of profitable authors.</i><p>That's fine, because what I'm saying is that the home runs will get to market fast and cheap so they're a very big competitive threat. Add to that a bunch of small niche authors that also have incredibly small cost structures and the decade long lead-time bets the publishers are now making are much riskier.<p>><i>The growing diversity will impact the volume of mid-list authors far more than chart-toppers. I see no sign that the human propensity for mass trends is diminishing, and those mass trends (and the mega-influential opinion-shapers who drive them) are what carry the top-selling authors to the top and keep them there.</i><p>I agree with this completely. I didn't mean to say that chart-toppers will cease to exist. What will happen though is that some of them will be self-published and more importantly the mid-list will probably be taken over by self-publishers. So as a publisher your portfolio now has a higher percentage of decade-long bets and they have to pan out for you to stay in business.<p>><i>However, a great author who has to pay middle-men (because they helped him become great, amongst other reasons) will still be able to charge a high enough price to make orders of magnitude more than lesser authors who self-publish.</i><p>So we do agree that prices will be pushed down? Cause for a publishing house that's monumental, their margins are pretty low as it is. Can we at least agree that self-publishing is a long-term threat for publishing houses? You don't think it will wipe them out, I think that at least the existing ones will get replaced by new firms that understand the new dynamics better.",1305008687.0

Always remember Land is a best investment because it is a tangible asset. \nThe increase in prices comes with increasingly high rate of inflation and demand for construction of houses e.g. sweet homes. Sometimes it can be more valuable if something explores in it e.g. oil & gas or raw materials such as minerals, precious stones, coal etc.\nAlways all those lands are more worthy which lie in the path of rapidly developing areas. The very first step is to buy undeveloped piece of land which prices will rapidly increase as it lies in the path of urban growth in nearby future in any form of ready property. The basic purpose of land investment is to identify these hotspots in advance and wait for the right time so that its real value is initialized.",1305008570.0

This does not necessarily follow - it could very well be the case that it is the cause of disputes but that it is still often the best option.

If the artists are getting scraps and you are illegally copying their stuff and as a result, they lose contracts, it's hurting them in the process.""<p>More artists go with indie studios every year, and for the most part these studios have learned to use copying to their advantage instead of fighting it.<p>There's never been any definitive research that shows artists lose money from copying, even the big studio artists. The math isn't simple--even if you grant that fewer albums are purchased due to copying, a wider fan base could lead to higher concert and merchandise sales. Of course, this may also mean that copying can <i>increase</i> album sales if it boosts popularity enough through network effect. One copier who likes an album may tell 10 of his friends, 2 of whom buy the album; that is profit directly attributable to copying.<p>""With no IP laws, most big companies would either create very expensive software (so anyone that buys it would not be willing to share it) or they would all go to service based apps (this is already starting to happen).""<p>If this is really how it would play out, I don't see the problem.
