Which is why I was curious about the history of the convention since the probability distribution is nearly 100% skewed towards no-space.  :-)<p>To answer your second question, with English, it certainly bugs me.  With programming languages, I use the space but of course do not expect the same from anyone else.  No one so far has complained about me using it either.  :-)",1428041272.0
