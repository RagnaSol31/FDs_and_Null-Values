3,5388432,comment,5387504.0,5388269.0,12,0,rolleiflex,,,"I am Turkish, so I might be able to offer some commentary. What is said is essentially correct, but I'm more reluctant to assume this is the reason why. Turkey has a long way to go and many other problems to solve before it can become an EU member, and Europe has its own problems too. Cyprus is too unimportant for both sides to care about right now. When Turkey's time comes for the full membership and agreed by both parties and if the Cyprus remains the only roadblock, the heat from Turkey and EU can sink the entire island in one day so it is likely that they will cede. In the meanwhile, it's a convenient excuse. However the other issues facing EU membership of Turkey are pretty serious, so they'll be able to play this game for a while. The problem facing Turkey is, essentially, when or if the country joins the European Union, it's going to take around 1/4  of the chairs in the European Parliament (it's based on population, Turkey is about the same size as Germany population-wise), effectively becoming an instant major player in EU decisions alongside UK, France and Germany. This upends the power balance in Brussels. While on paper Turkey looks like an another regular Eastern European acquisition for EU, it is in effect a larger process than the entire history of acquisitions combined because of political, cultural and populace implications.<p>Even then, Turkish population has largely soured by the 30-year-long waiting at the gates game, and they are not as likely to accept then shown the financial implications of an EU membership. Considering Turkey has largely been impervious to financial perils of the EU (chugging along with a fine 5% growth rate through it all) and also considering GDP wise it is now one of the Top 20 economies in the world, with the second largest army of NATO after the United States, an EU membership, once a dream, is starting to look like not that good of a deal.<p>Turkey is essentially the thing that stands between perpetual war and dictatorships of Middle East and ""civilised"" Europe.",1363503488.0

9,5388426,story,,,2,2,persilj,Tell HN: Tone down praising of the RSS-aggregators,,"Last few months I've used Feedly almost daily as the experience has been generally good, but this morning I decided to try other RSS-aggregators like Google Currents, News360, Flipboard, News Republic etc. (on my Android tablet). I felt that I was missing something and I realized that it was the mood that gets generated, while you browse the actual websites or when you are using an official -- well made -- mobile application for some website (like USA Today).<p>I'm quite sure that I can separate, if I'm reading Ars Technica or ReadWrite, even when not explicitely being told so, but while reading textual content of an article (with a possibility of seeing a photo, if it was included in the RSS-feed) different sources don't _feel_ different.<p>When I see the name of a source like ""TechCrunch"" I become aware of the attributes I've attached to it in my mind and thus I partially know what to expect from it. However, that is not enough to separate jokes made by Business Insider's article writers from TechCrunch's article writers. My mind wants more hints about the context (sensory cues, usually visual).<p>I'm not very keen to install tens and tens of different applications just to ""be more in it"", but I don't like vanilla RSS-feeds either (even with special effects).<p>It is virtually impossible to not ruin the experience of using a RSS-aggregator, if the subscribed feed doesn't contain any photos. I just subscribed to Phys.Org's RSS-feed through Google Currents and it was horribly boring to read the text snippets (full articles available on the actual website only).",1363503349.0

(Other common example: ""Your mouth is writing checks that your body can't cash"", which I think means you've been challenging people but you don't have the matching physical prowess to win such a challenge.)<p>If the product is trying to cash the check, then the hype wrote it out to the product. It's not clear to me why it did that. If the check bounces, it's because the hype doesn't have any money in its account. But assuming that money is figurative for some kind of value (e.g. ability to live up to the hype), it's the product who should have the empty bank account, not the hype. Why is the product solvant in this story - isn't the point that it isn't? And the transaction is entirely between the hype and the product, and thus doesn't really concern anyone else, which seems to defeat the point. I feel like the story should be that hype wrote a check on behalf of the product that <i>the consumer</i> can't cash.

86,5388347,story,,,1,4,tempestn,Ask HN: Which free RSS reader to recommend to our inexperienced users... on IE?,,"I run www.searchtempest.com, a niche search engine for classifieds sites like craigslist (no affiliation).  One of our features is to provide an OPML file of the craigslist RSS results feeds for the user's search from all cities within a specified range.<p>This can be extremely convenient for people looking for a rare item and willing to travel to get it when it comes up.  You can stick it into a folder in your RSS reader, and have your own personalized feed of new results matching your search.  However, our user base is representative of the general population.  In other words, many of them do not yet use RSS.  Some are quite technically savvy, but many are not, and many use IE.<p>Thus far, we have been recommending Google Reader to those unfamiliar with RSS, for obvious reasons.  We've written detailed step-by-step instructions[1] for importing and organizing the feeds in GR.<p>As you <i>may</i> have heard, Google Reader will be discontinued soon.  So we need an alternative.  I would love to recommend Newsblur, but the fact is that most of our users won't be willing to explore a paid service, and in almost all cases, the free limit of 10 sites will be exceeded.  (Personally I think Newsblur is worth its price many times over, but that's irrelevant.)  I would also recommend Feedly in an instant, except... IE.  Tried TheOldReader, but found filtering and sorting large numbers of feeds into folders to be quite a pain.  Also slow, although that may well be temporary.<p>So... what do we recommend?  Above all, it needs to be simple.  If it's a great reader in general, all the better, but the main criterion is that we can get someone from zero to viewing their craigslist results in as few simple steps as possible.  And it needs to be free, and needs to work in IE.<p>[1] http://tinyurl.com/atrdqyt",1363500938.0

Most people probably don't know about the idea of General Delivery[1], but if you're going to be without a fixed address for 6 months and passing through a bunch of tiny towns that don't have a Fedex or UPS store, you quickly learn 1) How awesome it is that most towns in the country have a post office, and 2) That USPS Priority Mail is both inexpensive and reliable.<p>The idea of General Delivery is that instead of having an address in the second line, you write ""General Delivery"", and fill in the third line as usual.  The main post office in the area holds the mail for 30 days after receiving it.  In a small town there's only one post office, and that's the one you go to to collect it.  In conjunction with Priority Mail packages, this is an awfully convenient way to get resupplied with things you can't find in small towns when you're traveling through.<p>I've done mail drops on the Appalachian Trail using Priority Mail, and while it would be possible to do a thru-hike without mail drops, you'd have much more limited food options.  If you had any kind of non-standard dietary requirements, you'd be hard pressed to meet them in most of the towns along the trail.<p>The AT is unusual in that there are hostels and outfitters along the way that will receive and hold packages on the behalf of hikers, and they're well publicized in the guidebooks.  I've also bicycle toured through the US, and being able to pick nearly any town, confirm that it had a post office, and pick something up there 3-4 days later greatly eases getting stuff to you.  I couldn't get a replacement derailleur hanger before I left, and wanted a spare (because a hanger is usually specific to a manufacturer, or even a frame), and I picked it up somewhere in Montana after my local bike shop was finally able to get one in.<p>By the end of the trip I had used up a set of bottom bracket bearings (the ones that make the pedals go around smoothly), and if I hadn't been ending the trip, I would have needed a new set.  Since mine were pretty uncommon at the time (external BB in 2006), I would have had a hard time getting replacements from a random bike shop, and I would have relied on General Delivery to get a set from either the manufacturer or a higher-end bike shop.<p>It's probably easy to underestimate the reliability, efficiency, and convenience of the Post Office.  Most people will probably never be in a town of 70 people [2] that doesn't have any sort of store but does have a post office, and if they do they probably won't be there without a car.  Those of us who have been know that the ability to get a box sent there from the other side of the country in a couple of days is nothing short of miraculous.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.usps.com/manage/forward-mail.htm",
