1,1590709,comment,1590503.0,1590644.0,0,0,andymorris,,,"What about the everyday meaning of ""proof"" and ""irrevocable proof"" as ""strong evidence"" and ""stronger evidence"" respectively?<p>If I saw someone leaving the house of a woman (not his wife) with lipstick on his face and messed up clothes, I think I'm justified in calling that proof of an affair. It's not ""irrevocable proof"" though.<p>""Irrevocable proof"" would then be actually seeing him in the act. Logically, though, it's not - maybe I was hallucinating? Maybe he has a twin? Etc. - the point is, language is rarely definite in everyday use.<p>I got tripped up on a few of these as well. I said that evolution is correct despite not being fully ""proven"", yet it was foolish to believe in God without irrevocable proof of his existence. My intent was to say that believing in a God would require a huge amount of proof, not that it could be ""proven absolutely"", whatever that means. The game decided that I was arguing that God needed to be literally proven in order to prefer the God theory.<p>I don't even know what would constitute ""irrevocable proof"" in any area bar ""I think therefore I am"" - and I believe even that has been shown to not necessarily hold!<p>--\nAyjay on Fedang/philosophy",1281423530.0

Formal education and intellectual training are not the same thing.<p>Very few people have the inclination or desire to accomplish intellectual greatness, though, and that's enough to keep most people out regardless of ability. When you only look at people who have that inclination and desire, many people openly admit to lacking ability compared to others.<p>The idea that all humans have the same potential to do <i>anything</i> is, frankly, something people tell their children as an encouragement to work hard, but is not really true, or honestly believed by adults. Not everyone is talented enough to be a professional athlete or a tenured physicist. Everyone who's tried to teach has noticed that some people pick things up better than others. I'm not talking about the people who aren't interested or don't care or don't work hard enough--even among the motivated students, some do better than others. And no matter how hard you work to pick up the people who are behind, they can't quite catch up.

I previously responded that it is ok to believe something spiritually based on a firm inner conviction, without external evidence.  It then posed that a person raped someone because an inner voice told them it was ok.  I responded that this was not ok.  It said that I had now some logical conflict.  This is not the case.  I said it was ok to believe in something without external evidence, I did not say it was ok to act on those beliefs without external evidence.  Huge massive difference here.<p>Logical Fail Here:\n""Earlier you said that it is justifiable to base one's beliefs about the external world on a firm, inner conviction, regardless of the external evidence, or lack of it, for the truth or falsity of this conviction. But now you do not accept that the rapist Peter Sutcliffe was justified in doing just that. The example of the rapist has exposed that you do not in fact agree that any belief is justified just because one is convinced of its truth. So you need to revise your opinion here.

No socialised healthcare, no government-subsidised education, a pitiful two weeks of paid vacation at best, joke unemployment benefits, etc.<p>I'm not necessarily arguing that any of that should be the government's job or that all aspects of it are fundamentally fiscally sustainable.  I'm just pointing out that you get quite a bit less for your money;  an alarming preponderance of your income tax goes to prosecuting pointless wars, Wall Street bailouts, and other suitably kleptocratic endeavours.  Local and state government operations are substantially funded by sales taxes, property taxes, excise taxes, and other taxes not even accounted for by your 45% figure;  the income taxes do not yield many practical, down-on-the-ground results apart from the relatively small portion of the federal budget that goes to state-bound block grants.",1281422775.0

It is a well-established fact that schooling is not just correlated with IQ, but actually causes an increase (Husén & Tuijnman 1991).<p>> A person from 2000 years ago has the same potential to get a phd as anybody as in our time.<p>...and you ignore my environmental arguments entirely.<p>And yes, I've read Hamming's lecture several times. Hamming was a great scientist. However, he was both not a social scientist, and he was addressing a room full of scientists at Bell Labs, one of the most effective research institutes in the 20th century. No one mentioned IQ because everyone there already had all the IQ they needed! Bell Labs was one of the brainiest places around! It was on par with MIT, where even the secretaries used and programmed early Emacs!<p>It'd be like discussing how to become a great programmer, and mentioning that you need to be alive. It's a prerequisite that's already met; discussing it is an utter waste of time and balmy.<p>Nowhere does Hamming say, 'and btw it doesn't matter if you score a 60 on an IQ test and can barely dress yourself in the morning, you just need to follow my suggestions and you have a shot at the Nobel!' Because that would be idiotic. Rather, Hamming at the very beginning states:<p>> ""I saw quite a few very capable people. I became very interested in the difference between those who do and those who might have done.""<p>He <i>assumes</i> from the beginning that he is discussing 'very capable' people and why some accomplish great things and some don't.<p>> Go on believing that only a selected few chosen by God were given the gift of being smart.<p>Hey, why give up?

You want to talk about regressive taxes, tell me why I have to pay nearly $2k to employ a part-time person who nets just a little shy of ~$1400 (roughly ~$22k annual gross), and that's without any benefits.

This doesn't disprove my claim.<p>Edit: Also, it seems that you are implying that the differences are so huge that we should have a lot of retarded people walking around us. The proof that the gaps in intelligence are small should be obvious by simply looking at your environment. There are people getting phd's from all corners of the world. China, Japan, USA, Mexico, Europe, Africa, Australia. How did those same genes that enable people to get phd's get to places so far away as China or Japan which have been isolated for so long? Even for thousands of years? The thing is that those genes have been there all along for thousands of years.<p>I think I already agree that there are differences but I do not agree that the differences are huge. Otherwise some of these groups of people, like china or japan who have been isolated for thousands of years, would have serious intelligence differences as the rest of us.<p>Another example is the Mayans, also isolated for thousands of years from Europe. Independently invented the zero and developed a Mayan calendar unequal on precision until recently. Many of their descendants have gone on to get PHD's. If there were really large differences then some groups of people would not even be able to get PHD's.<p>Again, the there are differences but they are tiny.

Part of the problem is that we tell everyone that they're going to have a wonderful career when that is plainly not an option for every school leaver.  What should be taught is self reliance and basic financial literacy and let people make their own decisions from there.<p>As for that unemployed capital - there's plenty of scope to put it to work, but the regulatory environment closes off a lot of options, minimum wages being just one of the factors.

I will even agree that there may be outliers, a super tiny amount of the population (although I've never met one, and some that are considered true geniuses have some serious mental deficiencies). Overall the differences when it comes to the general population are too small to be that much significant. The people getting phd degrees have in general the same degree of potential learning ability as the general population.<p>If there were really that big of a difference between their potential ability to learn as opposed to the general population than they would be passing this down to their kids. Since you claim that the difference is so large than with careful breeding we should be able to produce a super race of geniuses within a couple of generations.  That is not how evolution works.<p>Improvements are infinitesimally small and I don't see why would intelligence be any different. We all evolve as a species, not as individuals. I do not get the sense that we have been getting that much smarter based on our overall written history of the past thousand years.<p>The reason why some choose to pursue a phd and some don't is the same as why some choose to pursue a career as a painter, musician, writer and why some just choose to be a blue collar worker.
