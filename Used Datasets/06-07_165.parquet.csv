I would think that that seems like (and IMO is) a good idea. Here, the problem is how do I do this rather than should I do this.</i><p>The problem truly is, ""How do I do this <i>profitably</i>?"" Sure, lots of problems are hard. But there aren't very many hard problems that are also profitable. In my opinion, that's the greatest difficulty with a startup. It's not convincing investors that the problem is difficult. It's convincing investors that people are willing to pay for the solution.<p><i>A historic example rather than a theoretical one could be Googles' basic concept of page-rank. It seems like a good idea (this is not just hindsight, IIRC there are even stories about Larry Paige explaining the concept at the time and people thinking that it was genius). Just, how many people at that time thought of it? Even if people did think of it, it still is a technically difficult algorithm when you take into account the sheer amount of data that it must process. So again, the problem is not should I, but rather, how do I.</i><p>Again, you're misunderstanding the problem. Yes, PageRank was an ""obviously good"" algorithm. Heck pg himself thought of something very similar while he was at Yahoo. But you have to also remember that, at the time, web search was considered a ""dead"" field. Everyone thought that the future was manually created indexes and portals (like Yahoo) rather than in search. Google's real accomplishment was, IMHO, showing that web search could be profitable. Yes, they couldn't have done it without PageRank, but the new algorithm was only a necessary factor, not a sufficient one.",1348469983.0

There is so much supply that is completely held off the market for decades because of this law. I'm a renter and have lived in SF for over 12 years and I can tell you that this law, along with Prop 13, needs to go away. It's completely constraining supply as there are tons of $700/month 2bdrm apartments in this city and many of them get handed down (I almost got one myself). If rents floated freely, like property taxes should too.. sure prices would go up for a bit but there'd be a normal balance of supply and demand and prices would likely be lower than they are today because now there isn't a small subset of people subsidizing the majority of rent controlled apartment dwellers... and yes I live in a rent controlled 1bdrm in Russian Hill that's $1,600 including parking.",1348469333.0

In particular, American culture appears to approach diet most scientifically, yet has probably the least healthy population. Meanwhile, many illiterate cultures appear to have healthy diets (implying thousands of years of trial and error, admittedly a form of science, works).<p>My observations are anecdotal, not data, so feel free to dismiss them as such. I just suggest all scientific results so far, compared to what we'd need to meaningfully predict healthiness in a diet, negligibly less anecdotal.<p>The body is incredibly complex and diet involves multiple internal systems -- digestive, motivational, cardio-vascular, etc -- interacting with huge varieties of foods -- themselves sets of incredibly complex systems. Looking at parts of these systems doesn't seem effective in helping people get healthy, at least not at the level science is at today.<p>Generations from now science may be able to grasp this complexity and predict healthy diets at the individual level.

Most stores that sell soda are set up for the consumer to take the soda from the front of a long row, and then the row slides up in the display. I'd guess that some customers would create a mess trying to find their name and not bother to clean it up (if they can - many soda refrigerators can only be easily loaded from the back).<p>If my speculation is true, that probably gives store owners an incentive to de-emphasize the placement of the Coke so that random browsers will be less likely to create a huge mess.

San Francisco is a postage stamp of a city.  It's not as if there are vast tracts of persistently unbuilt land, or apartments sitting vacant for months (indeed, there are usually bidding wars and half-hour showings of new rentals).  And new construction (since it isn't covered by rent control), tends to cost more per square foot than the older stuff.  All evidence suggests that rent control <i>caps</i> prices in the city.<p>You can argue that without rent control, landlords would be free to expel the fabled rent-controlled ""freeloaders"" who have been living in Pac Heights apartments since 1953.  Okay.  So rent on those units goes up to market rate, the supply of market-rate housing goes up by a few units, and an equal number of tenants are now homeless, competing for market-rate housing.  Not a recipe for lower rents.<p>Another argument is that rent control reduces the economic incentives for landlords to build new units.  That's fine, except again, new construction isn't covered by rent control laws.  So it's actually in a landlord's <i>interest</i> to rebuild.  And it happens -- right now, there are a number of projects underway all over the city.<p>I don't think rent control has much to do with the rents here.  The city is 47 miles square, and is the second most densely populated city in the US.  Meanwhile, 3/4 of the land area is plastered with low-density bungalows and low-rise apartment buildings -- and that's never going to change.  San Francisco is zoned like a beachside village.  It's the source of the city's charm, and the reason that it will never have the high-density housing that might actually lower rents.  Rent control is probably incidental.",1348467733.0
