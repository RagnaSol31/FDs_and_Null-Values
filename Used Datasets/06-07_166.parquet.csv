I say everything here without knowing you, your wife or your idea.<p>First off, make sure that you read this article and follow it unless you have a good reason not to:<p><a href=""http://startuplawyer.com/startup-issues/if-i-launched-a-startup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startuplawyer.com/startup-issues/if-i-launched-a-star...</a><p>Specifically, both you and your wife should have vesting shares. After all, there's a reason that most people do not start up with their loved ones - they say that the best family business is a sole proprietorship. This isn't a corner store and you and your wife might find your marriage taxed by this radical twist on your relationship.<p>Would you start up with your wife if you weren't married? If not, then my polite suggestion is that you hire your wife and give her lots of equity for her contributions. Taking on a business partner is an incredibly important decision, and if you wouldn't hire her otherwise then it's a potentially questionable decision now. I wouldn't belabour this point but you didn't explain her background.<p>The other thing is that it pays to startup with a good idea. I'm a big believer in MVPs and pivoting and trying things until it works... but the fact remains that most ideas are terrible and it's hard to tell when one of your ideas is terrible. Most people around you are inclined to tell you how great an idea it is, because they can see in your eyes that you want them to love it. This is an extremely dangerous confirmation bias because you can and will waste your valuable energy and enthusiasm.<p>In short: seek people that you can trust to give you honest feedback on your ideas. Steve Blank's 4 Steps to the Epiphany is worth the kudos it receives. And most important of all: make sure all founders have vesting shares.",1296284146.0

11,2154920,comment,2154106.0,2154106.0,0,0,mtr,,,"1. It makes more sense to value your company on the profit as opposed to revenue, and throw in some expected growth for good measure.  For example, would you rather buy Ford with $132B in revenue, or the Google with $28B in revenue?  The market cap of Google is 3 times that of Ford $197B vs $65B.  Or Yahoo (revenue $6.5B, market cap $20B) vs Google ($28B, $197B).  Google's revenue is <5 times that of Yahoo, but it's market cap is 10x.\n2. Why do you judge the offer to be low by 20%.  Is it 20% lower than what someone else would likely pay, 20% too low based on your expectations.  If you can get a better deal somewhere else, why would you accept this one?\n3.

Amount of computations and bandwidth required -- simply because of the amount of information involved, which is much more than stereoscopic 3D.<p>2.  A moving display technology that can display these computed holograms.  My understanding is that the display needs of the order of one to ten giga-pixels or more to be useful to a non-technical end customer.  A common approach then is to tile a large number of displays in cost-no-bar systems.<p>In this work, they seem to be using an ordinary display to render the holograms, which is why the rendered image is nowhere close to the source content.<p>Achieving 15 frames per second using a GPU for hologram computation is an advance but does not seem to be extra-ordinary to me, and nor a significant breakthrough.

Now, a cool piece of interactive art one day, a <i>great</i> 24-hour deal the next, followed by a free album/song download from a few artists, with a clever game the next day... these are some of the kinds of things that may give you traction.  It's got to be ""wow this site has cool stuff everyday"" not ""let's see what ad is up there today"".<p>It's a chicken/egg horse/cart problem, but you're probably putting the cart before the horse if you're thinking monetization and advertising right away.  I'd think of it more like ""send in your cool stuff and we'll pick the best to display for 24 hours"" and see if that works.<p>Again, great idea, but you <i>have</i> to prime the pump!",1296282814.0
