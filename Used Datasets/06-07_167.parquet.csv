Hope it works out well for you.<p>But, just to chip in:<p>1) Does your target market know that a Google Account is, effectively, a Gmail address?

But when I hit the FAQs, I see:<p>> Do you support any payment methods/services other than PayPal?\n> Not at this time. Maybe Google Checkout if there is demand.<p>Maybe it's just me in my nerddom, but ""just log in with your Google account"" combined with ""no credit card required"" made me expect Google Checkout to be the default payment method, or at the very least supported.<p>May be worth adding a nod to Paypal somewhere earlier on, or an FAQ towards the top of the list explaining what payment methods <i>are</i> supported (and why the customer should be happy about them/it, etc, etc).

I don't think that a group of people that pg would be likely to pick would  a) upvote all the same things, or b) downvote posts they disagree with.  As the supervoter bit would be passed to people who voted in generally the same way as a reasonable number of the superusers, it would be unlikely that people who downvoted out of disagreement would get the bit.

Gates seems to be saying that there isn't a big difference between being worth 60 million and being worth 60 billion, because hamburgers taste the same, after all. That's all well and good if wealth is all about buying things, which it basically is for about 99,999 out of 100,000 people at least, but for that one person it definitely isn't. Someone worth 60 billion is at least 1000x more powerful and has 1000x greater impact in how he goes about wielding his power than the person worth 60 million. He is in many respects equivalent to 1000 people worth 60 million each, doing their thing, and perhaps more so since he can more easily strive toward a purpose or calling in a way that 1000 people couldn't, with committees and whatever else. So he's completely wrong about that (although he's the billionaire and I'm certainly not, so perhaps I should just defer to his judgment :-)<p>Which sort of brings up the other thing he said, which is that absolute poverty relative to historical values is decreasing, especially in the developing world at the moment, and that there are a few very rich and well-connected individuals isn't such a problem, to the extent that they don't corrupt the political system. But of course they <i>do</i> corrupt the political system. The entire problem with massively unequal distribution of wealth isn't that you get to live in a nice house on the water while for whatever reason someone else has to live in a one-room flat. It is decidedly <i>not</i> about jealousy and envy. This is what critics of the OWS movement do not seem to understand. We're trying to have a democracy, so have all the wealth that you want, but if your wealth begins to subvert that democracy, well then we have to do something about that.<p>I'm sure he gets this based on things he's said in other talks, and he's an honest enough guy I think (now, anyway), so maybe he just wanted to avoid making a complicated, and currently rather politically charged, point.",1319783260.0

78,3167238,comment,3165299.0,3165918.0,4,0,kb101,,,"With all due respect, ""worth more separate"" is a destructive business philosophy.  Unless your line of business is buying up other companies, building up value, and spinning them off.<p>Be that as it may, the differences between IBM and HP are stark in this instance.  I-B-M: it stands for International Business Machines.  Services to industry are their roots, and those roots run deep.  Whether in the form of census punchcards in the 1890s, or ballistics calculations for the military, or the creation of the SABRE booking system, or the creation of relational databases... the list goes on and on and on, but the point is that IBM has never strayed from its roots.  It is a business services company.<p>Upon hitting a rough patch in the early nineties, IBM took radical steps to revive its profits; one of these steps was the introduction and promotion of the business-oriented Thinkpad brand, which was a huge success and helped bring the firm back to health.  But that did not make IBM into a PC company any more than the success of the XBox makes Microsoft a gaming company.<p>After nurturing the brand and working gradually over time with a Chinese supplier to offshore production, the last step (at that point almost a formality) was taken and the brand ""Thinkpad"" was transitioned to Lenovo ownership.  IBM continues to be a company providing services to government and industry, as it has since its founding.<p>HP, on the other hand, is a company whose roots are in technical instrumentation and excellence in test equipment.  Over time, this resulted in innovations such as the HP 9100A, the familiar tried-and-true HP calculator line, its superb printers, and so on... all outgrowths of HP's core roots in engineering and instrumentation.<p>The spinoff of Agilent was like HP cutting off its right arm.  To add insult to injury, the company was forced to digest the Compaq acquisition at the same time.  Still, the core mission of creating excellent electronic machines survived and HP is in a dominant position when it comes to providing reliable hardware in the form of computers, servers, printers from laserjets to industrial presses, networking, etc.<p><i>With that as a basis</i>, the move into consulting services and enterprise software makes sense, but a move as unforgivably idiotic as removing the PC business would cut the very legs out from under the business, regardless of what some P/E number on a spreadsheet says.  Why would an enterprise come to HP for consulting when it cannot provide a package of desktops, servers, and software?  That is HP's mission as it is configured now, with Agilent gone its separate way.  It makes sense to push aggressively into new territory, but not to destroy the foundation of the business at the same time.<p>Apotheker brought no innovative thinking to HP; he merely sought to remake the company in his image and transform it into the SAP that not even SAP would let him create.  Whether or not that vision, taken in the abstract, is one worth pursuing is debatable to begin with-- but hacking HP into bits to force it to fit that vision is madness, and the plummeting stock price that you seem to measure value by reflected the market's view of this insanity.<p>Why is there any need to ""bleed heavily""?  The PC division is the foundation of the entire edifice.  It may not be sexy and it may not fit your metrics-based notion of company value, but it holds up the business and it is <i>number 1 in the world</i> and <i>profitable</i>.  That is a strength to leverage, not a ""drag"".<p>HP is finally in a position to do exactly what Meg Whitman said it needs to do today: focus on excellence. <a href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d6a4b220-00d8-11e1-930b-00144feabdc0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d6a4b220-00d8-11e1-930b-00144feabd...</a>",1319782951.0

The first is that anyone remains unconvinced that vinyl has <i>any redeeming technical aspects whatsoever,</i> other than the touchy-feely emotional stuff, and self-deception.<p>The second is that the music you referenced is so unashamedly <i>digital,</i> that the notion of purchasing it on a vinyl record is like buying a copy of Angry Birds printed on tree bark.<p>A 256 kbps AAC file (as sold by iTunes) is so very nearly transparent, only a small fraction of 1 percent of people would be able to identify the vanishingly minute differences. The difference is so small, it would be comprehensively outweighed by <i>meaningful</i> factors such as your choice of speakers, the shape of your room, and the presence of any ambient noise.<p>Whereas vinyl has crackle (unless you're playing a pristine copy in a dust-free environment), clicks, pops, rumble, wow distortion, and intentionally limited dynamic and tonal range. Fidelity progressively reduces as you move to the inner grooves, and high frequencies are literally scratched away as the stylus scrapes past -- every time you play a vinyl, it will sound poorer than the last. You can mitigate some of these problems, but generally at great effort or expense.<p>Of course, to make that music <i>useful</i>, you'll need to rip it back into your computer. You'd have to be <i>mentally ill</i> to believe that a [Lossless > AAC-256 > Lossless] conversion is more detrimental than [Lossless > equalisation > analogue mastering > lathe cutting > vinyl stamping > stylus scraping > pre-amplification > ADC > Lossless].",1319782324.0
