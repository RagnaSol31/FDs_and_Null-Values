What I like about him is that in his writings, he does not offer any solace. He does not promise that we will magically become satisfied with life and existence, rather he writes about the confusion between living and suicide, and interestingly, he argues that both choices are equally absurd. He does argue for morality. The reader is thrown into that dizzying choice where no option is preferential, so the choice to live is rather arbitrary. The realization that life is absurd freezes you for a moment. Though, since life is rather meaningless, I feel it also unchains a person from all those pressures and norms set by society, religion and family. The thought represents true freedom.<p>Camus also seems to be one of the philosophers who actually looked cool.",1376805690.0
