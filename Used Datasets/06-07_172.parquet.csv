The real hope is that this will be a replacement for the conductors in traditional silicon.  You still have the heat bottleneck when you hit a traditional conductor.  The dissipation free property breaks down at about 100C for this material, so you are going to have an issue with what ever is interacting with that 200A.\n[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.3008"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.3008</a>",1438668429.0
