1,2775376,comment,2774170.0,2775299.0,1,0,inoop,,,"Well you can run a VM in much smaller footprints. I can run Java on at Atmega128 for example, with multiple threads, GC, etc. Sun had a reduced JVM running on 2K MSPs (no GC, single-thread). It just depends on how much of the functionality you want, how much of a class library, and where you put the trade-off between speed and memory consumption.<p>As for features, the chip in the panda costs $13.44 in single quantities, and $8.13 in volume. An Atmega1281 costs $13.12 in single quantities, and $7.32 in volume. I can see how having a .NET runtime built into your chip with a class library to drive all your peripherals is worth a few extra cents.<p>> Normally I wouldn't care in the slightest what language you use, but I guess you could say I am nervous that interpreted languages would be favoured due to popularity and familiarity rather than sound design decisions, and rapidly take over the embedded market.<p>I'd say C is currently favored due to popularity and familiarity rather than sound design decisions. Either way, why would you be nervous about global trends? The embedded systems world is easy to predict, it's always 10-20 years behind the rest.

(This is perhaps a little bit less valuable at NYU, but the general principle still applies.)  Logically, therefore, if you want to maximize value as an MBA program, you should have your students party all day.  Which may not be all that far from the current truth.<p>The classroom aspects of the MBA have been uniformly criticized by the people I know that've gone through them, except for the few idiots who believe every business situation is like a case study and then run their businesses into the ground basing decisions on that.  Business is just too complex to reduce to classroom principles.  I think Marc Andreesen once wrote on his blog that at the time the executive makes the decision that an HBS case study will eventually be based upon, he has less than 10% of the information that the students who will eventually be critiquing him have.",1310972264.0
5,2775372,comment,2773514.0,2774344.0,2,0,hristov,,,"Sorry but you are not exploring anything. You are just experiencing hallucinations, paranoias and what have you due to the drugs changing the chemical composition of your brain. That's it, nothing more.<p>There may be more to the world that meets the eye. You may be right about that. I personally believe in God, so I do believe there is more to the world that meets the eye. But the implied message of your post, that we can reach that world by taking drugs makes nosense. Why would drugs make you capable of perceiving something that you are unable to perceive otherwise. You still have the same physical brain and sensing organs. Drugs are just a physical thing acting chemically on the same physical brain and the same physical eyes and ears. Why would drugs make your physical eyes and ears perceive the metaphisical all of sudden? It makes no sense. I mean I would understand if drugs made your hearing or eyesight better, or if they made you see things in wavelengths not visible when you are not on drugs. But to make you see something that cannot be detected on any wavelength even with the best instruments? Why? It makes no sense.<p>And if you believe in God, as I do, why in the world would God choose to reveal himself to only those that take illegal, dangerous and usually expensive drugs? Does God only like the idle rich? Nope that makes no sense either.<p>So, sorry again, but you are living a dangerous fantasy. What you are exploring with hallucinogens are just hallucinations somehow created in the pathways of your brain as a result of the chemical disruptions caused by the drugs. Nothing more. Nothing that actually exists in any way. And as the drugs damage your brain, your hallucinations will get darker and more paranoid and if you do not stop you may go mad.<p>About people telling other people what to do, I do not know about that. If you see a thousand people lose their minds doing LSD and become sad wrecks that can barely do anything with their lives between the acid flashbacks, wouldn't you want to stop number 1001?",1310972253.0

The point is that a professor is supposed to help his/her students when they have questions.  If they don't do this, they increase the probability of cheating occurring.

For students who want to talk about the cheating, just say, ""If you really believe you did not cheat, we can discuss the evidence. But that will only happen at an academic integrity board hearing.

91,2775285,story,,,2,2,10kwtoti,Show HN: My weekend project for tracking the top trends in news,,"My main goal: Scan one page to keep up with the most significant news of the last 24 hours. No logging in or customizing or voting or discussion. Just show me the (hyperlinked) headlines.<p>My other goal: Do it for free. Get it working in 48 hours.<p>How it works: The source websites are determined by a combination of backlinks/facebook and twitter activity/technorati. The source websites for each category can dynamically change overtime. There can be anywhere from 2-3 or 7-8 (for example) for each category at any given time. I did blacklist some urls manually. Once the sources are determined, various APIs find the hottest urls from each domain. If a particular url is older than 24 hours, it is eliminated. However, the same link can stay on the page and move up or down throughout the day depending upon the level of activity it is receiving.<p>The results are output to JSON and then converted to XML. An RSS feed is then burned by FeedBurner, and the content is displayed by BuzzBoost as HTML on a free Blogger blog. FeedBurner usually crawls the feed every thirty minutes or so, and fresh news is always shown. The higher up it is, the more significant.<p>The way that this is setup insures that I'm always well below the API rate limits. Everything is always cached for about thirty minutes.<p>Did it work out?: I'd say yes. It has its kinks like showing a duplicate url occasionally. The algorithm for choosing the sources will also be continually improved as I observe the quality overtime. Overall, though, it gives every major story that one would need to know about that day. Not all of it is necessarily ""news"". But if there is big news, it will be there. And it was free to build, except for the domain name that I didn't need to use.<p>Possible bonus tip: I've been a lurker here on HN for years now, and see Adsense discussion pop-up occasionally. Through my years of testing, I've determined that the ad layout on this site is among one of the best performers for most types of sites.<p>Link: http://www.neondex.com/p/news.html<p>P.S.
