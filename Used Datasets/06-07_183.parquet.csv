If 10% of the image have that color (for example white, in a logo) you could leave the class or id out of the table for these pixels.<p>- if two or more columns have the same color in a row, one could add a colspan. Since the word is rather long, it makes only sense from 2 columns onward, I guess, but if, say, the first 100 pixels of the image portrait a white line, instead of having 100 x '<td id='ff'></td>' you'd have <td id='ff' colspan=100></td'.<p>- The same could be done with column for colspan, albeit a bit more difficult.<p>- If there're certain pixel color patterns that appear throughout the image (say a white pixel next to a black pixel) one could create a css .before and .after rule for these, that defines the pattern for one td, making the 2. unnecessary.<p>There's probably more.",1346137037.0

They end up like the ""toys"" that come in cereal boxes: junk you throw out every Spring.  And something as personal as a case is something stylish people would rather pick out themselves.<p>Firstly, we're basically talking about the mission statement of the retail stores.  It was originally to provide a great experience.  Now it is maximize profit.  This is definitely a big deal.  No longer giving away junk was not a change of Apple's mission statement.<p>What does that mission statement mean to the customer?  Well... I would lean towards believing many customers are loyal to Apple due to quality.  It is logical to think Apple believe[s,d] in quality because it lends to customer satisfaction, which lends to brand loyalty.  If customer satisfaction is no longer their driving motivation... does that mean Apple has killed the very reason their customers are loyal to them? Those ""goodies"" probably were never considered the very reason Apple has brand loyalty.  If it was, Apple was able to change that reason to a new reason (quality).<p>Secondly, how much a customer can trust the word of a salesman is often determined by whether the salesman is commission or not... there's a reason people pay attention to it.  This is far larger than no longer giving away items which were never used & thrown away.  Although the employee don't seem to be paid via commission now, they basically still are (points tallied on how many high profit items are sold).",1346136946.0

Ive realized though that this is not what I want to do.

Im hoping that the move will push me even harder to make this transition work.<p>Currently, I have a basic skill level in some common web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, and Python. I am also familiar with jQuery and JSON. I am a very hard worker and looking to build on what I know.<p>If anyone needs an intern or junior web developer, please let me know!

10,4442464,comment,4438894.0,4438894.0,1,0,edanm,,,"This simple issue shows the big, huge, <i>gaping</i> problem with the future of digital media.<p>In the past, the labls/publishers/whoever wanted to create content, be able to sell it, and have a monopoly on it. The way to do this was to sell physical instances of the creation, like books, DVDs, and CDs. This worked wonderfully, because it's simple for people to understand giving money over to receive a physical good, which you own, and which you can e.g. later sell, or transfer to your kids.<p>In short, the old way was: ""buying"" == ""getting a physical copy of the media"".<p>The problem is, since digital media arose, there has been a slow shift in the meaning of <i>buying</i> content.  The producers are acting like ""buying"" no longer means ""getting a physical copy of the media"". They're acting like it means ""having access to consume the media"". E.g., buying a song from Queen means I get to listen to the song. It has nothing to do with having the physical file.<p>In other words, the new model is: ""buying"" == ""getting the (legal) ability to consume the media"".<p>This is true in many ways, both good and bad for the consumer.<p>The good is that, e.g., when I buy an audiobook on Audible, the physical file is irrelevant. I can delete it, and download it again. It's my <i>ability</i> to get the book that they're selling. I can have many physical copies of the book, on my computer/iPhone/laptop/whatever, and they're fine with it. The bad is that a lot of the rules for physical media are no longer relevant - I can't sell it, I can't lend it, I can't let people inherit.<p>Actually, this doesn't bother me much. Because I don't think of owning an Audiobook in the same way I think of owning a physical book. My thoughts are ""I pay $10 to hear this book, once"". Of course, this says a lot about me, because I <i>don't</i> have this same thought about ebooks - I <i>do</i> equate them to physical books.<p>My prediction is that the world will be going in a direction in which physical ownership of digital media is irrelevant. This <i>has</i> to happen, because of the way digital media works. People will be buying the ""ability"" to listen to songs, not buying actual songs. Programs like Amazon's ""lend books"" will be seem very antiquated and irrelevant. Arguably, the way these will work is by buying subscriptions to services, i.e. $10 for all the music you can listen to ala Spotify. I think this is the only way the world can go which will make sense to consumers, although I fear for the publishers.",1346136905.0

This is much like the summer of 2007... the hints are there but it took a year before all hell broke loose (saw it in the dotcom bust as well. Same hints.)   No way to know how bad it will be or if it will be anything very startling, or just a couple years of lower growth.<p>But when this happens companies feel it early, and the good ones react, and this happens months if not a year before things start to show up in the popular press like they did in 2008.<p>On future products:\nOne thing intrinsic to apple's DNA is evolution.  This is a company that is not complacent.<p>It is also a company that doesn't broadcast its intentions or its moves or its plans.<p>This means that when it sees opportunity, it starts to make changes well in advance of when it will be able to capitalize on that opportunity.<p>The Apple Store itself is a good example of this:  One of the reasons the retail operation was created was to be able to eventually sell the iPhone and iPad directly to the public in a way that couldn't happen before.  Macs can be sold online, but the iPad and iPhone need to be seen to be understood.<p>Apple stores have always done very well on the metrics apple cares about, one of which is profit.

However when there is no inheritance specification, the indexes can't be maintained, I presume. The easy solution is that calls are resolved using some string fingerprint lookup but that would make such calls really slow (compared to the C++).<p>Then how do they do it?",1346135245.0

Murder, torture, slavery, etc. These have all been legal in some past (or present) context. The possibility that someone who is acknowledged as a decent person could be a ""criminal"" is no surprise to me, and I'd rather argue to that point than dismiss the whole argument.<p>And even if I support abortion rights, the act is technically killing.

Let's use the Adobe Flex Framework as an example. If you bought into Flex 5 years ago then you're probably starting to feel a bit nervous. The reasons being:<p><pre><code>  1. Adobe are themselves signaling that \n  HTML is the future by releasing HTML5 tools (Edge)\n  2. Adobe have abandoned mobile Flash development\n  3. Developer mind-share is firmly in the HTML camp.\n</code></pre>\nNow, if the full adobe/flash stack were open source and there were multiple companies working on it, it would be less of an issue as the technology you invested into would continue to be supported. The fact that you, personally are not working on the flash/flex core would be irrelevant, as is the case with HTML5 and the open web.<p><pre><code>  If you think a layout engine is complex enough that \n  need to be open sourced, you are doing it wrong.\n</code></pre>\nI'm at a loss trying to respond to this. If you think writing a layout engine from scratch is easy then you simply don't understand the problem very well. Even writing a good <i>text</i> layout engine is <i>very</i> hard to get right, and text layout is only a subset of the whole problem. Not only that, but layout is an orthogonal problem to the one you're trying to solve (unless you're writing a browser or word processor), so the time you sink into it is wasted.<p><pre><code>  native app development (Visual Studio, XCode) layouts are much \n  simpler and more powerful\n</code></pre>\nIt's simpler because the complexity is abstracted away from you by the IDE/tools. The actual (hidden) application logic driving the layouts is just as complex if not more so.<p><pre><code>  The problem with HTML and CSS is that they are either \n  document flow based or absolute position.\n</code></pre>\nAbsolutely agree with you here. The document paradigm has been abused horribly to allow for complex layout on the web, and its roots are painfully evident - it certainly wasn't meant for this type of work.<p><pre><code>  It's easier to do it right in native ways. There are much richer containers,\n  control groups and docking options.\n</code></pre>\nAgree here too. Having said that though there are great advances being made, the flexible box model being one of them.<p><pre><code>  Oh wow, Javascript for layout, right.\n</code></pre>\nThat's sarcasm not a rebuttal :)<p>Going back to the original point, I think that CSS for native layout may be an OK idea, CSS certainly has it share of strengths and weaknesses. One thing this approach has in its favor is a low barrier to entry for web developers which may help bridge the designer/developer divide.<p>It's been fun sparring with you :)<p>all the best,\neli",1346134081.0
