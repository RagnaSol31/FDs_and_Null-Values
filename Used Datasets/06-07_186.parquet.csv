37,8738828,comment,8736357.0,8738237.0,0,0,noamyoungerm,,,"You make several false assumptions or gross misunderstandings of how language changes.<p>The reason irregular verbs originally existed is because English is a Germanic language, meaning, that a thousand years ago, what we now call irregular verbs were actually regular verbs. There was a logical ordering and well understood way to modify the stem of a verb in order to agree with the subject and tense. At the time, irregular verbs changed their stem, but in a predictable and universal manner.<p>This all changed with the conquest of the Norman French. After the slow introduction of French and Latin into English, the verb forms we are now familiar with entered the language. In time, all verbs of Germanic origin were used the same way they had been used in Old English, while verbs brought in by the French used the forms we are familiar with today.<p>The reason it makes sense to see language regularization is because we have grown to expect the French form of verb agreement rather than the Germanic one. The Germanic system is more complex.<p>In short, the reason that &quot;new verbs formed [are]  never formed as irregular verbs ...&quot; makes sense, is that the change from irregular Germanic verbs to regular French verbs is only about 800 years old.",1418365792.0
