It doesn't matter what you use to do the viewing, the eye, a ccd, anything. The information is simply not there, no matter how you magnify it.<p>That limit is called the diffraction limit, and it's related to the size of the lens used to collect the light. It sort of has to do with the fact that photons passing near the edge of the lens get distorted.<p>Dawes number is simply a calculation of the diffraction limit.<p>So that ""small dot"" that is really a flag, no matter how well you magnify it, will just look like a blur. The photons that used to show details about it have been scrambled enough that those details are lost.<p>Regarding the two collectors.<p>They are talking about two small telescopes placed far apart. They compare the image collected by both telescopes and using that they are able to synthesize information about the object that is not visible using just one telescope. But it's no longer a matter of just looking at it.<p>I'm sorry that I don't understand it well enough to give a simpler explanation of how that works.<p>I don't know if you read lord of the rings, but there is a scene where Legolas looks at riders at a great distance and can see details that the humans can't. Supposedly because of his keen eyesight. But actually it's impossible. Assuming that his eyes were about the same size as human eyes, he simply can not see those details, no matter how good of a retina he had.

Come on now...<p>I've only worked on ~10 paid development gigs and one of the first ones was a pharma research company who hired my team to create an interface for a truckload of sensitive data after nothing more than a phone call and a quick NDA. This pattern has continued in a few subsequent projects, often with no NDA or contract whatsoever.<p>A great many companies stop caring about privacy the second they can make or save a few bucks, questionable legality or ethics notwithstanding one bit. Businesses in general are fortunate that MOST software engineers seem to be honest and good people, because they regularly hand over the keys to the castle, often without even realizing it or considering the potential implications at all, and to be honest I'm actually quite glad it works this way. For whatever reason, we as a profession have apparently been deemed highly trustworthy, and I much prefer this situation with all its risks to a world of bulletproof firewalls and bureaucratic red tape.",1295935395.0

Most of the time I spend in the gym is suffering and generally unpleasant</i><p>Really? For me the unpleasantness is a fraction of the total time I spend there (pretty much all concentrated in coming out of the hole on the last set), and there's a definite pleasant component as well (any time I do squats after being away for the gym for more than a few days, I come away bouncing up and down, I suddenly feel so good)",1295935383.0

The service is ""question  & answer"" site.I plan to implement mention features such as twitter.   The mention  is uses the real username ex: @username. But I also want to keep user to use real name as seen on  quora. While  to implement @mention features using real names like quora I think is very difficult, because we have to check the user's id or slug on the server first. Moreover, when applied in mobile application it will make application running slowly. Are there any suggestions what approach should I do?",1295935312.0
