And I'm really expecting things from them now that they got incubator funding through Mozilla WebFWD.<p>I think the fundamental reason HN/Proggit and co. reject XMPP is because it's XML. Which is a ridiculous reason. Real-time streams over encrypted TCP seems to be the right way to go over forcing a protocol not meant for constant communication (HTTP) to do so.,1348297144.0

I think a segue into 'knowledge management' rather than pure CRM could yield results - I used to work in corporate strategy for a global financial firm, and my takeout was that in many large corporations sales and marketing teams have their particular CRM systems in place but it's not integrated or accessible throughout the company (cue lots of missed opportunities). I see a big need in the corporate world for integrated, enterprise-wide metrics - CRM, but also sales, marketing activities, strategic priorities, financial metricsall in the one system. It seems basic, but believe me for many large companies 'knowledge management' consists of Powerpoint and Excel docs, and version control is a nightmare. (They talk about Enterprise 2.0 but frankly it hasn't hit any of the firms I've had dealings with). I'd like to see company position snapshots at the click of a button - pull up sales for the last month, overlay with conversion rates, overlay with marketing activities, and overlay again with financial info. This level of transparency is completely lost in large firms and re-enforces a 'silo' company culture. Happy to chat further about it if you're keen, I toyed with a business plan around this before switching to my current startup.",1348296882.0
