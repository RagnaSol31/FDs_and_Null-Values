I guess I don't consider Putin's direct actions to be corruption so much as bad governance (in some cases; in other cases he's superior to Yeltsin, but maybe that's a really low bar).

But patents are far from a perfect fit for this problem.<p>Among other reasons, in an industry that is entirely dependent upon patent protection to defray the costs of getting FDA approval, it is impossible to get treatments through the approval process when they are not covered by patent.<p>For example somewhere on the order of half a million people in North America have Crohn's disease.  This is a rather nasty sickness that destroys quality of life, and requires lots of rounds of only marginally effective medication.  Research indicates that hookworm infection is an effective treatment.  The FDA has decided that this treatment requires their approval.  But you can't patent hookworms, and therefore nobody will pay for the necessary tests to get FDA approval.  And so a half-million people continue to suffer.<p>If the rules were changed to grant a temporary monopoly to the company that got FDA approval for a treatment, this problem would vanish.
