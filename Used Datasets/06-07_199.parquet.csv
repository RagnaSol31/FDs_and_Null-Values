Assuming a Gaussian distribution where 0.5 * $20k per month represents the high end of two standard deviations (since Boston ranks quite highly in S/W salary nationally), most DevOps engineers will be paid roughly half of that as well.<p>This yielded an estimation of $6.5k per month per DevOps employee or $19.5k per month for three.<p>Since all of this was off-the-cuff, I figured it best to throw in a bit of &quot;fudge factor&quot; and present a $10k per month savings.<p>As always, YMMV and I could be completely wrong about all of this :-).",1445669119.0

Instead I think people that are into creating habits -- you know, studying every week, working hard every week -- those are the most important. Those are the people most likely to succeed.<p>That is the one insight that I wished I truly understand years ago. After figured out that intelligence barely means anything, I thought that willpower would be the most important characteristics (because of endurance, perseverance yada yada you know).<p>Turned out that just like physical muscle, mental muscle get exhausted and you can run out of them.

No one had ever told it what a cat is. That was a milestone in machine learning.&quot;\nIf you dont mind, let me call this bullshit out. No one in machine / deep learning thinks that this was anything more than PR fluff combined with a very very weak paper that people had to approximately cheat to find the actual cats. (You had to initialize your random vector very close to an actual cat image, and do gradient descent, before it &quot;figured out&quot; for itself about a cat).",1445666684.0

We were born out of this movement. We prosper because of the technology and activism which comes from this movement. And we know that Open Source and Free Software remains a key part of the Internet and the online life we seek to build. We have had an ad-hoc grants program for many years. MOSS is a systematic way to provide a new level of support to this community.<p>The Mozilla Open Source Support program is designed to recognize and celebrate communities who are leading the way with open source projects that contribute to our work and the health of the Web. It encompasses both: a) a “give back” element for Open Source and Free Software projects that Mozilla relies on; and b) a “give forward” element for supporting other projects where financial resources from Mozilla can make our entire community more successful. We will identify crisp names for these elements as we go forward.</i><p><a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS</a>",1445666617.0
