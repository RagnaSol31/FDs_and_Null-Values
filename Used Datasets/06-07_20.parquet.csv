You describe your layout in a format that makes sense, and the compiler will decide whether to use tables, CSS hacks, or whatever.<p>Ideally, this wouldn't be necessary, but I've never written CSS without the knowledge of the HTML it's going to be applied to, nor have I written HTML without considering how to style it.<p>I am not being dumb, either.  HTML needs all sorts of hooks for styles (classes), since HTML doesn't have any meaningful elements.  (Oh boy, I get <p>, <strong>, and lists.)  When I have done three-column layouts, my HTML has always needed tweaking -- the content has to be in a certain order (usually left/right/center, which is stupid), and it has needed hacks like <br class=""clearfix"">.<p>So clearly we don't live in an ideal world; we are stuck with HTML and CSS the way they are.
