I think the greater point isn't that the TSA is ineffective but rather that they are inefficient.  Making millions of travelers each year jump through more and more hoops isn't making any of us safer.  A smart, determined, terrorist will easily smuggle something aboard.  I've personally walked through security a half dozen times with a lighter in my bag (forgot it was even there) when flying both domestic and international, including going from AMS to IAD.  Plus how many TSA screeners have you seen just aimlessly do their job?  You think these guys have real incentive to catch smart/determined terrorists?<p>The fact is the TSA has burned through billions of dollars (your money) that may have been better spent on intelligence and more robust ""threat list"" monitoring systems. Not to mention on a bevy of other issues they could have tackled with that money.<p>The TSA going after a few bloggers is inane.  Do you feel safer knowing that a bunch of knucklehead TSA agents wasted tax payer money to intimidate a bunch of bloggers?  Will the confidentiality of a stupid list of hoops travelers must jump through make you safer?<p>Is the end-result even a net positive for society?  Is it even CLOSE?",1262241676

But what would an organism adapt to if not overcoming challenges to reproducing, under selection pressure?<p>But, yes, if what IQ tests estimate is something narrower than David Wechsler's claimed general ability to adapt to the environment, it is understandable that some high-IQ people never even get to first base in the biological task of reproduction.",1262241449

It's doubtful purchasing Yahoo in this economic climate would have been a big winner either.<p>I also don't really buy the article's description of the Xbox business defying the data and business common sense.  For a long time, Microsoft has wanted to be in the living room, purchasing WebTV in 1997.  If anything, it's an example of how Microsoft has succeeded in the past; constantly improving upon it's past mistakes and not giving up as quickly as other companies might.  The original XBox wasn't all that successful, but they did some smart moves with the 360, getting it out earlier than the PS3, providing good tools and support to their development community, and realizing that good networking support at the OS level to allow seamless multiplayer experiences was going to be a game changer for this generation of consoles.",1262241240
