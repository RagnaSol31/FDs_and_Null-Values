But maybe Jeff Fox is right, and you really need ten thousand hours of programming <i>in Forth</i> to perform at an expert level programming in Forth.  And, given IBM's historical turnover, it wouldn't be surprising if performing at an expert level maintaining DB2 required not just ten thousand hours of programming, but ten thousand hours of programming <i>in PL/M on DB2</i>, in order to know your way around that particular codebase well enough to perform well. Certainly the ramp-up time is likely to be longer on that codebase than on something more modern.<p>But maybe we should go in the other direction  maybe Bill Gates is right, and it only takes a year or two of programming to perform within an epsilon of your best possible performance, and it's really something broader, like ""engineering design of artifacts with human users"", that needs a whole ten thousand hours of practice to master  not merely programming as such.<p>My point is that these can't <i>all</i> be correct.  Being an expert at engineering design of artifacts with human users implies that you're an expert at programming, which implies that you're an expert at programming in any context: in Forth, in PL/M in the core of DB2, on the space shuttle.   Being an expert surgeon entails being expert at tying sutures, but it surely doesn't entail spending ten thousand hours practicing the tying of sutures.",1316415225.0

The average stack depth of Rails 3 applications is ENORMOUS.<p>He mentions in the video that he rewrote the Rack API to pass a mutated var to the next piece of middleware in the Rack chain instead of calling the next middleware and passing an env var to it. The gains were pretty impressive. Hopefully, they make this change to the Rack API for Rails 3.2.<p>That change + the 1.9.3 fix for requiring files[1] should result in much faster overall Rails performance.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWOAHIpmLAI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWOAHIpmLAI</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.rubyinside.com/ruby-1-9-3-faster-loading-times-require-4927.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rubyinside.com/ruby-1-9-3-faster-loading-times-re...</a>",1316414873.0

MySQL suck, buy our solution! Nice guys.)<p>First, it is useless to store data in memory if you want them be committed into disk storage. The general idea here isn't about switching to some new version of mysql or SSD disks, it is about to realize that you have a data-flow inadequate for your one-server architecture.<p>Second - check-point intervals should be adjusted to your actual data-flow, which means they should be executed often enough. If there is situation of almost constant checkpoint - non-stop data writes, that is the sign that you need to consider sharding/multi-server solution.<p>The hints that there must be no other disk activity on the same hardware volume or any swapping in OS, I suppose, are obvious. People who have a /var/log and /var/db on the same volume are idiots.<p>There are also good idea to use one file per table storage and put a data and physical logs on a separate hardware volumes (links are your friends). One raid-X volume that fits all is a quite naive solution. Raid isn't a guaranty of reliability. Replications to a back-up servers are.<p>Third, when you test your configuration before put it into production, you should tune-up your servers to perform with data and log syncing, and then figure out appropriate buffer sizes and checkpoint intervals. Then, in production, when you're experiencing an increasing flow of queries, you may choice to switch into different syncing strategy and/or more often but a little bit faster checkpoints.<p>Configuring mysql with huge buffers and no sync means lack of understanding the basic concepts, self-delusion and misuse of software and hardware. ^_^",1316414593.0
