This is a nice bit of low hanging fruit for a segway into smarter home technology, something we've been promised for ages but which has consistently failed to deliver IMHO.

Solar could easily produce about 90% of power for some regions (remember, electricity is a valuable export commodity) and other methods will take up the load at night. That is where we are going and that is what the article is about. Once the price gets down low enough solar will become the first choice and other choices will just support it, much like coal or natural gas is that choice at the moment.

Thus without reading what the fields are for, it's very easy to assume you've simply been logged out of Linkedin and need to re-log-in. Upon doing so  Linkedin will try one time to login to your email (Gmail and other web email clients do this too -- to grab contacts from older email accounts but they don't use this phishing-style approach). If your email password happens to be your Linkedin password, Linkedin will have access to your email contacts without you realizing it. And more embarrassing: Linkedin may send an email to your contacts mentioning you (they used to do this, maybe not as much anymore). Don't you remember getting all those Linkedin invite emails from your 'friends'? how do you think those got sent? Do you really think your friends intentionally typed in your email address so Linkedin could spam you?",1319522460.0

I can think of at least two causal explanations that would account better.<p>1) Children born to wealthy parents are both a) more likely to go to college because their parents can pay for it, and b) to step into high paying jobs because of their social networks than poor kids.  Thus while there is correlation between college degrees and earning potential, the root cause is being born into a wealthy family.<p>2) Smart people are more likely to go to college than dumb people, and smart people are more likely to do well in jobs which require intelligence.  Similarly, intelligence is the causal factor, not simply attending college.<p>College may very well be worth the money; but your statistics prove no such claim.",1319522401.0

What is the cost they use? For industries with steep learning curves, the right strategy would be to use expected future cost as the basis for business decisions, rather than the trailing average (realized) cost, in order to build the market and more quickly progress on the learning curve.<p>If that's illegal (it's often used in instances I mentioned above), then I feel like progress in industries with steep learning curves will be slower, because companies will be more timid, causing the market to grow less quickly.<p>What is everyone's opinions here?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/234291/20111019/solarworld-solar-panels-cells-china-antidumping-subsidies-lawsuit-complaint.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/234291/20111019/solarworld-s...</a>",1319522400.0
