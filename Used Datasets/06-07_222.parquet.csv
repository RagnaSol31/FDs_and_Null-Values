Discussing in depth the Apple Watch conundrum, they explained why there are flawed misconceptions from western analysts on the Apple Watch market in Asia. The discussion also revolved around the luxury business models from prestige to “mass-tige”, and why Apple is challenging the traditional luxury market in a different kind of way. Moving from Apple Watch, Sameer offered his perspective on why Firefox should not build a desktop OS and argued that the challenge for the next billion is not just for Google but every technology company who is looking to grow their pie there. Finally, the discussion turns to the recent F8 conference and the prediction which both got right: Facebook has finally cloned WeChat, but Sameer argued that Facebook is using the LINE model more than WeChat. Lastly, they also discussed the interesting question on Meerkat and Periscope.",1428302130.0
