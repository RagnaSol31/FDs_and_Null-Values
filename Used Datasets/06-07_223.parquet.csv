Note the Dajaz1.com example; the government used an emergency seizure which is supposed to be used to prevent people from destroying evidence (though there's no way to prevent destruction of evidence merely by seizing a domain name), and then dragged the forfeiture process out for a year with secret court hearings that the owner could not defend themselves, before finally just giving up and giving the domain back because they had no case against it.<p>SOPA and PIPA are just ways to make this process easier, and easier to apply to domains owned by foreign entities.

Microsoft's new requirement that systems support the installation of user keys would let users boot their own modified bootloaders, so that may end up being sufficient to satisfy the license.<p>I don't understand. What does Microsoft have to do with GPLv3 requirements?",1326866707.0

Both work well, JIRA breaks much more often than Confluence, but then again we are adding a ton of records every single day. To be fair, JIRA breaks because some third party programs are really careless about how they call the API (ask for way too many records, and that sort of thing), if we shut off API access (and only allow JIRA access on the web interface), then all is well.<p>Confluence is very stable. We have a ton of content in it, and without it we are completely dead in the water. It works well.<p>Yeah the tags are a bit ambiguous, but I have never seen the tags get in the way.  Downtime would get in the way much more.",1326866584.0

Even the music you bought.<p>This is not the time to play ""Fair"" or be 100% accurate. You just have to get EVERYONE in the US talking about it. Unless you tell that basketball loving dude, he will not be able to send that rebound shot to his friend, the guys mouthing ""Jobs Jobs Jobs"" might have the day.<p>PS: Yes, it is ok to say if SOPA passes, everyone in Facebook, Twitter and YouTube will lose theie jobs.
