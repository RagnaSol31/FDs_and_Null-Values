28,7055757,comment,7054975.0,7055254.0,9,0,rpedela,,,"Yeah I generally agree with you. My view is that mobile will follow the desktop in terms of apps. Once upon a time, most apps were native to the desktop. Then the networks got fast enough and the browsers and tools got good enough that you could build most native desktop apps as websites. Once the mobile networks get fast enough, and the mobile browsers and tools get a bit better then I think you will start seeing mobile apps being built as websites too.<p>The main problem websites solve over native is the fact you only have to build the app once and it works everywhere (mostly). Of course, there will always be a place for native apps, regardless of desktop or mobile, when performance matters most.<p>I think you are already starting to see it happen actually with mobile-first web frameworks like Bootstrap, some mobile browsers performing well (i.e. Chrome), and 4G rolling out.

As the BBC article notes glyphosate is considered one of the &quot;most environmentally friendly&quot; farm chemicals by the World Health Organisation (glyphosate breakers down in water unlike older herbicides). GMOs and Monsanto are not even mentioned in the BBC article. Your second story is a photo essay with sad pictures but very little actual information. It is much more likely if farm chemicals did cause any of these illnesses it was older pesticides that are known to be much more dangerous.<p>Do you have better evidence than this?
