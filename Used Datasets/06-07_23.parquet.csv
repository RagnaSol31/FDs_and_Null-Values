Your CEO likely knows he needs your irreplaceable understanding of the company's technology, but otherwise wants you out of the way.<p>Replacing you as manager is probably not going to work out well unless he already has someone good in mind.  CEOs rarely understand how much difficulty they'll have identifying competent tech managers.  He's in danger of finding someone who does a great job of ""managing up"" and a poor job of getting things done efficiently and correctly.<p>If you can't prevent the hire, making sure you hire someone competent is probably the most significant thing you can do for the company.",1236668105.0

It made some sense because the CTO mostly directed the 6 months into the future vision of the company (next features, next  product). This worked ok because the CTO had a research team that reported to him and the VP of Engg had the development team reporting to him but it was not optimal.<p>The issues we faced were:<p>- CTO+Research team builds some amazing enhancements for the product but have to fight to get them into the next release (Dev claimed there was no time for regression testing..but next cycle there will be)<p>- Dev team thought the research team were ivory tower elites (even though this was not the case). There were Ph.D.s and people who never went to college on the team.<p>- Research team eventually thought they were superior (reaction to having all their input regularly ignored by dev team)<p>In short, if your company has a legitimate need for a research or forward looking team, there may be a way to make this situation work, but not without regular political disputes and bitterness between teams.

People are irrational?<p>All kidding aside, I started my university studies in economics before switching over to management halfway through. The thing about efficient markets isn't that economics is claiming that things are instantly, always, 100% priced correctly, it's that they'll price themselves correctly over time and in aggregate. Econ doesn't say that no one will make a bad purchase ever, it says that if you wait around for a while, the ""invisible hand of the market"" will do its thing and price things correctly. If people are ""overpaying"" for gasoline, more people will start digging and refining oil to take those profits. The more people that start producing, the more prices will have to fall to compete, until prices get sane again. If lots of speculators get involved as they have recently, they'll artificially decrease supply by stocking reserves until they need to eventually unload those reserves, resulting in - as we saw - prices going up, up, up - and then crashing down, down, down when the speculators have to unload their oil on the market. Funny how everyone who complained about speculators and gas for the last few years aren't talking about how cool it is to have gas in the $2 to $3 range again.<p>So sure, housing was overheated for a few years. Then people realized it, and you can see what's happening now. It's not really a pleasant thing that people make bad decisions that aren't obviously bad decisions at the time, but it's been the nature of reality for as long as reality has been around. Nowdays, instead of worrying nonstop about droughts, famine, floods, plague, we're worrying about things that are relatively much less painless. There's still unpredictability and people don't act perfectly in any given timeframe, but things tend to straighten themselves out if you give it a while.",1236665076.0
