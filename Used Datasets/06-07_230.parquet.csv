92,10263567,comment,10262719.0,10263447.0,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Over the last decade, the distributed system nature of modern server hardware internals has become painfully evident in how software architectures scale on a single machine. The traditional approaches -- multithreading, locking, lock-free structures, etc -- are all forms of coordination and agreement in a distributed system, with the attendant scalability problems if not used very carefully.<p>At some point several years ago, a few people noticed that if you attack the problem of scalable distribution within a single server the same way you would in large distributed systems (e.g. shared nothing architectures) that you could realize <i>huge</i> performance increases on a single machine. The caveat is that the software architectures look unorthodox.<p>The general model looks like this:<p>- one process per core, each locked to a single core<p>- use locked local RAM only (effectively limiting NUMA)<p>- direct dedicated network queue (bypass kernel)<p>- direct storage I/O (bypass kernel)<p>If you do it right, you minimize the amount of <i>silicon</i> that is shared between processes which has surprisingly large performance benefits. Linux has facilities that make this relatively straightforward too.<p>As a consequence, adjacent cores on the same CPU have only marginally more interaction with each other than cores on different machines entirely. Treating a single server as a distributed cluster of 1-core machines, and writing the software in such a way that the operating system behavior reflects that model to the extent possible, is a great architecture for extreme performance but you rarely see it outside of closed source software.<p>As a corollary, garbage-collected languages do not work for this at all.",1442989179.0

Groupon recently exited Turkey and Greece, which makes a lot of sense considering the economic turmoil in those countries and in the region in general.  The 7 countries that were affected in this news were fairly small markets.  Since when was Uruguay a major player in the global economy?  The layoffs of 1100 mostly in sales and customer service seems reasonable when operations in 7 countries are shut down.  Groupon has over 10,000 employees.  A 10% reduction in staff trims some of the low performers.  Microsoft and Amazon probably cut more staff each year with their stack rankings.  (I know MS supposedly killed off their stack rankings, but I have a feeling it still exists albeit in a less visible capacity.)  Overall, I think these moves make Groupon stronger, more competitive, more focused and more capable in a cutthroat market.",1442988717.0
