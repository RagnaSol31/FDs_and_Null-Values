Generally, most people are only good when they believe the reward for being so is >= the required effort or discomfort (rewards aren't always monetary and could be as simple as feeling good about yourself for helping the crippled-orphaned-widow-beggar across the street).  An example of this is airbnb's own policy of not disclosing renter contact information.  Despite what they say, airbnb believes that people are not fundamentally good as their concern of users circumventing their payment system is greater than their concern for the safety of said users (at least to the extent that stories such as this don't hurt their business more than payment bypassing would).<p>If airbnb believed what they espouse, they'd quit trying to outsource their trust in humanity to their customers whom they aren't liable for and instead actually <i>trust</i> that <i>people in general</i> won't sidestep the payment process.",1311835798.0

Laws and government regulations are a different set of rules, and much newer and more transient. What should be guiding all of us, I hope -- regardless of the current state of legal rules & regulations -- is whether something is ethical and what the impact is on society. By some standards, what hedge funds are doing is unethical or parasitic, and may in fact be a chaotic force which on the net creates more hardship than benefit to most of society. Thus, the details of whether they are currently legal or not is not important, in comparison. We can change laws to better reflect our ethics and what we think is best for society. So talking about social value is precisely and massively relevant: it's one of the main reasons we have laws. And it's quite possible that hedge funds are exploiting a temporary state of affairs where technology and the legal context allow them to do certain activities, and they'll continue to exploit until and unless we make changes to their environment.",1311835206.0

Failing that, a lightly skilled (50h practice) lock-picker can open most household locks, even ""secure"" ones, in under fifteen minutes.<p>Beyond that, the lock/deadbolt/wall is pretty weak. A sledge hammer will open almost any door in a single blow. Windows are essentially just big gaping ""serial-killer's enter here"" signs, as you can easily break them and gain access to the domicile. Where, presumably you would feed on the brains and organs of the residents.<p>And worse, the phone company publishes a book that lists your name and address. No longer do serial killers need to drive endlessly, trying to stumble upon a Stuart or a Fred, they can just pick up a phone book and they'll find a perfect list of people, indexed by name for easier killing.<p>PANIC!<p>But seriously now, you're over-reacting here. These risks are everywhere and AirBnB was just another way to meet another person.<p>What I'll consider unethical is if they do anything differently for this lady, who got the media attention first, than they'd do for anyone else.<p>I don't necessarily think they're liable, even morally. It depends on how they represent themselves. If they purport to offer screened participants and don't, that's a problem. But if they don't it simply means they're offering a lesser service, pay accordingly.<p>I want a market to exist for cheap and potentially dangerous things instead of offering only padded kid-safe versions. For instance, Lithium-polymer remote-controlled vehicle batteries. Essentially the same tech as the laptop/cellphone batteries that occasionally catch fire. But they don't have protective circuitry built in to prevent this. If you overcharge them they will catch fire. But they're far cheaper and you can draw more power than if they had safeties built in.

They don't use those shots until the latter half of the video.  Also, those particular shots don't really look that great, there wasn't enough overlap on the cameras so the motion is kind of choppy.",1311833111.0

Since it comes from Google, who have the history of ""revolutionizing"" various aspects of the web, hackers want to learn more and put G+ in perspective of existing (competing?) products. This makes it very interesting not only to read about how to fit G+ into the current framework (Twitter-but-longer? LinkedIn-killer? Facebook-killer?) but also follow the minutiae of the growth, adoption, and evolution of G+ (much like they would have taken to GMail, if the timelines had overlapped, imo).",1311832847.0

What the poster is describing is, in fact, what the government has been doing for several months -- using cash inflows to keep paying the bills, while rolling over expiring debts into new ones.  August 2 is the date when we will no longer have enough cash on-hand to keep paying our obligations.<p>In addition, a large raft of monthly Social Security checks are scheduled to go out at the end of next week, so even if the estimates are wrong and we can make it a few extra days, that singular large expense will be enough to push us over the brink.",1311832809.0
