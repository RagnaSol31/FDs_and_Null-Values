The time of contact between Alaska Natives and others was much more recent in Alaska than elsewhere in the US. That contact brought with it a number of issues:<p>- disease: Flu and smallpox epidemics wiped out more than half the population in many villages. This was a traumatic event, that left many young people disconnected from their families and cultural groups.<p>- cultural suppression: Initial contact with Native groups often involved missionaries. While a few missionaries added to an existing culture without taking anything away, most missionary groups came in and told the Native population that their ways were of the devil, and they needed to drop what they were doing and take on Christian traditions. These efforts contributed to severe disconnects between generations.<p>- introduction of alcohol and other drugs: Combined with all of the other issues that led to young people feeling isolated, alone, and depressed, alcohol and other drugs have had devastating effects on villages, and on urban areas as well.<p>These are complex issues, and not issues that everyone feels comfortable talking about.

Since both the USD and bitcoins are free-floating (though there are powerful institutions stabilizing the USD such as the Fed and IMF), there would be an onus to convert USD into Bitcoin until the relative value of USD was high enough to offset the conversion deficit.

Google designers are TOLD to uphold similar design pattern on all Google products, which have the same features across all of them.<p>Seriously, why does gmail, google+, and google search should have a similar look? It just breaks some functionalities. These products are different and should not look alike. Pushing same patterns into users mouths, when it hinders the experience is an overkill.",1383026814.0

I had done my own startup for 3.5 years at the time, so I wanted to give members of Hacker News useful, insightful, and positive feedback about their project.<p>The link was a landing page with a video about &quot;throwing away your USB drive.&quot;<p>In my Hacker News comment, I proposed a list of ways to replace &quot;throw away your USB drive&quot; with a non-technical metaphor that people of all ages could understand (a personal secretary who automatically makes duplicates of anything you create for safekeeping, stored the way you want and accessible from anywhere.)<p>I&",

Turns out we share a common vision: to develop a phone platform that is modular, open, customizable, and made for the entire world. We’ve done deep technical work. Dave created a community. The power of open requires both.  So we will be working on Project Ara in the open, engaging with the Phonebloks community throughout our development process, as well as asking questions to our Project Ara research scouts (volunteers interested in helping us learn about how people make choices).</i>",1383026511.0
