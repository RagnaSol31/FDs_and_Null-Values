No, it isn't morally right. The world isn't fair. The world isn't kind. However, not having this form of credit available at all would be even more unpleasant for those who need it, so all things considered I'd rather these businesses exist than not.<p>I still remember earning under-18 minimum wage and being happy if my disposable income after rent and food was $15 a week. In those situations, credit of any kind is far better than no credit at all - if the person in question considers the terms unacceptably usurious they always have the option of not taking those terms. All regulation would achieve is to eliminate such businesses - effectively the government taking that choice away because somehow allowing people to choose is not ""somehow okay"".<p>It isn't fair.

Once they join the league they would just pay a small subscription fee to be able to use the scoring features, manage their team rosters, see ongoing match stats & history etc. We would really like to implement live scoring as well. When playoffs come around each team could keep tabs on the other teams they are in contention even if they are in different locations. This could add a very interesting dynamic into league play and possibly affect the strategies used in posting matches based on an opposing teams current score.<p>Just some ideas, and I would love to get some funding to be able to work on this more often. The Japan APA reps were very into it, but I haven't heard back from them or the APA national office since I demo'd it in Vegas several months ago.
