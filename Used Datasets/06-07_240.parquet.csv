107,5964858,comment,5964377.0,5964701.0,1,0,dualboot,,,The right answer.  With a design that focuses on simplicity ( reducing the entry points ) you can be pretty well assured that if someone attempts to gain access to your data you will likely know.<p>For me that is an important factor.  I rather dislike the fact that in scenarios like Gmail and other providers of their ilk -- access is provided transparently to a third party.<p>Running your own server can give you a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Even in a hosted/colocated environment if you take the time and effort.,1372572741.0
