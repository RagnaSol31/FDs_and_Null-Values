It has massive consequences and the worst data leaks are probably yet to come. Should we impose heavy regulations on the software industry and curb toxic innovation? It is certainly not an absurd debate. Obviously most people in the software industry will react to this with hostility.

A cheating bot could wait until they received the input+number from all other players, then choose their own number as needed to obtain the desired &quot;random&quot; result.<p>A workaround is to have all parties pre-commit to their numbers by first sending a hash of the number. Each party will reveal their number only after receiving the hashes of everybody else. This adds another round-trip, which is bad for latency.<p>As a compromise, one could have clients pre-generate a whole sequence of numbers, pre-commit to that sequence by publishing its hash, and then reveal the sequence one number at a time. Then it is possible to detect tampering with the randomness at the end of a game.<p>However, even with this modification, another source of cheating in a peer-to-peer networked game may be that one party might want to adjust their <i>input</i> after having received the inputs of everybody else.

It was organized around a single stroll through each neighborhood in each  borough, touching on elements of history, food, and typical tourist destinations. The walks would sometimes be point to point, other times a loop, but always took me through interesting streets I would never have thought of going through myself.
