1,3124190,comment,3123507.0,3123971.0,9,0,hncommenter13,,,"I don't believe these are entirely accurate.<p>1) The Rice survey regarding profitability of deals is based on anecdotal data only (it didn't crunch the numbers on the deals offered).  The circumstances under which Groupon deals are profitable for merchants are very narrow and often difficult for merchants to measure, as they require tracking customers and referrals carefully over a period of months.  How many businesses do you know of that could cut their prices by 75% (50% off list + 25% to groupon) and survive?  Put another way, how many businesses have net margins > 75%?  Answer: none.  The profits to merchants are a mirage, as it's really future sales sucked into the present at a discount, not incremental increases.<p>2.) Not quite true. The current financial statements reflect the presence of breakage (for international), which is why the CityDeal acquisition actually saved Groupon's ass.  The merchant agreement in the US says that unredeemed balances are split with the merchant after 60-90 days.  Also, a customer's LTV goes down if breakage becomes too high--when customers don't use the coupons they buy, they tend to stop buying them.<p>3.) The latest numbers in the S1 show that the ""backlog"" of merchant deals in the US awaiting scheduling dropped in the most recent quarter.  Given that Groupon has 900 employees in the US alone calling merchants all day every day, that's not a good sign.  Sure, there are plenty of local businesses that haven't run Groupons yet.  But that doesn't mean they haven't worked with a competitor or that they are good potential targets.  Remember, Groupon has deliberately (per the S1) not repeated offers from the same merchant, and the pool of attractive restaurants/merchants is getting thinner.  A 50% off coupon to a crappy restaurant isn't worth much if no one wants to eat there.<p>4) This is actually less true than you would think.  Per the Deloitte annual restaurant surveys, food + labor (known as ""prime costs"" in the restaurant business) equal about 60% of revenues across all of the types/sizes of restaurants surveyed.  These costs are largely variable, as it's easy to cut a server's hours on a weekly basis or put food in the refrigerator for a day and order less for the next delivery two days hence.  Unlike hotels and airlines, where once the airplane takes off or once the hotel is built, there is no ability to easily adjust supply and significant costs are incurred to provide service to empty seats.  Regardless, restaurant net margins (per the same annual study) are in the 7-10% range.  Which means that a 75% discount to fill the empty seats would still be unprofitable.<p>5) Even if all of the above were true, that doesn't make it a good investment at the likely offer price.  Assuming the offer price is $10B, the only question is, ""if I had $10B in my pocket and someone offered me the chance to buy the whole company on the spot, would I take it?""  Buying a single share at $10B/[shares outstanding] is the same question.  Personally, I was eager to short it at $30B.  (Sadly, the speculative bloom is off the rose, so while I still think it's a short, it's not a screaming short.)",1318921098.0

Only the owner knows how popular it is, and even then, doesn't know if it's just a bunch of 'yeah, me too!' or 'that was informative or insightful!'<p>The most egregious example of 'why is this modded so' is this comment, so much so that I've stuck it in my profile:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3087822"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3087822</a><p>The thread was about RMS and what an eccentric he is, and about his comments subsequent to Steve Jobs' death. The comment is defending RMS using an oft-quoted verse of Jobs', where he defends mavericks making their own rules and violating the status quo. The comment makes a very insightful link, and is not offensive or malicious. Yet it's downmodded to dead status, something that other comments in the same thread didn't have happen despite being much more fractious. Why was it downmodded? Who can say? It's probably fanboys, nothing else makes sense from a mature point of view.<p>Which reminds me of another issue with the mod system: it's totally anonymous. There is no accountability. You can diminish someone else's statement without giving a reason why nor standing behind it with your own name/pseudonym. Again, the forum I come from gives you the option to see who modded a comment whichever way - which while there is the occasional problem, is overall a significant net gain for an online community that strives to keep things mature.",1318920838.0

My source tree would just about fit on a disk that could be connected to such a machine, but it would take eons of page swapping to compile with 8MB of RAM.<p>Software does a lot more stuff these days, with richer media, more layers of abstraction and more reuse of code.

Try doing that on your 486/33, with the tools of the era. You'd be lucky to have a sound card (MPC was a standard to encourage OEMs of the time to include them, along with a CD drive, if you recall) and a color console I/O library, much less a network connection good enough for cloud speech recognition.<p>My point? People today are forever bitching about how little we've progressed, how software development is still the same, but I can't agree. I remember what software development used to be like.

The simplest example of this was the Millicent protocol which used an MD5 running backwards as a one time pad, although that had other issues.<p>But lets say that at the 'introduction' stage the service set a cookie with the fob by saying 'remember this about me, I'll call my self ecb994af and your magic number is 3551eff' then later on verification passes it sends a message encrypted by its self key to 'tell me your magic number divided by 2 and encrypted with your id.' The attacker can see the whole sequence but if they don't understand what is being asked and returned they can't reproduce it, and they don't have the initial secrets either.<p>There are lots of ways to do this with smart protocols.

The nice thing about such protocols is they can be dynamically designed between device and service and malware is stuck out in the cold.<p>There are things it cannot protect against, malware running in the Google servers or Amazon's for that matter which has access to all of their server data.

And plenty of ways to say something publically, too.  I think one key thing Facebook has that other (currently well-known) things don't is the area between the two -- ability to write something directed at a specific person, which is also public.  Namely, making a post on their wall.  I was very surprised to learn Google+ doesn't do this when it was being touted as a replacement for Facebook.  IMO, Google+ is actually more like LiveJournal but without threaded comments.",1318917846.0

This is certainly a requirement for making a touch-first UI.<p>That said, it will necessarily make mouse based interaction more clunky. But they are committed to touch first, so this is not negotiable.<p>My issue with the new explorer UI is more specifically about the choices they made within the ribbon. Why put something that provably is never used in there at all? Why not put context-aware stuff in a context aware tab like the image tab in Word (only visiblw when an image is selectad)?",1318917846.0

For example, substitute ""v1agra"" for ""viagra"", and get through to the inbox. Though once you use a trick like that and it gets marked as spam a few times, you can't use it again. So yeah, perhaps your reason is more sensible.",1318917846.0

C/C++ has its performance advantage but may require more skills and training.  Php and Python is simple and fun, but you can't really use Php to write a search index.  Java is somewhere in between, but the beauty of Java is its proclaimed ""write once, at least test everywhere"", which allows it to build up a large developer community very quickly.  But that is also the downside of Java for its portability, and that is why many platform has to customize Java for speed such as IBM.",1318917740.0
