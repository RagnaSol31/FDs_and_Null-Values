20,2606280,comment,2606179.0,2606179.0,18,0,nostrademons,,,"One of the biggest surprises for me when I went to work for a big corp was that people didn't actually work harder in startups than in large corporations.  Perhaps there's a bit of sample bias; people at Google tend to work harder than at other big companies, at least according to my Noogler classmates who used to work at Adobe and Intuit.  But I know people at Yahoo and IBM that work even harder than I do at Google, and I work about as hard at Google as when I was working with a YC startup.  And yet they at IBM accomplish far less than we do at Google, and we at Google (on a person-for-person basis) accomplish far less than the average successful YC startup.<p>I've been trying to put my finger on why that is, and I think it all comes down to misallocation of resources.  Over time, work becomes focused inwards at a large corporation, dedicated to supporting the inner world of the corporation instead of the outer world of the market.  Without market discipline, decisions get made that seem logical to the decision-maker but are actually very pessimal from an efficiency standpoint.  Some team might create an API that's a continual tax on its users, but without the ability to bypass it and use or write an alternative, there's no way around it.  Or some VP may make a decision that seems sensible at a time, but mortgages future development, and without the ability for that initial project to fail and get completely reverted, you'll never arrive at the optimal solution.<p>Working hard is generally a necessary but not sufficient condition for success, and it's nowhere near a straight-line correlation.  Far more important is to pay attention to <i>what</i> you're working on, and make sure that it's actually important.  You can't succeed with zero hard work, but you can get much farther with a little smarts and little hard work than with a lot of hard work.",1306911153.0

For them to win almost all the (new) coins this way, they have to do almost all the mining.  Say, 80% of it, although it's really a matter of what you mean by ""almost all"".<p>Second, they could collude and subvert transaction audit trails so that the Bitcoin system transfers ownership of all existing coins to them.  For them to win all the (new and old) coins this way, they only have to do more than 50% of the mining.<p>So, if collusion is feasible, the second approach is easier; so let's forget about the first one for the moment.<p>The point at which the defectors, each using 2 orders of magnitude more CPU time, are doing more than 50% of the mining, is when they control more than about 0.9901% of the network's total raw computing power, because at that point, the cooperators control only 99.0099% of the network's total raw computing power, and the cooperators are using only 0.990099% of the network's total raw computing power to prevent counterfeiting.<p>If a single defector controls only, say, 0.5% of the network's computing power, they will get only about a third of the new bitcoins mined, and will not be able to subvert the network.<p>Only needing to have 0.99% of the network collude in defection to break the system is a pretty bad problem, but it's not nearly as bad as any single person being able to break the system.",1306909610.0

Until Airbnb confirms, you'll never know but you'd have to be naive to believe that you can build a company up to $1 billion by firing off a bunch of emails. Nobody here has even suggested the possibility that ""Airbnb became a billion dollar company"" by suggesting how many Craigslist rentals are posted each day, along with a standardized conversion rate.<p>I'm surprised to see how negative the comments are on this. This is like Yelp paying people to write reviews. Shady? Sure. Illegal? The only part of the CAN-SPAM Act Airbnb broke was (1) not including a physical mailing address, (2) not mentioning it was an ad, and (3) not including an unsubscrive link. Otherwise, CAN-SPAM is laughable at best. It's hardly enforced. Don't expect Craigslist to come at Airbnb with a lawsuit, it'd probably not hold up in court.<p>I see this instead as one of Airbnb's many tactics to try and reach out to users.

The people are brown not just because they're Moorish or African by ancestry but also because they're American. Most of them speak Spanish, French, or Portuguese, but a substantial number speak American languages like Guaran, Mapuzungun, Quichua, Aymar, Nahuatl, or Haitian Creole. Most of them practice Catholicism, but in a heavily syncretized form with Catholic saints corresponding to American gods, and a substantial number of them still practice American religions.<p>But all of those things are true only to a tiny extent in Buenos Aires, and a more noticeable but still small extent in the rest of Argentina.  This is what genocide looks like.<p>So I wasn't saying that Argentina is more European than Bolivia, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Cuba, or Miami because it's less Spanish.  I was saying that Argentina is more European than Bolivia, Puerto Rico, Brazil, or Cuba because <i>it's less American</i>, because none of the things I said in the previous paragraph are true here, and they're still true in those places.  The most distinctively American thing about Buenos Aires is that everybody drinks yerba mate.<p>By the way, Diego grew up here in Buenos Aires, where I also live.
