I had the same experience when I read The Fountainhead for the first time, in the middle of an ego clash happening at my school.<p>It's important, I've found, not to mistake Rand's works for wholesale reality. She makes some incredibly good points, and I love her concept of the virtue of selfishness, but things are more complex than she writes about. She was aware of this too: her books are deliberately overstated in order to drive her points home. The economy, along with people in general, is more complex than headlines might make it seem.",1231570606

It is a much more convenient way to do things than trying to find volunteers, mail out papers, collect responses, etc.  Not to mention you can potentially draw from a larger audience and you make your work more easily accessible.<p>One mechanism that does exist in peer review that I'm not sure could be easily reproduced is a sense of duty while reviewing a paper.  When selected to review a paper, you know you are one of only a few who will determine the fate of this paper and you feel a responsibility to try hard to understand the paper and give it a fair critique.  If a paper were just posted online for anyone to critique,  people might not put forth as much effort in their reviews.",1231570461
4,427746,comment,427319.0,427319.0,0,0,unalone,,,"There are two largely accepted definitions of art. The first is the view of art simply as the mastery of a certain action or craft. The second is the view of art as something that changes the person that sees it.<p>By the first definition, video games are inherently piece of art so long as there is an objective standard behind games. There's an art form behind, say, the comprehensive control scheme from Super Mario 64, which is in my opinion the best platforming control scheme I've ever used. There's an art to creating responsive and beautiful worlds.<p>By the second definition, games still qualify, but we're in a poor position in that thus far games are still parroting movies by-and-large. The large advancements that we've seen in gaming - I'll cite Shadow of the Colossus and Grand Theft Auto IV as the two pinnacles - are ones that, in terms of message, are still parroting movies. Shadow of the Colossus gives us the sense of loss, Grand Theft Auto IV gives us the sympathetic - and fully-fleshed - character. These things can be compared dismissively towards movies, since they're far more primitive in nature.<p>That's not to say that video games will remain as such. People are entering the field with ambitious minds right now. Many games are starting to hint at an expansion towards the sorts of things that gaming and gaming alone has to offer. I think that the ""are games high art"" argument will be moot 20 years from now, if not sooner. The gap is closing.<p>(I'll also say that if not the games themselves, music in video games is the least compromised that any forum of music has been for a century. I'm thinking of Nobuo Uematsu, whose soundtracks are regularly 4 discs+ long, who releases piano arrangements and orchestral and rock arrangements of all his pieces, and who - unlike, say John Williams - is given an incredibly wide scape of emotions to portray with every game he works on. His output is impressive, as is the output of Koji Kondo, though he isn't nearly as evocative in my opinion.)",1231570436

Just because the author wrote the title doesn't mean it wasn't chosen for marketing purposes -- to grab your eye, to be memorable, to describe the subject concisely, to pique your curiosity, to remind you of a story inside of the book so that hearing the title mentioned in conversation prompts you to tell the story. Authors are marketers too. Indeed, the first task of any new commercial author is to convince a publisher to buy a manuscript, and that requires a title which catches the publisher's eye, and which the publisher is convinced will catch the public's eye.<p>In other words, when I suggest that publishers pick titles with an eye to marketability, I'm not suggesting that the typical model is ""publisher buys the book and then suggests the title"". I suspect that's actually rather rare, although some authors have had that experience. Much more likely is the model where the publisher solicits hundreds of manuscripts and proposals and then picks out the handful that feel commercially viable -- and a good title helps a manuscript to stand above the rest of that slushpile.",1231569332
