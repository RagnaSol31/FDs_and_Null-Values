1,474849,comment,473421.0,473924.0,0,0,davidw,,,"> The same way he became an expert on the level of expertise among ""geeks"" (whatever that means) in macroeconomics.<p>It's pretty easy to observe that amongst geeks (or at least those that post a lot on the internet), there are way more people, compared to society at large, who believe in what most actual economists consider to be fairly fringe theories, like ""Austrian"" economics.  I think this is interesting enough in itself to warrant thinking about.<p>To cite an example, this could be any number of people on this site:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=473812"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=473812</a><p>There's definitely lots of curiosity about the world there, which is definitely a hacker trait, but also this element of going from socialism to the another extreme, rather than, say, settling down somewhere in a range between, say, Krugman and Friedman, who are probably at two ends of mainstream economics.<p>I'll also add: sometimes ""extremes"" are correct.  The concept of the US was pretty extreme at the time.  (Many?) other times, however, they aren't.  Plenty of smart people thought communism was a pretty good idea, and we are lucky in the US that during the 30'ies, the most extreme we got was FDR, rather than the wild swings that were going on in Europe.",1234249045

So the money only gets taxed when it's withdrawn as profit (and this itself is only necessary to tax foreign investors). Businesses are on average quite profitable, so why take away money that they're planning to reinvest? It will almost certainly be reinvested wisely (because they were already profitable, they presumably know what they're doing).",1234247301

The 1981-82 recession was very steep, but the recovery was very quick, precisely because the Fed induced the recession by raising rates, and then ended it by lowering them. Our recent recessions have featured bubbles bursting, so the Fed has ended up lowering rates to try to induce recovery, although each time monetary policy has been less potent. As our mega credit bubble has burst, we are now at a point at which monetary policy has no traction - we've reached the zero bound, and are only left with more unconventional measures like buying longer term Treasuries - so we can expect a steep decline, and a slow recovery.

Internet advertising didn't exist at one time and in it Google prospered.<p>Same thing happened with IBM, there weren't computers in corporations before them. There weren't computers in homes before Microsoft. There wasn't a computer in /every/ home before Dell.<p>Now there are several blue ocean opportunities being created. Cloud Computing is bringing scalability to the masses. Essentially we are looking at what Microsoft and Dell did for PC proliferation, cloud computing <i>could</i> do for web based information management.  Mom and pops can use the same quality software that the Fortune 500 use.  They can be efficient. We are going to see a rising and thriving of small businesses because now they to can have the same tools that the big companies have.  Big companies spend millions and millions of dollars on software every year and throw it away.  When small businesses can spend $50/mo for the same functionality, a new playing field will open.<p>The mobile market could reach every human alive via wireless.  We have netbooks selling like crazy.

We see great things in offerings in the SaaS market for example that consumers are willing to pay for.<p>Google makes money on tiny fractions of huge volume.  There are huge markets out there where each click, each page view, each morsel of information is much more valuable to the customer.<p>Think about it this way, Google gets its money from advertisers, not consumers.  So Google profits indirectly through the attraction of customers to the advertisers sites.<p>Today, there are more sites that are able to make money directly from the consumer, so the numbers are way way less than google's and the google model is getting gamed.  It's not free to do SEO compatibility and keep content fresh and all that.  Adwords aren't so great anymore.  Too expensive and no one clicks...  Just like social sites are great in the beginning, those who mastered SEO in the beginning won, but it's not so great anymore for newcomers.  Their algorithms like old sites that have been around for a while, so newcomers are looking for other ways to build organic traffic.<p>There's a lot of room for another google and I suspect that as time continues, the rate at which new google's appear will become more frequent as technology become ubiquitous, smaller, and easier to use.<p>Companies are going to make a lot of money doing things we can't even imagine right now.<p>Shoot, this is the first president that uses email...

Why wouldn't I do that?<p>There are plenty of Twenty and Thirty somethings that would do just that, gladly and in a heart beat and they will.<p>If you boil it down, Google isn't an internet company. They don't have scale because everyone at google still goes into the office. They don't work on their own schedule. They are bureaucratic. They are becoming a code shop.<p>The Google model is dead.  The please the investors model is dead.  The focus on the customer is alive and thriving and prospering.<p>There are countless companies out there who are making way more money in revenues than it costs to run their businesses.
