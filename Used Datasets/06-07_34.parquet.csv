He wrote, for example, confusing/obscure attacks on the value of philosophy itself. Not having any philosophical problems one is interested in or finds fruitful is completely understandable.

We had ~1000 machines on a  three year upgrade cycle, i.e., we upgraded 333 machines / year = $333k / year. Lets say I cost the company $200k / year. Several days = perhaps $2k, so I'd only need to get a .6% speedup for it to be worth it, not even including the cost of powering and maintaining our machines.<p>When I worked on it, our simulator was an order of magnitude faster than commercially available simulators (Synopsis VCS and Cadence NC-Verilog), which cost between $1k and $10k per license per year. I worked for a tiny hardware startup; established hardware companies use a few orders of magnitude more compute power than we did, so the equation is probably at least four orders of magnitude further in favor of doing assembly optimization in a commercial simulator.",1257144568.0

This kind of commentary is exactly where HN should be and often is, I'd like to take the time to point out to everyone who regularly bemoans HN is turning into reddit: it clearly isn't!<p>I find the CG rhetoric to be aged and irrelevant. The paranoia is so prevalent they sound like two kids smoking up in a dorm room, they use no explanation and cite no information for the paranoia than 'its the man'. It's pathetic. It's a tech website and there's barely even a passing mention of the technological feasibility of this project, and what examination of the feasibility they have is very weak and based on poor assumptions.<p>The assumption that the NSA will have thousands of HDD permanently running is absurd. Quite literally 1 cubic meter of 50GB blu-ray discs easily stores ~2.75 petabytes of data at an expected lifespan of 10-100 years (this is based on pure physical dimensions alone, and not storage dimensions). A single 100 disk stack of 50GB BR discs should store ~4.8TB of data. This makes the mass storage solely dependent upon write capability rather than size requirements.",1257141615.0
