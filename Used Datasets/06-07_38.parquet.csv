6,613105,comment,612504.0,612504.0,0,0,10ren,,,"Reminds me of <i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i>, but I think that applies only to specific product categories. The fortunes of many companies are tied to a family of products (e.g. Digital), and so the decline of that product category can cause the fall of the company.<p>The article is talking about companies that are so large that they become more like investors, whose job it is to allocate capital across different product categories. A skillful investor can then offset the tired against the vigorous to ride out the changes. But it seems to me that a company still needs to have some kind of mission and special expertise. This is why focusing on an abiding customer need appeals to me, instead of a specific technology or market. The need will always be there; if you keep on finding new and improved ways to solve, it you will always be providing  something worthwhile. That is, if you organize yourself around <i>finding</i> and <i>improving</i>, not around a particular technology or market.<p>For example, Google's mission, to ""organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful"" isn't tied to PageRank or even the internet. Whether this mission is more than PR, and whether they could make the leap in practice, hasn't yet been tested - though WolframAlpha might give them a workout.",1242543212.0

Instead, you want the fish to flake (this verb will make sense if you try it) when you run a fork along it ""across the grain"".  If you aren't confident the first time, use a recipe to get a general sense of how long it should take, and overcook it slightly, then slowly work your way back (on successive attempts) until you reach a point where you are comfortable with how well done it gets.<p>Once you are used to how the fish cooks, consider different flavorings, such as orange or pineapple juice (pretty much everybody starts with lemon), and onions (many people add black pepper to fish, I personally can't stand the stuff).<p>Unless you live close to where fish are caught (not just the coast, but particular parts of the coast for different kinds of fish), the only cheap fish available will come in a can.

30,613080,comment,612835.0,612914.0,0,0,cschwarm,,,"I think your point of view is too idealistic. You're attributing too much responsibility to the record companies. Sure, a handful of them dominate the market and their oligopoly has negative effects.<p>But the economic attributes of the product itself is the origin of the current market situation.<p>Consider the following though experiment: People form a club or cooperative. There's a monthly membership fee which is used to pay recording costs for artists, administration (legal fees, secretaries, etc.), and the necessary rights to distribute the recordings to its members.<p>In other words, no large anonymous record company owns the music, anymore -- but just normal people like you an me. But would such a club or cooperative act very differently to a record company? I don't think so:<p>1.) The club would not allow free redistribution of the recordings. Otherwise nobody had an incentive to be a club member in the first place and the club could not collect enough money to pay artists. In fact, the club would probably also restrict the amount of downloads per month. Otherwise people may be try to become members for a month, download all stuff, and then cancel membership to join another club to do the same thing, again.<p>2.) The core problem of such a club would be allocation of the collected membership fees. Which artist's music should be bought and recorded? Should the club make lots of low quality recordings or a few high-quality recordings or some mixture thereof? How much money should be spend on advertising of the recordings and club membership? These questions may be answered by some sort of Digg-Style voting but that presupposes that people are motivated to participate. In most cases, though, people have better things to do. This opens a window of opportunity for the most motivated to skew the results, for example, artists. We've seen something similar also happen to Digg.<p>3.) If a consumer is not sure which style of music and artists he or she likes most, it's most rational to become member of the largest club. In other words, there's also a strong tendency for the large clubs to become the larger, while the small ones are likely to become (relatively) smaller. It will also result in a sort of oligopoly where the largest clubs set the ""price"" for club memberships. This can also be seen elsewhere, for example in the blogging scene. Although there was nearly no commercial interest in the beginning of blogs, its readership quickly formed a Pareto distribution, as shown by Clay Shirky.<p>Overall, if people would really be concerned about the recording industry, they have all means to make them go away in the near future -- for example, by starting clubs and cooperatives. Most people, however, don't care that much. Otherwise, they would have already done it, right? ;-)",1242541646.0

Heat a little oil in a fry pan for a few seconds, toss in veggie mix, stir while heating until the onions change color.  Take off heat.  Cut open the fresh french bread you bought earlier that day, add ham, cheese, and veggie mix, top with a sauce if you like it, heat in toaster oven until either the cheese melts or the bread ends up toasty (your call).  Takes less than 15 minutes to make, cheap as sin, tastes great and is fairly healthy for you.  (Alternative to sauce: splash some soy sauce on the veggies in their last five seconds in the pan.)<p>Or, get the cheap cuts of beef that no one in American uses for anything, grill them in the pan with your veggies (beef goes in last after the veggies are done), add a bit of soy sauce and stir, then serve over rice.  Goes great with a fruit smoothie because it is VERY dry by itself.  Again, 15 minutes or less.<p>Then there is tofu.

It sticks to your ribs, it's fast, it's cheap.  Plus, the Grape Nuts swell up in your stomach, so you feel all full and bloated so you <i>save money and lose weight!</i><p>He also once went bonkers when his girlfriend broke up with him, took lots of LSD and ended up grinding his teeth in the asphalt of the middle of the road in the dead of winter in New England and had to be dragged back in the house by a bunch of guys.

I might be a DJ myself. ;)<p>Regarding the study, the results are in line with my expectations. Several of my friends are DJs and other art-loving people, who all download and buy massive amounts of stuff. The correlation between P2P downloads and buying strikes me as natural.<p>There's no doubt the major labels have played a pretty rotten game and also got the Internet completely wrong.<p>I want to see services that allow us to sample and listen to music without paying for it, allowing people to sample a large number of tracks and hopefully buy a fraction of those. I'd love to see decentralized distribution in such a way as to pay artists more and encourage creativity.<p>But I don't think piracy is the answer.",1242540051.0
