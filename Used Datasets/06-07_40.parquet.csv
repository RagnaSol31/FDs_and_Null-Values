However comfortable this may seem to from an employee perspective, if an employer decides to fire you they must really, really badly want to get rid of you. And that can seriously damage your reputation.<p>The result is that instead of firing people, both parties usually make a deal: the employee leaves ""voluntarily"" and gets a big fat final paycheck. Technically no firing has taken place and the whole process is way less confrontational. Employers will gladly give you a reference and keep quiet about why you were let go in exchange for a smooth exit.<p>You'll be hard pressed to find someone in the tech industry in Europe who has ever been fired.",1310799574

Currently, I'm building an autonomous tricopter, because I thought it'd be cool to build. Last semester, I wrote a webapp to handle an event we were having. Previous semester, I was working on a way to control my room from my computer (still working on that, just not as intensely). These all easily answer ""Why am I doing this?"" (tricopter: because it's cool. Webapp: Might be able to make money from this [Note: didn't make any money from it ): ]. Computer-controlled room: It's cool, and it allows me to be incredibly lazy.)<p>I know that I'm not an idiot, I should be getting As, and I do get As in the classes that genuinely interest me. Unfortunately, at least 75% of the classes I take don't interest me, so I get lost in trying to answer ""why am I even bothering with this?""",1310796906

On a lark, I took a class on Native American Literature (just on the name alone, I thought it would have been more Native American lore; it turned out to be contemporary fiction written by Native Americans).  The entire grade was based on one mid-term and one final.  The mid-term I failed.  When it came time for the final, I realized there was no way I could even answer the single question and simply walked out of the class.<p>I fully expected an F for that class, but I ended up with a C, which surprised the hell out of me.<p>I was recently talking with a friend (a former English instructor for a well known university in the United States) about this, and he said I either received a ""Gentleman's C"" or (more likely) the instructor simply thought he lost my paper and erred on the side of grade inflation.",1310796414
