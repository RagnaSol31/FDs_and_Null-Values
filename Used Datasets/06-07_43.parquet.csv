It looks like there is no learning apparent from one towel fold to the next, which would be thoroughly fascinating if it were done in even the littlest of tasks simpler than towel folding.",1270537179

That might make their behavior in some sense ""normal"", but it doesn't make it OK, or beyond reasonable criticism.<p>Most of what you're saying could equally well be applied to (e.g.) criticism of suicide bombers. It may well be the case that suicide bombers are not, as a rule, unusually evil people. If you have the relevant life experiences, you might even have a sense that you'd do the same thing if you were in their position -- in the same way that it's easy for an American to feel some sympathy for the soldiers in this video. Nonetheless, the actions of suicide bombers are unambiguously wrong, and are rightly subject to criticism.<p>(Of course, I'm not attempting to equate the soldiers' actions with suicide bombing, it's just an analogy.)",1270536682

I have fabricated my own touchscreen into my car and did all the work to make it look as factory as possible, however it takes a lot of time to make sure that everything holds together.  Honestly, from the clips they showed, it really doesn't seem that the iPad was made to stick in there if the roads got a bit turbulent.  I have seen people's touchscreens fall out from not being properly secured into the dashboard (including my own from a particularly rough driving experience...)<p>Ultimately, I think it's pretty cool but the iPad interface is not a very safe one to use while driving.  This is why I always, always, always install a dashboard frontend like Centrafuse or RoadRunner on mine to make navigation simple.<p>Aside from all that stuff, I am pretty curious to see a) how the iPad holds up on the car battery, and b) how well the screen illuminates during sunlight.

We have a working democracy (though by no means perfect), and the growth rate (around ~7.5%, opposed to China's 10%) is real, as opposed to China's famous dodgy math when it comes to economic issues. China is more likely to implode economically if political unrest (when it begins) gets out of hand - India has been dealing with that since ages, so there won't be any surprises. So in a way, though China is growing  much faster and a more lucrative investment destination, India is much, much safer (our central bank, aka RBI, is extremely conservative and hawkish on economic issues - which is why we survived the global financial meltdown of last year).",1270536381

Keeping APIs private allows you to provide functionality that you want to have without risking a bunch of stuff breaking client-side on upgrade, since you can update your applications to work with your API as needed.

This time, turn off the sound and ignore the captions.<p>A man covered in blood is crawling along the side of the road as you drive by. You say, ""My god! This man is injured! We need to help him!"" You and your friend jump out to help an injured man, not really sure what's going on, and tell your children to wait in the car. Suddenly you're dead, because a helicopter flying high overhead killed you instantly because you were moving an injured man.<p>That isn't a hypothetical, that's <i>what happend</i>. And if you ignore the chatter of a few pilots eager to score more kills, it's very clear that these people had <i>no connection to any activity on the scene</i>. The Van is nowhere in sight until the very end of the engagement.<p>What's more, it's clear the pilot is <i>eager</i> to kill. He reports it in the most biased of terms: mentioning they were ""possibly recovering weapons"" despite seeing NO such action. How do we know he knew such a thing, you might ask? Because just moments before he was <i>literally begging</i> them to pick up a gun so he could kill them, and in the end he got a fire order anyways because of a biased report.<p>The actions of the pilots in that video were reprehensible and it is unfortunate that they will most likely be shielded from prosecution. On that day they ceased to be revered servicemen for the united states and became a representation of every flaw in our military system that Americans revile.

With the same argument, one can justify all war killings. Even the act of Nazis. We don't bring in Godwins law when discussing and comparing war and killings.",1270534156

That was the Web 2.0 Conference in 2006.<p><i>I'd buy a bigger database machine, spread my servers to more geographical regions, whatever it took to try to bring that latency down.</i><p>Why make life hard.  Buying a bigger database server costs actual money and time.  Getting out the YSlow checklist and knocking two to three things off of it costs nothing and no significant amount of engineer time.<p>Gzip CSS/JS files: four lines in your Apache config, warm restart, done.  Collapsing CSS/JS together: 16 characters (:cache => true) in Rails, warm restart, done.  Spriting CSS images: open a web page, type a bit, copy/paste what it tells you to to development, push to staging, verify it works, done.<p>Moreover, as compared to buying a DB or spreading your servers, these are virtually guaranteed to <i>actually work</i>.  Many, many of the suggestions that come under the heading ""performance improvements"" do not <i>actually work</i> because they address things that are not problems.  (For example, unless you have data which convincingly demonstrates differently, the vast majority of websites can assume that the web stack is <i>not</i> a problem.  Optimizing your code within the web stack is generally a hideously expensive waste of time.)",1270533961

66,1243995,comment,1242877.0,1243648.0,0,0,ww520,,,"When something is illiquid due to insufficient buyers and sellers, the bid and ask spread is large.  A big discount is needed to motivate people to buy it.  E.g. you ask for $100 to sell your lawn mower because that's what every seller asking for.  People only bid $60 to buy a lawn mower because they know it's difficult to resell it.  The spread is $40.  Now from time to time, a few buyers would get desperate and buy at $100; likewise a few sellers would sell at $60.<p>Someone then comes in and says the spread is crazy.  He offers to bid to buy at $70 and to ask to sell at $90.  The few desperate sellers of course would sell to him at $70 instead of $60.  And the few desperate buyers would buy from him at $90.  He narrows the spread from $40 to $20, and makes $20 in between.  He basically increases the buyer and seller pools by adding himself to them, thus increased the liquidity of the lawn mower secondary market.<p>The risk to the arbitrager is that he guesses the amount of potential buyers or sellers wrong and set the wrong narrower bid and ask prices.  E.g. he could buy a lot of lawn mowers at $70, but there are much fewer buyers willing to buy at $90.  He would have to reduce his offer price to $85, $80, $75, $65, or $60 to really get the buyers going.  As you can see his profit margin erodes and eventually turns into a loss.",1270533833
