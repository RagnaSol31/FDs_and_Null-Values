And it's not just a maturer of waiting for improved efficiency.

So there is a gap between the user's mental model of Google and what Google actually does, and it's this gap that SEO exploits for its own profit.<p>An infinite amount of exploitation would mean that Google would just return results randomly, and so it makes a lot of sense to detect signs of SEO and penalize the behavior before it further broadens the perfection/reality gap.

It might be the case that your protected code is needed elsewhere. Now you have to duplicate it, or break around the protection/expose a new way through, all of which would not be necessary for a free function. At the very least you have overhead considering this. All of a sudden your neatly wrapped class is two classes, one in use in two places where you could again change code and have an effect far away if you're not careful.<p>3) In a language such as Python, you don't have your code inside a class protected by anything except convention. So it seems that you either must: a) accept that what protects groups of code is programmer attentive care, not the system of classes itself, and thus that any other programmer paying the right kind of attention could have the same benefits and less code, or b) declare languages like Python to be excluded from the benefits of classes by not implementing them properly. Do you agree?",1332050981.0
