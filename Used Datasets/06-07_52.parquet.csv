2,4696651,comment,4692858.0,4695846.0,1,0,drewcrawford,,,"Laundry is definitely a pain point. You first have the chore of removing and subsequently installing fitted sheets, which are certainly not zero-insertion force. And the folding and sorting of the clothing (distributing towels to bathrooms, etc.)  This requires enough seek time to at least hit each room once, and in the case of suboptimal routing, probably twice.<p>In the case the laundromat, you have the carting of multiple baskets of clothes and materials, often down flights of stairs, into a vehicle, and at some distance. Materials experience spillage. A community (e.g. apartment complex) laundromat eliminates some travel, but your quarter supply may vary unexpectedly, requiring unexpected travel. This probably amortizes to eliminate the gain.<p>In the case of doing laundry at home, you have both an infrastructure cost and a pipelining problem. Speaking for myself, I can rarely accomplish anything useful during a laundry cycle, leading to a near-total loss.",1351148309.0

Full cost of an employee is usually estimated at 2-2.5x salary, so on an average of $93k salary, the hourly rate must be about what one would expect.<p>Full cost of employee means salary, benefits, physical space, equipment, social security, etc.  Also worth noting that its unusual for developers to work more than 48 weeks out of the year; not sure if you took this into account.",1351148265.0

Your socket code will be testable, because its trivial to write fake net.Conns that are backed with byte buffers. Your handler code will be testable because they are in terms of parsed objects.<p>I tend to write socket code once per server project, and then leave it alone for months, so this isn't a big deal for me.

It's completely ridiculous to ask for citations in the context of a speech and only an idiot would do that.<p>In the context of writing, it is certainly appropriate to cite sources.

In turn, the source I cited, cites other sources in addition to doing investigative journalism and speaking to credentialed experts, who in their turn cite their sources.<p>As a writer, it is not my job to prove the veracity of my sources. That is the job of the reader. My job is to cite them; it is the reader's job to determine the ""provenance"" of my sources if they think provenance is the most important thing here (it's emphatically not).<p>If you're stuck up on provenance, you could have googled and discovered that the provenance of this is Arte France, a French-German TV producer, which in turn is owned by Arte Group, a French-German media corporation. They are relatively small players--Wikipedia reports they have about a 1% audience share.<p>Having said all that, in any good research the least important question is provenance. The most important question is research methods and findings. If you were to do your due diligence as a reader, and actually check the citation in question which is your duty as the reader, you would find out that their research methods are disgustingly rigorous and beyond any reasonable doubt. Their research is of the extremely boring variety that unearths extremely obvious facts. They also speak to credentialed, published experts to put these facts in context.<p>In conclusion, your objection is completely without merit, you have failed to engage in good faith, you have failed to do your due diligence that is your duty as a critic.

They may be slightly more easy to use in pair games.<p>> If there were other noncosmetic differences, this wasn't apparent to me as a casual player.<p>Nope, there aren't, probably to avoid the balance issues of e.g. Hero Academy.",1351145066.0

I think Microsoft could bank (and has to an extent) on customers flocking to its services if they could work on delivering specifics instead of, what seems like for the last decade, just reactions. There are a lot of purchasing managers and CIOs that know that if MS puts out a product in the enterprise space it's at least a safe bet. But they lose that as the enterprise blurs into the realm of the personal and MS makes larger bets into the personal space.<p>Microsoft's problem is that while Windows and Office give MS the freedom to explore new markets those same two things  let them treat these new markets as nothing more than multi-billion dollar whims that ultimately leave customers gun shy. I'm probably one of the last ten or so people that still has a Zune subscription (because the price and software are really compelling) but I also know that if they shut the entire thing down tomorrow and told all their Zune customers to go pound sand it wouldn't make a single penny's worth of difference on the Earnings Per Share report at the next quarterly earnings conference call.<p>But while you say that Windows Phone was a wake up call it doesn't seem like it from the outside. When Apple announces things they give dates and prices, Microsoft announces things like the Lumia line, which look great, but they lose when they fail to deliver specifics instead just relying on everybody knowing that anything the demo will be available in the next 6-18 months.<p>MS may have finally turned a corner by not releasing a half baked tablet OS in an effort to fight for the number 2 spot in the tablet wars, they waited until their ""perspective"" on tablet usage was ready. But still, they failed to outline specific dates and prices until relatively recently. People will ""flock"" to commitments to specifics, not so much so to ""oh, shit if we don't find a MS response to threat X it's going to be bad"".",1351144805.0
