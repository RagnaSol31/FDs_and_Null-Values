Clojure is a master's tool, like Unix. Good tools require time to learn and for the user to develop a bond with them.<p>It's precisely the functional programming, multimethods, immutability, concurrency, macros, and sexprs that make up Clojure's value. There are enough blubs already.",1277705485.0

My parents said I had to get a summer job, so I got an entry level PR job at a Web design agency (new media, baby!) in London. Somehow, within a few weeks I was attending recruitment interviews. One totally normal looking guy came in, sat down, and after a quick introduction the CEO asked him what his background was. The guy jumped up, shouted ""you can go f!@k yourselves!!"" and ran out slamming the door. Never saw him again.<p>I was only at the agency a month in the end, but just the crazy things <i>I</i> saw there could fill a book. In hindsight, I regret quitting.",1277705252.0

If you're only interested in 2D, you could theoretically pass double-rate video marked as 3D, and get a 120Hz refresh rate.  I don't know how HDMI 1.4 signals 3D vs 2D video, though, so you may need a video card (or dongle) that can send the right signal and/or flip the right bits in the HDMI signal.",1277705159.0

The language has to be quite bad in order to drive programmers away from good libraries.<p>It's the Python problem: I know the shortcomings of Python quite well and I would happily use some other language instead except that Python has almost everything and despite the shortcomings of the language itself, Python is by far the fastest way to code a quick program to solve some random, particular problem.<p>I don't like Java but in the case of Clojure, the heavy machinery in JRE is a critical life-saver.
