I suppose as long as the big sports leagues aren't pushing the issue justin.tv has no reason to aggressively go after people streaming copyrighted material. There are services like Sopcast and TVU that specialize in live sports piracy who don't seem to be getting any attention from the big sports leagues either.,1285484060

Even the shallowest read of Buffett's investment history, you'll find he's always followed a very concentrated portfolio strategy. He waits for the fat pitch, and loads up when an opportunity comes along. He's mentioned that if you were to take away his top 20 best investments, Berkshire would have a pretty average record.<p>Does Taleb believe more decisions increase the likelihood of reverting to the mean (ie: average returns in this case)? And by that logic, Soros has made more decisions, so that must suggest its less random, and more talent?

As for the ones that do, many successful founders and MBA holders tell me to be suspicious of said programs' ability to prepare one for actual entrepreneurship (as opposed to writing academic papers about entrepreneurship).<p>I personally did finish college (this year), majoring in physics with minors in math and computer science.  I attended a small liberal arts college with no practical business classes, of which I took 3 by hacking around the system.  The physics major taught me how to get projects done, work efficiently and endure recurring high-stress situations.  The math minor taught me that I suffocate in a room with too many mathematicians.  The CS minor was really a collection of ""X cool research area has Y,"" which is occasionally relevant.  I definitely learned in a college, though I've yet to reach a conclusion on whether it was ""worthwhile.""  I wish I'd taken more theatre and had more fun.<p>I'm much more weary of grad school.  As far as I can tell, college is more about exploring and learning general life lessons, while grad school buys you specialization.  Specialization has power; most tech companies recognize this and hire PhDs as soon as they can afford to.  But I currently have every reason to think that great founders are better off as generalists.  Specialists get pulled in to support specific areas.  Furthermore, while I admire those who were born to do one thing and do it well, I'm not one of them.  I have very little idea what I would study.  I certainly don't intend to spend my life researching a narrow subfield of physics.  Unlike in college, I couldn't spend the 1st 2 years of a PhD or masters program field hopping.  Occasionally someone tempts me with an interdisciplinary program; maybe I'll try one of these someday.  Part of the draw of entrepreneurship is how multifaceted it appears.<p>I have every reason to believe that for recent college grads dreaming of startups, the best way to get experience is by trying it.  That's exactly what I'm doing at the moment.  I also tried to form a startup in college.  That didn't go too well.  Now I'm starting up full time.",1285480812
