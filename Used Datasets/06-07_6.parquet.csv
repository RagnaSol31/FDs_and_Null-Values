2,384112,comment,384088.0,384103.0,0,0,gecko,,,"So, disclaimer: I'm a Mercurial fan.<p>There are two big things git has traditionally done better than Mercurial: lightweight branching, and rebasing.  Both were possible in Mercurial using mq (plus qguards, in the case of lightweight branching), but the experience was rather clumsy.  I didn't mind putting up with it, since, at the time the two systems came out, Mercurial was markedly easier to use than git.  But, over the last year, git closed a lot of the usability gap, while Mercurial has held almost completely still, and that's resulted in a lot of arguments that Mercurial's time had passed, and git was the way to go.<p>The good news is that this release fully eliminates git's first advantage, and either eliminates, eliminates and beats, or fails to address the second, depending on where you're coming from.  The easy news to process: the rebase extension enables full git-style rebasing, end of story.  You can do an automatic pull and rebase via `hg pull --rebase`, if that's what you want, or you can do more customized rebasing via `hg rebase`.  So that's done, and, based on my use in production environments, works very well.<p>Now, Mercurial 1.1 introduces real lightweight branching--no mq hackery--via an extension called `bookmarks`, which ships with Mercurial.  These provide identical capabilities and benefits as git's local branches.  The complicated discussion we can have revolves around bookmark <i>semantics</i>.    bookmarks, like git branches, are basically ""floating tags""--tags that mark a head in the repo's DAG, and that move with that head as you issue additional commits.  The difference comes from the fact that bookmarks very directly expose what's going on, whereas git's branch command hides what's going on behind what I personally feel is a more intuitive UI.  So, the argument is: is exposing what's actually going on better, because it gives you more power; equivalent, since the functionality provided is identical; or worse, because too much implementation is exposed in interface.  I personally need more time to sort out preconceived bias of what micorbranching should look like, from the bookmark extension in particular.",1228286845

4,384110,comment,383781.0,384090.0,0,0,netcan,,,"I don't disagree with you. Defaults on an individual level are consumers' fault. Magnifying that to the point where the worldwide economy is at risk is banks' fault. They leveraged to a point where everything breaks down at a point that isn't totally unlikely. I can understand that in light of that, seeing banks hound people to take credit makes people understandably cranky.<p>I think the fact that it's consumers' fault is the interesting point here. This article implies that on average consumers cannot be trusted to loan what they can afford and/or pick the correct credit card. Not because they are being tricked or because information is unavailable or any other market imperfection. Because the average decision making is bad. What does that do to economic models?",1228286681

11,384102,comment,383781.0,384033.0,0,0,netcan,,,"Yeah sure. It's not strange that the lender should choose to do this given the facts. That isn't strange.<p>What is strange is that if the lenders choose not to do this, & lend (ie sell) as much as people will borrow (buy) like most other markets, there will be a massive default rate. Presumable a person should be able to work out if they can repay a loan before taking it. Presumably they don't want to have a loan they cannot afford to repay.<p>Common sense (& the assumptions underlying economic theory) would suggest that this should be enough to make sure people don't loan too much in all but end cases.<p>The reason I say it's strange is that the running assumption that doesn't even seem to need to be mentioned any more in these sorts of articles is that consumers are determined to take out loans they can't repay & the banks, governments or whoever else need to police this. Supposedly, a big chunk of this 'crisis' (the sub-prime) comes down to that: banks not policing enough.<p>It's strange that no one thinks it's strange to assume that everyone wants to bankrupt themselves.",1228286075
