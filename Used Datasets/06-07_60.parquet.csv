I'm pretty sure it does.<p>Yes, it does, but I was responding to you comment that ""expected logarithmic height is achieved just by randomly permuting the input sequence"". It achieves the <i>effect</i> of having randomly permuted the input sequence, but it does not <i>actually</i> perform input sequence permutation.<p>> Can you give me an example of that, then?<p>Any tree with nodes that store the number of descendents (weight-balanced search trees, for instance) take Omega(lg n) for finger updates. See also ""Heterogeneous Decomposition of Degree-Balanced Search Trees and Its Applications"" by Shan Leung (""Maverick"") Woo, section 1.1.4 and ""Robust balancing in B-trees"" by Scott Huddleston and Kurt Mehlhorn. They both mention that the original flavors of B-tree have sequences of k insertion and deletion operations where the update costs alone are omega(k).<p><a href=""http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2009/CMU-CS-09-133.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2009/CMU-CS-09-13...</a><p><a href=""http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mehlhorn/ftp/Huddleston-Mehlhorn-RobustBalancing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mehlhorn/ftp/Huddleston-Mehlhorn-...</a><p>Another example is repeated insertion and then deletion of a single element in a full binary tree viewed as an AVL tree. Node height (or even single bit height-balance information like ""which child is heavier"") propagates all the way to the root for both operations.",1316585955.0
