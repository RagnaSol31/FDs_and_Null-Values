He picked a neighborhood, mapped every business around it, knew exactly how many accountants and offices were around his area through a survey, you get the idea. With the evidence, he talked to a number of investors. One investor gave him a pretty high valuation. In a meeting with another investor soon after, the investor asked a number of questions,  hmm-ed the answers and escorted the founder out the door. In investor then promptly returned to his desk, opened up his rolodex and called the best retail exec on the list to start what is now Office Depot - in a different part of the country, to avoid a direct clash, because chains such as these expand geographically.<p>While this is an extreme case, it is not uncommon.

If the research surfaces a better competitor, the firm doesn&",
