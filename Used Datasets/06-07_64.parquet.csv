It's amazing how fine-tuned an intuition one develops after a while for code one's looking at when its structure isn't distorted by extraneous demands of the language. In Lisp, I find I am frequently (and often subliminally) processing visual cues to figure out what I'm looking at, prior to parsing what the text says, which is a slower thing to do.<p>Actually, you get the same effect in any language. You can tell a lot about, say, a Java program by printing it out, sticking the printout on a wall, and walking back 10 feet. But Lisp's regularity makes this effect richer, more powerful, and workable-with at much smaller scale.<p>Unfamiliarity reactions are not properties of the unfamiliar thing.

Recently launched a new site - http://www.megavocab.com - Its a Video Dictionary.<p>I am confused about the best way to market the site. It is clearly not a SEO play since the competition is sites like dictionary.com , merriam-webster , thesaurus.com which are long established , more so this site is video something that google does not understand completely when compared to text<p>I am trying to hit facebook and twitter to get some traction but that is a tad slow ...<p>Any suggestion how can reach a relevant target market in a scalable way ?",1306131521.0

65,2575124,story,,,2,2,cosmorocket,Ask HN: A detailed JavaScript frameworks information source,,"I work with JavaScript closely these days and sometimes I look for new libraries or frameworks that could fulfill my needs so that to not invent a wheel. And sometimes I find almost accidentally solutions that I think I just could overlook because there is not so much buzz around them. For example, I have been looking for some MVC/MVVM solution in JavaScript and accidentally found Spine. It can be that someone else missed a library or a framework just because it's not as hot as jQuery but still can be useful. So, what if there were are resource collecting and sorting info about JavaScript libraries and frameworks with categories, ratings, a way to submit or share opinions. With info about compatibility between this library and that one, what feature this library has that another one doesn't. It's a place where you could come, click ""MVC Frameworks"" category or ""jQuery image gallery plugins"" and see all libraries from the category with comparisons, pros and cons etc. I am thinking about beginning creating something like this because I think I could need this and asking you if you think it could be useful and interesting. Any suggestions are appreciated!",1306131342.0

I haven't logged on for a while, but when I was involved a few years ago I had a great time building multi-agent systems inside of SL and pushing the limits of what their environment can do.  For example, here is a multi-agent ant simulation I did a few years ago: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehEzRUu4_RM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehEzRUu4_RM</a>  I also wrote self-synchronizing virtual fireflies and physics simulations.<p>For a programmer, it's a 3D, multi-user IDE where you can learn new programming techniques in real time with your friends.  Yes, people also use it for weird things and porn (unlike the rest of the Internet).

Basketball wouldn't be all that interesting if you could just do whatever you wanted; oil painting is more interesting than photography because it is so much harder than pointing and clicking (sorry for the cheapshot, but you see my point); automatically generated music is never as cool as something that sounds like the composer struggled to make it happen.  I think we re-live the creative process with its challenges when we experience real art (you can feel the challenge in a hard guitar solo, for instance); if there is no challenge for the creator, there is no human experience for the audience to share.
