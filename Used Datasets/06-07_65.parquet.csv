For even more fun, throw in Pakistan, North Korea or (really stretching here, because they don't do formal nation state like  diplomacy  or maintain records thereof) the Taliban or Al Quaeda.<p>I suspect a good portion of the people who decry WikiLeaks today would be analysing this data, or otherwise using it to draw insights to further US interests and lauding Assange as a hero, while the Chinese (or whoever) would be making the ""this endangers our people/troops""  and ""Wikileaks is irresponsible"" argument.<p>I doubt US citizens would be doubting Assange's ""agenda"" or saying things like ""many of the documents being leaked contain information that was exchanged under the assumption of privacy."" and so they shouldn't be public and so on. I suspect people would laud Assange as some kind of heroic figure for exposing an enemy regime at great personal risk.<p>Is Assange a US citizen? If not why should he care about the impact on the USA? Would an American care about the impact on say Chinese diplomacy before he exposed any records he had on their thinking?<p>Nothing wrong with being nationalistic/patriotic as long as you are aware of your biases (if any) therefrom. Most HNers are Americans and the discussion here is somewhat biased in that direction of whether this is good or bad  for the USA. That is just one possible perspective of many and hardly universal.

Largely the policy systems countries choose are based on the demographic, values, economic values, etc.  Germany's economic systems work for Germany because they are build for Germany.<p>I recognize that this article is not directly making the argument that the US should convert to a German style trade and employment system, but it implied multiple times.

Techcrunch and YC are not in any way responsible for the economic environment that has been forming over the past decade.  We're experiencing the second wave of the tech boom from the 1990's.  TC and YC are cheerleaders for what was already occurring.<p>* Recession/weak job market for programmers is a thing of the past, at least in Silicon Valley.<p>The job market is weak, in terms of quality jobs and pay.  Outside SV the job market for job seekers is absymal.  There are many skilled programmers who don't live in SV and can earn more money developing websites and web apps than they can in the job market.  Companies are being left with open jobs and unable to fill them because the talent is being eliminated from the job pool.<p>* Reducing this to $50/month has no meaningful impact on startup costs.<p>I was referring to the large-scale cloud computing, not replacing virtual dedicated hosts with VPS.  I don't have exact numbers but I'd gamble that it costs 2 orders of magnitude less money to develop a large-scale datacenter than it did a decade ago.",1291010929.0

If neither gdp growth (below other European countries in the same category as Germany) nor median income growth is a good metric, what do you suggest instead to measure German success ?<p>Your comment made me realize I may have not been very clear - the issue is that Germany's success is measured in terms of exportation as is, which is known to be a common fallacy in economics. If it were because German's products became better at a cheaper price, then it would have been a good thing, but I am arguing it has been mostly through artificial deflation (income stagnation instead of money deflation as this is impossible in the eurozone).<p>This is not very polemic, btw, and is pretty much agreed upon by quite a few people, independently of their political inclination (see e.g. <a href=""http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/03/martin-wolf-china-germany-commiting-world-to-deflation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/03/martin-wolf-china-ger...</a> for one reference)",1291010910.0
