Chinese firms will start to evolve their software to local tastes and will slowly set themselves apart from mere clones that don't translate well. That will be followed by free form borrowing of the best ideas from multiple sites  and that will be followed by local innovations. And at that point China will begin to export their software as the world wants to talk to them (much the way you'd join LinkedIn from abroad if you wanted to do business with Americans).,1302850497.0

Although I do think 100k is possible, even if unlikely(say 4-5 hours a day from 2-21, then 18 a day from 21-present). I do think he's probably averaged more than 8 hours a day since he turned pro if you include all activities that are meant to improve his ability on the golf course. That's clearly pretty close to the upper bound but more likely than 10k.<p>Finally I agree that it's dismissive towards incredible golfers and I think that's why it's so many people looked at the article and commented here. I have no doubt that if someone puts in 10k hours over 6 years they would likely be a damn good golfer(better than scratch) but touring pro level is very unlikely. The issue in my mind that this article is stupid because either 1) It's obvious that you could get very good but perhaps not incredible at something after 10k hours of practice or 2) because we go by the title and realize that becoming a touring pro after not touching a golf club in the first 30 years of your life is not at all likely.",1302850439.0

33,2449666,comment,2448654.0,2449596.0,3,0,wikyd,,,"Holy lord is that a lot of risk to accumulate doing a full rewrite and deploying it all at once.  I think the hardest part about rewriting an app is knowing about all the edge cases, kludges, etc. that accumulate over the years.  It makes sense that the person who knows the most about the product and its dirty secrets would be much more capable of rewriting the app quickly than a newly hired employee.<p>As a counterpoint, last year I joined a startup as the first technical member.  I migrated a PHP application written by an inept contractor (terrible DB layout, SQL queries in the views, most features buggy and incomplete, etc.) to Rails piece-meal.  I had very little experience with Rails or PHP prior to this, but was able to rewrite the app in the course of a few months, while adding new features and continuing product development.  I simply placed nginx in front of both the PHP and Rails app servers and rewrote the auth system for both apps so that cookies/credentials could be shared.  Then it was a matter of migrating sections of the app over one-by-one.  There was some hairiness in how the Rails side linked to non-Rails pages, but that code was gradually replaced as the rewrite progressed.<p>Even despite the abominable DB schema from the original PHP app (which, in fairness, had nothing to do with PHP), Rails was flexible enough to allow me to override its conventions and map tables to models with joins, etc.  Overall, it was much simpler than I thought it would be and after the rewrite was complete, it was pretty simple to write migrations to start organizing the DB schema into something coherent.",1302850068.0

PHP is a clumsy mess, but it gets the job done and I am a firm believer in importance of being first to market.<p>Cite my sources: When I came out of university I had what I thought was a very good grasp of what software should be, and that ""elegant"" well written software would dominate the market.\nTotally not true. The best example is the accounting system ""Attache"" in Australia ... it was the WORST software I have ever used. They only recently (in the last couple of years) got the ability to open more than one window at a time <i>in an mdi windows application</i> !! .. Attache is without a doubt the most successful accounting software in Australia, despite the fact that it's a dog. Why?? Because they were first to market. They were there on Day 1 with a product that met the minimum requirements (e.g. it RAN)<p>I often see people who underestimate the importance of being first to market ...

I have an enduring memory of sitting outside at a restaurant, on a beautiful day, with my roommate, who was a political science major.  At one point he started pulling out his notes and an essay and wanted my thoughts, and we spent the next hour discussing various minutae of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<p>Another memory that vividly stands out is being at a friend's house party one evening.  One guy, a arts major from Argentina, for some reason made what seemed like the best tasting beer in the world in a red bucket, and we talked for a while about how he managed to make it.  Afterwards he displayed an unusual, tenacious, and passionate interest in alternating-current (AC) and as I started breaking down the basic physics and EE behind it a larger and larger group of people gathered around to pester me with questions.<p>I love computers man but not everything is online.

During its first few decades, the United States took the key\nsecrets of the Industrial Revolution from England, Scotland and France and launched its own industrial economy. Two centuries later, Japan and then Korea developed by\nadapting American manufacturing, raising the quality and lowering costs. These days, China is doing it with much success, moving up the innovation ladder at a rapid rate.<p>Piggybackers ride on the backs of rich nations by doing more and more of their manufacturing and service work at far lower costs. India is practicing the art of\npiggybacking right now, using advanced computing and communications technologies to perform software development, tele-services, and even high-level innovation at a fraction of the labor costs compared to performing the same jobs in the United States or Western Europe. A recent study showed that one in ten U.S. software jobs will be exported to places like India and China over the next five years.<p>Finally, leapfrogs skip over inappropriate technologies and embrace new ones, such as Finlands sudden break from Soviet domination and its rapid adoption and development of new inventions like wireless networks.<p>""</i>",1302847826.0
