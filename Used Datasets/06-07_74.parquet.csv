I'd been driving pizza delivery and in general coasting through life after dropping out of college. I had wanted to be a programmer when I grew up but a personality conflict between myself and the head of the CS department at school convinced me to hit the bricks.<p>Anyway I was doing a delivery to a local apartment complex on a windy day and on my way back to the car this little pink piece of paper blew across the parking lot and fetched up next to my shoe. I picked it up and inspected it. It was printed on both sides, one side had some kind of spam advertisement for carpet cleaning or real estate or something, but the other side caught my eye. All it said was ""If you want something you've never had, you have to do something you've never done"".<p>While it would make a great narrative to say I went back and quit my dead end job immediately and dedicated myself to getting my shit together, it was another year before I started putting my life in order. But ever since that day, whenever I felt like I was in a rut or whatever, I'd remember that little piece of paper.<p>Eventually I got my shit together, educated myself on a couple of programming languages and joined the workforce as a developer, married, bought a house. While I don't think that piece of paper is solely responsible for my successes, the idea ""If you want something you've never had, you have to do something you've never done"" has been kicking around in my head ever since, and I'm sure it's colored at least some of the choices I've made since that day.",1292482105.0

I see two courses of action: (1) we could take the hard road and seek to catch all dishonest students and punish them or (2) we could make cheating extremely difficult with some simple changes.<p>I think (2) is the prudent course of action. The majority of cheating that I am aware of is only possible because professors reuse assignments and homework/exam questions from previous years.  Solutions are simply passed down each year. One notable exception is in our theory classes, where the faculty make the effort to produce unique homework and exam questions every semester. I believe cheating in the theory classes is far lower as a result and I am extremely thankful that the faculty put forth this effort.<p>I am cognizant of the work required to generate unique assignments each semester.  However, as demonstrated by how departments typically handle quals, it is doable if the workload is distributed.  It is my sincere hope that this becomes standard practice. It is the easiest and most fair way to handle the cheating problem. The reason why such a system usually doesn't get implemented in practice is because it requires the entire department to commit to undergraduate education, which is quite difficult to achieve at research universities.^<p>Some other minor additions to the above system that have a good payoff/cost ratio: (1) static analyzers to detect duplicate code submission and (2) higher weights on exams to punish those who share complete answers on homework assignments.<p>^Don't take this as a condemnation of undergraduate education in the CS department at UIUC.

I'll add this: the heavily-edited version got a hell of a lot more attention, and it was indisputably a work of propaganda.  Releasing the full video on the side doesn't excuse the misrepresentations in the edited version.<p>In regards to the death and/or suffering I presume to have been caused by these leaks: no I can't prove it.  I can't sweep into a war-torn third world country with a CSI-style team and determine, of the dozens of people abducted and/or murdered each weak by the taliban and/or al qaida and/or various warlords, which were killed as a result of these leaks and which were killed for other reasons.  However, I can take those thugs at their word when they stated that they would use this information for reprisals.\nNor can I be sure which particular ambushes against NATO troops benefited from knowledge of NATO tactics.  Nor can I be sure how many ambushes could have been avoided if sympathetic Afghanis hadn't been too afraid to give tips because they could no longer trust the Americans to protect their identities.  However, it is unreasonable to assume that these effects are not taking place.<p>EDIT 2:\n""The Apache video was edited to show the chain of events that led to the killing of a bunch of journalists...but I don't believe permission to fire would have been granted if the guys in the helicopter hadn't been so scared and hadn't embellished their account of the people on the ground.""<p>The video was edited to make them look rash and to make their account look embellished.  And I really don't know where you keep getting this idea of ""scared;"" I never hear anything remotely like fear in the voices on the tape.  It wasn't just a ""bunch of journalists,"" it was a few journalists standing around in the midst of a much larger group of armed men who were shooting at American troops, with no indication whatsoever that they were not members of the larger group.<p>I call it propaganda because it leaves out the part about the armed men shooting at Americans and focuses on the part about journalists being killed.  I call it propaganda because it leaves out the very considered discussion of the role of the van, which stretches back to before the initial engagement when the pilots noticed it driving around the area in a loiter pattern reminiscent of insurgent support tactics.  In short, I call it propaganda because it removes all context in order to make the decision to fire look as feckless and cavalier as possible.<p>""As for the leaked information putting lives at risk, Wikileaks offered to let the US Government redact any information it saw fit to. This offer was refused.""<p>Frankly, I call BS.  Their ""offer"" had unacceptable strings attached, such as acknowledging the legitimacy of the release of large quantities of classified materials by wikileaks.  By statute, the government can't just arbitrarily decide to declare that it's OK to do something like that.  Furthermore, sufficient time was not provided to properly go through all of the materials, a complaint raised by many (former) wikileaks partners/employees/volunteers.  Finally, I am deeply skeptical that they really would have redacted ANYTHING the U.S. Government asked for.<p>In regards to your attempt to compare the U.S. to dictatorships: There are legitimate reasons for states to keep secrets, and the fact that you happen to personally disagree with particular secrets doesn't change the fact that the decision to keep those secrets was not made by any one person, but rather by following processes established by duly elected representatives.<p>On the day that the U.S. turns a foreign country into another U.S. state by force of arms, I will mail you a check for $100.  Until then, please don't make such ridiculous claims about the motivations behind our foreign policy: go ahead and question the judgement to keep the troops there, but don't claim implausible imperial motivations.",1292480098.0

We are less concerned with whether students learn the right thing than whether they learn in the way that we rely upon to measure how well they learn when compared to their peers. We do this without even having considered whether the measurement is even useful, much less necessary or even counter-productive. We do it without considering whether encouraging sin is a good way to teach morals. We do it for no better reason than tradition, habit, and inertia.""",1292479788.0

In low density towns you can build horizontally, which uses less human, energy, material resources than building upwards.  In a low density town, parks and fields have low enough usage that the grass can be maintained on its own, in cities the fields need to re-sodded often and require extra fertilizer.  In cities you end up building roads on multiple levels, railways underground, etc, all of which adds enormous resource costs to construction.  Cities have so much pavement they are noticeably hotter in the summer, which requires more air conditioning.<p>On the flip side, low density towns require more asphalt per capita and more day-to-day gasoline usage.<p>Overall though, it's not on the face of it obvious to me that low density is more resource intensive.  I'd be interested if you have links to detailed research on the matter.<p>It's also not obvious to me that small towns are more subsidized.  Bridges, highways, subways, etc, going into a city are all government funded.
