22,2749736,comment,2749559.0,2749559.0,4,0,briandon,,,"From the post: <i>A few years ago, before the CEO cared a whit about social networking or identity, a Google User Experience researcher named Paul Adams created a slide deck called the Real Life Social Network. In a very long and well-illustrated talk, he makes the point that there is an impedence mismatch between what you share on facebook and your interactions in real life. So when you share a photo of yourself doing something crazy at a party, you don't intend for your aunt and uncle, workmates or casual acquaintances to see it.</i><p>In real life, the crazy party photo you would be showing your friend would be on your phone's screen or (in olden days) it would be a hardcopy photograph.  Putting your phone or the hardcopy photo back into your pocket would be the end.  The potential for blowback would be limited to whatever could be whipped up by your friend's verbal description of what he'd seen.<p>Whenever you put anything on the Internet, though, there's not really any way to control its spread. Whatever privacy mechanisms a sharing/social site puts in place will be broken by crackers at some point or part of the system will break on its own and leak information.  Long before that, though, one of the people you permitted to access the controlled content will simply copy it and share it with other people.<p>Don't put anything online that you wouldn't be comfortable with your grandma or work colleagues/boss reading.",1310366727.0

Do you sacrifice the mobile experience to cater to the 10-year-old computer crowd?<p>Even if you forge ahead through the cognitive dissonance to create a graphic-design/visual-brand-centric priority system, for a given budget you have to decide whether you want to dumb it down for consistency's sake or create a more polished design that 50% of people will see today and 90% will see in a few years.<p>The bottom line is that these decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis, and pounding on some creative hubris about the sanctity of each pixel will not guarantee anyone a more successful project.

Startups like Airbnb which have engaged in this sort of behavior are a little entrenched by now and have considerable traction, but for littler guys like Teevox, this is pretty strong stuff I'd imagine.<p>pg obviously isn't going to micromanage every startup he funds every season, yet there's clearly a problem.<p>edit: Then again, it could be argued these sorts of things are necessary in some cases to build traction. YC startups just need to learn to be better trolls and build up better, more believable stories. Or actually be more transparent in cases like this which don't involve divulging actual userbase yet (which is crucial in the case of something like Reddit, which had to do this in a sense. Who wants to use a dead/empty site?). The fake dude and all was unnecessary. Another small company in the same space (in this same thread) was more transparent about it all and this was appreciated by the targeted market and gave them good karma and brand value in the minds of readers who'll stumble across the name again and again.<p>edit again: also some commenters on Reddit have pointed out other shady tactics including blocking jtv ads which are the income source for jtv and the players, as well as soliciting donations under the guise of the heroic lone coder giving back to the community...which turns out to be a violation of Paypal TOS.

I don't think your examples give a counter-proof here, most Smalltalk compilers are JIT compilers, so it's really an argument in favour of the authors orginal thesis, and Common Lisp introduces a lot of extra type annotations to achieve good compilation results.
