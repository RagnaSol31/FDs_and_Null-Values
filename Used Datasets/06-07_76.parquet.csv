I can't speak for the dev team here, but I, personally, would love to hire a test dev intern here in NYC.<p>Want to create a model-based test for our platform layer (in Ruby)? Want to create an AI to combat our back end Java ""director"" AI (yeah, in Java, of course or tell us how you'd rather do it)? Want to test render code (as in ""game dev"" sort of render code - perf-sensitive code that grids out video and sync'd audio to the limits the hardware will allow)? Do you hate ""the cloud"" (Amazon's in our case) and want to show everyone how fragile that is? Well . . . I would welcome an intern who wants to understand any of those things deeply and <i>break dev code</i>. So pick one and tell me how you want to break it.<p>The company supports open-sourcing your test code. Share it. Put it on your resume. Put us on your resume!<p>I only want someone who wants to blow up and/or set fire to and/or just do horrible, horrible things to the dev code.<p>My name is Drew. I break things for a living.<p>You? Write code and want to SMASH things? Obliterate them? Pulverize? Have other destructive fantasies but don't want to talk about it? Ask for me at devjobs@animoto.com with the subject ""SDET Intern"".",1298960579.0

Why not just say they're the same??!</i><p>One advantage is it gives you the flexibility to demonstrate the first limb using one technique, and the second limb with a completely unrelated approach.
