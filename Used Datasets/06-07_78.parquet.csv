At this point, the context of this war should be noted - it occurred, in part, because of the manner in which World War I ended, an armistice (however imbalanced in its terms), which was certainly a factor in the outbreak of World War II.

But also consider that I wanted to show how people from other countries think of the situation too. I mean, people tend to think of country B in country's A terms and framing of the discussion, so I tried to do something like the opposite.<p><i>I was not aware that the mainstream view was that Japan was surrendering before the atomic bombings.</i><p>That view is widely held all around the world. Try to find some Europeans thinking the bombs were ""needed"". There is also evidence that us leaders knew about it, it was just a showcase, mainly to scare off USSR. Besides, it's of little consequence if Japan was surrendering or not: the war was going on with conventional weapons even in more dire times, including the Normandy invasion, so nothing called at that time to drop atomic bombs on civilians (if anything ever does). Especially considering that Japan was at the time under attack by conventional bombs, tons of them, that had burned most of its cities and killed hundreds of thousands.<p><i>Easier said for Iraq than Afghanistan. It already had chaos, civil war, etc. at the onset of the invasion. Expected returns from mineral wealth hardly justify the cost.</i><p>It had the Taliban rule, but not much civil war anymore. And certainly no mass chaos and deaths, like it does post invasion. And it's not just ""mineral wealth"", it's also setting foot in a strategic area.<p><i>I'm guessing you mean King for one. Not sure who'd other would be? (Malcom X? He advocated racial seperation).</i><p>Was thinking of X, yeah. Well, even if he advocated racial separation, just means he was killed just as a pro-black activist, instead of a anti-segregation activist. Both reasons seem bad to me.<p><i>Either way, it's a tall argument that the country (government?) assassinated them.</i><p>Who said the government? I said ""the country"". To show it in the same vain as people that blame other countries for things done not only by the government but also by local religious nuts, teams etc.<p><i>Iran executes people at not only a far higher rate but even in absolute numbers. It also applies death penalty to a far wider range of crimes.</i><p>Not much consolation. One's too many for my tastes. YMMV.<p><i>Sure, but they aren't running the government</i><p>No, they only run the previous government. And no one can talk openly against them, or they will lose office pronto.<p><i>As opposed to being charged with blasphemy in country B.</i><p>You mean like in the Salem trials? What, that was long ago?<p>Then tell me, why Country A, that stopped practicing slavery later than other countries, introduced women's voting later than other countries, stopped racial segregation later than other countries, has not yet stopped practicing the death penalty unlike other countries, etc etc, thinks other countries should all be on the same timeline as it does, as to what laws they have?",1328768043.0
