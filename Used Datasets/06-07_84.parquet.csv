Different?<p>Faith is ""Being sure of what you hope for and certain of what you do not see."" (Hebrews 11:1) Now, how can you be sure of what you hope for if there is not due evidence to have that kind of certainty? Also, you can't be certain of what you do not see without other evidence (e.g we can't see air but we know it exists from a plethora of reasons).<p>I'm not sure that Christianity is about ""simply believing"" -- I mean yes that describes the effect of Christ's <i>grace</i> (all you need is belief/acceptance to receive it)... but that's not <i>why</i> I choose to believe in a God.<p>The rational / irrational (who cares) reason for my belief in God has to do with the things that are historical texts and events, key elements include the existence of Jesus / his effect on the world, as well as the written word recorded close to after his death. Is the old testament just a silly mythology, or a long way to prove a single point (that humans could never achieve the nature of this thing we call God)? Maybe, I don't claim to know. But I feel that the new testament and its claims as well as the testaments of some people who died refusing to renounce what they saw as truth are very compelling in terms of conveying something important that happened. Do I believe that some really crazy, amazing things happened back then? I think I have due reason to believe it. I mean, I just find it so hard to believe that all those people who wrote the letters and books that make up the bible are crazy. They were crazy enough to die gruesomely and still refuse to renounce their belief, and the thing that separates them from suicide bombers is their apparent sanity in the writing as well as their message of love. <i>Personally</i> speaking I think the evidence is enough for me to put my faith in it, to be sure of what I'm hoping for (that there is a loving God out there). Hey, worst case scenario I was wrong and I loved more people and used my life to help others, right?<p>In addition, it's not like the dude Jesus was preaching ""thank god for dead soldiers"" or ""kill the infidels"" or ""scare them straight"" or anything moronic like that. He preached humility, love, forgiveness and a bunch of things (personally, I feel) the world actually needs. I don't know how anyone can be mad at me for choosing to believe in something like that.<p>Now, I can similarly understand that what I see as evidence may not be evidence enough for another person, and so they may not believe the same thing as me, and that's fine. But for me to tell them that they are dumb for not seeing it, or for them to tell me that I am dumb because I choose to believe something, iono if that's a good thing. We all get the same data and we draw our own conclusions.<p>Am I evangelical? Yeah, I have to say yes. If you want to know more about what I believe, I am happy to spend time talking or do a bible study. Do I shove religion down other peoples' throats or get all political about crap?

The reason its difficult to get a merchant account through other payment processors is because chargebacks ARE EXPENSIVE.\n(payment processors will not accept a merchant that is above a 2% chargeback rate). This means that Square will be susceptible to a larger amount of chargebacks (which means that most of their angel funding will likely be in an escrow account to protect against chargebacks).<p>Great idea but we'll see how these issues are handled.",1266386906.0

When a [x] value is larger than the size of the first, just subtract the first's size from x, and find that value in the second.  It's even still O(1) time.<p>Viola, you've now got nearly <i>double</i> the storage of what you can reference, and it'll work in a generic case, but you'll never be able to refer to anything larger than your index-number can reach.<p>To make matters worse, do you know if your library isn't doing this for you?  It'd allow you to extend your array without having to copy the whole thing, which saves a LOT of time on frequently-lengthening arrays.  The extremely small cost of checking an int's size before actually accessing the sub-array necessary is often negligible compared to duplicating potentially <i>billions</i> of values.",1266386880.0

In order for you to directly compare the two, you'd need to actually look at the derivative of the unemployment graph.<p>That's not to mention that the unemployment numbers aren't directly derived from the number of jobs gained/lost.  You can start generating jobs and still have unemployment stagnant for a variety of reasons (population and workforce growth, for example)<p>So, while this is the landing page for a political campaign, it is an honest visualization of the data.

By giving it to everyone you make everyone benefit which makes everyone want to keep it.  (The same principle that makes Social Security impossible to get rid of.)  But once government has taken that step, then there is no need for separate welfare programs, there is no reason for a job to provide a living wage (hence the removal of minimum wage), and there are not artificial barriers where a single mom on welfare has incentives to not work.<p>Another crazy idea I have is to fix the student loan programs so that parents are expected to have living costs that a reasonable for some time in this century (currently they are appropriate for the 1960s) but then only make students at universities whose average tuition is in the bottom 75% eligible to receive any kind of government financial aid.

And with 64-bit, it's effectively impossible for this to happen (except in exceedingly excessive circumstances, and then you better not be using such limited primitives, or suffer the consequences).<p>I mean, heck.  On equal footing, you san say that it's a ""bug"" that you can't access array indices past what your integer can refer to, but you could conceivably push data in further than that if your array implementation allows it.  The article's bug happens at 1/2 that limit, but it's the same thing, just slightly harder to find.  <i>Slightly</i>, mind you, as something like this should be checked any time you approach the limits of your formats.<p>Here's something to ask: <i>which</i> are broken?  Example code, code made for a use significantly below 2^31 values, or <i>code in use in cases which may exceed this value</i>?  I'd be willing to bet it's the first and second.
