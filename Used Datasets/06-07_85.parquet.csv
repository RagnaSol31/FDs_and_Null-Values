Existing tools can do this with some success, but there are still some camera moves that prove to be more difficult (zooms, irregular movement, etc).<p>Artifacts caused by objects moving in the scene are often much more difficult to remove, at least when it comes to providing a generic solution, because &quot;reconstruction&quot; of the image requires fairly accurate information as to how those objects were moving. In the case of the rotating prop or wheel, it may be somewhat simple (the algorithm would still probably require user input of things like the center of rotation and speed), but in other cases, the motion may be quite complex (e.g., multiple wheels rotating in different directions/speeds, linear vs angular motion, etc).
