You would still need to provide some way of detecting in the compilation pipeline and intrinsifier that method you are looking at is indeed `Integer_bitAndFromInteger`. In this particular case you could look at the name of the native, but that does not work with those intrinsified methods that have Dart bodies. In those cases it would have to be @intrinsic(&quot;name of the intrinsic&quot;).<p>Right now we can write C++ code like this:<p><pre><code>    switch (recognized_kind()) {\n      case MethodRecognizer::kSmth:\n      case MethodRecognizer::kSmthElse:\n        break;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf we start to relying on strings - this code will become less readable (or alternatively you would have to map strings into C++ enumeration which would require a list quite list one of the above).<p>To be honest aesthetically I like annotations, so I would like to use them to replace these lists, but that does not really solve anything or improve much. Even more: there is really no fundamental difference between having an annotation and a list like that, so I don&",
