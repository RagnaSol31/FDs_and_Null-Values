Where everyone knows English and has no trouble using English tools and consuming English content.<p>Same goes for measurement systems (metric), time, currency, and other formats. I reckon it would simplify our lives greatly and spare us the trouble of dealing with 1000s of encodings, multi-byte strings and different text directions.<p>Technological landscape is the only place where such unity between nations is possible, I tend to think that this is what should be pursued instead of translate-everything-everywhere approach.",1413356144.0

If the interviewer asked me to print the minimum number of drops and my code was a single print statement of the closed form answer, I wonder what the reaction would be.<p>Although the posted solution process is equivalent, my solution was to use dynamic programming when I had encountered this problem first. Once you have the recursion figured out, the closed form is a few algebraic steps away. One advantage of this is that now you can also optimize for the expected case, not just the worst case.<p>There is hardly any code to write once you have solved it on paper (or solved it in your head if you are much smarter).<p>What I really liked about the post was the number of insights in the hints and how the hints are laid out gradually. I missed a lot of those, cause the moment I saw the DP I stopped thinking. It became a problem of just solving the recursion. There is always a lot of value in getting your insights about a problem.",1413354769.0
