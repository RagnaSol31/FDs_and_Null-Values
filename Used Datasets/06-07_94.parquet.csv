Multirotors have enjoyed open source development by enthusiasts so far, and they built heavily on the experience of the RC enthusiasts, and they repurposed tons of hardware that is suitable for small applications.

But, any size/budget/project bigger than that is bound by a different progress curve. I bet it can be done, and if it is practical, it will be done too.
