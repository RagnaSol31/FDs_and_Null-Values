1,2015504,story,,,6,4,sabj,Ask HN: Help me understand Python 2.x vs 3.x,,"I've been trying to teach myself Python recently, with mixed success. (Recently, I have been a little seduced by the availability of resources and community around Ruby, since my interest is mostly in doing things on the web - so e.g. Rails vs. Django, even though I conceptually like the later, for some logistical reasons I am finding the former to be a little tempting to experiment with more.)<p>However, a principal question I still have concerns the different versions of Python. [http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3]<p>I have read the Wiki and understand some of the differences, or lack-of-differences, but am still unclear. For example, I know some servers or services (eg Google App Engine) are at one version, while others are at another. Should I be concerned about any of this? Is there any reason to try to use Python 3 at present? Etc?<p>Thanks for any insights here!",1292569115.0

6,2015498,comment,2014991.0,2015252.0,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"<i>Land of Lisp</i> is probably the best computer book I've read in the 5 or 6 years I've been programming. It manages to be informative and fun at the same time. Where most books teach you how to write boring crap like JSON parsers, LoL walks you through Hunt the Wumpus and teaches you a couple of useful graph algorithms along the way. It devotes a chapter to web applications where you write a web interface using a web server you wrote yourself for a game you wrote yourself. There's even a program that uses a very rudimentary evolutionary algorithm to evolve organisms in a virtual world.<p>Thanks to LoL, I dug up archives of computer magazines from the seventies and eighties[1] (<i>Creative Computing</i>, <i>Compute!</i> etc.) The ""hacker spirit"" sure has changed in the last 30 years. Those magazines were playful. They even had entire sections devoted to computer games and interesting puzzles you could solve using a computer (Core War, for example, first appeared in one such magazine). These days people write Twitter clients and todo lists that run on Google App Engine.<p>LoL is one of very few books published in the last decade that capture the hacker spirit. It ranks right up there with <i>_why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby</i> and <i>Programming Perl</i>[2].<p>Right now I'm having a blast re-writing old BASIC games in Lisp and then writing programs to beat those games. Most games are easy to beat, but some of them can pose quite a challenge.

39,2015461,comment,2015124.0,2015124.0,0,0,trotsky,,,"People need to square up in their heads that the retail experience necessitates higher prices. If you don't want to pay the higher prices, that's fine - but then what are you doing in the store in the first place? Pretty much everything is cheaper online. If you need to go to best buy or borders to find the product you want on amazon, the whole process is unsustainable.<p>Also, just like supporting locally owned business, supporting locally operated business is in your best interests. They create local jobs and contribute to the local tax base.<p>I know this isn't a popular opinion, but the sales tax disparity needs to go. The states get triple penalized by it - lack of tax revenue, lack of jobs and it creates a disincentive to online retailers to spread their operations. Maybe they all need to drop it entirely and raise income taxes to make it up (which isn't a bad idea, sales tax being at least somewhat regressive). If not, they need to find a way to collect it.<p>I have no doubt that this trend will accelerate though, I am guilty of doing it myself.
