16,10021208,comment,10021018.0,10021153.0,0,0,hansibansi,,,"First of all, the reason why they differentiate product and general search is, because Google injects a carousel at the top of the page, regardless of its relevancy. Thus, the differentiation. \nSecondly, the big discussion of abusing its market dominance was ultimately triggered by Yelp and other vertical search engines. Google first ripped of Yelp by scraping their content and then added it to their own Google Places search. After that, they decided to give their own service more relevancy. This would not be a problem, IF they were competition in the European market, but Google has an average market share of 90 percent in Europe (note, that it has up to 99 percent in other markets like Germany) and thus Yelp is super dependent on Google. \nOverall, this is NOT a fair market and Google has such a dominance in that market that new players are not likely (or ever) to appear. A 99 percent market share is a monopoly, there are not many non-government markets that experience such a malfunction.",1438930312.0

Silicon Valley sees the huge first-mover advantages and is moving as fast as possible to move into every liberalized market. But it makes no sense for a country to allow Silicon Valley to take these industries for themselves. This is the fastest growing industry for the next several decades with the best paying jobs.

It might put off the occasional eater of spicy food, but regular consumption depletes the neurotransmitters that generate the effect. It is an acquired immunity that can quickly escalate the level of spiciness required to perceive it. (You lose that immunity relatively quickly though.) Being able to eat almost arbitrarily spicy food is a trivially acquired ability.<p>Source: I eat quite a lot of habaneros and thai chilis, mostly because those are the peppers that taste strongly &quot;spicy&quot; to me on a day to day basis. If I eat too much on an ongoing basis, even the habaneros start to lose their spiciness. Most people have a &quot;spiciness&quot; threshold so low that the pepper is barely detectable to me. I was not born this way, peppers have been a regular part of my diet because I like the flavor and that confers a natural immunity to the effects.",1438929293.0
