Even if MD5 was a true source of randomness, the problem is still that you've only got 32 bits, so you'd expect a collision after 2^16 with a random function.<p>Besides, xoring the other bits does nothing to increase the security on non-broken hashing functions. Take the extreme case of xoring every bit to generate either a 0 or a 1.

No traction? Just put it anywhere, 'cause frankly, it doesn't matter.  Cheapest reputable VPS possible.  Let's say, Linode.<p>2. Scaling out, high concurrency and rapid growth? DEDICATED hardware from a QUALITY service provider--use rackspace, softlayer et al.  Have them rack the servers for you and you'll still get ~3 hour turnarounds on new server orders.  That's <i>plenty</i> fast for most kinds of growth.  No inventory to deal with, and with deployment automation you're really not doing much ""sysadmin-y"" work or requiring full timers that know what Cisco switch to buy.<p>3. Technology megacorp, top-100 site? Staff up on hardcore net admin and sysadmin types, colocate first, and eventually, take control of/design the entire datacenter.<p>I simply don't understand why so many of these high-traffic services continue to rely on VPSes for phase 2 instead of managed or unmanaged dedicated hosting.  The price/concurrent user is competitive or cheaper for bare metal.  Most critically, it's insanely hard to predictably scale out database systems with high write loads when you have unpredictable virtualized (or even networked) I/O performance on your nodes.",1300431059.0

24,2339618,story,,,50,11,bks,An Update on my Ask HN - 2223764,,"A few weeks ago I posted an Ask HN about what to do as my 3 next steps on a startup concept, and now I wanted to provide you with a quick update.   http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2223764<p>Based on some of the advice and information I received I decided that imperfect action was better than no action at all, so I went to my local San Diego Ruby meetup. I had some lengthy discussions with some of the folks that I met and concluded that as non-programmer attempting to manage full time hires was not practical and that subcontracting vs. full time was an appropriate next steps.<p>I then asked for recommendations, and along with a trusted and experienced PHP programming friend did some interviewing of the local talent. With the average cost estimates, timelines projections and learning curves - I figured it was time to expand my search rather than risk it with the two person companies that I was finding in San Diego.<p>I reached out to every provider listed on http://rubyonrails.org/ecosystem plus a list of people that they recommended to simply schedule an initial call.<p>My result, I was able to speak to 6 of the 17 providers that I called or emailed - the others did not even respond.<p>A few of them ""disqualified me"" during the initial calls as not having the budget, they suggested other trusted providers and sent me on my way. They did not get out of bed for less than $150,000 on a rails app and an additional $60,000 for the iPhone component. I certainly do appreciated them not wasting my time.<p>I had three fantastic conversations over the next two weeks and one of them said they said it was an awesome idea however they were not inspired to work in XYZ industry, but again I asked for the referral and called another set of providers.<p>After each of the calls and rejections I learned a ton about the vernacular and language of communicating my ideas to development teams and what is expected from the clients perspective in order to work effectively in an Agile environment.<p>So I refined my Keynote presentations, update my strategy and then something huge happened - I realized that part of the reason that I was not inspiring the providers was that I was not talking to them in the language that they wanted to hear....I was pitching business cases and they wanted 'user stories'.<p>So with the help of youtube / google I was able to get an immersive indoctrination into the distinctions of user stories, story carding, the differences between agile and waterfall / scrum and about 7 other Evernote notes full of info. After a few hours I was actually able to pick up the concepts and I have been giddy ever since.<p>Now I am not saying that I have ANY experience with the process, but it most certainly made sense! So I ended up building story cards and calling the providers back and communicating with a common language.  What a difference that has made.<p>It may seem simple to those of you that do this for a living but because I did not want to use something as complicated as Pivotal Tracker and I needed to build cards really efficiently that I could sort and that the providers could have access to.  I was unable to find any templates for the tools I already had so I build my own version in Keynote.  (the template is located here if it would help anyone - http://bit.ly/i1phXs)<p>I am talking to my preferred provider tomorrow to see if we can hash out a plan and I have put my investor on hold until we all know what we are in for - both in time, and money.<p>I recruited the CFO of a company that I used to work for to build a financial model based on some projections and API costs and things have really come together nicely. I have also been following the advice and formatting of the ""applying to ycombinator"" - not because I intend to apply but it does ask some very important questions and provides great insight into the getting to the ""why"" of the project.  (who knows, I might just click the submit button on Sunday after all of this effort)<p>This has been an amazing four week I have learned a lot - but it seems like a lifetime of experience 36 years :-) are really coming together to move mountains.<p>Thanks to HN for all the great insight and articles. As things progress, I will most certainly let you know.",1300430421.0

Although I had been doing small-scale computer repair for a while at this time, I still lacked both the self-confidence and maturity to do anything substantial. I did however want change from an awful summer spent mostly alone in my room. Upon returning to school that year I had received probably the worst people in my classes I could, or rather, the people most like me, the people who were terribly unmotivated, for one reason or many. The school had specifically picked out the academically troublesome students based on their previous year and put them in slightly smaller classes with lower expectations but more teacher assistance. This was a great move by the school. This alone was not enough though, as most of the students and myself made a dismal effort to do well, the ability in these people weren't lacking, it was motivation.<p>My lack of motivation was a progression, I didn't have much motivation to begin with but, due to a summer spent mostly alone I frequently browsed Warez forums and attempted to write a package manager for Windows (I had been taking an interest in Ubuntu and really liked apt-get), and released a customized version of Windows for them a couple years prior. That was the height of my productivity in that school year, because in the following December I had begun smoking a lot.<p>After that I spent most of my time smoking. I smoked a ridiculous amount of weed, on average three times a week, but mostly on the weekends. I  never went to school high however (and I don't plan on it). My friends (and the same people in my classes) were the people I would smoke with, although I paid for a lot of it, as I had a decent amount of income for an 8th grader ($75 per month or so on average, I fixed computers over Craigslist). I hadn't gotten a pipe or any smoking paraphernalia up until summer, and so I would use what was around me. Most of the time those were the insides of pens, with taking out the top where one clicks the spring to bring out the tip, and putting a tiny chunk of weed in it, lighting that end and breathing in where the tip of the pen would normally be. The joy I got from smoking started to end though.<p>It started to end in June or so. I remember wanting to stop back then but didn't feel motivated enough to do it. June also happened to be when I smoked more than before, as I had nothing to do other than that (This was after school had ended). I would just go to town and smoke with people, practically everyday, and then when I wasn't high I was around people who were, eating Taco Bell, or just walking around with people.

I'm not sure there's any answer I could recommend to someone who didn't want to invest the time and effort required to gain some expertise about it.  Certainly there are opportunities in the stock markets, the commodities markets, and the currency markets right now, but I wouldn't recommend any of those for novices.  Real estate is probably easier, but this is not a great time for it.  And yet leaving it in CDs isn't very attractive these days either.<p>If he could find a good investment advisor, that person could show him how to set up a diversified portfolio.  Really, that's probably the best plan.  However, I don't know how to find a good advisor; I'm sure even this requires some work.  And if they told him to put a lot of his money in stocks, as they might, I'm not sure that would be good advice at the moment.<p>Starting a startup is something that has to come from within.  If he's not already doing it, it's not a good plan.<p>Really, I think the only good advice I can give is to do some soul-searching, and explore some possibilities (without actually spending any of it yet), and figure out what he wants to do with it.

Long haul, the computer's going to win out for sure. But that initial feel of faster, and the way you can just grab it and go instead of sitting down at a desk to check email or get online, will make most consumers prefer tablet computers to full comptuers. Same as oven vs. microwave. It's much faster to bring 10 gallons of water to boil on a stove, but your cold cup of coffee would be reheated much easier in the microwave. Complementary devices, some similar use cases, but for the most part the microwave let us warm food we otherwise would have just eaten cold. The iPad brings computing in an non-intrusive manner to areas we otherwise would have not used computers.<p>And it's not just the iPad; Android Tablets will play a big part, and HP/Microsoft/RIM/others will as well.
