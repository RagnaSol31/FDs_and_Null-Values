In case it's the former, here's my two cents.  This comes from a place a little further down the road, and therefore it is a little OT, but I'll mention it because I wish I would have heard the same.<p>You might find that your professional success--perhaps your emotional investment in your business--gives rise to turmoil in your relationship.  Many of us strive to get big, go public, get acquired, acquire others, merge, etc.  These events are typically wins, but the downsides are loss of control, loss of interest, and perhaps even a bit of depression as a result.<p>I hope you're successful.  If you feel a little off in the course of things, don't let it poison your relationship.  Recognize it, act on it, but don't <i>react</i>.",1297407570.0

The above will open each of the files in a new buffer.

I've got mine set as follows so it not only makes CTRL-t create a new tab, but it also puts your focus in the vim command and fills in the "":e "" so you can open a new file:<p><pre><code>  "" Open New Tab\n  map  <C-T>  :tabnew<CR>:e \n</code></pre>\nYes, this last bit is due to the personal annoyance of hitting CTRL-t and mistakenly expecting a new tab to appear when vim doesn't work that way by default.",1297407209.0

Most TDD advocates are overboard with it imo; a test case should certainly be written when a regression occurs to make sure it doesn't happen again, and tests should be filled in in other cases as time and circumstances permit (recognizing that tests are an important part of the application that you can't just shove off until your favorite theorized utopian corporate culture is realized), but I've never been a big fan of making the development process all about tests. I think it's overzealous and ultimately just burns people out on testing, causing them to get lazy and go almost test-less when they have the option. There are times when it's better to discard form and just write some code straight up without descending into a mire of testing beforehand.",1297406950.0

I'm going to address some of the issues described in the blog post (note the ""you"" i reference is adam obv)...<p>1. spamming, hypergamy, and false advertising is a huge problem as you mention, and a big time sink. People want to use online dating because it is a huge pool of potential people and because it’s an efficient use of time. However when you have to waste time it detracts from the value (more on this below).<p>2. spamming - On Luv@FirstTweet you just respond to our Tweets which build your profile, so you’re not browsing profiles or messaging random people. The only time you do message someone is after you’ve been matched with them, and at that point we show several things in common as well as their photo, so hopefully when you email them it can initiate a real dialogue about things you care about, not just “nice pic ur h0t” haha.<p>3. hypergamy is covered pretty much in my comment above due to the nature of how you interact with the site.<p>4. In terms of false advertising, I guess it could be done if you lie in responses to all of our questions, but this isn’t a traditional dating site where people are browsing profiles and a deviant dude hopes his lies will ensnare an unsuspecting profile viewer…we’re building a profile about you and then matching, so it wouldn’t have the same impact and thus I doubt people would feel the urge to do it as much.<p>5. network effects are the biggest challenge I see us facing, and it’s something we’re got to deal with and adapt to. The big players are pouring tons of money into advertising their self-destructive business models as you explain, so this makes things tricky.<p>6. if there was a “like” button next to Zao Yang’s quote I’d click it – nicely put<p>7. “And to redefine the problem a little bit, I suspect there’s more value and fun in helping people meet new friends generically, and only incidentally maybe a significant other.” the nature of our platform could go this way, but currently we’re sticking with matching for dating. Something cool to think about though.<p>8. business models – looking into the future, there are many different avenues to monetize which aren’t ad based, but thanks to some good advice from @schildkrout from HowAboutWe we’re keeping the site free. We want to grow this bad boy after all and when looking at pt ",

Why would you, or anyone,  alternate with search engines if one of them too often fails to deliver?  Why not just use Google all the time and avoid the cognitive overhead?<p>Does Google do a poor job, or a worse than Bing job, with airplane tickets?",1297405172.0

I just feel like they have discovered a pot of gold, and are being shy about it - heck, that makes total sense. If I were them, I would probably do the same thing until it was too late for anybody to clue in and catch up. So that might be what they are doing.
