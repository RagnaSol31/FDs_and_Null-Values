According to the article, they were seeing year-to-year growth of their click-through rate in earlier months of 25-40%, and in the last 2 months it's been 0% and 3%. That's slowing growth.<p>(Unless you mean relative to the aggregate number of clickthroughs and not relative to the clickthrough rate. But advertisers care about conversion rates more than total inventory of impressions, and we don't know how it affects aggregate clickthroughs anyway until we know how the base inventory has changed.)",1206690484

I didn't get the results I expected so I let it die after the money ran out. Since then, I've gotten eight phone calls from Google trying to get me to re-fund the account. It's beyond annoying.",1206689475

8,148400,comment,148341.0,148341.0,0,0,rms,,,"I saw mention on an SEO blog that one reason the clickthrough rate has fallen is that previously, the entire ad copy was a link and now only the title is a link. So there is less space to click and less accidental clicks. In the long run this should make each click more valuable.",1206688918
