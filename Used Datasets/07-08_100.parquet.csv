We've been saying this for years.<p>Legalize all drugs and tax them.<p>You can't stop something that people want them.<p>If you think it's bad for somebody's health or is addictive, then I've got news for you: alcohol, sugar, caffeine, bacon.<p>I've never even tried pot or anything stronger, but I still support legalization.<p>But let's cut to the chase, this is not about drugs and health issues. This is about money and jobs for DEA. Essentially, we're pissing away our tax money to pay for DEA agents and their expensive toys, who, in turn, don't provide any real service.<p>This drug war is expensive, it costs dollars and lives.

Clearly it's difficult to solve someone else's problem. If the overwhelming majority of the Afghan people wanted the Taliban gone, and they had U.S. support, and we didn't fuck a bunch of stuff up, then of course we could have rid Afghanistan of the Taliban. If the Afghans legitimately trusted us, and supported us in large enough numbers, the Taliban would have had trouble finding even caves to hide in.<p>Also I never made any claim that the ""average"" drug user was a child, just that it is a huge problem. The drug addicts that you know might have been adults when they first started using, but without exception, every one of the dozens of drug addicts I know started as a teenager. I can only speak from personal experience.<p>Feigning ignorance to the fact that there is an epidemic of children in our country becoming addicted to drugs is the most ""woefully misinformed"" thing I've ever heard. Just because someone wants to be pro-legalization, doesn't mean they have to ignore reality.<p>Edit: Apparently I have a habit of using the terms drug addict and drug user interchangeably.

23,4824825,comment,4824573.0,4824782.0,24,0,ralonso,,,"See, this is a rather simplistic and ignorant comment. I do not mean to insult you - actually, I wish it was as simple as you're saying, just kill them and end with it. However, the problem is incredibly more complex than what you think it is.<p>I live in Mexico, next to a city that a couple of years back was one of the worst in the country in terms of violence and drug distribution. (In fact, one of the big cartels started in that city.) I've interacted with people involved in those cartels and with their families. I've interacted with officers who're in it, too. The problem is deeply rooted, and it's a problem of, among other things, culture.<p>The solution is not to ""kill them all,"" but rather to educate. According to one article[1] (note: it's in spanish), Mexico invests less than 0.5% of its GDP into science and research. While Mexico has always had top competitors in international competitions for math, biology, robotics, science and engineering in general, and even chess, they're anomalies and products of extremely expensive private schools. Hell, even GNOME was made by two Mexican hackers. Schools in Mexico are beyond messed up.<p>Lack of education, mixed with poverty, create criminals. In Mexico you rarely ever see racism, but instead there's classism. Unlike in the US, our government officials aren't old white guys, but people of all kinds of skin color with money. Mexican culture - and maybe I'm wrong in this comparison, but this is from what I understand - is similar to black culture, where you have to fight your way out of your impoverished group by primarily violent means. You don't earn the respect of your fellow poor friends by getting an A on a test, but by having designer jeans or by having the latest iPhone.<p>And this is what gets most the ""bunch of degenerate shitbags that have been given firearms"" that you mention. These are literally teenagers (or even younger kids) that want to get out, probably even help our their family or community, and this is the only way they can do it.<p>I may be going a bit off-topic, but killing them off won't do any good. In fact, starting an all-out war might make things worse. These kids don't fear death because they have nothing to lose. The higher ups also don't fear the government or the army.<p>Another thing is that, if a war against organized crime were to start, it would create fear instead of peace. It would make the population, at least to my understanding, ""uneasy"" to say the least.<p>What I would propose instead of killing people would be to educate and invest in shit other than fighting a meaningless war.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.metronoticias.com.mx/nota.cgi?id=378883"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metronoticias.com.mx/nota.cgi?id=378883</a><p>EDIT: Hmm, I noticed that I rambled a bit too much. There are several other things I wanted to mention. I am not in a position to offer a concrete solution as I'm not an expert in this topic. I've only seen this from afar and read almost daily on the newspapers about what's happening in the country. As I mentioned, the problem is far too big to be reduced into a couple of paragraphs. There are countless books, articles, essays, blog posts, etc, devoted to this specific topic and the solution offered varies (albeit slightly) from person to person.<p>If anyone is interested in more information, let me know and I'll see what I can do.",1353742899

The cartel is a massive problem, and to get rid of them would involve a massive conflict. If the Mexican government was acting alone, it would pretty much demand a full-scale civil war. It would be a really shitty solution, no doubt about that, but it's a shitty situation no matter what. Basically, Mexico has to decide what it's willing to tolerate. If they think living under the ever increasing threat of being murdered in a turf war is more acceptable than the casualties they would endure trying to get rid of them, then that's a decision they should be entitled to make.<p>But what saddens me, as it does in all nations where people face death on a daily basis, is that often, the actual people, the working class Mexicans in this case, don't get to make a real decision. They have an ineffective government on one hand, who is so used to having its members assassinated that it is mostly afraid to do anything, and on the other hand you have an insanely large band of murderers, torturers, and rapists that never should have been allowed to grow as large as it did.

It's probably overkill to say that Microsoft never gets the details right, but I do agree that their first version product which introduces their inovations is generally rough and unpolished to say the least.<p>I loved metro when I first saw the build videos in 2011, but that's because I looked at the demo apps as early and unfinished examples of the direction they were taking. Now over a year later I see almost nothing has changed and the same level of quality I saw back then is what is being released now. A lot of things are unintuitive, apps have awkward layouts, the icons are downright awful, etc.<p>There was a lot of promise for Windows 8 back then, and to some extent I still expect them to refine the UI and make it into a better user experience by the next version of Windows -- but by then the feeling of ""innovation"" will be gone and they will have missed their chance to make the big impact that they needed and would have otherwise gotten.",1353741377

I use the term soldier loosely because its really just a bunch of degenerate shitbags that have been given firearms. They are allegedly larger, more organized, and better funded than Al Qaeda has ever dreamed of being. Still, there are bullets enough in this world to solve such a problem. It would be long, ugly, and bloody for all parties involved, but if we were serious enough to actually go about it the right way, the entire planet would be far better having seen it to completion.<p>When an ultraconservative thinks about the war on drugs, they are generally thinking of the elimination of mind-altering substances from the face of the earth. When I think of the war on drugs, I think first of finding ways to prevent children from becoming addicted to hard drugs before they are old enough to know what decision they are making, and secondly, the annihilation of the violent, terrorist organizations that currently control the industry. I understand that nothing will ever completely eliminate the recreational use of drugs, but by my definition the war on drugs is absolutely winnable.

One of the philosophical underpinnings of the GNU project is empowering non-superusers as far as possible - that's why they've stuck with the microkernel design, too.

If your idea fits somewhere under the broad umbrella of your group's mandate, so much the better.<p>I have to disagree a little with one of the earlier points, though. Through start-up acquisitions, Google is getting a lot more groups with the developer/hacker mindset. Those groups tend to keep to themselves and rail against Google's slow pace, and often eventually quit. Google could learn from that mentality, but equally those developers could learn from Google's methodical approach. In my (limited) experience Google could do much better at integrating newly acquired start-up teams into the overall corporate culture and development philosophy.",1353741170
