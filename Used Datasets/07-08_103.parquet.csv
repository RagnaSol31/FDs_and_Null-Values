There's an additional baseboard you can get but it's huge or I guess you can put your own blocks on.<p>* the Beaglebone comes w/ two PRUs if you need to do real-time work this is pretty sweet<p>* For general I/O, libraries like PyBBIO and Bonescript make the Beaglebone dead simple to program with.

But you still won't get what he's saying unless you're already a follower and have digested the ideas in his blog.<p>Venkat trades in big, hairy concepts. The one he's using here is <i>legibility</i>. It's when information is structured in rigorous ways, defined by those using it as an instrument of power. It is the primary tool governments use against the people. An example is making every person have a current address listed on their driver's license. Governments stack these legibility requirements up so as to control commerce and extract rents. (taxes)<p>Venkat's argument is that investors won the game by forcing founders to be legible, reducing the information advantage they enjoyed historically. While it may look like founders have never had more power, in reality they've lost a crucial ability, to hoard critical inside information. It's really the only advantage they have, without it, they're at the mercy of investors. The ability to dictate terms is really inconsequential, more a function of fashion than actual power.
