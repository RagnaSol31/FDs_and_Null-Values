This is obvious by comparing the dictionary definition with your definition: the former is general and widely understood, while the later is values-laden and requires an appreciation of a particular philosophical position.<p>> For instance, the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence are not considered to be &quot;regulation.&quot;<p>They are by definition regulations. If you read the definition of regulation, you would have to agree they are regulations.<p>> Your proposed terms of &quot;good regulation&quot; and &quot;bad regulation&quot; ignore my explanation of support or violation of sovereignty and are just a poor attempt to discredit my (correct) position.<p>They specifically acknowledge and address your points around individual sovereignty - your assertions to the contrary indicate you haven&",
