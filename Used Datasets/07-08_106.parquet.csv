He was telling this to the Mac team, which had become a kind of splinter group with its own identity within Apple.  Of course, it's not just better to be a pirate yourself, sometimes the empire needs to hire some pirates.  The navy can't be seen robbing Spanish ships after all (or devoting lots of money to zany projects like a graphical user interface on a personal computer).<p>I wonder if big dumb companies like Yahoo could actually use the pirate mentality/method to their benefit.  Why doesn't Yahoo take a few million dollars in seed money and start a bunch of companies under its own umbrella using some of its own people?  Give all the power to the engineers and the designers, skip the MBA-wielding drones that you've described above and let people that can actually make stuff set sail.  Would it still fail?  If any of the ideas did thrive, would the companies just be smothered when incorporated back into Yahoo?  Would anyone even notice that a couple of million dollars went to creating several radical new projects?",1315382395.0

12,2968738,comment,2968392.0,2968392.0,2,0,bugsy,,,"It's a very interesting question. I use yahoo a fair bit for email accounts and for reading the news. I am not sure how they monetize this activity if at all.<p>Recently they forced me out of the old interface with email. Now I can no longer open emails I want to read by option-clicking on links to open them in new browser tabs. All mouse clicks are intercepted by the javascript on the page. Without the ability to do this the email is significantly slower and less easy to use than before. Now I am faced with finding a new email provider, and not gmail. If they had just left it alone or allowed me to use the old. No doubt others feel the same way.<p>But what do to? Well for news I read yahoo but comment on topix, which is community oriented. Yahoo should clone that. Unlike topix, yahoo seems to license their news content which should provide an advantage. Have news discussion local like with topix. Then sell local classifieds if you get enough local activity boards going and frequented. Might be hard at this point though to get people away from topix.<p>For me yahoo signified privacy and flexibility with the emails. I used to get news alerts on some topics but they never worked reliably or consistently. Haven't gotten one in a long time so I guess that feature was cancelled.<p>Oh I also use yahoo groups. These groups should have cloned the functionality of ning.com, to supplement and expand the mailing list paradigm. Yahoo groups have never worked well, screwing up the formatting of most posts and not having a smooth experience for integrating media. That all should have been fixed decades ago. Then try monetizing it like ning does with pay for extras and pay to be the premium ad free host.<p>A lot of the problems have a vibe that the programmers aren't great, or aren't around long enough to make things great. A lot has the feel of middle management dictating features to programmers rather than software designers being the developers and having the autonomy to own projects long term and make them great.",1315381879.0

21,2968729,comment,2968392.0,2968392.0,2,0,kb101,,,"1) A unified, coherent design language and user experience for the site.  This would really make Yahoo stand out, as even Google is clunky with this (""more"" and ""even more"").  As it stands currently, it's too visually cluttered and hard to navigate.  Example: I used to use Babelfish a lot, but trying to browse to it from the front page is well-nigh impossible.  Another thought: sort the list of Yahoo sub-sites by popularity instead of alphabetically.  It's fine to have umpty million different sub-sites, but they need to be coherently organized and findable.  Yahoo really needs a first-class UI, even more than Google or Bing do, because Yahoo actually <i>is</i> a portal, and a portal is different things to different people.  It needs to be cleanly navigable and this includes cleaning up the 1990s looking My Yahoo.<p>2) Back to basics: search.  As soon as possible, get rid of the Bing mess and get back to being a premier search provider.  Type nearly any topic into any search engine and you get a Wikipedia page first thing.  If I type ""hacker"" into Yahoo, out of the top ten results, there are five junky results: 2 Wikipedia pages, one Answers.com page, one Dictionary.com page, and one WordIQ page.  If I want to get a definition or an encyclopedia page, I can go to those sites.  Web search is supposed to pull up awesome cool links from the web, not the standard junk pages that have shallow content and are not hard to find.  Even Google is getting infested with these kind of crap results.  Nowadays, if I find an awesome link it is typically via a site like HN or somebody's blog, but I remember the days when I used to love going to Google and digging up fresh new links that were interesting.<p>3) Social is still ""ripe for disruption"" as they say.  The flurry of interest around Google+ is evidence of this.  People want more control, and more privacy, and a greater ability to differentiate their online identities without any one identity compromising the other.  Eric Schmidt's response to this is ""well if you have something to hide blah blah blah"" but it's not about having something to hide.  It's about the fundamental human need to interact differently in different social and economic settings.  Maybe the guy who works as a cube jockey in some corporate wasteland needs to have his LinkedIn profile for trying to make it to the next level, but what about his sideline trying to network his way into a graphic design job?  Maybe he needs a couple of profiles and wouldn't like to have to use his real name on either.  Innovative approaches to allowing flexibility and growth on social sites (isn't that what the web is supposed to be about?) instead of locking people into one idea that they damn well better stick their RealName(tm) on... that is an area where Yahoo could step in and fill a void.  Particularly if it was done right, and done in a way to leverage their existing myriad of user bases across the niche sites.<p>4) Quality.  (Echoes of Steve Jobs and his quest for the perfect shade of yellow in an icon.)  An enterprise-wide push for quality would help.  Instead of being meh at 100 things, Yahoo could easily be awesome at those same 100 things.  They already have the infrastructure in place, they just need to clean house and remodel.  (This kind of ties back to point 1.)  Flickr is a prime example.  It's big, it's a brand name, it has a loyal user base, but it isn't awesome. It needs to be awesome.<p>5)  Develop an identity.  If the preceding four steps are done right, this will follow.  Google's identity is ""search plus a bunch of other crazy shit, and they have really cool offices to work at"" right now.  It works for them because search (advertising) makes them so much freaking money.  But it's not really a coherent identity.  Yahoo's identity could easily be ""the coolest web portal with the best links"".  If Yahoo became synonymous with premium quality, they would be unstoppable.",1315381633.0

For what is worth, I personally dont use downvoting at all (except by accident!): I simply dont upvote.<p>Now, please bear in mind that while you just replied<p><i>Your comments about css etc are perfectly fine, and interesting, in an of themself - but not in the context of that article. In the context of that article they were off topic.</i><p>you previously stated<p><i>People comment on the css when it interesting and you can learn from it. Saying someone didn't use css is not interesting at all.</i><p>I was obviously replying to the latter.<p>Let me emphasize a point youre not addressing. Even though vote counts are gone, relative positioning of comments give you an idea of what HN as a community deems interesting. Clearly my original comment was not considered enlightening, engaging, nor for that matter inappropriate. But, again, plenty of popular comments are decidedly off topic with respect to the articles content: DNS, webserver used, whois  information, ping times, JS usage, accessibility, color choice, cookies, character encoding, HTML semantics, etc.<p>But thats the thing: the moment you provide a URL in HN, many aspects that go way beyond the actual content are generally not considered off topic.  Whether that is right or wrong, whether this means not getting it are, in my opinion, entirely pointless mental exercises. Clearly, as soon as this changes significantly I will heed the cue and adjust, possibly looking for venues where this off-topic chatter is deemed acceptable and even fun.<p>In any event, thanks again for clarifying your point.

But freedom comes at a cost (this is natural!). The price is learning it, remembering it and a constant state of awareness for all the patterns it has to offer.<p>The speed of a compiler (think of PyPy), is a thing that can be improved at least to some extent. But very few people are willing to work on the inner structure of a language, that you doom to be inappropriate for 50% of the tasks out there.<p>Look at the set of various languages as a biosphere of evolving organisms. They tend to improve. If there was no demand for Scala or PHP, they wouldn't have occured in the first place.<p>I think the original article and the follow-up is a poorly disguised attempt at elitism, or maybe just an excellent way to challenge people.<p>I will say it in simplest terms possible, what really matters is how Scala handles tail-recursion, not whether it allows it.
