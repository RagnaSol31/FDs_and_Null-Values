37,8141454,comment,8139508.0,8141340.0,15,0,beloch,,,"Studies of the ǃKung San, who were recently hunter-gatherers living in a rather marginal environment, showed that they could get by doing <i>far</i> less work than farmers.  The work they did do was strenuous.  For example, they practiced persistence hunting.  However, on average they had a lot more leisure time.  Being a hunter-gatherer was probably an even sweeter deal before farmers and ranchers gobbled up all the prime real estate.<p>Interestingly enough, the recent history of the !Kung shows that settling down and joining the rest of civilization does not always benefit the fairer sex.  !Kung society was much less sexist before contact than it is now, as the surrounding peoples they are now in contact with are not exactly the most egalitarian.  Most archaeologists consider egalitarian social structure to be typical of hunter-gatherer societies, with rigid hierarchical structure being an innovation resulting from settlement.  Consider the concept of being &quot;rich&quot; for example.  In a nomadic pastoral culture, wealth might be owning a big herd.  In a sedentary culture, wealth might take the form of housing or accumulated items.  A hunter-gatherer does not own animals and has to carry everything he/she owns around.  A hunter-gather&",

If you search in one of the big sites the first several pages are occupied by those properties which are going to bring the most revenue to the aggregator and which in many cases are in turn inventory provided by another site with little or no knowledge of the individual properties.  \nYou will probably never get tot he well managed properties with many 5 star reviews owned by individuals who care about your holiday experience because they are not worth as much to the aggregator so they are right at the bottom of the lists.  If the aggregator cared about your holiday they would  be at the top and possibly over the long term this would bring him more revenue because travellers would come to know that they could find the best properties quickly.\nYou also cannot get to actually speak to an owner of any of the properties on the several first pages because they are all on commission rather than subscription and obviously they don&",
