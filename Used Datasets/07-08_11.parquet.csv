It's not a physical item, and it doesn't compare to taking such a thing from a store.<p>What's being taken is the opportunity to make a transaction.  It's more like blocking the entrance to a store.  The problem with that analogy is that we don't have some traditional method for accounting that loss.  If you did that in real life, you'd be prosecuted for trespassing or something similar.<p>Which is the point -- there isn't a traditional method for accounting of that loss, and any analogy that enables one is wrong.   In the case of file sharing, the prevention of sales is the only crime being committed, and people hate doing the math/research on something like that.",1232437779.0

Restitution in the criminal arena refers to an affirmative performance by the defendant that benefits either the victim of the crime or the general public. If a victim can be identified, a judge will order the defendant to make restitution to the victim. For example, if a defendant is convicted of stealing a person's stereo, the defendant may be sentenced to reimburse the victim for the value of the stereo, in addition to punishment such as jail time and monetary fines.</i>",1232437620.0

This gambit is just to get people used to metered, limited internet so they can charge much more in the future when bandwidth usage is far higher. As a cynical, Machiavellian profit strategy, it is a good one. Most will say, “Oh, 250GB! I’ll never use that!”<p>And then in three or four or six years, they will. And then they’ll get the $500 internet bill in the mail. Comcast's bandwidth costs have done nothing but go down over the years.  I can get 250GB+ transfer from a hosting company for $10 a month these days.<p>I will never use Comcast, and I urge everyone else to do the same.

Seaside firmly insists that the programmer, not the designer, should be generating the proper markup; the designer has CSS.  If this fits your work style, or if you're both the designer and the programmer, this style will benefit you and is much more enjoyable that raw HTML.",1232436466.0
