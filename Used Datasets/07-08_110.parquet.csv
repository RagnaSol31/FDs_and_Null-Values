It feels reinvigorating how a single person can quickly hack together something really nice when you only need to do 16x16 pixel textures. I think people underrate how exponentially increasing production costs are a drag on game developer creativity. The human ability to suspend disbelief is monumental and I think these new constrained voxel games and platforms like the iPad will see more experimental gameplay emerge much like it did in the early eighties.,1289894174

Coders are not Computer Scientists.  It's like comparing a physicist to an electrician.  Being a good coder is a craft much, much more than it is a science.  While I'm very tired of college being a requisite for middle class lifestyle in the US, I also feel like these threads wind up being areas where people write off the CS degree as unnecessary without applying enough context.<p>Career-wise, if you're looking to do research in computing, computational theory, develop novel algorithms, solve deep problems on the frontier of what it means to be ""computable"", or just effectively reinvent your own wheel and prove that it works..CS is still VERY relevant to this end.<p>While I don't perceive CS as a program to inherently producing good coders, I also don't perceive the generic good coder as someone I'd turn to to help me create novel algorithm (read no prior documentation, no prior code, very little academic work) to solve a previously unsolved problem.  Look at Facebook and Google...Google at its early form and Facebook as it reconciled its data into the form of the social graph while wrangling a huge codebase...do you think they got where they were by hiring armies of people who were ""good coders"" that decided to forgo the foundations of algorithms and Computer Science?  No way.  Thus, if this kind of work what you want as a career path, the CS degree is still very relevant as its topics can be very relevant to your career's future.<p>TLDR: Are good coders very employable?  Very yes.  Does that mean that CS is readily discarded for all as a good career move?  I likely think not.<p>I agree with the rest of your post.",1289892601
