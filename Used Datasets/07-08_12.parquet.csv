People used to complain about the lack of static IPs, now that's no longer a problem. Once they get around to rolling out this feature to the public, the only legit complaint that people would have for them is the base cost when starting out.<p>When your traffic is zero or very low, as in the case of when you're just starting out, a conventional VPS host is still a lot cheaper. But the good thing with AWS is that it's easy to port your apps to run on their platform.",1208159812

2,162997,comment,162938.0,162938.0,0,0,nuggien,,,Why would you post a link to your blog promoting the fact that you're thinking about writing an OS?  That's like me posting a link to my blog promoting a startup I haven't thought of the idea for yet.,1208159335
3,162996,comment,162341.0,162704.0,0,0,davidw,,,"Heh!  No, not that much capital, and I think americans are actually fairly ambivalent about trains (although IIRC, Warren Buffet says he's been investing in them).<p>It's a food item(s).  If anyone's that curious, write me and I'll tell you about it.  I guess for me 'lot of capital' is pretty much anything outside the software industry, not 'lot of capital' in more objective terms.  I have no idea if it'd be realistic for me to attempt to do something with it, but I know people would like it, with a certainty that I've never had with any other product, which is why it amazes me that no one else has done this particular thing, as there are plenty of established players in the space.",1208159297

I also like the fact that you take some design cues from Google with your logo/search box (nothing wrong with using design patterns!).  I also liked the consistency when you clicked on a link - ie, the header and title didn't move.<p>Is that ""What is Jaanix?"" always the default link at the top?  If so, great!  In these nascent stages you should definitely be accommodating people with questions and establishing what it is you do.  When Digg first came out people had a lot of questions about how that worked as well.<p>The tuners are great.  I really dig how they're analogue - a lot of people make the mistake of stepping sliders for ""tuning"" functionality.<p>Such a small thing, but any chance of making the comment box slide out rather than pop out?  Everything else looks so slick it was the one thing that stood out to me.  Actually I also noticed videos seemed a bit clunky (click on one and then scroll to see what I'm talking about).<p>What would be great in terms of functionality is an Audioscrobbler style thing - name a few blogs and have the tuners get set for you.<p>Also have you done the pre-requisite widget for people to embed into their blogs, etc?<p>Not sure what other advice I can offer to be honest, you guys seemed to have nailed your concept quite nicely.",1208159152

And it's important because it shows that to see a black swan coming, you often have to look at things from a different perspective.<p>Second, sure the US dollar won't be as bad as the Zim dollar.  That's hyperbole, but the truth is that it's going to get much worse before it's over.  That's doom and gloom, but it's less so when you raise yourself above turkey-level and at least attempt to manage around it.",1208157830
18,162981,comment,162884.0,162952.0,0,0,lux,,,"Honestly, if you do a good job, a customer is likely to recommend you anyway.  They don't need a monetary incentive to, and I know a few customers of mine that feel that this would cheapen their word of mouth.  But if you want to increase the word of mouth going around, then go ahead and ask them directly.  Give them a handful of cards and say that if they liked your work you're trying to grow your client base so if they can refer anyone they know please do.<p>As for other things, hard to say.  My business operates on people finding us online and by word of mouth.  I tried Adwords and other things like that, but it's been a long time since I've bothered with showing up at conventions to hand out business cards or had my sales guy cold call anyone.  I never really got the hang of those anyway...<p>I would also say to be careful though.  If you're looking to increase your clientele on the consulting side, that can quickly turn into a full-time thing you're left managing, with little time to pursue your startup.  And there is a big difference between a consulting business and a startup - one has its revenue directly tied to someone's billable hours and the other creates some sort of recurring revenue stream with the goal of exponential growth.",1208157816

The context actually works in the book better than the quote might appear in the comment. It depicts someone who does know what they are doing in a job surrounded by people who don't wishing for a change. That's what brings me here at any rate. Ayn's typical over-the-top-ness obscured it in the book as well, but by then you'd read hundreds of pages and were quite used to it!",1208157498

We just got creative with advertising.<p>I agree with zkinion, many startups use ""legal spam"". Our site was around before MySpace became the social networking behemoth that it is today. They used to make fake accounts on our site all the time. And we would do it back to them.<p>You don't read about it much in the stories in Founders at Work, but from what I've seen a lot of very successful sites did whatever they had to do to win. If your product is truly disruptive you shouldn't have to do much at all to advertise it. But there are a lot of social sites out there, and a lot of them play dirty.",1208156996
