I wish that publications would stop stating this number like it means anything.  I could probably think of 10 ways off the top of my head to skew the lines of code that a function would require without even affecting the size of the binary (heck, just change the style of <i>braces</i>...).  I could change one line and create a buggy mess, or remove 1000 lines and create a brilliant masterpiece of efficiency.<p>Something that <i>might</i> mean more is growth in code complexity over time.  For instance, if measured every month for a year without changing the compiler version or platform, how much bigger or smaller did the compiled binaries become?  How much more or less memory and runtime were consumed?  How many ""severe"" bugs were found?  When overlaid with information on the features that were added or removed during that time, it should become a lot clearer how large the code base really is and how maintainable it will be.",1343721368.0

In 1998, if advertisers paid the maximum that traffic was worth to them, Yahoo's revenues would have \n<i>decreased.</i>""<p>I remember when AdSense ads used to be images and Google replaced them with text links, essentially reducing the clickable surface area of the ads.

I once asked my boss to select a random file of code from one of the flagship products and discovered 40 errors in 5 minutes (he was <i>not</i> happy, long story). It is a wonder these apps work as well as they do.<p>At the time they had this weird home brew mix of PSP and ""agile"" as their 'methodology' and while it generated a lot of meetings and paperwork, it didn't improve the code one bit. I am glad to know  that they are moving towards better practices, but Intuit is <i>the</i> most technically inept organization I've seen, so I wouldn't be too hopeful of the end results. OTOH they <i>do</i> understand their customers (and marketing to them) <i>really really well</i>. I learned a lot from Intuit about these aspects of product dev.  Which goes to prove you can make billions with totally screwed up engineering.",1343719924.0

You may very well indeed be a top notch candidate so don't take it personally.<p>That said, as a Googler, I understand why they will hire non-SWE with phds in chemisty, neuroscience, or particle physics or what have you -- it's because Google has unique problems to think about that are not just pure software engineering. For instance, how do you scientifically evaluate the current search quality and ensure that it continues to improve?

Just look at the source code[1]. They save a few low bits for the worker ID, data center, and worker-specific sequence. The highest bits are the timestamp bits.<p>Maybe you can correct me if my assumptions based on the code are wrong, but my guess is you'll magically find that Twitter's highest ID grows linearly with time. Then you're just randomly sampling within this maximum timestamp. At this point you're assuming that Twitter sees a constant rate of signups wrt time, which I highly doubt.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/twitter/snowflake/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/twitter/service/snowflake/IdWorker.scala"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/twitter/snowflake/blob/master/src/main/sc...</a>",1343718775.0
