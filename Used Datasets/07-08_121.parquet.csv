Someone who has done a thing for ten years is going to be way better than someone who has done the same thing for only two, all other things being equal.  Really, experience makes such a big difference that even without other things being equal, the person with a decade of experience is usually better.<p>Hell, this is one of those things that the unions and management agree on.   All other things being equal, a more experienced worker is going to be more effective and productive.<p>Gaps matter too.  I mean, I agree that they aren&",

Their jobs involve opening the gates for visitors, gardening, cleaning and so on. They have a lot of free time on their hand. And many of them are saving up with these jobs to be able to go back to school and learn to read.<p>With the power of the internet, surely there must be some kind of material that one can print out that can act as a self-learning course for a person to learn how to read. The boys may or may not know how to read the alphabet, but they certainly know how to read numbers (from their phones).<p>My ideal would be if one could print out some kind of book that the teens can use to figure out how to read, and just distribute it to them.
