Not to derail things much but perhaps the ethos is not so much from the place but from the parents.  In my experience new parents who care about education, if they can afford it will move into an area with good schools perpetuating this virtue.  Of course there are some parents who have a lot of money and stay in locales with poor schools but then send their kids to private schools.  I know it seems like one in the same thing but its not.

You’re at high power but you’re not switching the load at zero-crossing as you would in a resonant load such as a Tesla coil, instead you have to switch at an increasing current depending on how much power you want to the wheels. You now don’t just have to switch a lot of power, you have to switch it FAST so that the resistive losses in the FETs don’t blow out the power channel due to ohmic losses. Your switch is now not just big and bulky, it’s complicated (since you need an additional HV supply) and pretty sensitive to things like stray capacitances.
