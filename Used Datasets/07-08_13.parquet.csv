In reality, I comment very little, just pointing things out that can’t be quickly deduced from casually reading the code.",1256284750.0

Perhaps the data only indicates that the equilibrium is shifted a little more towards the capitalism side?<p>I don't understand how your second link argues that less gov control means higher standards.<p>I think what we see in the world right now is that there are many more 3rd world countries with ineffective governments and less economic freedom than there are countries who are doing well enough to have an economy to <i>not regulate.</i> So in other words it's much harder for a country to go from poor, low economic freedom to prosperous than it is for a country that already has a strong unregulated economy to adopt some regulation and go to prosperous.<p><a href=""http://www.investmentu.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/20060123iub.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investmentu.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/200601...</a>\nThe graph there probably doesn't exhibit a bell curve because as soon as a country leads too far right towards pure economic freedom, it jumps back really fast. And I think enough time has passed that all the most developed countries have hit that mark and popped back left a little.<p>Also I think you should consider the size of countries like Hong Kong and Singapore, since different principles probably govern economies of different sizes.<p>Can you name me one 1st world country without economic regulations? I think this is evidence enough that there must be some slope leading down to the state of America in the early 90s, even if that slope is almost vertical.",1256284297.0

You need to bring some quality writing or analysis to the table to make this worthwhile.  You need a purpose.  Some example things you could do:<p>- A humor site.  Unoriginal and a little mean, but it could work.  You'd need good writing and consistently interesting/funny failure screenshots.<p>- A design critique of failure pages.<p>- Failure pages on well-known properties with descriptions of how they're triggered, each followed by a dash of well-founded speculation about the causes of the error as an intro to a technical discussion.

The route I took was to jump ship to a smallish start up for as long as it would take to feel comfortable (I figured around two years, it actually took a bit longer than a year).<p>There were several good things about doing it that way:<p>- I got a lot closer to customers and the sales/marketing process and saw product development cycles much more akin to the kind of thing I would be doing on my own.<p>- I met a lot of people and made some great connections.<p>- I picked up some related skills and qualifications and contacts (on my own time) which have cut ~£1k+ off my business admin costs and made me more competent technically.<p>- I saved up a nice healthy seed fund at the same time as moving (myself) to a city that's better for start ups.<p>There were some negatives to go with it as well.<p>- I burned out a little bit on the really long days, which made it hard to work in the evenings. Oddly enough that's no longer the case now I'm doing my own thing - it's too much fun.<p>- I couldn't carry on with product development for contract reasons. It did give me time give the product a serious review and to pick up some other skills I would need though.<p>- I lost a year's first mover advantage. It's a big market though, and a year hasn't radically changed the competitive picture. The niche I want to steal is still under-served and stuffed full of people with money.<p>On the whole it was a good idea for me, but everyone's circumstances vary.",1256282261.0
23,898405,comment,896113.0,896284.0,0,0,chrischen,,,"I think that relates to how smart is synonymous with lazy: it's because smart always try find the easy way out.<p>The hard way to do something would require a lot of effort, but actually very little brain power. An example would be trying to modify a set of data. The <i>hard</i> way would be to do it by hand. That's the most obvious method and thus requires little brain power to arrive at. However the faster way is to write a Python script that does it.<p>Probably part of the de-emphasis on smarts is society's general attitude towards innate intelligence. We don't like to believe that some people are simply born better than others, so we stress that more effort is better instead.<p>There's no arguing the fact that not everyone is equally gifted in terms of brain power, so I think it's kind of silly to try to ignore intelligence. Intelligent people are creative, open minded, and flexible. But an intelligent person who's allergic to actual effort is the real problem we want to avoid. Also we're probably more equal in intelligence than we are in our ability to work hard. So in practice, this is probably why effort is a better indicator of ability to succeed than intelligence is.",1256282111.0

Things I found out a couple of days ago (when I ran into probs):<p>* Ssh keys have caveats with this setup.<p>* You need to login at least once (locally,ssh,etc) because it needs your system password to mount the ecryptfs on your home directory. So you can still use the benefits of ssh keys if you need to login to the same machine with the same user account multiple times. You'll just need to use the system password the first time.<p>* If you only need to access something outside of your encrypted home, you <i>can</i> created a ~/.ssh directory in the unmounted home directory and cat your public key there. (Your login will have have an empty home directory unless you manually mount eCryptFS)<p>* Because the mounting can happen in a PAM module, this is leaps and bounds ahead of Apple (at least a couple of years ago). My experience with FileVault was that you needed to login through the GUI to get a mounted home directory. SSH logins were a no go (except for an empty home dir).",1256281245.0
