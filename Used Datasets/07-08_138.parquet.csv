First, excursions, where a new thought is interpolated into a sentence before the previous one is complete, can be tiring.<p>Second, people use em dashes where other punctuation would be more appropriatethe article illustrates this nicely, where lots of em dashes are used that would better be commas or semicolons.  Em dashes are the most emphatic punctuation for communicating excursions, so the two points are related.<p>Indeed, em dashes should be used sparingly, as exclamation marks are, since they are visually distracting.  <i>Chicago</i> suggests that no paragraph should contain more than two em dashes, and most should not contain that many.  By my reckoning, Noreen Malone packed 14 em dashes into each of two paragraphs in her article.<p>But the fairly mechanical task of turning dashes into other punctuation doesn't tackle the point about excessively excursive writing.  And here I don't agree that they are the enemy of ""truly efficient writing"".  Excursions can be a sign of mental disorganisation in the writer, one who isn't writing with clear purpose, but they can also be the sign of a successful reworking of complex material, to present it in the most digestible manner.  I don't think that ""excursions bad"" is useful advice, rather I suggest ""check that excursions are of clear value"".<p>I have three excursions in this comment, and I think all pass this ""clear value"" test; as an exercise, you can check if you agree with me.

Then I would aggressively bargain. \nWell you if you're important to the success and value yourself highly you should do that anyways, they won't get angry, in fact should appreciate somebody like that more (if not I'd doubt if it's worth working for those people). \nMost likely they have no idea how ""fair"" their offer is as much as you don't.<p>Also if other people will be getting a similar deal Iwould be slightly worried about motivational issues.

Of math done outside math departments, control theory is relatively good mathematically.<p>And, yes, there should be applications elsewhere.<p>For physics, yes, the deterministic theory of optimal control has been seen as replacing the older calculus of variations which goes back to Newton.<p>My references are old.<p>More recent work on stochastic optimal control has been by R. T. Rockafellar at University of Washington.<p>For<p>Stuart E. Dreyfus and Averill M. Law, 'The Art and Theory of Dynamic Programming', ISBN 0-12-221860-4, Academic Press, New York.<p>'dynamic programming' is a big part of the discrete time versions of optimal control.  It can be stochastic or deterministic.  The linear-quadratic-Gaussian (linear 'plant' or system, quadratic cost to be minimized, and Gaussian exogenous random variables) has 'deterministic equivalence' -- nice -- and this book treats it.  The book is a good, elementary start.  Apparently Dreyfus was a R. Bellman student.<p>For<p>L. S. Pontryagin, V. G. Boltyanskii, R. V. Gamkrelidze, and E. F. Mischenko, 'The Mathematical Theory of Optimal Processes', ISBN 0-470-69381-9, Interscience Publishers, John Wiley & Sons, New York.<p>it was, of course, the main source of the Pontryagin maximum principle, and, thus, a swift kick in the back side for parts of US aerospace in the 1960s.<p>For<p>Michael Athans and Peter L. Falb, 'Optimal Control:  An Introduction to the Theory and Its Applications', McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York.<p>Athans was long in EE at MIT and did some military work, e.g., on parts of the C5A airplane.  Falb was at Brown's Division of Applied Mathematics.<p>One Athans story was the 'control' for least time to climb to, say, 100,000 feet for an F-4:  Go up to a few thousand feet, go into a dive, get supersonic, get the lower drag of a few hundred knots above Mach 1, and then with the lower drag continue supersonic to the final altitude.  I was not able to know if that 'control' idea was just intuitive or directly from computation and the Pontryagin maximum principle which is, after all, just a necessary condition, i.e., local optimality.<p>Also in that division at Brown, see the papers of Harold Kushner.  As I recall, he wrote out a stochastic version of the Pontryagin maximum principle.<p>For<p>E. B. Dynkin and A. A. Yushkevich, 'Controlled Markov Processes', ISBN 0-387-90387-9, Springer-Verlag, Berlin.<p>there are connections with economic planning.<p>For<p>Dimitri P. Bertsekas and Steven E. Shreve, 'Stochastic Optimal Control:  The Discrete Time Case', ISBN 0-12-093260-1, Academic Press, New York.<p>the math is done carefully.  So there is a lot of attention to measurability.  Part of the reason is the issue of 'measurable selection':  This can be a deep subject, but often a relatively simple way out is via regular conditional probabilities as in<p>Leo Breiman, 'Probability', ISBN 0-89871-296-3, SIAM, Philadelphia.<p>For<p>David G. Luenberger, 'Optimization by Vector Space Methods', John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York.<p>this has likely the easiest mathematical treatment of deterministic optimal control and also Kalman filtering and also the math needed for 'least action' in physics.<p>For<p>E. B. Lee and L. Markus, 'Foundations of Optimal Control Theory', ISBN 0471-52263-5, John Wiley & Sons, New York.<p>this tried to be clean mathematically when it was written.  At the beginning, should know some relatively advanced results in ordinary differential equations, e.g., as in<p>Earl A. Coddington and Norman Levinson, 'Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations', McGraw-Hill, New York.<p>For more, you can consider non-linear filtering and connections with mathematical finance.<p>The above is just from my bookshelf.
