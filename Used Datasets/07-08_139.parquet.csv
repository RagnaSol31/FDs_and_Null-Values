I looked two days ago at Wikipedia [0], but primary source should actually be Eurostat [1].<p>And you are of course right in that different countries have different systems, and numbers are not always directly comparable. A small difference is not necessarily significant, or there may be quite some difference in practice even if numbers are the same.<p>But if we look at those Eurostat numbers, what the paper says is <i>Total revenue from taxes and compulsory social contributions - % of GDP</i> so also for Portugal and Greece, those mandatory social security contributions of employer and employee are included as tax revenues in this comparison, like they are for Sweden.<p>What is significant is that the employment rate of people varies a lot in different countries; it is 73-74 % in Sweden, Netherlands and Germany, while it is below 50 % in Croatia and Greece.<p>It should also be noted that tax revenue to GDP is just a ratio, a number. It does not mean that taxes are a certain proportion of GDP, because a sum of all tax revenues is not a component of GDP.<p>Interestingly, in Portugal this ratio actually dropped from 33.2 % to 32.4 % between 2011-2012. Most countries were tightening taxes at that time. But since this number is ratio to GDP, if GDP increases and tax revenue stays the same, the ratio drops.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_GDP&oldid=645214116"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/gen_info/economic_analysis/tax_structures/2014/pr_92-2014_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/tax...</a>",1422949765.0

The name rollover effects on the Grantland page are carefully designed to keep the content uncluttered, not just to be cool; I just noticed there’s supposed to be a similar effect on the Bloomberg page, except it only works when the name itself is rolled over instead of the whole box, the avatars aren’t as stylish or consistent, and some of the the sub-descriptions are too long and spill out of their space.<p>The overall typography and layout of the Grantland page is better designed; in pretty much every detail where they differ, the Grantland page is done more carefully and with more obvious adherence to a design vision. (As one trivial example, the Bloomberg article uses a mix of straight and curly quotation marks for no apparent reason.)<p>I’d say Bloomberg’s designers copied the idea and several specific elements from the Grantland page (or another similar one), but ultimately either had shittier design constraints imposed from outside, did a rushed job, or just overall weren’t as skilled or tasteful.",1422948894.0
