They want founder's interests to be aligned with theirs.""</i><p>I responded to this, but its been said, and better:\n<i>""As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend to be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would prefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, while the VCs can afford to be ""rational"" and prefer the latter.""</i>\n<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/vcsqueeze.html"">http://www.paulgraham.com/vcsqueeze.html</a><p><i>""VC money can force you to move at breakneck speed""</i><p>You cannot predict the future- you cannot predict the level of success you will have in advance. Thus, signing agreements that put a ticking clock on your business is never a good thing.  You can work at ""breakneck speed"" anyway, without increasing the risk of breaking your neck. <p>There is a fundamental limit to how fast you can go.  Google was able to take their time and was fortunate in that regard.  Netscape killed themselves with their speed.  In fact, this forced breakneck speed is one of the killers of startups -- all the billions that were burned up in the space of 2 years between 2000-2001... much of that money, if spent more wisely, would have resulted in viable businesses in 2003.<p><i>""I think you might be interested in building more of a ""lifestyle"" business than what most people would define as a startup. ""</i><p>I'm not sure what you mean by a ""lifestyle"" business.  I consider the word ""startup"" to apply to any business.  But since I am building a high tech startup that is a web based platform, I'm not taking the relaxed approach of someone opening a hair salon, or whatever. <p>I'm looking to increase leverage, growth rate, and viability. <p>In looking for a citation, I cam across the Paul Graham essay cited above- which I think makes the same essential point I'm trying to make.  (So I'm sure I'm plagerizing him to some extent, mixed with my own experiences and stated less eloquently.)<p>In summary, many costs are now lower, thus leverage has increased, and so VC funds under traditional terms, are less desirable and less needed. \n",1174895732

At the same time, I strongly feel like I want to start a start-up (yes, I'm aware that many fail and that I have to support my wife).<p>Assuming I come up with a convincing idea/prototype and a co-founder, what are my chances of getting funding from Y Combinator?

10,6308,comment,6157.0,6157.0,0,0,lmuwanga,,,It's not deception.  The great thing about start-ups is that we determine the company culture.  With mine I'd like employees to enjoy more autonomy than in corporate where it's laid back and everyone has a voice for the direction of the company.,1174894367
11,6307,comment,6302.0,6302.0,0,0,BitGeek,,,"\nWell, since I started, might as well get all the controversial opinions out now. :-) Remember, advice is limited experience + overgeneralization.<p>--<p>Building a startup is about leverage.  Leverage is the ability to magnify your efforts.  The bay area reduces your leverage.  Especially compared to somewhere like Seattle, or Portland, or Boulder, or Salt Lake City, etc.<p>11. Everyone is rude.  It's like living in New York or LA. The laid back california of the 70s is no more. Maybe Eureka or Weed or Barstow are good places, but the bay area is harsh.  Some relish the challenge, others just want to be left alone so they can be productive.  Being productive on your product increases leverage... <p>10. California looks so run down.  This is because it is.  The quality of life is declining rapidly.  There's nowhere to go to escape urban sprawl-- not close anyway and getting there is hours in gridlock.  Being unhappy decreases focus which decreases leverage.<p>9. The population density is so high, everyone is on prozac.  (I'm not kidding.)  Being depressed reduces leverage.<p>8. After spending 2 months there, I knew the business plans of 70+ companies in stealth mode.  Everyone knows what everyone else is doing.  Thus getting an edge on your competition is difficult, they may get your employees,  and they do know your ideas.   You have less leverage.<p>7. Every resource is in high demand, thus time spent finding real estate, finding equipment, is higher.  The local and state government levels of regulation are very high, and thus time spent dealing with the burocrats is much higher.  All these are distractions you don't need.<p>6. The availability of good startup quality employees is lower in the Bay Area.  Because startups per capita is much higher there, there are more startups competing for the same employees. <p>5. Office rent is expensive, Gas is expensive, Taxes are high, everything you could want to buy costs more.    Your burn rate is going to be much higher.<p>4. You can't find a place to live.  Your employees can't either.  Both you and your employees need more money to cover basic cost of living... your burn rate is much higher. <p>3. Being in the bay area means being on the VC treadmill.  This is the opposite of working for yourself, you are working for the VCs, and unless you triple their money in three years, you get nothing.  This forces bad decisions and much less leverage.<p>2. Long frustrating commutes reduce employee productivity and morale. They also reduce the length of the workday.<p>1. The state taxes capital gains like income!  So, even if you win, you lose.<p>\nThe upside... what rocks about the bay area:<p>10. Better S&M clubs.  Much. Better.<p>9. You can fantasize about one day getting a boat and sailing out under the golden gate bridge.<p>8. Skinnier (but more expensive) women who want to date geeks.<p>7. More plastic surgery.<p>6. More networking events.  <p>5. Better parties.  <p>4. More founders to commisserate with when you're forced out of your company.  <p>3. You can TP Arringtons house if he gives you a bad review, or doesn't invite you to a party, or says something particularly slimy about someone. Hell, just do it anyway.<p>2. A lot of the good conferences are there, and if they aren't, Las Vegas is closer than to other cities.<p>And the number one good thing about the bay area:<p>1. Well, at least its not Los Angeles!<p>",1174894321

Maybe for classic style VC fueled all or nothing deals, but for those more interested in living cheaply and bootstrapping something, as long as you have a line on the good tech people in your area, perhaps you can make a go of it.  Perhaps it's even easier to get a few of them on board, because there are relatively less other interesting things going on.<p>Europe definitely isn't conducive to startups though, even registering a company is quite expensive.  I think if I were to head back to the states, I might pick someplace... not too isolated, but sort of ""second tier"".  Portland, Oregon would be great..maybe someplace like Tucson in Arizona, Boulder Colorado, and so on.<p>(*) Biotech/medical - now <i>there</i> is a field where high capital requirements and lots of regulations mean that startups really can't happen without massive investments and thus tend to cluster very tightly in certain areas - bay area, san diego, boston.",1174892822

VC money can force you to move at breakneck speed to prove your idea is worthwhile or not. It's up to you to decide if its <i>possible</i> to succeed quickly like that, or find investors willing to build more slowly.<p><i>""...replace you if you do not make the choices that lead that way.""</i><p>Again it comes down to smart investors.
