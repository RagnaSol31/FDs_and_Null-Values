It might be possible with better physical tracking and identification of the key influencers to be able to get a jump on what will prove popular with enough lead time that you can lengthen the supply chain to be able to take advantage of low cost labor, but I have not explored this idea.",1448953572.0

I would be especially interested in example verifications of lock free data structures and in comparing the proof effort to logics custom built for this purpose.<p>All the constructions I know use at least second order logic and something like Iris is - as far as I know - most elegantly described internal to the topos of trees. If you have found a good way to avoid this complexity then that&,
