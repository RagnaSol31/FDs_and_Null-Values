Stock is often called a ""paper"" asset.<p>This seems odd (also the example of programmer with stock options later) - so is he saying that because the payment is in equity you're in the financial sector / not producing real value? I'd read that last line as being disparaging about stock because it's ""paper"". \nThe only example with any bite is the investment banker admitting they think they add no value.",1312444788.0

So if I boot up, fire up the IDE, sip my coffee, pull up a bug report, then proceed to browse f'ng Hacker News for 2 hours, I don't charge my time.  Similarly, if I notice by lunchtime that I'm just plain not smart enough to program computers for money today, I'll stop the clock and go climbing or something.<p>So yeah, I bill 20-30 hours each week, but they're <i>good</i> hours.  Back in my salaried days I'd often find my butt in the Aeron for a good 60 hours a week, much of which was spent debating where to go for lunch, reading the internet, and maintaining the corporate HalfLife server.

I was, in a previous life, a programmer.<p>I do not judge employee worth by whether or not I can see them working/goofing off. I judge them by whether or not they produce the goods on time and to spec.<p>That said I have a remote worker and it is a constant battle to see whether or not I am getting what I need out of him. He is poor at communications and so the rest of the team feel as if they do not know what he is doing at any time (so they assume, in the absence of any other data, that he is not pulling his weight).<p>I am sure that he works long hours and does indeed try to produce the goods but that doesn't take away the perception (if he cannot be contacted at 1000 people assume he is still in bed (and he might be for all I know)). If he comes into the office and spends time talking to people they see it as interference (with a dollop of ""why is he sat here chatting to me instead of getting on with the work we are trying to complete"").<p>I think it takes a very disciplined person to work remotely and those disciplines are: working at home as if you were going to the office; be fanatical about communicating with your colleagues; make sure everyone knows what your routine is (if it isn't the same as theirs) so that they understand why you cannot be contacted at 1000 in the morning.",1312442701.0

He gave me some reasoning, and I wish I remember what it was. I think part of the problem is that there isn't enough of a ""fun"" or ""excitement"" component in SICP for a very many n00bs, which I was then. Python was cool. Perl was cool too. They're not terrible languages, but admittedly boggled down by syntax. Scheme had a ""for education purposes rep"" (many times propagated by professors themselves). And there was no ""easy_install mechanize"" or ""easy_install pyqt"" to start doing cool shit in Scheme (which I don't believe is true, but for whatever reason at that point it wasn't apparent this was even an option to me).<p>Overall, I had a lot more fun starting off with Python on my own time. I may have taken longer than most to come around and appreciate Scheme, and certainly find myself wishing JavaScript had less syntax. SICP is awesome though. In fact, I sold most of my books after I was done with university including that one. But maybe 3 or 4 years later, I ended up purchasing it again as I wanted to find classic Lisp literature. Only after it got delivered did I realize this was the same book. And this time around I did truly enjoy it. But I wish I remember what reasoning my professor gave for preferring Scheme over Python.",1312442641.0

While that may be nice for Dale it wouldn't enfuse me with confidence (were I his boss) that he is focussed on MY needs. He says that it is very important that a remote worker is open to as many communications channels as possible. But he doesn't start work until late morning and then works through into the night. If his colleagues need to speak to him at 0900 where are the communication channels into his dream cycle? If he needs to talk to them at 2100 does he call them at home when their working day is done?<p>My gut feeling is that this works nicely for Dale but not so much for his colleagues!,1312441992.0
