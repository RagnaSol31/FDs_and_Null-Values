The gasoline for the greater San Francisco area is pumped from the Brisbane junction.<p>For anyone who wants to move a company there, they don't have much amenities.  They have a single chinese restaurant, una taqueuria, and have a stellar coffee shop, but its not open long enough for the hacker personality.<p>Brisbane is a small town that used to be lively during the days of Johnny Cash.  Its not a substitute for a city like San Francisco or even a south bay area like Mountain View.  Its that mountain town you see up in Tahoe, but 1 mile south of the city.  I actually suggest making a daytrip to hike the abandoned railroads through it.<p>If they were to move into the open buildings in the area, this could make lives of people who use public transit annoyed.  The Caltrain stations are 1 mile away on each side away from Brisbane, there is only a single SamTrans running along Bayshore and forget BART, its way too far.  Biking is your best bet via caltrain.<p>Since Brisbane is an economical situation where they are talking about shutting down the elementary and highschools, this could be a very good thing for the city.  As for Twitter and other companies alike, its a question about what type of culture they want to grow.  As a resident of the area, I prefer living in Brisbane, rather than working.",1300262214.0
