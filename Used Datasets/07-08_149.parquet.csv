It's that\nApple wants to be the gatekeeper, who gets to tell you what kind of software\nyou can run on your device. There are plenty of types of software that are\n<i>outside of the realm of uber technical people</i> that Apple will <i>not</i> allow on\nthe device that would enhance the lives of many.<p><pre><code>  > I think there will always be a place for Nerd Jesus to do his thing.

For the parts of our codebase that are purely CPU bound Go is about 2x slower than C, fast enough that we haven't yet felt the need to rewrite in C and use GCC. For the rest of the system we get a nice flexible statically typed language that has good support for concurrency. Previously a similar project would have used Erlang/Python/C on the server side, now we can just use a single language.<p>YMMV, we (tinkercad) do data and computation intensive problems which fits the original design goal of Go pretty well. Plus we find that C/C++ programmers can transition to the language quite easily, which is a plus given the domain of graphics and computational geometry is still filled with a lot of people who have mainly used C++ for performance reasons.",1287647479.0

I bet the ratio for the average Mac user of iTMS songs+movies downloaded, to CDs+DVDs ripped, has been on a steady decline for years, and when they do this it's because they'll have decided that it's finally crossed some inflection point.<p>By the time Macs ship universally without optical drives, the idea of getting music off of a CD and onto your computer will be as backwards-seeming as getting video off of a VHS and onto a DVD. Sure, it's possible, and you might want to do it for things with sentimental value and out-of-print oldies, but in both cases it's way easier to just bring your old tapes (discs) to a media shop whose service include conversions, than it would be to find the equipment to do it on your own.",1287647179.0

In the long term, if any of the previous events in the matter are of any importance, Go is very likely to climb that list without much effort. That's just the reality of compiler optimization : It's much more easier to do for a static language.<p>On a related note, you sound very ""dynamic language"" centric. Some people actually like static typing, and i won't relaunch the debate here but both sides have pretty good argument, especially when you throw type inference into the mix.<p>In the static camp, here is a few advantages i can see to go (i'm not actually an user of the language) :<p>- Easier to get your head around than Ocaml/Haskell\n - Arguably better than java (pros: actually has proper closures, and a sane system for polymorphism. cons: no generics)\n - Compiles to machine code rather than byte-code, so doesn't depend on a VM.

37,1814617,story,,,1,0,Sourcio,Monitis Announces Game-Changing Events Monitoring as a Service,,"San Jose, CA – October 20, 2010 – Monitis, the leading provider of the world’s first Cloud-based network and application monitoring suite, today announced a significant new product launch – the Monitis Logs, on-demand system events log monitoring and analysis service.  Monitis Logs enables IT managers and system administrators to be alerted when critical issues arise during the course of standard system and application level processes.<p>Monitis Logs is a web-based, real-time universal log analyzer which can collect, analyze and report any type of log files:<p>-	event logs from distributed Windows machines, \n-	system logs from distributed Unix machines,\n-	routers, switches, and other network devices,\n-	application logs from Apache and IIS web server,\n-	FTP servers,\n-	MS SQL and Oracle database servers,\n-	DHCP servers.<p>Monitis Logs is highly customizable, enabling IT managers and system administrators to centrally manage notifications for events that are important to them.<p>At present, there is no comparable system on the market that can monitor each and every aspect of application and network performance from the Cloud.<p>Monitis Logs helps monitor threats to the enterprise IT resources and tightens security policies in the enterprise.  Thus, it helps organizations comply with various regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI), as well as archives logs for the purpose of network auditing and forensic analysis.<p>Monitis Logs’ on-demand log analyzer service also reduces system downtime, and increases network performance in the enterprise in a cost efficient way. It greatly improves visibility and saves hours of work for system administrators to troubleshoot problems on servers, applications, and the network.<p>Monitis Logs utilizes Syslog-ng and Rsyslog - the most widely-used open source tools for aggregating logs from multiple sources. They are already deployed in many server environments to consolidate logs across multiple machines on a LAN. In order to deal with massive amount of data, Monitis Logs uses a Casandra database, a highly scalable second-generation distributed database used by companies like Facebook, Twitter, Rackspace, and Digg.<p>With Monitis Logs, you can collect logs from any number of Syslog-ng or Rsyslog instances. “The benefits are clear.” Said Monitis Founder and CEO, Hovhannes Avoyan,  “You already have tons of installed application and servers that you need to keep running and up-to-date. So why install more just for network management and why provision new costly servers. Take advantage of what you already have to consolidate and manage all of your logs from the Cloud!  Talk about saving time!”<p>About Monitis All-in-One Monitoring Platform\nMonitis is the only service that provides Systems Monitoring from the Cloud.  It is leading a new era of systems management tools – the Cloud generation.  Monitis is a 100% Cloud-based, complete, and flexible IT monitoring solution, offered on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model.<p>Monitis consolidates back-end monitoring, application monitoring, website monitoring, and cloud monitoring in an all-in-one, hosted monitoring service. The platform is easily customizable and may be used for managing of all kinds of IT assets such as websites, servers, routers, switches, VoIP devices, DNS, databases, processes and any other IP devices.  Monitis provides users with a comprehensive view of their system’s health and performance.<p>About Monitis\nMonitis believes that the Cloud is the biggest thing to happen in IT management since IT management. Having seen this vision early, Monitis is now the global leader in developing this market.  It is the first affordable network and systems monitoring solution based 100% in the Cloud.<p>Besides Monitis’ enthusiastic and loyal user base of 50,000 customers from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies to government agencies and educational institutions, Monitis has won rave reviews from the technology analyst community.  These accolades include:<p>•	Being named as the “Most Innovative Start-Up for 2009” by industry analyst The 451 Group at their annual client conference in December 2009. \n•	Being ranked among the 2010 OnDemand 100 in April 2010.  The OnDemand 100 is a ranking by Morgan Stanley, KPMG, and AlwaysOn of the world’s top 100 private companies.<p>Headquartered in San Jose, CA, Monitis is lead by a team of IT professionals with deep experience running enterprise-grade IT businesses, as well as starting and selling several IT start-ups.  Using a global workforce, particularly its R&D team based in Yerevan, Armenia, Monitis is poised to move from strength to strength.  At present, it has a loyal and enthusiastic user community of 50,000, and an average month-on-month growth of over 10%.<p>Contact:\nMonitis Inc.\nSales & Marketing Department\ninfo@monitis.com\nhttp://www.monitis.com\nUS & Canada Toll Free: +1-800-657-7949\nUK + International: +44-845-527-3346\nFrance + International: +33-48-607-9035\n2880 Zanker Road Suite 203\nSan Jose, CA-95134\nUSA",1287646772.0

I would bet that it's difficult to find a phone that will give you signal strength in dBm at a high update rate.<p>I worked on a localization project using passive RFID tags and an RFID reader (a more power efficient setup than having active bluetooth nodes). Especially in a store/mall type environment with many people moving around, I think it becomes hard to get a decent model of expected signal propagation (mainly due to constantly changing multi-path signal amplitude).<p>All of that said, for your application you might be able to get by with the reduced accuracy (within 10 feet might work?).<p>With bluetooth, you also have to consider the number of connections a bluetooth receiver can handle. That will probably greatly restrict your density of nodes. RFID again holds an advantage here, in that RFID is a very low-level interaction, while bluetooth is much higher level.
