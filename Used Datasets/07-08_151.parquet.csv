Try to get a good picture of what your wife has in her mind, because emotional state or ideas are key.  The world is largely emotional, which you have to find your way of dealing with. Find out the reasons by just listening. Be aware that the answers or story you get depends on her emotional state. If something is wrong, she will not tell you something is wrong even after asking. People focus so much on the negative and forget every positive thing in a relationship but if people were perfect they wouldnt love eachother.
