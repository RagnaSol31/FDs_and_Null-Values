Where information regarding the value of a skill is difficult to quantify due to the largely tacit nature of the skill, valuation is difficult.<p>It is, however, possible to examine value by examining the differences in demand. If a firm compares their programming staff to a theoretical programmer, then determine what they would be willing to pay for wrt some specific added value that they would get at a particular level of execution, they can effectively price talent.<p>The take home point is that your first step to pricing is by way of comparing delivered value. The interesting part here is that programmers will likely discover that their skillsets are highly asymmetric wrt value delivery.<p>My question is how do we measure delivered value?

The SWS models can get up there (and I've since picked one up) but you can get a decent Seagull for under $500, and it won't break the bank.<p>- Seagulls generally have wider nut widths, which gives a little more breathing room between the strings, and is great for finger style and the 'fat finger' feeling new guitarists have.<p>- They sound AMAZING.  For my last guitar, I was dead set on buying a Taylor 514CE, but playing it side by side next to Martins and solid body Seagulls, I ended up getting another Seagull.  Obviously, this is as subjective as the ongoing 'Martin vs Taylor' holy war, but I took a neutral party to blind listen to me playing so as to mitigate the confirmation bias, and they picked the Seagull too (though obviously, I was more keen on the Seagull architecture, which I'm sure did bias things).<p>All that aside, I don't think I got really serious about learning guitar until I ultimately picked myself up a Les Paul (per your advice) to effectively ""get more skin in the game"", as well as to know that whatever mistakes I made were mine, and couldn't be blamed on the guitar.<p>Also, in addition to justinguitar.com, I would add Marty Schwartz, who has a Youtube channel at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/guitarjamzdotcom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/guitarjamzdotcom</a>.<p>He teaches a lot of beginner level, few-chord songs that people know and recognize, and even though I know that it's a Youtube video, and not interactive, the videos are recorded with a great deal of patience.",1364628445.0

As a beginner, you're really not going to appreciate the difference between that and a high end model anyways, so why spend more?<p>If you're the type that needs to blow money to feel motivated, sure, you can do better, but there's a lot to be said for learning to sound good on a shitty instrument before you are good enough that spending more will actually make you sound better.

Electrical Engineering or Mathematics come to mind. Another approach would be to indulge whatever else you're passionate about, be it Philosophy, History, Literature, or whatever.<p>I studied Physics and ended up in this industry without any formal CS classes. I would have liked to get the formal knowledge of Algorithms, Programming Languages, and Operating Systems. Perhaps a course on databases. I'm glad I took the EE intro course on digital circuitry, and I'm glad I took the math course on graph theory. I think taking a lot of math courses is a good idea.<p>So all of those in the previous paragraph are my suggestions for courses to take. The other point I'd make is that college can be a lot of fun. You're around a lot of other people of the same age, and everyone has a lot of free time and not many responsibilities. College has value outside of just knowledge acquisition.

I'd say they were a startup at that time.  His perspective is obviously colored by their success, but they only sought funding 2 years later.  Still, the definition of 'startup' is indeed vague, and PG wrote an essay on it [2].

If you're into guitars (or simply beautiful things) it's hard to put down and you find yourself spending more time with it than you'd initially planned. And that's the single best thing for getting better at it :)<p>- you get no excuse (like, ""it's not the real thing, it sucks, that's why it doesn't sound right even after many hours of practice""); it helps to remove doubts and concentrate on practicing<p>- if nothing else, it will make a decent long-term investment (high-end guitars tend to depreciate in the first years after the purchase and appreciate afterward). Some people even claim that it's a better investment than real estate, but I don't know about that<p>Ask somebody to play it for you, ask their opinion of how easy it is to play, have it set up by a good guitar technician... And keep on picking :)<p>Also, somebody mentioned justinguitar.com; it is a great site; the guy is a great teacher and a wonderful guitar player. It's got a bunch of theory lessons, but also lessons where Justin picks apart famous guitar songs and teaches you to play them in a ""dumb"" way - some might say it's cheating, but it surely helps to keep the fire burning when you can learn a tune or two without pulling your hair out trying to transcribe without the required experience (it's very hard, although that's what every guitar player should try to learn eventually).",1364627235.0

A large part of the reason medical care is so expensive for average people is that they are subsidizing the healthcare of poor people.
