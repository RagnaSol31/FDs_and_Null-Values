It enforces nothing, which has the consequence (in addition to allowing you to make a mess!) of having the whole application conforming to exactly how you think it should be organized.<p>...is precisely the deal breaker for me. If OP thinks it's hard to add/edit Rails code because it's spread out, then a lack of convention suddenly isn't a very compelling scenario for productivity.

(I heard him say something to that effect in a talk)</i><p>He must have a typechecker in his head ;). My experience with learning Clojure (knowing Haskell) is that I constantly bumped into bugs where I thought ""Haskell's type checker would have caught this"".<p>Usually, when I write new functions in Haskell, I write down the type signatures first. This helps catching many errors. For instance, if your type signature is:<p><pre><code>  f :: Integral n => [a] -> n\n</code></pre>\nYou can not accidentally apply a function (in f) to f's argument that assumes a list of lists, or return something that is not an integral number.<p>This cuts both ways: strongly encoding semantics using the type system catches many potential bugs in functions, but it also provides guarantees to the caller of a function. For instance, I know for sure that f does not return a 0/nil/None pointer, I know that the number is exact (since it is integral), etc.",1335512422.0

Those that have time to hunt for deals and deal with flakes and last minute hagglers. There is a ton of people like this, but I argue that there are even more people that would use it if it were cleaner. Why force people to develop ""muscle memory""? The rate of recycling of used goods would be much higher if craigslist was more open to either improvement of their platform or to startups building features for their community. Maybe the folks that want to develop ""muscle memory"" to fish out deals can do so at the cost of their time and score the best deals, but the value of time varies a lot from person to person and even from year to year. For example I sold a bunch of stuff on craigslist in college, but now that I have a job I don't bother with anything less than $200. I usually just donate it to the salvation army and write it off my taxes or let crap pile up in my garage. If I had an app that I could use to post and sell objects quickly and easily I would use it. I'd even be happy to pay someone to make this simple and easy. I am not saying to make a new service a paid service, but let free markets and innovative entrepreneurs figure out how to justify the costs of improvement. I definitely think craigslist has generated an insane amount of value, but I the bar can be set higher. They have definitely done net good, but if they continue to use their monopoly of the local online marketplace as a justification for not improving their site, I think it is bogus.<p>Either improve craigslist or let others build value added tools on top of craigslist. Why stop an app like Bazaar that helped people post things easily? Let people make up their own mind. Using smartphones as an example again, people will trade int their iPhone 3GS for $80, when they can get $160 for it on CL. So there is definitely demand somewhere in the massive gap of services that retailers and B2C companies offer and what exists on craigslist. Making consumer to consumer commerce smoother and easier is a huge opportunity in my mind that is not only lucrative, but fills in a big gap that exists because craigslist is still stuck in 1995.",1335511659.0
