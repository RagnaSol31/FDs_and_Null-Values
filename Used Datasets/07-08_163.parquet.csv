Solutions include immediately offering trade free of tariffs, to help countries stabilize following the collapse of their governments (there are a few good presentations on TED.com about this), and offer the expertise to create legal structures that enshrine property rights for all.  We don't need nor would we want colonialism (or even the mercantilist approach France still practices to a certain degree).  We can however provide good examples and support countries that attempt to make the transition.

If you've got a legitimate argument to make against Facebook, make it; if you don't, you're allowed to stop arguing at any time. It's not like people will dislike you here for not pressing an argument. The one thing you <i>will</i> get judged for is snark. Stop it.<p>If you don't see a reply button (I think that's a glitch in the site; happens to me all the time), then you click the ""link"" button up top, next to ""parent"". That'll give you a box in which to reply.<p>I'll apologize for the abruptness of my last comment to you. Hopefully you'll understand there was a reason behind it, and that reason is: This debate springs up once a month, and every time somebody new comes up saying Facebook is like MySpace is like Friendster, and every time I feel the need to explain why they're wrong, and it takes an hour and leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. I'm a bit of a Facebook fan, and I figure that since most HN users aren't I might as well step in and shout my things.<p>If you'd like to, I can craft a response to you that addresses that one point specifically. As it is, I spent a good twenty minutes looking for previous things I've said in the hopes that you can get the gist of my argument, and hopefully respond in a non-arsewipe way that leads to fun conversation that leads to us each enjoying the sight of our respective names in future debates.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=513550"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=513550</a><p><i>In 2005 I was working on the quality assurance team for a social network start-up with a pretty neat set of technologies. Part of my goal was to get other people to move off MySpace. The site I was with, Zoints, had a cleaner design, more features, and some parts of it were much more intuitive. People refused to switch. They had friends on MySpace, and they had nothing to gain from switching. Social networks are all about the users, and they were in one basket.</i><p><i>This is important not just as a lesson of how hard it is to make people switch, but of how good Facebook is. Everybody had a MySpace, but they switched over to Facebook anyway. By the time Facebook let high schoolers register, they had 85% of all college students as active users, and half of those were active daily. Now I would suspect it has more than just 85% of all high schoolers registered, and it's leaking down to middle school registration. People at work use it a lot, and as a result entire families are signing up.</i><p><i>Many people here don't ask themselves just how that happened, which is damn shortsighted. I mean, my mother signed up. My grandfather signed up. He comments on my Facebook statuses. My young cousin got an account. And it's not like Twitter, where people want to ""tap into a network"". It's not like getting a blog. Simply put, Facebook keeps people in contact better than any other application does. It provides an incredible interface. People who know nothing about tech just ""get it"". They figure out how to write photos and write notes and update statuses and make friends. It's that easy. It's so easy, and so universal, that middle schoolers get them, not just to be cool, but to talk to other kids. Older family members get them to talk to their relatives. My mother currently has a network of 39 friends, including mothers in the neighborhood and friends at work. That's pretty damn impressive.</i><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=255532"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=255532</a><p><i>Facebook becomes just a point for those few times you want to plan things way in advance, or when you just need to vent to friends. It becomes useful in a way. Not productive, but useful. And what makes it useful are the things Facebook built itself: photos, events, notes. Any applications beyond that are only good for amusement's sake. The top app developers get that.</i>",1251186850.0

This turned out to be a much better arrangement - not only did these industrial countries have access to high grade chemicals and lab equipment, they also had far better shipping routes.

A lot of that work was contract work in hospitals in poor neighborhoods that had a lot of trouble staffing their departments.  I now work in a very, very nice upper middle class neighborhood in Silicon Valley.<p>Absolutly, unequivocally I can say that if you're sick and want the best medical care, go to the hospital in the neighborhood where the rich people live.  The difference in care is night and day.  Well to do hospitals have patients with private insurance that pay a lot more than Medicare or public health insurance.  They also tend to expect more from their medical care, and are usually a lot more educated and can be more proactive in their care.<p>One ER that I worked at in Chicago, I drove past a funeral home.  And almost every single shift, there was a group of kids standing on the street corner outside of the funeral home ""tipping a forty"" for a friend that had just died.<p>I've worked in ER's that were so overcrowded, that when a patient died, we'd have to shove the body into a dirty utility room to make room for patients we could still help.   That would <i></i>* never <i></i>* fly in a rich hospital.<p>In poor neighborhoods, people are used to dying young.  They are used to the crappy care that's given them, and yes, they tend to have a lot more lifestyle diseases.<p>But, why do they have more lifestyle disease?  In Silicon Valley, I can go to my local farmers market, and I can afford to spend money on organic produce.  When I didn't have a car, and lived on the edge of the ghetto in Chicago, it was really easy to get my calories at McDonald's down the street or get crap food at the 7-11 down the block instead of walking  12 blocks each way to the grocery store.<p>Poverty does kill, for many reasons.

This is not the same as not being able to procreate at <i>all</i>, which, applied to the entire population, means effectively committing genocide. All lowering the fertility of developing cultures would do is concentrate each family's wealth (fewer children to feed means each gets a better chance), thereby creating more opportunities for highly-educated individuals to <i>create</i> this ""good government"" that is necessary to effect industrialization.<p>But frankly, I wasn't really talking about poverty. Overpopulation is a problem we will eventually face as a species, <i>whether or not</i> any one of us lives in poverty. There's only so much room on this planet, and [eventually] living on other worlds just isn't looking very promising as an alternative. ""Social solutions"" aren't; they're really social <i>management</i> of the problem by given cultures, and cultures eventually fall.<p>As I was saying, one of the main ""problems"" we have as humans is that we're just <i>too good</i> at breeding. When left to our own devices, without cultural mores in one specific direction or the other, we naturally produce <i>too many</i> more humans. When we figure out genetic engineering, and how to create safe, stable methods of delivering genetic sequence ""alterations"" to the entire species (retroviruses that won't mutate, etc.) one of the first things we should do is lower our own natural fertility rate. More sex, less babies, fewer complications all-around. (Also note that industrial cultures have below-2.0 <i>reproductive</i> rates, but that says nothing about their fertility, just their willingness to put their work before the goal of creating a family. A <i>post</i>-industrial society doesn't necessarily <i>have</i> work that is all-consuming enough to <i>let</i> you be diverted from creating a family.)<p>But again, as should be obvious from even the nature of my suggestion (involving technologies which do not yet exist) this isn't a solution to a problem we have today.

The argument here is purely biological and doesn't really need a defense.  I'll preempt the usual counter argument by saying that if we could quantify decision making ability, I'd be all for using that instead of age.  But age is the best we've got right now.<p>As I said before, if it doesn't affect anyone else I don't really care what you do.  Parents can do whatever they want (drugs or otherwise) if it doesn't affect their kids or other dependents.  In addition, anyone with a job needs to consider their responsibility to their company.  But hey, if there's someone where none of these connections apply, s/he can do whatever they want.  I certainly wont judge.",1251184778.0

If so, I'd love for him to read this comment, and anyone who generally supports his ideas to read this comment, because I think it could change lives.<p>I read this piece by him:<p><a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/handwritingwall"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/handwritingwall</a><p>Short summary: A speaker tells a story about an evil king. The king gets 10 hostages, and you, and asks you to decide, ""I'll kill the hostages, or you can die in their place. What do you choose?"" When asked, most people choose to sacrifice themselves.<p>Same scenario. Evil king, 10 hostages. But now the king asks, ""I'll kill the hostages, or you can give me all your money and live in poverty for the rest of your life. Which do you choose?"" And the people asked think, and it seems reasonable to choose the poverty alternative. Certainly, it's better than dying, and they already agreed to die to save the people.<p>Then it talks about children dying in Africa, and how with just a little bit of money you could save those people. The speaker concludes, ""Thus if you decide to go on with the life you were probably planning to lead, you will be letting 10 people die rather than give up your flat-screen television and your cocktail parties. And that is more than gluttony, it is murder.""<p>Now there's a major, major, major flaw with this line of thinking, which is also in ""Poverty Kills"" and many pieces along those lines. It's the assumption that there are no choices besides the ""evil king"" and ""dying/sacrificing for the rest"".<p>Never was this more clear than my travels in the back provinces of China. I climbed Mount Emeishan in China, and the locals farm the mountain and live quite poorly. By selling food and crafts on the side of the road to visitors (mostly Chinese, didn't see any foreigners besides me) - by selling, they got the money they needed to buy tools, medicine, and so on. I got to eat some local food, and bought a wooden sword for my then-kid brother. The sword cost basically nothing except a few hours, and the money from that could buy weeks worth of medicine or seasons worth of clothing, and so on.<p>This money went to the heads of households and most industrious people on Emeishan, who in turn would help their relatives and so forth. The Communist Chinese government couldn't begin to do half the job feeding and providing medicine to these people that free trade did. It was never more clear to me - honestly working for money and spending it on things I wanted helped other people. It helped the people who paid me to for them (I freelance/contract work, I haven't been salaried ever). It helped the people who I bought food and crafts from. Everyone won.<p>So back to the ""evil king"" - what if instead of giving in  for the hostages right now, you came back later, kicked in the door with your sword, and assassinated the evil murderous king? That's the third option.<p>There's more choices than ""give up your money in taxes/charity or bad outcomes happen"". I almost built an international school in China with my girlfriend. I still might go build schools someday. If I do, they'll run for a profit. The teachers will be paid more than they would at another job (or else they wouldn't come work for us). The parents will value it (or else they wouldn't send their kids there). The administrators of the school will be paid. The kids will learn better, speak more fluent English, and increase trade between China and English speaking countries. That'll bring more money to China, and lower the expenses of all English speaking people abroad who can afford the Chinese goods.<p>If there were more taxes, and I had less of my own money to fund a school, it wouldn't be possible. The Chinese government is not run by people as driven, intelligent, and empathetic as my girlfriend. If they took her money, and the American government took my money, then we couldn't build a school, and instead you'd have schools like Sichuan and the United States currently have. Quality - not so much.<p>Charity has its place. I've run charity events and donate to charities. I tend to support St. Jude's Children Hospital in North America and Great Ormond Street in London. A friend is getting a therapy dog program started in Tokyo, I pledged some money for that and volunteered for the auction.<p>But there's greater options. Really now, governments have proven themselves incompetent many times over. And nonprofits, God bless them, frequently have people drawing way over market salaries and making themselves rich, while working at a job with less pressure, lower expectations, and very little accountability. If you look at the statistics, nonprofits are depressingly ineffective and do very little towards succeeding in their missions and improving the world.<p>There's a third option. It's improving the world honestly, getting compensated for it, and paying people who improve your life in return. That system has built almost everything of value on the planet. I reject the ""evil king or your life"" dichotomy; it is false; there are other options.<p>Aaron's a hell of a writer, and I hope he reads this. I know political views can be like religions - but I try not to make mine. I've studied all sorts of history and sciences and commerce and all manner of things. The results look like charity/government (and <i>especially</i> taxes) underperform the rather cold and heartless market in any long term time horizon. Now, these aren't fashionable viewpoints in many intellectual circles, but we all ought to consider them - is the end good is our objective, then even unfashionable opinions against our circles' worldviews must be considered.<p>If anyone knows Aaron, would they kindly point him to this comment? He seems like an incredibly intelligent and thoughtful guy, and I really hope there's something I've written in here that's valuable to him.",1251183681.0
