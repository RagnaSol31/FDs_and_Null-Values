It's obviously a success but to me the size of the community became too much to be a functioning community. Every submission had thousands of comments. The ""smartass"" comments are always at the top, the mindlful ones get lost in the middle, mine ends up at the end. What's the point in chiming in with meaningful discussion when there's 2,000 ""chit chat"" comments like ""That's what your mom told me last night"" followed by ""That's I told your mom last night"", followed by ""That's what she told me to tell your mom last night"", followed by another regurgitation of the previous comment in a different order.<p>=== Why I left Reddit ===<p>I remember Reddit back when it had tech news and startup advice. Back when it was like Hacker news basically. At that time Reddit's comments were of the highest quality. It was the most intelligent & sometimes hilarious discussion I had ever seen in an online community. So I fell in love with Reddit. But as it grew (especially from Digg refugees and popularity) Redditors started to ""participate"" on an astronomical scale. Because of the shear amount of participation, the first members to comment on a story (despite having  mediocre comments) had a better chance of getting upvoted, those who waited a few hours to submit their comment got their voice lost among thousands of comments and no one would ever see it.<p>The problem with upvotes is this: They don't scale up very well. Whoever comments first competes with LESS comments and so has a HIGHER chance of getting their comment upvoted. Remember, just because your comment was one of the first to be seen and voted on doesn't mean it contributes the most to the conversation, the best comments come from people hours, sometimes days, after a submission gets popular. So by the time high quality comments came in, the community of Redditors had already received and upvoted the most mediocre, smart ass comments with tired memes, old jokes, & complete non seriousness. Even if they spotted your high quality comment that revealed something incredibly profound and rare, you never stood a chance at catching up to the comments at the top.<p>Also, as Reddit's popularity grew, the worst of humanity came out. Off-topicness, mob-rule, endless memes all became the norm. You had to flee to a subreddit and even then, the massive amount of comments (most of them one liners and chit chat) was just too much to wade through. I became frustrated at trying to have a serious conversation in a room full of jokers, I was just fed up with trying to speak in a room full of thousands of people yelling. So I just left.<p>My last few days I was a Redditor, I remember every submission had comments like these at the top:<p>Comment",

Having been there myself, all I can say is hold on tight, it'll be an interesting time to say the least.<p>While every situation is unique, I'd say expect to be playing the supporting role for mom and baby.  Getting used to certain paradigm shifts are also very interesting.  For example, once the baby's here, you're Dad first and Steve second.<p>Expect the on-the-side startup to suffer, at least for the first 4 months.  Babies are particularly fragile at till about 4 months old.  Even a minor cold can turn into something very serious.  So, it's a good think that you work from home.  That'll at least spare you from passing out in the middle of the day in a company meeting while the speaker is directly addressing you.<p>I can't emphasize the supporting role enough.  If mom can breastfeed the baby, encourage her to do so long as she can (within reason of course, anywhere from 6mo~8mo should be good).  Breastfed babies are generally less susceptible to disease, have better brain development and a whole lot more.  There's a huge push from formula companies to get the baby on formula ASAP, resist this if you're able to (it's a lot easier on the wallet too).  However, this process takes quite a toll on mom.  So, expect to dedicate some energy dealing with all the hormonal changes.  Keep an eye out for postpartum depression (for both of you, it can affect dads too).<p>Warnings and worries aside.  You're probably going to be in for the time of your life.  Enjoy the baby.  Watching them grow is by far one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  I can say for sure that I've learned and grown a in that time as well.  I look forward to coming home every day.

The tone says to me that his money should have solidified or shaped the opinions of those his industry donated to.<p>That's very different from trying to get someone elected because you believe their view of how to best serve their constituents aligns with your platform.  Now, I'm sure you will find many people here who will argue that that, too, is corrupt.  But it's not so blatant.<p>However, there's one more piece to the puzzle: None of the politicians have said they are going to give up on passing legislation that fights copyright infringement.  They've shelved two bills, that's it.  They haven't announced any bad intentions toward his platform, and they haven't established a pattern of ignoring his platform.

Google is losing that ability. It makes things like their Q4 'miss' [1] more likely.<p>It is of course entirely Google's prerogative on how they spend their money. And if you look at their Q4 results [2] they deposited 2.97 <i>billion</i> dollars into the bank in cash based on the work done by their 32,467 employees. That is $91,477 in cash for the 90 days that ended December 31st. Lets say every employee ate 3 gourmet meals a day, at a cost of $15+$25+$50 or $90, and consumed another $25 in snacks so $115 per employee per day. (and those are gonna be some fat employees!) That is 32,467 x $115 x 90 days or $335 million dollars. Or about 11 cents of each dollar they dropped into the bank. The numbers of course reflect the costs that a typical restaurant would charge that was profitable, and $25 a day in snacks? That is probably way beyond what most anyone would eat so these numbers are way over if anything.<p>But at some point between the original prospectus where Larry and Sergei told potential investors that they were going to spend a lot on perks like this so get used to it; to today, where sometimes elaborate explanations about social consciousness and environmental justice precede the denial of those perks. Someone decided the company's interest was to build a cash pile, not invest in quality of life benefits for the rank and file. Sad really, they are the kind of company that can afford to do it, and now they choose not to.
