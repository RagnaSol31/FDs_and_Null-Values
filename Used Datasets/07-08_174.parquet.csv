Though that said ARM is also in that area and alot cheaper to obtain ARM compatable kit.  ARM was born out of frustrations/limitation with the original 6502 CPU and in that may be a better more practical use of your educational time.<p>That all said - every programmer of any language should at least learn/play with one assembly language sometime in there life, maybe one or two.

They are just as wrong in their beliefs as those who supported segregation were or those who were against women's suffrage were. Marginalizing these people for their ridiculously antiquated beliefs is fair game, IMO.<p>A thousand times this.  Some opinions need to be taken out back and shot, and being against gay marriage is one of those opinions.

Section 3 defines marriage for purposes of federal law.<p>Section 2 (specifying that the full faith and credit clause does not apply to same-sex marriage), which Law Prof Andrew Koppelman suggests is roughly as effective as a ban on hunting unicorns is not before the court and if Koppelman is right (and the section does nothing anyway), will never be before the court.<p>My prediction is that they will, and they will strike down this provision on the grounds that defining marriage has been a traditional role of state governments and that the federal government must defer to the states as to who is married and who can be married.  They would then hold that there is no valid reason for the federal government to treat these differently.  This decision is likely to be 7-1, 8-1, or 9-0 depending on whether Scalia dissents and whether Kagan recuses herself.<p>The result will be that it will fully revert to a state-by-state approach and that if you are in a state which recognizes same-sex marriage you can bring your same-sex spouse over, but if you are a resident of a state which does not, you may not.",1341732179.0

One is the special rights and privileges given to married couples, and the other is the actual word ""marriage"". What I was suggesting is that the government should drop the term ""marriage"" from their vocabulary and change it to something else, like ""domestic partnership"". I highly doubt that anyone employing rational thought would suggest we can do away with the concept of mutually exclusive partnership between two people in the legal realm. Part of what the people on the right are arguing for is to not have the actual term ""marriage"" redefined by the government. That word has a lot of tradition and meaning. If we turn the conversation towards removing that word from the government's laws and replacing it with something that has less specific meaning to people, then the conversation is purely about equal rights and not a fight over a word and the tradition behind it.
