This capability is that of expressing purity via the type system. Monads - and by extension, monad transformers - are a tool designed to assist the expression of imperative algorithms in a pure context.<p>The reason I phrase it this way is because people often make the mistake of assuming Haskell is lacking expressive power due to its purity. This is untrue. Haskell is perfectly capable of expressing messy, mutable, imperative algorithms just like any other language. Other languages, on the other hand, struggle to express many of the pure algorithms and data structures used in Haskell; they simply lack the ability to enforce purity within the language and are thus reduced to purity by convention.",1405667372.0
