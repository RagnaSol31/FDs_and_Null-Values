What would you pay to outright buy irrevocable permissions world-wide for e.g. &quot;The Capital in 21st Century&quot; which sold 1.5 million copies?

It is a comedic layer added by the directors to make you laugh, because it is a comedy.<p>But the truth beneath the funny is that less smart people generally make poorer life decisions.
