The connection between the outside world and the premises will always be outside the \nscope of any type system.&quot;<p>Which is precisely why I enjoy types: Self referential consistency makes sure I do not make errors within the logical model I have set for myself. It does not help me build better models but once those models are built it helps me to compose programs that do not break the invariants in the chosen formalism.<p>Which, I think tells exactly what static types are good for: For those sort of problems that benefit from having a formal specification. There are a lot of programs that have this quality.<p>So the argumentation is a bit skewed off. It should not be about whether static or dynamic types are better but more focus on what are those identifiable problem patterns where a dynamic type system helps programmer create more value than a static one and vice versa.",1423726988.0

The ideal repetition unit is one cycle of the entire figure eight. But by the frame similarity heuristic, we will find that the cross in the figure eight creates two identical positions which give rise to a half-cycle of the figure eight also being considered viable. In this half cycle, the point abruptly changes direction at the cusp of a tear-drop path.",1423724999.0
