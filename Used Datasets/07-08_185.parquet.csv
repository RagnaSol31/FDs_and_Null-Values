You build this by starting with a couple of tasks where you pay the subcontractors hourly rate, to feel each other out, but you need to make sure you are clear about what you want after that: project based work, help on various tasks with an hourly pay model etc.<p>Since good subcontractors are hard to find you should not treat them as interchangeable pieces and try to get the lowest rate possible. Being transparent will go a long way towards building a professional relationship that will allow you to collaborate long term on multiple projects.<p>On this note, I would be interested in hearing what you are looking for as I would enjoy doing some subcontracting considering I do not really enjoy the whole client dance.
