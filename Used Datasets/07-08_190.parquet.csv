Many real world problems in the technology industries would never have existed if intellectual property laws could not be applied to restrict communication and compatibility. Allowing patents to effectively restrict the transfer of data, because the tools available to either or both parties effectively require patented formats or similar, is either a tax on communication or a tool for censorship, depending primarily on the willingness of the patent holder to licence on useful terms.<p>Ironically, the US actually got this right in the case of fonts and copyrights, in that while a specific program to describe a font might be subject to copyright, the design of the font itself is not. Thus unlike certain other creative industries, no-one can go around claiming royalties on every publication displayed in a sans serif font because it looks a bit similar to something from the early 1900s and (insert dubious legal argument about derivative works restarting the copyright clock here).",1445154278.0

And educated parents tend to better stimulate their kids. I remember a French statistics from the 90s showing that about 25-30% of the kids going to the Ecole Polytechnique (top engineering school in the country) come from families which do not own a television. Not sure there is a direct effect between watching TV and success but there is a direct effect between good parenting and success. This is why a good education system is fundamental to make up for what sometimes the parenting does not provide.<p>The other possibility, though not a politically correct one is genes. Rationally I find it hard to believe that genes play no role in our intellectual capacity, and they would mechanically self perpetuate poverty.<p>Without any hard science to back it, my intuition is that a brain is like a muscle, people are born with different muscle structure, largely driven by genes (but with a certain degree of randomness). So not everyone can make it to the olympics. But going to the olympics also requires hard work and training. If all one does is eat burgers and watch TV, the only outcome is to become obese irrespective of the muscle structure.",1445152088.0

Similarly, every fourth number is a multiple of four; but one must get to 102 before the fourth becomes an even divisor. Every power of ten also misses six as an even factor, and one must wait until 103 (1000) before eight divides in evenly. All told, ten simply skips many of the most important fractions, and those it does catch it generally catches imperfectly. Ten is certainly a poor base from this perspective.&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;This shows that all bases have irregular wholenumber fractions; for example, the reciprocal of the base less one is always 0.1. However, it also shows that one base stands out in the regularity of the most common and important fractions (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8): that is the base of twelve.&quot;",1445151619.0
