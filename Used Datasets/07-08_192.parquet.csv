They should also spend every possible moment learning about the world, and every possible moment trying new experiences and getting out of their comfort zone. There aren't enough moments, so you need balance. Lack of balance in one direction is correlated with spoiled children. I <i>think</i> that's all he's saying.<p>(Personally I think it's hard to cause irreversible damage by spoiling children; it's amazing what they'll outgrow.)",1316159987.0

None of them try to make a profit, therefor they are non-profit. It's not really that complicated.<p>Most religious organizations turn large profits.  That they are used to build more churches, mosques, and temples does not detract from the fact that it's a profit.<p>>Except that they don't charge. Which of course does make them different.<p>Again, this is false.  There isn't a cover charge, but there's an expectation of donation.  It's no different from a tip.  Waiters aren't non-profit, and neither are churches.<p>>You are biased because you (presumably) don't like what they do, but that's your opinion, and you should not assume everyone shares it.<p>A) I don't assume everyone shares it.  B) I like a great deal of what many religious organizations do and have done, and dislike a great deal they do as well.<p>>And it's interesting you find the only organization in the world that claims to be a for-profit religion (Scientology) and use that to paint the rest of them. (Again barring fraud, which obviously does happen.)<p>This is patently false.  From the Catholic Church, to Evangelical preachers, to most other organized religions, they all turn a profit.<p>>Your post sounds like you want to be the arbiter of which messages are for profit and which are not.<p>Message has nothing to do with turning a profit.  That is determined by the money you take in minus the money you spend.  I count money spent on growing the organization, through the building of additional churches and missionary works, as an investment in future profits, and hence not deductible from profits (to the extent it would make an organization a non-profit).<p>I've clearly stepped on your toes.  I apologize for the offense I've caused, but not for the words that caused it, which I stand by.",1316159889.0

Up to date results:<p><a href=""http://attractivechaos.github.com/plb/plb-lang.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://attractivechaos.github.com/plb/plb-lang.png</a><p><a href=""http://attractivechaos.github.com/plb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://attractivechaos.github.com/plb/</a><p>The difference between V8 and LuaJIT is nowhere near 2x on matmul and comes from differences in language features (no debugger interruption support for generated code in LuaJIT2) and lack of certain optimizations (e.g. array bounds check elimination) in V8 [matmul_v2.lua used for measurements relies on ffi arrays which do not include bounds checks at all]. Code generated by both compilers is roughly equivalent (invariants hosted out of the loop, temporary double values are on xmm registers, etc).

49,3003539,comment,3002838.0,3002838.0,5,0,mas644,,,"-Good points about OCaml/Standard ML. One big omission though (at least I did not see it) was the lack of emphasis on the concept of ""pattern matching"". I'm not sure about SML, but with OCaml, everything is implemented using pattern matching. Pattern matching is an important concept in all functional languages to begin with. What makes ML datatypes so powerful is the ability to pattern match on typed expressions. Unlike dynamically-typed functional languages like Lisp, your expression and all of its subexpressions have a type. More importantly a type that can be statically resolved. When you write code it's guaranteed to be safe meaning that the code did not corrupt memory or perform operations that do not make sense (e.g. try to take the square root of the string ""banana""). Unlike other clunkier statically typed languages, type inference automatically resolves the types of most values -- so the code ends up looking compact and clean like a dynamic language but at the same time type safe. Type safety is a big deal...ML makes it impossible to violate the type system. No recasting allowed, no way to corrupt the process memory, no way to cause runtime type errors :)<p>-Where it fails though still...and this is a big deal in this day and age, kernel level thread support. User level threads can solve a lot of problems, but when you're dealing with heavy number crunching and the algorithms of the future (computer vision, AI, highly parallel search, etc)...you need to use all the cores! Intel is talking about having thousands of cores on a single die by the end of the decade. We have to run 1000 OCaml processes and do process level messaging passing??
