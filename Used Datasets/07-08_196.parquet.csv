10,5661323,comment,5660717.0,5661100.0,2,0,trippy_biscuits,,,"You make some fair points.  I don't believe stupid gets constrained by age.  In counterpoint I offer the truism, ""you don't know what you don't know,"" using the collective you while referring to someone with a given point of view.  A person that's ignorant of a certain body of knowledge may not even be aware of that ignorance let alone its size and scope.  Generally, the younger the person, the exponentially larger the size and scope because that body of knowledge is not academic, it's earned through life experiences.<p>I know an 80+ year old former farmer.  He does not have a smart phone and cannot operate a computer or any other advanced technology.  He's not stupid by any means even though many points of view could judge him so.  Despite any rubric that measures him as stupid, he knows things that cannot be learned through experience because things just aren't done that way anymore.  He knows the how and why of something in many more ways than someone half his age can even fathom.<p>Take the older sys admin that used to build firewalls and sendmail.cf files by hand, for example.  Just because there's no need to do that anymore doesn't mean that the experience is null and void.  Older folks often know how and why something works (technology, human relations, etc.) while the younger folks just know how to repeat observed actions until it looks like it works.  Granted, this behavior isn't just limited to the young (some people never learn).  Don't discount someone's ability to contribute meaningfully just because of age.  That's exactly what the sampling from stackoverflow revealed.",1367826798.0

A server serving static webpages will enjoy better performance and static webpages are simpler to manage in many ways.  However, some of the benefits a CMS gives you like auto-generating headers and navigational aids, etc, are missing if you just write some straight HTML yourself.  So a static content generator can read your blueprint for the website layout and generate the webpages for you, and they don't have to be pieced together on every request they way they are with a CMS like Wordpress.  Anytime you have new content to add, you can just add it to your files that you feed into the static content generator and it builds all the webpages of your entire website for you once again.  I'll reiterate that the server doesn't have to waste any time processing the files to send them down to your browser--essentially, they're already complete and ready to serve down to you.<p>Bootstrap is basically a CSS framework.
