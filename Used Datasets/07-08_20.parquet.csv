1,1028333,comment,1028327.0,1028327.0,0,0,knieveltech,,,My vote: complete waste of time. I experimented very briefly with rentacoder before giving up on the idea of sites like this altogether. My experiences with services like this (and to a lesser extent craigslist) have been unpleasant to say the least. These days I only take on gigs that come to me through my network and even then I'm careful to vet potential clients before accepting a gig.,1262505148.0
2,1028332,comment,1027785.0,1027785.0,0,0,coffeemug,,,"I'd imagine that computing the cost of health care is an incredibly complex undertaking. Without being able to review the methodology used, this graph is next to useless. For example, here are just a few questions that come to mind (and I'm sure more would arise if the methodology was properly peer reviewed):<p>1. Are there no data points between the United States and Switzerland? Are there no data points above the United States and below Mexico? If there are, that would make the graph misleading and they have to specify this limitation if they're intellectually honest. If there aren't, they have to demonstrate that they've gone through the exhaustive list of countries and there are no other ""interesting"" data points.<p>2. Is the cost adjusted for cost of living at a given country? If not, that would make the graph extremely misleading. If yes, what adjustment strategy was used? Can we see the ratio between cost of health care and median yearly salary, for example?<p>3. What does ""average life expectancy at birth mean""? Does it account for countries that have a significantly lower birth rate than the United States? I would guess not, which could significantly affect the perception of the numbers. How does one normalize for something like that?<p>4. How was the currency conversion rate computed? Currency prices fluctuate throughout the year, did they account for that? How much does that affect the numbers? Could be a lot, could be a little, but I need to know whether this was taken into account.<p>5. What does ""universal health coverage"" mean? Soviet Union had universal health coverage and no medication, surgery performed by under-qualified residents, and no post-surgery care, unless you know someone or bribe the doctor, of course.<p>6.  Surely there are countries without universal health care other than the U.S. and Mexico - how do they stack up?<p>7. I'm willing to bet a country like Poland has <i>a lot</i> more homeless people that don't factor into the life expectancy numbers than the U.S. That begs a more general question of whether the same methodology was used for computing the cost or life expectancy for each country. If they simply took official numbers from each country, it's almost certain that they were computed differently. Was this accounted for? If not, I need to know. If yes, how were the numbers normalized?<p>One could probably come up with dozens of questions like these. Of course any analysis of a problem that complex can be called into question, that doesn't mean every analysis is useless. But before we can seriously discuss this graph, or base any policy decisions on it, they at least have to provide the methodology. It doesn't look like this graph is intellectually honest to me, and the burden of proof is on the author.",1262504924.0

I guess.<p>The thing about bottom up parser generators, is that they really aren't all that useful.<p>There's a dirty little secret in compiler development: most ""real world"" compilers use hand written top-down recursive decent parsers. They don't use Bison.<p>The classical argument in favor  of using bottom up parsing is that it can recognize a larger class of grammars and is often more efficient than top down parsing.<p>This, however, ignores one huge point. Parser generators are leaky abstractions. They almost always suck at error recovery. This is particularly true for bottom up parsers because they don't have a lot of contextual information. Error recovery is extremely important for several reasons:<p>1. Parsers with bad error recovery give shitty error messages.<p>2. Things like intellisence, which always operate on syntactically incorrect code, won't work without good error recovery.<p>Some people have done research on automatically injecting error recovery into bottom-up parsers. These systems, however, are always based on heuristics, and supporting one set of scenarios well always leaves another set of scenarios not supported well. Those are exactly the kind of situations where you need humans to tune things.<p>The problem with parser generators is that their input languages are not turing complete (by obvious necessity). That means when the parser generator does something wrong, you can't always fix it. Most abstractions in computer science are not like this. They involve one turning complete programming language being compiled down into a lower level turning complete programming language. When abstractions leak, you can always code around the leakage.<p>But, with a parser generator, you can't do this. If you want to implement robust error recovery, then you have to add explicit productions to the grammar to handle them. That becomes extremely tedious extremely quickly.<p>That means to create a real parser, for use in interacting with humans, you need one of two things:<p>1. A customized parser generator, tuned for the exact parser you are generating.<p>2. A parser written by hand.<p>Item ",

Does any freelancing site stand out from the rest or are they all pretty much the same?<p>I've heard horror stories about people not getting paid, projects never getting finished, etc.. how representative are they?<p>Scanning through the listings on some of the sites, it seems a lot of ads are looking people with many years experience and a buzzword-compliant resume to work for them for next to nothing.

8,1028326,comment,1028314.0,1028314.0,0,0,cwan,,,"Japan never actually dealt with the bust - and instead of taking the short term hit, they spread it over two decades.  This was the problem - not the loss of confidence - which is an effect rather than the cause of the current malaise.  When asset prices ultimately collapsed following the bubble, the government chose to prop up zombie banks instead of writing down grossly overvalued assets and restructuring debts - an issue that I worry about myself in the US though I think (and hope) American policymakers are wary of similar consequences.<p>This goes back a bit to the debate over whether or not it's possible to have economic growth without dynamism. That yes, you do have booms but you also have busts but that the net benefits of the booms (in productivity and innovation) far outweigh the consequences of any bust.  Governments who attempt to dampen busts (e.g. minimum wage, stimulus, propping up businesses that should otherwise die off) as a corollary also tend to dampen recovery and growth (e.g. resulting higher interest rates, slower hiring, stagnant growth of new businesses as zombie firms squeeze resources that would have otherwise been reallocated).",1262504397.0

First, if WalMart gives 1% of revenues, and they have $400 billion in revenues, they give $4 billion to charity. They say $13 billion is given to charity by corporations. Note that U.S. GDP is $14 trillion (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States</a>), so WalMart takes in under 3% of that. It seems off that 30% of all charitable giving by corporations is high for one organization.<p>Also, it says that public charities ""collect a total of "" more than $1.4 trillion. But we only give $300 billion to charity. Where does the other $1.1 trillion come from?",1262503406.0

Heck, even the Salvation Army is a religious charity.<p>But I think you're right that the structure of a country like France  allows it to run on less charitable giving. I would imagine that the welfare state eliminates the need for a lot of food kitchens and shelters, for instance.<p>American numbers are also inflated by a large number of organizations operating as 501c3s and collecting contributions that would not be considered ""Charities"" by most people. For instance, the second largest 'purpose' grouping for 501c3s is ""education"".[1] Is Harvard University really a 'charity?'<p>Notice that the largest purpose grouping (by revenue) is health care. I know that Advocate Healthcare -- one of the largest hospital chains in Chicago -- is a 501c3 which has been attacked by health reform advocates for being very stingy with charity care and engaging in aggressive billing practices.<p>The ""healthcare"" segment is over 52% of the 501c3 sector by revenue. Some of that may be charity clinics, but I imagine the vast majority of it is institutions like Advocate. If you combine the healtchare and education segments, they account for over 71% of the entire sector.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nccsdataweb.urban.org/PubApps/nonprofit-overview-sumRpt.php?v=nteeFilers&t=pc&f=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nccsdataweb.urban.org/PubApps/nonprofit-overview-sumR...</a>",1262502717.0
