12,4379869,comment,4379170.0,4379368.0,10,0,kevinpet,,,"I thought I agreed with you, because I read this post thinking it was a reply to the recent article about app.net's fee-based service not being inherently superior to twitter's ad-based service. When I read the post it was actually a response to, it does make sense, but it isn't clearly stated.<p>If I may attempt to restate, the argument is as follows: Ilya wrote an article criticizing those who are reluctant to ask users to plunk down cold hard cash for an actual solution to their problem. This is a legitimate point. However, app.net is a poor example of someone attempting to actually get paying customers because the app.net customers are doing something more similar to donating to a cause they believe in than actually buying a product. The value of this product -- the good feeling of supporting something new and exciting -- will inherently disappear as soon as the product is no longer new and exciting. Additionally, because the product does not yet exist in anything resembling a final form, the customers are able to project their own hopes and dreams for what they would like it to be, rather than what it actually is.<p>This argument is a lot more than saying nothing. I definitely agree with it. If a reluctance to ask for money in fear of getting shot down because your product isn't any good is the problem, then asking for money to support some product that exists more as dreams than code isn't the solution. The solution is to build something that real people will buy, not because they are your friends, not because they want to be able to say they were an early adopter of something that will become big, but because the product actually provides value to them as it exists today.",1344930777.0

At 10 I went to school by bus, alone, with 2 or 3 changes along the way (and a ~10 minutes walk between home and the bus station), total travel time was maybe 45~60mn and same thing the other way around in the evening.

Taking the plane is probably less common around here but considering the plane culture of the US I don't see any issue with it.<p>> I understand United offers a service to make this possible but it seems like a ridiculous thing for a parent to take advantage of.<p>1. No it's not, the whole point of the service is to use it.<p>2. I'm pretty sure United created the service because parents were <i>already</i> sending children across the country by plane alone, that's not a rare occurrence.

That's pretty cool by itself, but it also speaks to the attitude that if a change in Perl 5 core breaks a test, by default this is a bug in Perl 5 core that must be fixed.<p>It's interesting that by taking this seemingly limiting attitude (""don't break working code""), you gain the ability to treat all the tests for code written in your language as tests for your language.<p>Do any other languages have something like this?",1344930343.0

They are absolutely the least culpable people involved with airline incompetence.<p>At least for Delta, flight attendants' primary compensation is based on <i>scheduled</i> flight time. Not actual flight time. Not tarmac time. Not delay time. <i>Scheduled</i> flight time. And even then, only with passengers!<p>So when you're stuck at the gate, waiting for some nincompoop to fetch the jet bridge, and you start giving the flight attendants hell, you need to understand that <i>waiting there sucks for them too</i>. They have only a few short hours to get a half night's sleep and enjoy the destination; the only perk that justifies their lifestyle. The rest of their job boils down to glorified waitress and underpaid babysitter.<p>If you think you've got a travel horror story, you ain't got nothing on a flight attendant. One night, my girlfriend's phone woke us up at 3 AM. She was on call and was needed immediately for a flight from Anchorage (we're in Seattle). It's about 40 minutes to the airport and this was a ""short call"", meaning she needed to be there in less than 2 hours! She and 5 of her co-workers, had to jump out of bed and haul ass to the airport where they boarded an empty flight to Anchorage. They were there to relieve a crew that didn't receive the legal minimum rest time due to a weather delay. While they were in the air, scheduling decided ""fuck the FAA regulations"" and put the overworked crew back on a plane anyway. So my girlfriend's crew arrives, finds that the flight they were supposed to work has already departed, and the pilot who brought them required a legal rest period. So they were required to spend the night in Alaska and take another empty flight home. It was the dead of winter, so it was far too cold to go anywhere outside the hotel. All in all, the crew received one days worth of per diem and no compensation for either flight, as they were ""dead heading"", which is unpaid. That per diem is fixed for ""domestic"" travel, so it's relative value varies by destination. It generally doesn't even cover the cost of meals in Alaska.<p>Fuck airlines.",1344930240.0

United needs to fail so someone better can take over. The moral hazards are ruining the country.<p>I saw it recently with farmers struggling from the drought. Compare this farmer: <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7417774n"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7417774n</a> who has acres full of hay that don't do well in the drought to this farmer who planted a solid base of drought tolerant sorghum <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7417664n"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7417664n</a> in addition to his corn. The second farmer is diversified. He's making smarter decisions with his farm, but because he wasn't hit as hard as other farmers who aren't making good decisions with their land, he's not going to get as much compensation for failed crops. That first farmer needs to go to work for the second farmer so he can learn better and more profitable methods of farming and we will all benefit -- including him. Watch the two farmers. Look how worn out the first one is compared to the second one. The first farmer is working <i>harder</i> the second farmer is working <i>smarter</i>. We need to reward that.<p>The same thing with United. United Airlines was the largest recipient of cash grants from the US after 9/11, getting $774.2 Million [1]. If the US hadn't kept United alive over the past 10 years so an Airline that cares could fill the void, this little child may not have been left stranded at the airport by a company full of employees who don't need to care.<p><a href=""http://www.laane.org/downloads/ShortchangedStudy.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.laane.org/downloads/ShortchangedStudy.pdf</a>",1344929355.0

Our school offers both the Core-Plus Mathematics Project (<a href=""http://wmich.edu/cpmp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wmich.edu/cpmp/</a>) and some variation of what I'd consider traditional (Geometry 1, 2, Algebra 1, 2, etc.).<p>The students more often than not will prefer the Core-Plus Mathematics Project over the traditional courses early on in their education - but once the math switches over to a primarily calculating class (take, for instance, Calculus), the opinions shift and favor the other one.<p>What we honestly have in my district is a case of a system that's trying to split itself down the middle politically - as we're attempting to switch to a modern, context driven approach to mathematics, whilst maintaining the link to processes like Advanced Placement, which only judge on the traditional aspects (<a href=""http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_calab.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_calab.htm...</a>).<p>While it might be a better route for the future, the present is demanding math to be calculation based for the near future.

I really have no choice but to be an advocate for getting your kid screened. It's a simple blood draw, find out their 677 and 1298 status.

Those companies make it impossible to contact a human being in the first place.<p>This article very specifically touches upon how the United employees were asked directly by a scared child for help, and yet did nothing.  There are a lot of other associated failures, but this is the central idea: that the individuals working for the company felt not even a little responsibility to help their customers.<p>Google, the company, ignores you as a matter of policy.  That might be a dubious practice, but it is categorically different.",1344927692.0

Building something that people pay money for is hard. Failing to do that and asking people to buy the dream while at the same time doing heavy marketing criticizing the concept seems ironic, to say the least.",1344927658.0

As you noted United charge for an unaccompanied minor service[0], the parents believed everything was squared and United completely dropped the ball. Had the service <i>not</i> existed they could have opted to not send the child to camp, try to get what to do drilled into her and sent her on her own or found somebody to accompany. <i>Then</i> they <i>could</i> have been at fault if things had gone wrong.<p>But here? I fail to see how <i>any</i> fault can be put on the parents. We can debate between the fault being 100% United or 80% United and 20% bad luck, but the parents? Not in the presentation of the article.<p>[0] And the complaint letter adds details:<p>> The United personnel who gave her the wristband and instructions told her very loud and clear to only go with someone with a United badge on and that she would be accompanied at all times.",1344927608.0
