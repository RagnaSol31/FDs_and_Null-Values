The financing is a little more problematic because you could argue a lot of things should be illegal like Louis Vuitton handbags for example. Have you seen the prices? It is unreal you could get 5 bespoke handbags from a master leathercrafter made from virgin snake leather or something. People who want to pay 3000 USD for a laptop are probably gullible enough to pay lots of money for other overpriced things as well. A reasonable requirement would be to always have to post total amount owed though to help people unable to do math. If they still agree there is not really much you can do.,1348646247.0

Why can't they send that signal? It's convenient for the consumer to say $10 because they are comfortable with that. This amount is what labels can squeeze from consumers (because piracy has left them no options), but that doesn't mean it's the final and perfect solution.<p>If music subscription services end up not being much better than piracy, then all it does is grant a false sense of entitlement to these people who might as well still be pirating.",1348645388.0

Well, judging from the comments, it seems that many perceive bootstrapping only applies to the early stages of the company. But I find that hard to stomach as someone who is also bootstrapping a company. When you bootstrap, you use your own revenues to finance growth. Getting investors is an alternative to that strategy. I don't see how you can both bootstrap AND have investors.<p>Looking at it differently, maybe they didn't need the capital, but they took it. You don't just accidentally get $5M from Union Square... term sheets happen. Lawyers are involved. Cap tables are adjusted. That doesn't happen when you bootstrap. It happens when you use other people's money to finance growth.

If a user accesses my website over unsecured HTTP, gets sent to an HTTPS DailyCred (or other OAuth provider) site to log in, and back to my unsecured HTTP site, they're still as vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks as if the OAuth provider didn't use HTTPS.<p>In particular, a man-in-the-middle can capture the redirect to DailyCred and instead send the user to some trojaned site to capture their username and password (and then forward it on to you to get a legitimate token, but the password's been leaked in the process).<p>I don't think it's helpful to say ""we do HTTPS so you don't have to"". Your users still need to be using HTTPS and preferably HSTS, unless I'm misunderstanding the intended use case. (I'm very happy to see that you guys do HSTS, though!)",1348642958.0

I'll note that your example doesn't declare any return code anywhere. Now, I'm curious to know how you would do the equivalent of this with error codes:<p><pre><code>  public class MigrationException extends Exception {\n    public MigrationException(String msg) { super(msg); }\n  }\n  \n  public class SqlException extends Exception (\n    public SqlException(String msg) { super (msg); }\n  }\n\n  public class Migration {\n    public void migrate(Statement stat, int migrationNumber)\n      throws MigrationException, SqlException{\n      if (migrationNumber <= 5) throw new MigrationException(""Wrong migration number "" + migrationNumber, should be > 5"");\n      // throws SqlException\n      stat.executeNonQuery(""INSERT foo INTO bar"");\n    }\n  }\n\n  public class MigrationRunner {\n    public void run(Statement stat, Migration migration, int migrationNumber) {\n      try {\n        migration.migrate(stat, migrationNumber);\n      }\n      catch(MigrationException ex) {\n        migrationLogger.error(""Bad migration"", ex);\n      }\n      catch(SqlException ex) {\n        migrationLogger.error(""DB error"", ex);\n        sqlLogger.error(""Error during migration"", ex);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nI'm on purpose not reimplementing an SQL driver here :)<p>I'm not quite sure why you are arguing about ""error declarations which can be checked at compile time in C++"". Sure, C++ has exceptions, but I thought you were trying to make a point about return codes, not C++ exceptions vs language X exception. My point, on the other hand, is that it's very easy to do this:<p><pre><code>  ",

I get that it's a new site, so I can accept that it might be tough to get recommendations right away, but it would be really helpful to explain <i>why</i> there aren't any results. Is it because I haven't rated enough beers? Is it because there aren't enough other users that have similar tastes? Is it because there's a delay before results show up?<p>Also, I had to try searching for some beers multiple times because my search didn't quite match how it's entered in your database. For example, I didn't realize that ""redhook"" is one word instead of two. I know that search is tricky and it's perfectly understandable, but I just thought I'd let you know.<p>Other than that, it looks great.
