12,2130146,comment,2130068.0,2130068.0,0,0,jsz0,,,I don't see Android tablets taking off as quickly as Android SmartPhones did. There are more credible competitors on the horizon. Most of the companies that totally missed the boat on competing with the iPhone are in a much better position today. HP/Palm & RIM of course but also Microsoft who I think has an opportunity to make inroads in the tablet-as-productivity-tool market someday. Any of these companies could stand to capitalize on Google's cat-herding problem or Apple's authoritarian pitfalls. Android/iOS will probably still be the big targets but I don't see the others being such <i>distant</i> competitors this time around.,1295682335.0

If you fund as many companies as we do it's unavoidable you'll end up with some overlap. Even if you tried not to accept competing companies, you'd still get overlap because startups' ideas morph so much. The way we deal with it is that when two startups are working on related stuff, we don't talk to one about what the other's doing.<p>In practice it has not turned out to be a problem, because most big markets have room for several slightly different solutions, and it's unlikely that two startups would do precisely the same thing.",1295681538.0

In many cases, wealth is a function of trust combined with ability. You don't (usually) get wealthy by hiding in your basement and never talking to anyone. So along the way, you meet good people and build relationships.<p>Conversely, the less wealthy a parent is, the less likely they are to form relationships with people who can benefit their children. At the extreme end: if your mom is a fry cook at McDonald's, what benefits are her colleagues able to offer you? How many of those connections can benefit your future?<p>On the other end, if your mom is Marissa Mayer, you're in much better shape. 14 and want a summer job? I bet she knows someone who could give you some interesting, mind-expanding paid work. 19 and looking for a college gig that can help you get a great job after your graduate? etc.<p>It's anecdotal, but growing up in a household that wasn't at all wealthy, I can point to this as the greatest disadvantage I faced. I wanted to learn programming, but we didn't know anyone who knew anything about that. I wanted to know anything at all about computers, and I was on my own. Not an insurmountable problem – I taught myself. But I know access to mentorship at an early age could have made a huge impact.",1295681130.0

They stop resellers like Psystar, and they've broken a few things which appeared to be ancillary to moving their own products forward (Atom CPUs), but they could be far more annoying about it every point release if they really felt like it. Early on, they also needlessly released a few fat binary hardware drivers for ethernet, sound, and wifi devices that have never been bundled in a real Intel Mac.<p>Apple certainly has the means to stop it, but I don't think they mind the fringe hackers running OSX.
