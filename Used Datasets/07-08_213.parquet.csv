Then they have a nightmare and when they wake up they are babbling.<p>The additional anti-pattern-badness with sync-in-the-app is that that kind of sync is usually incompatible with another app's bespoke sync.  But when sync is in the infrastructure then a much larger group of people who use that infrastructure can share data <i>across</i> apps if they want to without having necessarily to share a schema.  \nThis is the real power of making sync part of the underlying computing fabric.<p>Finally when this infrastructure is open source the real -danger of lock-in such as when you use Dropbox is mitigated, should you want to have that freedom.<p>Cheers.",1365492962.0

Pushing people towards using more formal methods to generate and accept protocols is always good.<p>That said, I thought the argument against length fields was somewhat.. weak.  But maybe I'm misunderstanding the context.  The question at the end was not answered satisfactorily. A protocol with a length field is most certainly deterministic, and if you go the other way and use a delimiter, escaping/encoding is the only way you're going to work with arbitrary user data.  I would argue the length field is miles better.  If someone injects bytes into your stream that match the protocol, your recognizer isn't going to save you, just the same way someone rewriting the length field is going to blow up.<p>What this talk seems to argue for is making the language simpler (e.g. context-free), so you can validate that the semantics are working as intended, but transferring arbitrary blobs of data is always going to be an issue as long as people enter random musings in text boxes that are rendered by Turing complete software. :-)",1365491291.0

For authentication / authorization and various other forms of permission / logging, you have the MQ communicate with the web framework via http callbacks (Webhooks) and a standard REST API. So the architecture is:<p>User <--Websocket--> MQ :: publish/subscribe<p>MQ --Webhooks--> PHP/Django/Servlets/etc. :: user signed on, user joined a channel, etc.<p>PHP --REST--> MQ  :: publish(msg), remove(user, channel), etc.<p>The key is to include cookie information in the callbacks from MQ -> PHP so the callback happens in the context of the user session. Suddenly you can do things like write a chat app in 30 lines of php + js, or a persistent time series in 20, and it really feels magical.<p>I actually started Hookbox almost as a statement of irony, because I was really frustrated about the major pushback I was getting to sockets in web browsers at the time. I'd just finished writing/submitting the initial proposal for Websocket, and I wrote this tongue-incheeck piece about the mismatch between typical web development and network server programming: <a href=""http://svwebbuilder.wordpress.com/2008/10/20/html5-websocket-and-webjneering/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svwebbuilder.wordpress.com/2008/10/20/html5-websocket...</a><p>So Hookbox started as a 2-3 day project that took on a life of its own for a while and ended up being really useful. This project was one of my smaller open source codebases and to this day I receive tons of interest and requests for maintenance, though I've abandoned it for years due to time.<p>I'm sure there's a huge market for this sort of thing.

Don't decide before you dive in, use that surface knowledge to know what your options are and where to start but don't make decisions with it (can be tricky).<p>And as others are saying, know your fundamentals, and know your theory. Get experience doing something real start to finish as often as possible and in order to do that you will have to dive into things. That's how to decide what to learn next.",1365490952.0

So what you said can be rephrased as, ""The US system works to enable wealth creation"", or in other words, ""The US system is optimized for providing the best standard of living for its citizens.""  Which is exactly the case.",1365490830.0

In L.A. every and his brother ""had a screenplay.""  ""Oh man, can you read my screen play?  We're looking to raise a million for this indie film.""  In Silicon Valley say you're a VC and my lord the way people change, from talking to you casually to looking at you like an addict and you're a bag of heroine they desperately need.<p>Startups CAN actually survive and meet early milestones without us VCs you know.  In Canada I'll bet it would be refreshing to ""have"" to meet those early milestones without being made to feel like a failure just because you're not already ""funded."" ""Are you funded?  Yeah, by who?"" ""You're not funded?  Oh bummer."" (Person walks away.)<p>So eventually a Canadian entrepreneur may need/want to move to Silicon Valley, but I'll bet they learn alot - and find it alot more refreshing - to start out at first without the non stop ""you got a screenplay? you got an agent?"" equivalent I see and hear every day and every hour in Silicon Valley.<p>We VCs aren't the be all end all.<p>Happy to take any questions from entrepreneurs.",1365490806.0
