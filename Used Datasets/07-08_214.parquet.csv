You said this with great confidence and amplified upon it based on ""your research"". But it's an extraordinary claim - basically you're saying everybody who disagrees with you has been fooled by a big conspiracy - it's a conspiracy theory. It's a ""denial"" of the more obvious possibility that <i>some people just happen to disagree with you</i>.<p>Like you, I'm kind of tired of debating CAGW and so I had no intention of trying to convince you CAGW is actually wrong. I only hope to disabuse you of your view that <i>all</i> skeptics are in thrall to The Cabal. To do that, I only need to find a counterexample or two.<p>CAGW is in practice an extremely complex chain of assertions; there are a great many particulars in which somebody might reasonably have a specific differing view from ""the consensus"" or be skeptical that the case for ""the consensus"" is sufficiently well-established to act upon.<p>So: Landsea. Landsea was <i>skeptical</i> of the IPCC's views on hurricanes - with good reason, since he was the relevant expert helping to write that chapter.<p>McIntyre was <i>skeptical</i> of the IPCC's views on Paleo reconstruction, again clearly with good reason and with no prior connection to the Kochtopus - statistics was a hobby interest of his and he just got curious.<p>I have a friend named Peter Ward who is an expert on volcanoes who does think AGW is a big important problem but is skeptical about CO2 as the primary driver - he thinks sulfur dioxide is more important than is commonly recognized (and has recently published a journal paper on the subject, albeit in a minor journal.)<p>So that's three people who are ""skeptical"" about some aspect of AGW not because they got talking points from whats-her-name but because what is commonly claimed contradicts their own expert assessment of the relevant literature.<p>Given the fact that there do exist people like that, your claim was false. That was all I was trying to say. I wasn't trying to prove that all skeptics are right or that <i>none</i> have been ""duped"" or, contrariwise, that all AGWers are mistaken. Just that <i>some number of skeptics come by their views as a result of an honest assessment of the literature in areas of their own expertise</i>. Or by evaluating the claims of others who have done that.<p>I absolutely agree with you that a few bad apples in the IPCC process don't <i>necessarily</i> spoil the whole bunch. The opposite of stupidity is not wisdom, sometimes it's just more stupidity. The AGW hypothesis is certainly worth <i>somebody</i> investigating. I just think claims of ""consensus"" and a need to ""act right away, we don't have time to be certain"" are a warning sign that one should probably wait and think some more about it. (This attitude has served me especially well when buying used cars. :-) )<p>BTW, here's the caltech lecture <i>Aliens Cause Global Warming</i>: \n<a href=""http://s8int.com/crichton.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s8int.com/crichton.html</a>",1312185262.0

They would be in a much better position to decide how the US will balance its budget had Obama simply declared the debt ceiling unconstitutional, as Bill Clinton advised him to.  Now, they've ceded legitimacy to the Tea Partiers and will have to acknowledge them (and their demands) in future negotiations.  To the Democratic senators and congressmen who have been around long enough to know what a bad idea that is, this deal comes off as a betrayal, one made worse by the president's flat refusal to consider the constitutional option.  Even if Obama wanted the Senate to capitulate on the Bush tax cuts, he could well face a revolt.  The Senate will hold absolute power on that one; they need simply do nothing to see them expire.<p>It was pretty clear that the Tea Party wing of the GOP was willing to see the US default if it meant no increase in revenue and steep cuts to entitlements; I wouldn't be surprised to see Reid et al stick to a ""keep the tax breaks for middle income Americans and close loopholes and subsidies for corporations"" line, then blame the Republicans for the raise in taxes on the middle class when they don't accept his proposal.  After that, it's simply a matter of what a tax break will look like.  Democrats have quite clearly stated their willingness to cut taxes for ""working Americans"" (ugh), so the Republicans would have to argue why they think corporate subsidies and tax breaks for the rich should be enacted when they will further worsen the deficit.
