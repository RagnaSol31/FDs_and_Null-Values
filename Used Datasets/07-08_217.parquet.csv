A lot depends on the types of companies and positions she is applying for.<p>It is easier to get a job with the skills and experience you already have and then try to migrate to newer skills.  So maybe going for Java & Python jobs without relevant experience is an issue.<p>Whilst education is important experience is far more pertinent in hiring.  As is the personality factors revealed during interviews or even in the covering letters.  100+ applications suggests that there are issues.  The trick is to find out where they might be.
