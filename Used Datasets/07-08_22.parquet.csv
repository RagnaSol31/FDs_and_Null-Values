You see, the thread is asking why HNers have no sense of humor, and... ah, screw it, it loses it if you have to explain it.<p>The erlang articles were mostly very interesting, and seeing a HN meme flare up and go away just as quickly, especially one that is self-deprecating in poking fun at the stereotype of the HN reader doing everything pg says, was very fun.  I'm sorry you didn't enjoy it.<p>The only kind of noise that I really hate on HN is the ""hacker news sucks"" crap.  If you think it's too noisy, get better filters, or help out by flagging the articles that violate the TOS, up-voting the articles that are good, and ignoring the rest.<p>Complaining about HN in an HN comment is frankly just humorless.",1240473457

Do you believe that animals have a lesser capacity for feeling than children? Their is intellectual capacity is at a similar level. Doesn't it make sense that they have the same capacity to feel pain as a child? Where do you draw the line at being OK with causing extreme pain to other beings?<p>We where surprised to find that we shared so much DNA with other animals and it seems likely that we will find that the neural processes have a lot in common as well. My guess is that we will find that animal consciousness is much like our own with an obviously reduced inferential capacity.<p>The comparison with slavery is valid in the sense something that was once considered normal (or more likely 'unpleasant but convenient/necessary') can become abhorrent. There were probably a lot of people who knew deep down that it wasn't right but it was so convenient. In the history books those that promoted slavery don't tend to come off so well. The difference now is that the pace of change is faster and our lifespan may also grow considerably.<p>As for the term 'torturepreneur', I thought was an apt response to the title.",1240472846

17,575255,comment,575238.0,575238.0,0,0,tptacek,,,"""Session fixation"" is an old web vulnerability. This is a very slight twist on it.<p>Session fixation vulnerabilities happen when web applications (most often J2EE applications) honor session IDs presented prior to login. After login completes successfully, the app mistakenly recycles the session ID, instead of generating a new one and discarding the old one.<p>Attackers exploit the vulnerability by creating landmine pages that coerce users into logging in to sites with predictable session IDs (like ""000000""). Once the trap is set, the attacker simply probes the vulnerable application waiting for session ""000000"" to become valid.<p>The attack here simply substitutes ""OAuth Request Token"" for ""Session ID"". It's otherwise almost identical.<p>You have a Twitter account, and use Tipjoy. You trust both Tipjoy and Twitter. You want Tipjoy to send a message as you over Twitter. But Twitter doesn't fully trust Tipjoy.<p>OAuth solves that by creating a weak relationship between Twitter and Tipjoy. When you ask Tipjoy to act on your behalf, Tipjoy can ask Twitter for a ""Request Token"", which is the moral equivalent of a session ID. Tipjoy passes the token to you, and asks you to take it to Twitter. You present the token to Twitter and authenticate. The Request Token is now hot; Twitter will honor it (specifically, Twitter will allow Tipjoy to ""upgrade"" it to an Action Token, which is like a logged-in session ID).<p>The fixation attack is simple; Alice is the good guy, Mallory is the bad guy. Mallory gets a Tipjoy account. Mallory gets Tipjoy to give her a Twitter request token. She then creates a landmine page that gets Alice to present the token to Twitter. Eventually Alice (or someone like her) does. Mallory now owns a hot token.",1240471943

In such a circumstance, the presence of additional people is largely irrelevant.<p>A sequence of arguments going back and forth between two people, on the other hand, are essentially the back and forth of a duet playing separate themes (that, ideally, mix at the end).  While certain sorts of arguments are non- or counter-productive (analogous to internally discordant themes), the possibility of such things occurring does not imply that this mode is not superior to single-view discourse.<p>The fact that discussions center on points of disagreement is not an accident, and does not imply that there is not agreement regarding most things.  Disagreements are simply the portion of a topic around which someone believes that there is more information that an outside observer should consider when formulating their beliefs, whereas when there is agreement no further information is necessary, so there is no value in transmitting more signal.",1240470808

You can save a lot on high quality food.<p>Don't let the name scare you off, salvage just means that other shipments are better suited to retail. The reasons the retail grocery store sent back the shipment range from cans being dented to one  jar being in the same box as a broken jar and getting water damage on the label. Or the food could be nearing its expiration date.<p>Since the food is being returned to the warehouse, some bad food occasionally slips through. But most stores are very good about checking for expired or bad food, and nearly all problems with food quality are very obvious as long as you check the date.<p>Food quality can be very good. If it is being run as a health food store, you'll basically be getting some of the food from places like Trader Joe's and Wild Oats for bargain prices. The stores are also good if you want to buy bulk ingredients. Variety is usually good, but selection isn't. Since the stores are at the mercy of other stores for their produce, you can't expect to find a specific brand in a store at a specific time. And you also can't really expect to find a product in the store just because you had previously bought it.<p>Salvage stores might not be for everyone, but they can save you a lot of money on high quality food. Some food may be selling at or below wholesale. So it is at least worth checking out.<p>Here's a list of stores by state.
