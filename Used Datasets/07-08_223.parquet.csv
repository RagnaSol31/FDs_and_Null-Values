Russia was ranked third, with 12 per cent saying it posed a significant risk.",1375773737.0

See for example this meta-study from 2008 about what happens when health workers go on strike [1]:<p>&quot;[..] mortality either stayed the same or decreased during, and in some cases, after the strike. [No study] found that mortality increased during the weeks of the strikes compared to other time periods.&quot;<p>The authors speculate about the reasons:\n&quot;The paradoxical finding that physician strikes are associated with reduced mortality may be explained by several factors. Most importantly, elective surgeries are curtailed during strikes. Further, hospitals often re-assign scarce staff and emergency care was available during all of the strikes.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18849101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18849101</a><p>EDIT: clarity",1375772562.0
