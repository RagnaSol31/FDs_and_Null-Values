Go back to the 18th century, and most states were much more fluid, driven by changes through inheritance, wars, and indeed the fact that a substantial number of todays large, influential nation states simply did not exist yet, or where the states existed in a substantially different form.<p>Nationalism itself did not come to prominence until the latter half of the 18th century (the term itself was not even coined until this time), and a lot of the modern nation states that people came to identify with were artificial constructions created largely as a <i>result</i> of the gradual evolution of local governance and culture coupled with the outgrowth of popular political involvement and the growing prominence of national media where culture started becoming more uniform across what we recognise as modern states often because of limitations of language.<p>Nationalism is not a requisite for local governance or local culture to survive at all - both pre-dated nationalism for millennia.",1370761818.0
