The very best IDEs in the hands of a skilled programmer should produce code better than a similarly skilled programmer who insists on using a dumb text editor. If the resulting code can only effectively be modified by a similar computer/human team - well that's a small price to pay.</i><p>That's true, but show me an IDE that lets someone write better code than someone without the IDE.  The reality is that IDEs provide very superficial features that help beginners be more productive, but don't help experienced programmers much.  (The most cited feature, symbol completion with docstrings, is available in pretty much every text editor.  It's nice confirmation that your mental model matches the tags table, but hardly essential.)<p>All I can say is: Java got a lot easier for me when I stopped trying to make Eclipse useful.
