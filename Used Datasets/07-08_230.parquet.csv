It's a post-rationalization and a poor one.  If that were the reason, books wouldn't be allowed out.<p>Speaking of post-rationalizations, one I heard from a flight attendant recently is: ""it's not that they aren't safe, just just need your full attention during takeoff and landing.""",1355385575.0

4,4914813,comment,4912964.0,4912964.0,34,0,RogerAlsing,,,"Roger Alsing the author of that old gimmic here :-)<p>Some clarifications from my part here, 4 years after the post was released:<p>1) No this does not qualify as a true GA/GP.\nby definition GP need to have an computational AST, EvoLisa has an declarative AST.\nThere is also no cross over in play here.\n(see 3* for explatation on this)<p>2) Hill climbing or not?\nAccording to wikipedia, Hill climbing only changes _one_ value of the problem solving vector per generation.\n""""At each iteration, hill climbing will adjust a single element in X and determine whether the change improves the value of f(X)""""<p>So it doesn't quite fit the hill climbing definition either, also the DNA/vector is of dynamic size in EvoLisa while Hill climbing AFAIK uses fixed size vectors (?)<p>3) Why wasn't a larger population used and why no cross over?<p>This is the part that most of you get wrong, increasing the population size and adding cross over will NOT benefit this specific problem.<p>The polygons are semi transparend and overlap, thus, adding/removing polygons will have a high impact on the fitness level, in pretty much every case in the wrong direction.<p>Let's use words as an example here:<p>organism1: ""The Mona Lisa""\norganism2: ""La Gioconda""<p>Both may have similar fitness level, but completely different sets of polygons (letters in this naive example)<p>combining those will very very rarely yeild an improvement.<p>e.g. child(result of org1 and org2) ""Lae Mocondisa"" that is complete nonsense and the fitness level falls back to pretty much random levels.<p>Thus, you can just as well use pure mutation instead of cross over here.<p>If the problem instead had been based on genes that paint individual parts, e.g. a gene for the face, a gene for the background, a gene for the body etc.<p>THEN it would have made sense to use crossover.\nIn such case it would be possible to combine a good face gene with a good background gene and the fitness level would improve.<p>However, due to the nature of this specific problem where the polygons span the entire image, this is not effective.<p>And if crossover is not benefitial, then a larger population gets less interesting also since you cannot combine them.<p>Increasing the population will only make more separate individuals compete against eachother with no additative effect in any way.<p>see it like this.<p>If we have one sprinter running 100meters, if he might complete the run in about 10 sec.<p>If we add 1000 sprinters to the population, each of them might complete the run in about 10 sec each.<p>Thus, the problem is not solved any faster by adding more individuals here.\nAlso, by increasing the population size, there will be much more data to evaluate for each generation, so even if we can bring down the number of generations needed to solve the problem, the actual real world time to complete it would increase due to evaluation logic.<p>Anyway, nice to see that people still find this somewhat interesting.\nIt was pretty much a single evening hack back 4 years ago..<p>//Roger",1355385321.0

These advantages are apparent in the Google maps website itself.\nOnce found though Apple Maps is smoother, more responsive and, in general pleasing to look at (although the last part is subjective and personal preference and many people will find the Google Maps better maybe).<p>Map data deficiences in Apple maps are well documented at this point and map data is the single most important thing about a map. Google Maps is superior ( and i'm guessing outside of the bay area/the US, orders of magnitude better ).<p>I did miss out on another big advantage of Google Maps - Street view (which i guess is part of the data but it is still unique to Google Maps)<p>The original comment waxed lyrical about how it ""annahilates"" Apple Maps in ""every which way"" which didn't gel with my experience. it's better in the parts it is expected to be.

It helps - if a logic suddenly breaks by increasing the 'intensity' of the subject, then there's something wrong in it.<p>I would suggest avoiding doing so publicly. People can come to the same conclusions if they want to apply theory of extremes, but when you jump to that kind of thing in your initial comparison (especially without a disclaimer) it just makes you come off as a crazy person. Doubly so since the extreme didn't hold up.<p>It didn't help that some of the more rational points are easily countered (even if not wrong). Stating that my use of Apple harms you because of my ""support"" of their business and legal decisions may not be entirely false; however, it's a) unreasonable to expect consumers to know about the operational choices of every company they do business with and b) also helpful because it promotes competition in the market. Again, your points had merit, but so does the other side of the equation.<p>The unfortunate reality of being a publicly-traded US company is that you are more or less legally required to try to litigate your competition out of existence if the numbers support it. This instance is unfortunate because Apple was granted some patents that they should not have been, and there was inept jury in deciding to uphold them (never mind the fact that it was a jury-based trial at all). The Apple/Samsung thing should have been a trademark case which I think actually had <i>some</i> merit, but patent litigation has a higher potential upside so the finances said that was the way to go.",1355383647.0

It's not an XBOX with integrated media centre and ability to stream high-definition video. I don't think I've ever played a multiplayer game on my Wii, ever and I don't know of any of my friends using multiplayer either. It's a family console, not a console for gamers who like playing online RPG's and shooters against other people.",1355382298.0

Google+ has a lot of going for it when it comes to photography.<p>Skipping over the UI, which is really, really good for photography consumption (have you seen the iPad app? it's beautiful), Google+ has one freakishly big advantage when comparing it with Facebook or Flickr that goes unmentioned:<p>Google Drive - because IMHO, online backup and carrying your huge collection wherever you go, on whatever device, are far more valuable for photographers than sharing.",1355382286.0

Put another way, the x-axis will roughly be the inverse of development at the beginning of the period. This is because nations that were highly developed at the start of the period wouldn't have reasonably been able to add an additional 8 years of schooling on average. Nations adding 8 years will overwhelmingly have been starting from low bases.<p>So the chart essentially says that adding education is more valuable in developed economies. Which is good to demonstrate empirically, but is hardly shocking.<p>The other major flaw in this study is that the timeframe is short. Again, consider the x-axis. Adding 8 years of schooling on average to even the least developed nation takes the first cohort out to ~15 years of age. By the time that first cohort hits age 47, the study period is over. This is measuring improvement without capturing the a full decade or more of the first cohort (and even less for subsequent cohorts). And obviously the first highly educated cohort wouldn't have had time to mentor a productive generation yet (or completely infiltrate the political infrastructure, etc.). Perhaps there's more useful data in the linked papers, but the data in TFA is unconvincing.<p>Finally, on the larger point of the correlation between education and productivity/wealth creation, there are ample empirical correlations. Obviously these do not imply causation, but the onus is certainly to show why this is not the case given that the correlation of education and wealth exists in roughly 100% of developed economies. If a country could become developed without spending on education, why has nobody done it?",1355382259.0
