We confidently believe a great deal of things that are untrue, and getting it confirmed with science is valuable. In hindsight, it's usually easy to be unsurprised by a scientific result.<p>He's not talking about science per se, but the insane level of rules and regulations you've got to put up with as a business owner -- especially in California. In other words, my interpretation of the GP's remark is that you can get at least an order of magnitude measurement of the pain-in-the-ass/cost factor, which is likely several orders of magnitude higher than what you think it is if you haven't owned a business that has enough revenue to put you on the radar.<p>The bias on HN is probably more towards software (where we can all 1099 each other) and not so much towards manufacturing (which is a major compliance pain). When you're dealing with manufacturing, things are different. You're dealing the EDD, FTB, INS and IRS (from an employee compliance standpoint), then you're also dealing with OSHA and the EPA and all their arcane rules and enforcers that hit you with $15k fines if you use dishsoap incorrectly. Then, on top of all of that you're paying a 35% tax rate.<p>Honestly, I'm surprised manufacturing has lasted as long as it has in the US.<p>> Given that a balance must be struck, it is possible that the optimal level of taxation would be higher than now. I do not know how to judge it - I have no basis for that. I would like to see the evidence that shows where that balance must lie.<p>Well, you could read the article :) We have a control group (the US) and the test groups (Germany, China) are far outperforming us.",1339401508.0

I did teach him to drive a car and to code in 'C'. He also lived with me rent-free for years. Kenneth is my brother. These are the sorts of things that I thought somebody was supposed to do for a brother.<p>The document includes a short biography of Kenneth that explains how things worked out. It will be expanded over time. There are some positive parts worth mentioning. Not many but I'd like the family history to present a complete picture.<p>2. I was told years ago that Kenneth was the man who had developed the Kindle. And he <i>was</i> interested in convergence as far back as the 1980s. Additionally, people I meet around Silicon Valley all seem to know him. Except me, of course.<p>But I was never able to confirm the Kindle story. He's been cautious about staying out of the limelight; not the way he used to be. Somebody who was curious and checked said there's little about his role on the Amazon Lab 126 webpages.<p>It appears that he did do the Kindle, though. The court papers seem to indicate this. Note: Since I've mentioned the court papers, I should add that I haven't been lawfully served. The whole thing is tiring and confusing. And more than a bit frightening. Gee, thanks, Kenny.<p>I haven't read that part of the court papers closely but I gather Kenneth is furious that I've sometimes referred to him as the Kindle Kid. I don't see what's wrong with calling Kenneth the Kindle Kid. I think I'm entitled. I'm the big brother who taught him to code in 'C'. I helped to teach him to walk and I remember the expression on his face when he took his first step.<p>There's other things I haven't mentioned. I think Kenneth may have forgotten about some of them.<p>I don't deserve to placed in a criminal database for saying Kindle Kid. That isn't the way Kenneth and Thomas (he's a VP at Humana) are playing it; but see the history of the case if you're curious.<p>3. Regarding the wheelchair remark I see in the post above, I should explain that I walk perfectly well most of the time. I'm just in the wheelchair occasionally.

Indeed, local talent has the advantage of being local. However, I would rather work with a remote developer that can get problems solved, than with a hypothetical good local developer that I don't have, or with a local developer that creates more problems than it solves.<p><pre><code>     There will always be a delay between a request and \n     the work actually starting\n</code></pre>\nYes, but in my view, that's a really good thing. As a side effect: (1) management is forced to cut the crap and make specifications as clear as possible + (2) it means that I have a lot of time in which I can concentrate on solving the hard problems, instead of lamenting about the color of a link or have meetings about the next meetings we'll have.<p>Even when working with local developers, it's always a good idea to NOT interrupt the workflow of developers, unless it is an emergency. If you have to fix the specs, or set out new directions, and you need to do that often, that means you suck at being a manager. That's why Scrum sprints take 1 or 2 weeks during which the developers manage their own schedule, and if something happens that changes the priorities / specs, then the sprint must be restarted (throwing away unfinished stuff, starting from scratch later) ... that's a little extreme from my point of view, but there are good reasons for why some people prefer this.<p>There are also good tools for managing remote developers, tools such as bug and feature trackers, tools such as Git or ReviewBoard, etc... Really big open-source projects, such as Linux, scaled like crazy with contributers from all over the world. So I really can't see your point.<p><pre><code>     If there's an emergency, well, you get the picture.\n</code></pre>\nPersonally I'm on call 24/7.",1339400270.0

The fact is that income taxes only tax against profits, though excise taxes can be a bigger deal (think gallonage taxes on liquor produced) because those increase your overall cost.<p>There are two problems with overregulation though.  The first is that it is a up-front cost that keeps on coming up day in and day out.  It's not like an income tax that hits your profits.  It's more like an excise tax on goods produced.  Overregulation is a drag on the economy.  It is a drag that makes it harder to break even.  It is a drag that makes it harder to do anything.  It's a bigger issue than income tax rates.<p>But it's even worse than excise tax rates.  Regulatory compliance is something that takes resources.  The more resources you have the easier it is.  Consequently over-regulation protects big players by raising huge barriers to entry.<p>And at least in a country like China, if the system is unworkable a whispers in ears and envelopes of cash probably go a long ways towards making the system workable.....  Over here we have a slightly different approach.  We pay a professional class of people large rates, and, as in places like China, they then represent our cause to various officials.

Time is pretty short for conventional means as I didn't learn about the first hearing until shortly before it was scheduled.<p>In fact, I haven't actually been lawfully served but the hearing will proceed regardless. In just a few days. To be honest, I'm worried about the whole thing.<p>Additionally, there are some unusual aspects to the case. Kenneth Kiraly is apparently the architect of the Kindle. Thomas is a VP of Humana. Some of the allegations are serious but bizarre at the same time. And the entire exercise started when I asked our parents to work on a book. The book was going to touch on abuse and that's certainly a issue of some importance. If enough people see this, it's possible somebody will be interested enough to consider pro bono.<p>BTW I use the Crowley spelling most of the time these days. I don't see myself as related to these people. They aren't my family. Anybody who reads the document might understand why.<p>The family history is interesting, though, and I'll expand it. One person I talked to in the 1990s was an Admiral who ran Security for the Manhattan Project. And James Kiraly's mother (my grandmother) Ann Kiraly was a remarkable woman. Rose to the top of the insurance industry back in the 1940s. James didn't like her much, though.<p>I'm new here and I hope a detailed response is all right. The document explains why I write this way.",1339398350.0

The US has seen that type of domestic manufacturing decline to almost nothing over the last 30 years. China by far and away dominates that.<p>High level manufacturing could certainly be threatened by robotics, but labor in the US is a much smaller portion of costs when you're talking about jet engines or medical devices than sewing a shirt (eg if you're paying $80k per year for labor, you're not going to be making $7 toasters in the US at that rate, you're going to be making million dollar jet engines; and you can't get labor costs below around $22,500 total in a manufacturing environment in the US).<p>The US lost the garment industry because its labor couldn't compete on wages. The average garment worker in China isn't making anywhere near $7.25 per hour, which is the US Federal minimum wage. Legally the US literally can't compete on wages.",1339398292.0
