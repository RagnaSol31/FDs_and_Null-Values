But what sets C++ apart from other mainstream languages like Java is that you can optimize for reading to a much greater extent than with other mainstream languages like Java or JavaScript. You can create entire DSLs all within the language. I'm not saying this is always a good idea, but if you want to radically pioritize readability, C++ is a better language than most.<p>Some of the boost libraries actually demonstrate this very well. If you look at the implementation of the library, you may be intimidated by its complexity (as you have shown with bind), but if you look at examples of its usage, you will often find it a lot cleaner than other languages.<p>Imagine what you would have to do in Java in order to do what bind does:<p><pre><code>  int diff(int a, int b) { return a - b; }\n  auto reverse_diff = bind(diff, _2, _1);\n  \n  assert(diff(5, 2) == 3);\n  assert(reverse_diff(5, 2) == -3);\n</code></pre>\n(Obviously, this particular example is trivial in any dynamic language, but that's a different debate)<p>I'm not saying C++ is the only or even the best language for creating statically typed DSLs.

I do a lot of (non-development) work via Prompt and when I need to consult documentation I just swipe over to a PDF or web page. Not being able to see the two side-by-side is almost a blessing simply because when I switch over I read the documentation carefully and only switch back when I'm ready to actually resume my work. This helps me out a lot because instead of skimming the documentation as I go I actually spend a few minutes reading it all and absorbing it. When I'm ready to switch back to my work I'm less scatterbrained about what I'm trying to accomplish. I'm way less prone to skimming the documentation just for the relevant parts. I'm starting to think uni-windowing is way underrated. When I work on my Mac I often do the same thing with full-screen apps now. I feel like it's made me more productive.<p>The one feature I really need added to iOS is a multi-item/history based clipboard system. This would make working between apps in a uni-window environment much easier.,1354433207.0
