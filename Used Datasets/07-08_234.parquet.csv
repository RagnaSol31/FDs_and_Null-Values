The effect is very visible also in Europe where tv is 25 fps and no 3:2 pull down is performed to 24fps material.<p>The soap opera look came from the video camera which operated similar way as video playback. Although the systems run 25 or 30fps they show each frame in two interlaced fields. This meant screen was updated 50 or 60 times per second, but showing either the odd or even lines of the frame at once.<p>Video was recorded in similar fashion so each field was captured with half a frame offset in time to give it effective frame rate of 50 or 60fps even though this meant actual frames would look funny on noninterlaced displays.<p>Film was transferred to video by taking both fields from one frame or with 3:2 pull down in 60hz countries. This made the effective frame rate closer to 24 fps like it was intended to be shown in cinemas.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlaced_video"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlaced_video</a><p>edit: added link",1448351432.0

I suppose they might still gain some value from having the aerial view as opposed to setting up multiple shots  from cameras/phones on the ground?  Then again if, as you say, the shots from a small commercial aerial drone are not clear because of stability issues etc., then it is pointless to use one.  Is drone camera stabilization getting better though, to the point where it would be very easy to capture a good, high quality image from a higher altitude even with a small drone in the near future and is that something regulators should take into consideration now?\nHow do you think the drone industry should be regulated and what weight class(es) do you think it these regulations should cover?",1448351000.0

Nobody would bat an eyelid if you stood across the street from a bank for 40mins with a iPhone pressed against your ear with the camera facing the bank, or if you left a phone in a windscreen mount in a parking lot facing a prison.

The texture of the painting surface and of the brushstroke is relevant in the creation of art.

Use open source as a way to show you have experience in software development. This is especially helpful with team based open source projects.<p>* If you are contributing to an open source project with a community be vocal in that space. Answer stack overflow questions, write blog posts, tweet, and get involved in other online areas where discussion takes place.<p>* Build a website for your open source project. HTML content is easier for most people to consume compared to a github repo with README.md.<p>* Speak at a conference or meetup. A great way to get started with this is to give a 5 minute lighting talk demo for the project at your local language meetup.<p>Doing these things will help you market yourself and your open source work. This usually opens the door to networking with people that have similar interests, which is a great way to further your career.",1448348918.0
