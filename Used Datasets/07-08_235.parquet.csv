It would divert resources from more-pressing functionality (new features, bugfixes, etc) and almost certainly introduce its own new bugs due to the complete re-write.<p>(See also this classic Joel Spolsky article, &quot;Things You Should Never Do, Part I&quot;: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a> )<p>This would be the case whether you schedule the re-write in a single blocking development effort (in which case, all forward progress would stop during that time) or broken into batches over time (in which case, it will be much longer until the new system is ready, and the old system will be a moving target as it continues to be developed).<p>Instead, the chances of a Nim-integration being beneficial to the company (and thus, your chances of getting approval from your engineering manager) are MUCH higher if you can simply write NEW functionality in Nim (or occasionally re-write small, self-contained inner loops in Nim) and the new Nim code integrates smoothly into the existing Python as a Python module.<p>This is the approach I&",

In fact the politics surrounding it drove me to seek relative sanity of doing a startup. When I started working on it, there really were two camps: clang emitting house IR instead of LLVM IR, or translating LLVM IR either early (right out of clang) or late (as a target after all optimization). I was working on the prototypes for the latter pair of options before another constraint was added that invalidated all of those paths.<p>The problem was that clang is quite intertwined with LLVM IR. ABI is spread all over the place, both FE and BE. It was proving hard to get something the house optimizers/code generators would be happy with. So a more radical path was chosen — wiring clang&",

People that start start-ups are in general smart enough to research the patent situation around their start-up idea and will look for greener pastures if they consider the patent situation too borked to try establishing a foot-hold or to navigate the patent minefield.<p>It&,
