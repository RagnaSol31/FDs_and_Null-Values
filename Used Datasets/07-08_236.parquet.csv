It's what I have been saying for some time now: With vastly increased wealth for the richest due to technological leverage, what will need to be done is increased taxation, especially for the richest. The taxes can be used to pay for a ""dividend"" system, which could for instance be implemented through negative taxation up to a certain low income. We might not be there today, but it is where we'll end up if automation keeps spreading at the rate it has until now.<p>Norway almost de facto has a system like this already (through an incredibly generous welfare system), but the only reason we are able to pay for it is through the huge petroleum income.",1349942185.0

I just don't trust someone who manages my account making a gain in the good times, but suffering no losses in the bad times.<p>@hartleybrody<p>I really really love practical advice. And so you are in luck, because I have a practical ""betting on myself"" story.<p>When I moved to Bend, Oregon it was 2005, I was 24, and it was shortly after my brother had passed away. I was pretty emotional and wasn't in a rational state at the time.<p>So when friends, family, every-freakin-person was saying the following mantra.<p>""Buy now or be priced out forever""<p>And with this chant ringing in my ears, I went to a mortgage broker. This broker proceeded to approve me for up to 415k dollar loan, in Central Oregon, with my wage of 45k annually. (If you have been following the mortgage crisis this isn't the worst atrocity)<p>And sitting there with my young wife, wanting something solid to cling to, a small mechanism clicked in my brain, despite the emotion. It didn't feel right. So we walked away. I said to my wife<p>""I'll perform some research and we'll come back.""<p>And so what did I do? I did what any solid nerd would do and went out to gather data. How? I learned all about scraping (screen scraping, web crawling, etc) from my new buddy Matthew Turland (plug his book not mine, which had not been written at the time but I'd like to think my quesitons helpd him realize his expertise. Yes it's all about me ;-)  <a href=""http://www.phparch.com/books/phparchitects-guide-to-web-scraping-with-php/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phparch.com/books/phparchitects-guide-to-web-scra...</a>)<p>Using this knowledge I scraped and regexed the county records (<a href=""http://www.deschutes.org/Assessors-Office/DIAL-Search-Form.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deschutes.org/Assessors-Office/DIAL-Search-Form.a...</a>) and do you know what I learned? I saw that on average the annual increase in real estate prices in Central Oregon hovered around 3%. Yet by the time 2005 rolled around, 50% YoY increases were the norm.<p>""Whoa"" I thought channeling a Matrix style Keanu. ""This is Not sustainable""<p>And so this is the beginning of ""betting on myself"". By analyzing the data, I knew that this growth was not going to last, so I convinced my wife (bless her for trusting me) that housing was a malinvestment, even though ALL our friends were arguing our stupidity.<p>It was almost like the biblical story of Noah, where everyone thinks you are crazy for saying a flood is coming. With everyone thinking you are crazy, you eventually just shut up.<p>Then the RE market stalled. This were slowing down, but no one was putting it together.<p>Then Lehman Brothers Crashed. And the World was like ""WTF Lehman? Alright this sucks but the losses are limited.""<p>Then the market frickin crashed. By March of 2009 it was beyond ugly. <a href=""http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=maximized&chdeh=0&chfdeh=0&chdet=1349467200000&chddm=746851&chls=IntervalBasedLine&q=INDEXDJX:.DJI&ntsp=0&ei=tnJ2UJDlIuOOiAL7wgE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&...</a><p>And here is where I bet on myself again. I poured half our savings into GOLD.<p>OMG!<p>OMG!!<p>OMG!!!<p>This really is gambling. But the data and the research I had, helped me see that there was this crazy opportunity. Buying into everyone's fear.<p>One thing I'd like to point out, is that I consulted with my wife. I told her my thesis and she concluded.<p>""Well you were right about housing, I'm going to trust you. If we lose the money, we will move on.""<p>The last bit was really important. I only risked what WE were willing to lose.<p>Ok. Where was I? Oh yeah...<p>So I buy gold, then I start tracking foreclosures. But I get really bored of tracking them by hand.

But hopefully it articulates the ""betting on oneself"" philosophy that I've taken.<p>It may not pan out, I'm ok with that. I like my odds better than the 401k folks.<p>One thing that sets me apart is that I've learned a crap pile about a ton of different topics I never knew anything about.

There are a lot of attempted alternatives in this niche but none provide the instant kind of payment you'd get from using eBay or have the quantity of buyers. It is truly the network effect at work.<p>What's my point about this? It's that the problem with eBay isn't because it doesn't have a Pinterest-esque style layout. No one really cares about eBay's dotcom style layout, or the fact that it the logo until recently was schizophrenic about it's capitalization. It's because they completely bone the sellers. If you're a seller on eBay, you're constantly juiced on every little single thing. You also have little recourse if a buyer rates you poorly (I guess punish him back by rating him badly too?). It's been a slow methodical shakedown of sellers and quite frankly people are sick of being nickel and dimed to death. So I hope this blows up in their face and that they continue to lose market and mindshare.<p>And I find it funny that eBay is now promoting that images are the way to go with this layout when for years they nickel and dimed sellers on photos (Is the max 3 without paying?

First, a San Francisco public relations firm, Whitaker and Baxter, was hired to coordinate the anti- health insurance initiative.</i><p><i>As a result, a proactive National Education Campaign was designed to make the AMAs case against the Ewing Report and subsequent national health insurance legislation in Congress At its core, the National Education Campaign would focus on connecting national health insurance with socialized medicine in the publics mind.</i><p><i>Second, Morris Fishbein, the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), was removed. Fishbein had been an important voice within the AMA for three decades; he was, however, a reactionary thinker, and his public methods lacked the precision and flair of the new Whitaker/Baxter proposal.</i><p><i>To promote their National Education Campaign, Whitaker and Baxter first went about assembling a war chest. The internal legislative body of the AMA, the House of Delegates, voted in December 1948 to assess each member $25, for the purpose of raising $3.5 million  money that would support the Campaigns goals.</i><p><i>Within two months, Baxter and Whitaker had sufficient resources (around $1.5 million) to begin implementing their strategic plans, which included distributing millions of pamphlets, making wide use of the press and radio, mobilizing additional pressure groups against government health insurance, writing letters to congressmen, and organizing speakers bureaus throughout the country.</i><p><i>In addition, the AMA would use physicians themselves as assets; while waiting for their family doctors, patients would be exposed to pamphlets  one of which was titled The Voluntary Way is the American Way  that detailed the dangers of compulsory health insurance.""</i>",1349940131.0

The main downside is that if you want a key for loader.efi added (so you don't have to say ""yes, I really want to run this"" each time you boot), you have to put UEFI into setup mode and the interface for doing so depends on the motherboard.  So SuSE's is nicer from a UI standpoint but it puts keys in two locations, while this one is uglier from a UI standpoint but it keeps all keys within a single UEFI store.",1349939333.0

Antirez says it best:<p><pre><code>   remember all those stories about DB denormalisation, and hordes of memcached or Redis farms to cache stuff, and things like that? The reality is that fancy queries are an awesome SQL capability (so incredible that it was hard for all us to escape this warm and comfortable paradigm), but not at scale.\n</code></pre>\nYou'll be hard pressed to find any medium-sized project in the wild that doesn't require a layer of denormalization or caching to be reasonably responsive (I mean, some frameworks come with that built-in - their users might not even be aware this is happening).  You might have some beautifully crafted model underlying that layer, but don't fool yourself into thinking that's all there is.",1349939221.0

Chrome does well with just three channels: Dev, Beta, and Release (ignoring the Canary channel as a special case of Dev).<p>I support shortening the release cycle (to maybe 4 weeks) and increasing the number of Beta users. Having two channels (Aurora and Beta) between dev and release is useful because it widens the user population as the release stabilizes. As you point out, some bugs can only be found by increasing the test population, rather than the test time. Early adopters that install Aurora or Beta are not representative of the ""Joe User"" population, who probably suffer from malware, anti-virus software, and older hardware.<p>(posted from Firefox Nightly 19.0a1 :)",1349938922.0
