After all, regardless of GPL rhetoric, the BSD, Apache and MIT licenses are also very popular and someone who does a little digging can find exactly the license he is looking for.......unless he/she intentionally chose GPL!<p>Also, I dont believe anyone today is silly to believe that Microsoft or ""unknown large corporation"" will really steal their ruby/python/java code. Most big companies choose their libraries and tools very carefully and are more concerned about lawsuits as opposed to spending some developer time to re-write some library.",1247558355.0

This ideal is rather neutral towards any commercial and business aspects: it only conflicts with some of the established practices and beliefs of the current business world.<p>GPL does not intend to compete or lock-out other software while that may indeed happen if you're playing a different game and holding tightly on to contradicting views of what you think is important.<p>In reality, there are no other limitations in GPL than that effectively no single author or distributor can't enforce control over or killing the software.<p>For companies, there are two possible outcomes:<p>1) secrecy of the company source code is more valuable. Conclusion: there's no rational reason to even consider incorporating GPL code in the company. What's the problem?<p>2) benefits from reusing GPL'ed software is more valuable. Conclusion: GPL your stuff as well to gain the benefits and avoid any legal problems. What's the problem?<p>Otherwise the company is holding on to the belief that they can have and eat the cake, and effectively just wasting their own time.",1247558314.0

However I think a lot of times people put their software under the GPL because of its position in the open source world, and the rhetoric of the FSF.<p>There is a continuum from having your code used in a completely non-commercial project to being used by Microsoft in some terrible software.

It's fine to keep all the choices available, but put them behind the scenes.  When someone boots up a linux distro for the first time they should see a browser, a word processor, email, a media player, and an IM client...some basic games too.  ubuntu netbook remix is the best example of this that i've seen.

I used the 'bind interfaces only' configuration directive, which I thought would prevent it from opening any ports on my Internet interface.

I took a full backup of the box and then re-installed it from scratch as I couldn't trust it.<p>I learned that you should always look at what ports you have open (`netstat -lpn` is my favourite command for this) and that there are some times when a firewall might be of use (I'm not a fan of firewalls on anything other than gateway boxes).",1247557516.0

There are situations where people think they know what you mean and go in and mess with things but miss the subtlety of a situation. Or where it comes down to matters of taste.

Except for 2 points:\n- In my lurkings on HN (for a few months now), I have seen that most folks here are pretty fair. Surely then they realize that choosing a license is the prerogative of the author. This is nothing to hate or get angry about.......just respect the writer of the code. There should be plenty of similar projects with more acceptable licenses if someone digs around. And if more people start using them, they will, in time be more popular than their GPL counterparts. After all, what is an open source project without a community?\n- Writing webapps (as a lot of projects on HN seem to do) does not require one to open source one's backend application.",1247556518.0
