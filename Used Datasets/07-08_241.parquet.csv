1,3294235,comment,3290630.0,3292570.0,1,0,lisper,,,I suppose depth is in the eye of the beholder.  That's pretty much it: to build a Lisp out of vectors you need numbers as primitives.  To build a Lisp out of cons cells you don't.<p>Follow-up exercise: do you need numbers to build a Lisp out of associative arrays?  (Hint: this is not a trivial question to answer.),1322639963.0

4,3294232,comment,3293522.0,3293905.0,3,0,po,,,">So, without this change, each group was getting treated fairly? Care to explain how multidecade wait times for the two biggest groups while the rest get visas in a matter of years is fairness?<p>Yes, from the perspective of the individual countries, the old policy is more fair. If you gave all of the countries of the world one vote each and had them vote, that's what you would get. However, if you gave all of the <i>people</i> of the world one vote, that is not what you would get as the people in the more populous countries would want their country to send more people.<p>As I explained, it is fair to the group not to the individual. All countries were capped at 7% of the total so large groups (and here we group by countries) would not crowd out small groups. You obviously don't like that policy.<p>As for the diversity argument, I am not stating wether it is better or worse. I explicitly said that it is up to society to decide that and our legislators have chosen to go with the less diversity option, so there you go. I think the fact that it will cause a reduction of diversity - diversity in the sense of what country immigrants come from, <i>not</i> cultural diversity -  in applicants is indisputable. It is important to understand the consequences of our choices and this is one of them.<p>Also, <i>I</i> didn't lump all of India's diverse cultures into one group, India (and I guess the British and French) did. The grouping is done by country because that's how immigration laws and treaties work. I am fully aware of the cultural diversity in India.",1322639828.0

And, by '96, I had graduated from HyperCard into C and Pascal.<p>But: I spent a <i>lot</i> of time in HyperCard, and I can assure you that the field of HyperCard complexity was not limited to just ""simple back and forth stacks"" or ""anything truly useful beyond that"". HyperCard afforded a really nice way of gradually ramping up complexity and approaching complex-on-the-outside problems with simple-on-the-inside code.<p>I doubt I could remember any of my own HyperCard projects at this point if my life depended on it. But, I can tell you about a HyperCard project a good friend of mine did: he called it ""MusicMaker"", and it came with a piano keyboard, multiple synthesizers, and its own unique musical notation system which allowed you to easily translate any sheet music into text which the HyperCard stack could synthesize and play on the piano keys. It could teach people music better than just about any other piece of software at the time. This was not, as I recall, remarkably challenging for him, and we both had a lot of fun with it.<p>I think any network-related programming is going to suck. Tricks of the Mac Game Programming Gurus had an entire chapter devoted to it, as I recall, in which most of the chapter could be summed up as, ""OpenTransport sucks"". So, I don't think it's fair to use a networking-related program as an example of a challenging HyperCard (or SuperCard) project.<p>> <i>I appreciate your romantic notions to the contrary however.</i><p>(edited for snark)<p>Please try to keep the snark to a minimum.

He and Apple focused on the consumer market (imacs, ipods, etc.) - the business market had already been won by Microsoft.  Microsoft also already had a more successful end-user friendly programming/scripting environment: Visual Basic and VBA.

64,3294171,comment,3293657.0,3293891.0,9,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Y'know, I can see where he's coming from. I'll get to that in a moment, but first: I'm starting to get a little sick of HN's tone lately. I'll readily admit that I've contributed to that in the past, but some of the comments in this thread (""person is a troll"", ""writes vacuous posts"", ""is a crackpot"") are really over the top asinine.<p>He's a better person than I am, because if it were me, I'd already have a script in place that checked the referrer and would post a blank page with ""Eat a dick"" for anybody coming from HN. If nothing else, it would ensure that the submission wouldn't get as many upvotes (or would get flagged) and I wouldn't feel compelled to put up with the abuse.<p>Anyway:<p>So, IIRC, my progression as a young programmer went something like: BASIC on a Commodore 64 / Vic-20, to Logo on I-don't-remember, to HyperCard (and then on to QBasic and Pascal and C and C++ and OOP and on and on).<p>HyperCard was amazing because its barrier-to-entry was so, so low, and I agree with the author's comments that there still isn't anything quite like it. For one thing, it was on most Macs by default at the time, so you didn't have to find a copy of the software and install it first.<p>As he shows, it was a piece of cake to get started with. A budding HyperCard programmer could easily learn new tricks by downloading anybody's stack and reading the code. Since it wasn't compiled, you could learn from it. Anything that anybody else did, you could take apart, and learn how to do.<p>And it grew with you. You could make something as simple or as complex as you wanted. My very first, very naive foray into AI was in HyperTalk; I discovered I could write self-modifying stacks, and decided to see if I could teach a HyperTalk stack to talk to me like a person.<p>HyperCard also introduced me to online forums for the first time. I still remember, fondly, downloading J5iverson's XFCNs from eWorld. From there, I discovered the world of the early internet -- the alternative to BBSs. Whereas BBSs at the time let me easily chat with someone else in my town (or, more often, play TradeWars or something), eWorld let me chat with people ""across the pond"" for the first time. For a young kid, this was a life-changing, world-shrinking event.<p>I disagree with the comments that SuperCard is a reasonable alternative. I don't remember the details now, but while I appreciated the addition of color in SuperCard, it brought with it other complexities that I disliked. I played around with SuperCard but ultimately went back to HyperCard.<p>So, what I'm getting at is, if it weren't for HyperCard, I don't think I'd be a programmer right now. HyperCard was simple enough for a beginner, and rich enough to keep my interest. It was a <i>huge</i> influence on me. I really can't overstate that.<p>Almost two decades later, I was approached by an employer who wanted me to teach computer programming to his son. His son was young, not yet in high school, pretty sharp, and, y'know, geeky. Liked video games, liked taking things apart. Not exactly a challenging pupil in terms of motivation.<p>I spent a ton of time trying to figure out just what in the hell environment to use to teach him.  JavaScript? You have to know a <i>lot</i> of other stuff before you can really begin to do anything of value in JavaScript. Before we could do the calculator example in the author's blog post in JavaScript, I'd have to teach basics of HTML, the DOM, and eventually we'd either end up using JQuery or going over the whole ""browsers are different in how they handle the same code"" discussion, which, honestly, is one of the most stupid problems in the history of computing when you think about it.<p>Anyway, I went through a bunch of options and finally settled on something called Kids Programming Language (or Phrogram). What a damned mess that was. It wasn't very long before I had to teach the concept of objects to the kid. And scope. And then half the time the entire environment would just up and crash with no helpful explanation. There's a fun problem for a newbie programmer: write some code, your environment crashes, no explanation.<p>If the field has improved much since then, I'm unaware of it. Not having something like HyperCard available to young programmers really is a tragedy, because it means that future programmers are going to be introduced to programming in college (which, often, is a joke, and IMO also too late in an individual's mental development), or they're going to have to tough it out through JavaScript or Ruby or Python or whatever the inscrutable popular language-of-the-month is, and that's going to really narrow down the field of people interested in getting into programming.<p>Some free market adherents might respond with, ""Well, if there was demand, someone would build it, so obviously there's no demand"". Honestly, I find that entire argument completely boring. It's clear that there <i>was</i> a lot of demand for it; did nobody want it before it was invented, and has nobody wanted it since it became no longer supported? I don't think so. I think there is a market for such a thing, and it just hasn't been built yet.<p>I really hope it will be. It's already on my list of near-future projects if nobody else does it first.",1322638253.0

Especially if it's keeping professors happy (who, let's face it, probably complain a lot about IT's offerings) and doesn't cost them anything? Coursekit in its current form isn't dependent on IT for anything -- they host on their own server, use their own logins. IT can either ban it (and face the whiplash), or politely ask the tenured professors to stop using it (and they wouldn't even know <i>which</i> professors are using it, since it's external). The one thing they <i>could</i> kick up a storm about is student grades being stored on an external server. That's a pickle.<p>Faculty won't pay for this, true -- thankfully, there are other ways to make money in the industry -- but a much bigger problem is that faculty aren't even <i>looking</i> for it. They've been conditioned that software comes from IT, so while they may hate using Blackboard, most aren't googling for ""Blackboard alternatives"". That'll need to change. I think Coursekit's strategy of creating student evangelists  might actually work though, especially at smaller schools where the relationships between students and professors is stronger.",1322637766.0

If you haven't captured any frequencies above 15kHz (which an average cell phone mic is unlikely to do), no amount of averaging, filtering, or combining will get them back.
