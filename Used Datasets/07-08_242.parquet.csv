Those are the two problems that nobody seems to be solving yet.<p>Basically, high-voltage electricity is distributed with networks that are dumb and old. The generation and usage is very carefully balanced with heavy users and large producers, because the network does not have storage capacity. It also has very little tolerance for power imbalance, the frequency cutoffs in the old equipment running most of the network are rather severe (in high-voltage networks, frequency increases with more power being fed into the system).<p>There are already extremely severe network problems in Germany for example where quite a bit of power comes from solar and wind. (I worked as an embedded sw engineer doing software that controlled solar inverters for a while)<p>The problem with upgrading distribution network is of course the MASSIVE amounts capex needed to replace it.<p>The other problem is industrial consumers - an aluminium smelter requires a certain amount of power coming in 24/7 or the ovens will freeze and if they do, restart is basically impossible. There are many other factories with similar problems. Given the trend towards just-in-time production and shipping, the chain of events that leads to massive disruption in the global trade can start from a fairly small shutdown with large snowball effects.<p>I&",

These formats compress audio by cutting out difficult to hear frequencies. By contrast, CD quality is considered lossless, because it represents the entire frequency of the sound wave. 320 kbps is less data than a CD. \nWhether the jump from a good quality MP3 to a lossless format gives you a higher quality listening experience is up for debate, but 126 kbps is definitely terrible.<p>This website can help you compare the bit rates and see if you can hear the difference. <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/06/02/411473508/how-well-can-you-hear-audio-quality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/06/02/411473508/h...</a>",1444375242.0
