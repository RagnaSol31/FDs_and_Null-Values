Ms. Kwolek did not directly benefit from it financially, however; she signed over patent royalties to DuPont.<p>This is kind of sad to me. I realize it is more or less standard practice to sign over all IP rights to your employer, but this was a significantly greater contribution than your standard invention. Reminds me of the engineer who created the blue LED who only received a bonus of <$200. He later sued and got closer to $9m.
