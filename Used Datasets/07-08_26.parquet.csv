I run a Chinese teaching business though (<a href=""http://popupchinese.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://popupchinese.com</a>) and think the analogy is a bit misleading. Unlike English with all of its irregularities, Chinese definitely gets easier and easier as people learn.<p>There's a failure of pedagogy in teaching the language. Chinese grammar is trivial if taught properly (we teach ""prepositions"" and ""adjectives"" before introducing ""coverbs"" and ""stative verbs"" and that seems to work). And while the tones can be tricky, most people don't get nearly enough listening and speaking practice.<p>As you said though, practice makes perfect. For me recursion was fun but memory management with vectors of pointers was a bitch. Easy to have a conceptual understanding, but the sort of thing you only master when you need to trace stuff through source to figure out where an error is. Then it clicks for good. :)",1265874743.0

He thinks that since devices are not that useful without his content; he eventually wins because he will get people to win. “Content is not just king, it is the emperor of all things electronic!” he recently said.</i><p>I think he's missing the point here.<p>a) Newscorp has flourished as a business because up until recently media has been an industry with a high barrier to entry.  To paraphrase Warren Buffett, if you own the only newspaper in town it's a bit like owning a local monopoly.  The same applies for television channels, etc. which have high upfront costs.<p>b) The problem facing Newscorp now is that the internet has lowered the barrier to entry dramatically, so that its size and financial clout is no longer a major advantage.  For instance, would you rather read an article in a Newscorp paper or one of PGs essays?  In the past it'd be hard for PG to get his essays out there, now it's much easier.  This means a much higher level of competition, and competition destroys margins.<p>c) e-Readers/Tablets don't make the barrier to entry much higher.  (You can publish stuff on the Kindle for free, for instance: <a href=""https://dtp.amazon.com/mn/signin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dtp.amazon.com/mn/signin</a>).

21,1117158,story,,,4,9,lostintech,Ask HN: What you think of my startup idea? Knockoffs & China: huge problem,,"I am double posting this because i just got (1) one feedback with the original post, and i badly need more. I would not post this anymore, do not worry. If nobody cares probably the idea is doomed, anyway, let's go ahead.<p>The concept behind the idea, is well grounded. I will give you an example : I have been selling watches on ebay lately, and i noticed that at least 95% of the questions i received from people were: ""Is this a original watch? or a knockoff copy?"", but this phenomena extends to other products as well, such as perfumes (which are more dangerous when fake because they can contain harmful chemicals impurities), bags, handbadgs, and a ton more kind of goods. I was thinking to the relation this service could have with china, and its economic rise, and the fact that here fakes are almost legal. Chinese government made promises to the international community when joined WTO in 2001. They told they were going to make counterfeits good illegal. Some days ago i've asked a a smart woman who was selling counterfeit watches in Shenzhen LuoHu Commercial City :<p>Alberto Armandi: hey do u think china will ever put a stop on this ? \nChinese Woman : do u really want to know the truth ? Alberto Armandi : yes, of course. \nChinese Woman : i think China will never do that because we , and our economy depends heavily on that.<p>So given the Chinese economy growth, and the seriously diffused ""Chinese entrepreneurial mindset make money fast with counterfeit goods"", i think ebay will have to cope with a lot of those nasty stuffs in the future. This gives room for this kind of service i think. I already bought domains : spotebayfake.com and fake-howto.com. Both are related to keywords such as ""how to spot fake"", keywords that outputs some nice results if you look at volume of searches on google monthly.<p>It would not be billed with a monthly or whatever, subscription model, instead the customer would pay only for the item(s) he's interested to check, and when he or she wants, the model i am thinking is ""pay per consumption"". I was thinking to SMS because transactions will be vary small. I have to read how Paypal deals with micropayments. Regarding how the service would work, let's say you find a watch on ebay, like a Rolex watch, and you want to know it is fake or not, you come to our site and submit the request for investigation, i will check the object ( i know something about how to spot counterfeits and replicas, i am in china since 2005 ), and i will provide you an aswer, in terms of probability. All the process would not take more than 5 minutes, i do not think that real-time informations matter that much in this specifical case. You will then pay let's say 1 USD to me for the information, and go on with your purchase or discard it.<p>here is a link to get a, not very precise, big picture of the market :<p>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=how+to+spot+fake&aq=f&aqi=g10&oq=<p>There are also some forums on ebay :<p>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&newwindow=1&q=ebay+forums+how+to+spot+fake&aq=f&oq=&aqi=<p>What do you think ? is it worth implementing it ? let me know your feedback. it is precious.<p>Thanks so much in advance.
