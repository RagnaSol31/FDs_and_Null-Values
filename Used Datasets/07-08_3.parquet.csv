It does come at a price of killing general ed requirements but I agree with this. Reasons:<p>(1) It destroys the separation of compulsory secondary school and voluntary tertiary school.<p>(2) Dumbs down core courses, as the general ed students flock to easy courses or convince lecturers to make the class easier.",1243151284

If you define success in terms of growth rate and speed from idea to market dominance and massive profits, then Google is right up there.<p>It all depends how you weight growth and total profit when you talk about ""success.""  The growth curve of oil as a business took hundreds of years, whereas Google became a billion dollar business in a few years.",1243150712

It's a desktop app for ripping videos from the web and converting movies to a format suitable for iTunes & iPod. So those bittorrent videos can finally find a place in iTunes & your iPod. You can rip movies straight from YouTube by dragging the url icon into the app.",1243150702

Someone would have to weed through the entries, though (maybe make it open to votes, like stories).",1243150473

I think good ‘taste’ comes from a willingness to change--rather, an insistence on change for the better leads to what comes across as tasteful.",1243150023
8,624192,comment,624045.0,624176.0,0,0,tralfam,,,"Thousands of people saw Apple's bad move when this story made its way across the web. Apple doesn't think twice when it's someone small who can't make a fuss.<p>It's the same kind of deal we saw with the Google Checkout story a couple months ago. Honest people get caught up in overzealous protection methods and companies just take it as a loss.<p>Search for ""iPhone app rejected"" and you will see this isn't an isolated incident. A lot of the rejected apps probably broke the rules, but plenty have not, and Apple doesn't seem to care unless they have a big soapbox to shout from.<p>Textbook ""evil"", no. But, it wouldn't be hard to stop these things. Apple takes a calculated approach because they know the few wrongfully rejected apps won't cost them as much money as implementing a beefier review process across their whole app store. When this policy gets bad press by influential bloggers, like with this app, they can spend a minimal amount of resources to reevaluate the app. It's cold and calculated.",1243149895

11,624187,comment,624058.0,624058.0,0,0,djehuty,,,"""Why does Google give away products like its browser, its apps, and the Android operating system for mobile phones? Anything that increases Internet use ultimately enriches Google, Varian says. And since using the Web without using Google is like dining at In-N-Out without ordering a hamburger, more eyeballs on the Web lead inexorably to more ad sales for Google.""<p>Very silly. Google's browser generates searches in the title bar for free which Google pays Firefox and the others for. Mail, Talk and the apps are vehicles for showing ads to people. The extra internet use is <i>just not</i> the primary purpose of these things. What confuses people, even Wired, who should know better, is that not <i>everything</i> Google does has an immediate payoff every time. They're willing to develop something, like maybe Android, which can make them money later, maybe.",1243149106

But the ones that <i>are</i> denied aren't always denied for logical reasons. Baby Shaker was approved. Eucalyptus was denied. That's messed up.,1243149002
