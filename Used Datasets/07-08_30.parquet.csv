It is, indeed, slave wage.<p>The workers are charged for their meals from their salaries, though they buy a lunch card once a month.<p>To put things in perspective: a two course meal in Shenzhen at a cheap Chinese restaurant is $20RMB/person. A McDonald's meal roughly 50RMB. A metro ride is 10RMB. A train ride within Guangzhou ~50RMB, a neighboring province +120RMB. A pirated DVD is 10RMB. One hour of internet at a netcafe is 7RMB. A bottle of Tsingtao is 10RMB. A pack of cigarettes is 10RMB. A 10 minute cab ride is 20RMB.<p>A Chinese teenager can expect to spend 80RMB on a weekend, doing nothing but taking the train to visit friends, having dinner and two pints of beer and a pack of cigarettes. 26% of their weekly income for 2-3 hours of R&R.<p>For comparison, an American teenager with a full time job, making minimum wage at $7.25 earns $7.25x8x5 = $290/wk. Dinner + beer + bus + cigs + movie ~= 10 + 6 + 8 + 4 + 10 = $38. Or only 13% of their weekly income on R&R, half of what a Chinese boy or girl spends, and I threw in a free movie experience at the cinema, something that would break any Chinese teen's budget.",1275375651.0
