Try to burn through half the budget straight off the bat.  If I still had the contract after that, I'd run ads where I squeezed as many clips of people into 30 seconds as I possibly could - think of the production costs.  If it was coming in too cheap, maybe throw in some B-list celebrities if I could get away with it.  Finally, if the client still hadn't wised up, I'd just spend whatever was left of the budget, though at that stage I'd probably only be able to afford ads where I just pull someone off the street and get them to buy a computer.<p>Ah - it all makes sense now.

It's actually a fairly simple answer and one you might not have realised visually.<p>Antz tried to make characters more realistic, IE 6 limbs (2 arms, 4 legs), whereas A Bugs Life anthromorphised their characters and gave them 4 limbs, 2 arms and legs. This is so that people watching could identify with the characters more readily, even though it was technically unrealistic.<p>They also did this with Finding Nemo to an extent, giving the characters mostly forward facing eyes and eyebrows which fish don't have but allowed for more expression. In fact, the characters were heavily influenced by Dog facial features as that is something people would be relatively familiar with.<p>EDIT - I also figured I'd argue another point unalone made :)<p><i>Froo and I argued Kung Fu Panda versus Wall-E on IRC, if I recall correctly, and while I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about the animation world as he is, it's pretty hard to say that Jack Black in KFP is a more relatable character than Wall-E.</i><p>Well it really depends on your perspective. One can relate to WALL-E as an adult audience more easily than to Po (Jack Black's character). This is why when we were arguing, it's difficult to argue one in favour of the other as the stories have two seperate markets.<p>Po's story arc is essentially this: He loves Kung Fu, He learns he is the Dragon Warrior, He learns kung fu while learning to believe he IS the dragon warrior, he defeats Tai Lung - it's simple and linear.<p>WALL-E's story arc is a little more complex. He first struggles with becoming self aware of his environment and learning about it (the first scene where he's collecting objects). The story then goes ahead and emphasises his need to be loved and his loneliness (the guys and dolls TV scene where he holds his own hand). His daily grind (when he wakes up and struggles to put his tracks on which adults relate too and after being curious (the landing marker) he learns of eve and starts to fall in love. He then goes on a voyage of discovery and then goes through a back and forth process between love and bravery (saving eve and the plant) in which he ends up saving humanity and getting the girl.<p>So WALL-E has a more complex story arc and has elements with which adults relate to more readily. But both have eye candy, so kids enjoy them both too.<p>From a visual standpoint, Andrew Stanton and his team discovered early in the process that WALL-E's binocular-like eyes and the little eyebrow things (which have no actual use except for expression) were all they needed to articulate emotion. Ben Burtt's sound effects reinforced that. In fact, during WALL-E, sound was a part of the production process and not an afterthought in post production like it normally would be.<p>Po's character really didn't break much ground in this respect. KFP's biggest thing was how they managed to do so much cloth on fur which is fairly computationally intensive.",1239003749

He and I made similar salary, did similar work. He got to be in more debt, though, and as a bit of a bonus he bragged about stanford and software quality, etc blah blah. I told him all software startup code is garbage and quietly to myself he should just work on the product. He quit, startup got sold and I cashed out. Sure I was lucky but his whole attitude was wrong.<p>Back at SSU I knew of another Stanford grad who was humble and was genuinely into software and all around a spiffy guy. And he knew more than my cube-neighbor.<p>Here's thing thing about ""it"" schools like Stanford, MIT: it's something of an illusion. Sure they great schools and they do the best research, if that is where you want to go (something I had a hard time doing at SSU). Before I got hired I worked on my own stuff, contributed code and had all-around genuine extracurricular fun messing around with systems, hacking, and reading about binary analysis and security. That's the kind of stuff that gets you somewhere. Not going to ""it"" schools gives you the freedom to pick what your extracurricular stuff is, though. :)<p>I guess my advice is to do what ever you want.

Shrek in the original movie is an exception. They make <i>identifiable</i> characters, but rarely are their characters deep and human. Froo and I argued Kung Fu Panda versus Wall-E on IRC, if I recall correctly, and while I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about the animation world as he is, it's pretty hard to say that Jack Black in KFP is a more relatable character than Wall-E. Pixar makes people that you really feel like you know. Dreamworks is willing to make caricatures and as a result, their movies feel shallower from a story point of view. Even if Pixar follows a formula, it's a complex formula with deep permutations so that Mr. Incredible and Woody and Nemo's father and Wall-E are all very different people, even if the one recurring thread is that they all feel real to us.<p>This is actually the one problem I had with <i>Annie Hall</i>, which I saw recently for the first time: Woody Allen has a brilliant style, but the characters he made all seemed like caricatures, and so despite being a genius movie, I didn't love it. (I thought of this because back when I was a kid and there were two camps of children, the Ants kids and the Bug's Life kids, I was an Ants kid, thought Woody Allen in that was terrific, and thought the movie was stylistically and conceptually beyond Bug's Life, but going back to them I realize that Bug's Life, for all that, still has the more realistic characters, the ones that feel real, and so Ants's clever and detailed world falls apart at that one big seam.)",1239003221

Even then, they have no problem with changing the story at the 11th hour.<p>Case in point - WALL-E's ending was originally very different with WALL-E originally saving EVE from the trash compactors (essentially larger versions of WALL-E for irony). After the film was complete and was screened in Portland, Andrew Stanton changed the ending to what it is today. The story flows better.<p>Compare that to something like Dreamworks or Blue Sky Studios. Dreamworks focusses on making films which are more technically proficient and aimed at children (Kung Fu Panda was astounding from a technical standpoint) and something like Horton Hears a Who or Ice Age are heavily stylised films.<p>Dreamworks are more focussed on the business side, rather than the entertainment side of the process.<p><i>I first saw Toy Story as a child. Looking back on it as an adult, I remembered that I had a pretty good grasp on the plot and characters as a kid, so I was assuming it had been a simplistic film. When I watched it again, I saw lots of things I didn't notice as a kid.</i><p>That's Lasseter's influence as one of the Pixar co-founders. This style has permeated throughout the whole studio. Creativity comes first at Pixar. Ironically, he was actually fired from Disney in the 80's for trying to introduce 3D to their production pipeline and Disney ended up buying Pixar for billions...<p><i>They've built up a pretty solid momentum now, and it would take a series of bombs (like Disney after the mid-90s) to shake it.</i><p>Funnily enough that's a result of Katzenberg leaving Disney after a disagreement with Michael Eisner (then CEO of Disney) and he ended up co-founding Dreamworks.<p><i>(Though I'm kind of on the fence about Cars.)</i><p>Yeah, each of the studios has those little outliers.
