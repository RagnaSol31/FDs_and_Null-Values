It does a great job of showing how to make a point effectively, and showing how a lot of political writing fails to do much of anything but preach to the choir.<p>Glad to see it on here.",1218355041

7,272237,comment,272206.0,272214.0,0,0,thenextweb,,,"I have always wondered if that would work for spam too. What if we would set-up a bunch of servers to follow all links (times 10) in all spam messages. Even better, make it a plug-in for Outlook & Mail. Then, if a spammer would send out 100.000 messages he would immediately receive 1 million hits. No problem if you are authentically sending a few emails but a huge problem if you are sending out millions of mails.<p>If would be an active spam fighting solution instead of all the 'turn the other cheek' solutions that are popular right now...",1218353115

If they were, there would never be any progress. No iTunes without napster. No Microsoft being the biggest software company in the world without piracy. That doesn't mean it's ethically justified to break any rule. I just think it's not as simple as someone stating their own rules and everyone automatically obeying it.",1218352641
