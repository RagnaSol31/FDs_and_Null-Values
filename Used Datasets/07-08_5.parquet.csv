They would use the alternative.<p>Hence, if you are providing a product (without lying), I think you are doing the world a service.

7,543035,comment,542947.0,542981.0,0,0,BobbyH,,,"Payday loans may have a high interest rate, but if the cost of a payday loan is less than the alternatives, then it seems ethical to me. For instance, say a payday loan for $200 costs $30. That's translates into a high interest rate, but it's worth it to you if it helps you avoid a $50 late fee on another bill that's due before your next payday. The trick to running a payday business ethically seems to be fee transparency and not charging excessive fees such that borrowers must borrow an ever-increasing amount. This article about a payday company in LA talks about these issues: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/magazine/09nix-t.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/magazine/09nix-t.html</a>",1238657689.0

Most numbers in economics (and in nature) vary in an exponential manner. Consider, for example, inflation, interest rates, and population growth. Nature deals in ratios; it is only human afterthought that adds units to measurements.<p>One incidental result of the fact that numbers tend to vary exponentially is that the first digit of a measured number is most likely 1 and least likely 9.
