You will soon be able to create and share your own movies.<p>We know Facebook games tend to be shit, but given we only had barely enough funds for a game like this (we originally wanted to do an mmo) we tried to be original and haven't resorted to spamming users the way most games do.<p>We tried to design a slightly different experience to what can be found over there, so we're doing a game where you play but soon will be able to create content, a little like Little Big Planet.<p>We launched on Tuesday and have grown to about 20k users and over 6k daily active users.

18,3116810,comment,3116495.0,3116495.0,9,0,Abundnce10,,,"I taught English in the public school system in South Korea last year.  There were a few stark differences that I couldn't help but notice and I feel they shed light on our failing education system here in America.  They have a curriculum that is set forth on a national level.  This accomplishes two important things: One, teachers can now collaborate and share resources on topics that all teachers around the country are preparing for (I did this with my fellow Native English Teachers and ended up saving a lot of time not having to reinvent the wheel for every lesson).  Secondly, it helps eliminate the unnecessary spending that accompanies the insanely large amount of school districts that we have scattered around our country.  Washington State alone has almost 300 school districts!  The board members of these schools districts are in charge of determining the curriculum for their specific locality, mean while others are doing the same exact thing in the next town over. Furthermore, the majority of those board members have a Masters or PhD and require a hefty salary - which could be going towards funding intelligent, passionate teachers.  I'd love to be a teacher but you won't see me entering a public school classroom anytime soon.<p>If we can eliminate the redundancy of our school district issue and provide the framework for a nationalized curriculum, we could pay teachers more (thereby attracting a higher talent pool), lower class sizes, increase spending on classroom necessities (pens, pencils, paper, books, COMPUTERS!), and allow teachers the opportunity to share resources on predetermined, upcoming lessons.  Tackling these issues will put us on the right track towards getting our school system out of this steady decline we've been on for the last couple of decades.",1318750665.0

In 2010 for many of the schools in Denmark where you can become a teacher there were <i>no</i> requirements on your grades from ""gymnasiet"" (equivalent of high school), you only had to have passed gymnasiet. In Denmark, coming teachers choose 2 or 3 subjects that will be there main subjects. For these subjects there are some requirements, unfortunately these are ridiculously low. In gymnasiet all subjects have a level A, B or C which indicates how deeply the subject is covered. Some subjects eg. Danish and history are mandatory and exists only in the highest level A form while others eg. languages, biology, physics, math, exist in usually at least two of the levels and depending on your choice of line you can choose different levels with the requirement that when finishing you must have had 2 non-mandatory A level subjects. To choose eg. nature & technique, a subject supposed to encompass physics, chemistry, biology and geography, as one of your main subjects when becoming an elementary school teacher, it is sufficient to have the medium grade in just a single of a list of subjects that are related to natural sciences and this only had to be on the middle B level.<p>Another problem is that until 2007 the ""seminars"", the schools for educating teachers, were mainly relics from the late sixties, this having all the obvious implications given the hippie\nstate of DK in those years.<p>Also in DK through all levels of the educational system from elementary school through university, the main focus is on the students who are at the bottom of the skill spectrum.",1318750235.0

User will say to Siri, ""[App Name], [command].""<p>""New York Times app, read me the 10 top stories.""<p>""Pandora app, play Sugarland station.""<p>Each developer can list a series of actions = verb + object.  When the user installs the app, Siri will pick up all the actions and they will be available to the user.  Again, it must be initiated by the user saying the app name first.  I can see two main usage cases:<p>1. Launch app into particular action - for example, ""Pandora app, play Sugarland station.""  This opens Pandora and plays Sugarland station.  Pretty straightforward.  Devs just determine the verb + object and what Siri does with the action.  In this case, Siri launches Pandora and sends over the verb ""play"" and the station ""Sugarland,"" and Pandora knows what to do with it.<p>2. Read/show data within Siri.  So, in this usage case the app doesn't launch but rather gives Siri data.  For example, ""New York Times app, read me the last 10 stories.""  Siri sends ""read"" (verb) and ""last 10 stories"" (object) to New York Times app.  New York Times app gets that action and does an API call to the server to return the 10 top stories and gives it to Siri to read.  Siri reads them to the user.<p>",

Don't do it ! And for the love of God, don't get any of it on your face)<p>You can make fresh water out of sea water using just a sheet of plastic and something to catch the water. First, dig a hole in the ground, in a piece of sand that was exposed by ebbing water. Say 20-30 cm deep. Put a cup in the middle of the hole on a stone. Wet the sand with seawater, put the plastic over the hole, attaching it to the sides somehow and put a stone in the middle of the hole.<p>Water will evaporate, hit the plastic which will be slightly cooler than the air below it, so part of the water vapor will become liquid, go towards the middle where you put the stone, where it's cooler still because it's deeper in the ground, and it will drop down into the cup.<p>For better performance, you can put anything that contains water, like plant leaves, rip them to pieces and put those pieces under the plastic. But sea water will work. This is not good enough to remove all salt, but it will reduce it significantly.<p>And btw, if you need to cool down : dig a hole deep enough to have permanent shadow, and lie in it.",1318749042.0

Also, learning should have more meaningfulness in it; something along the lines of what Papert talks in his Mindstorms book <a href=""http://www.papert.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.papert.org/</a><p>What I have observed is that people are not much interested in learning in schools; those with passion get bored and creativity is not encouraged, at all.<p>In my opinion, it's a horrible state what we are in but I don't think many will do anything about it. And in universities, it's even worse. Studying e.g. Computer Science is much of theory without not enough practical learning, as departments lack proper funding (e.g. assistants for helping with assignments). People learn basic concepts barely, and are not excited by them. It's just something to get through so that they get the diploma which is too highly appreciated by companies' HR.<p>Also, the content what is taught, is not what should be. The whole culture is short-sighted, and people who get out of universities are not well-equipped but are suited for trivial web-development of current age, i.e. what the industry is in need of.<p>This makes me sad as learning and teaching should be fun, and could be much more effective. I see some hope with interactive, visual tools that let people learn by themselves but I am not so sure the people responsible for these kind of things really are multitalented and experienced enough to do the proper thing.",1318748880.0

The question is not whether she is the right co-founder to present to PG, JL, etc., for the sake of applying to YC. Instead, you should be asking yourself if she is the right person to be building a company with. A startup is essentially a shotgun marriage where the company is the baby. Can you see he being the right person to bring a company into this world? If the answer is ""yes"" then start working with her. Whatever you do, don't base your decision on what YC is or is not looking for. They look for teams that have qualities that suggest success and that are aligned with their investment thesis. If you have a team that doesn't fit into their investment thesis, but is the right team, then that's all that matters.",1318748499.0
