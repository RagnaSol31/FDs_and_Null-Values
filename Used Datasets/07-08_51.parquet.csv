25,2906104,comment,2905686.0,2905966.0,46,0,Meai,,,"You come up with only a single, high level reason for what could have thousands of reasons, and you seriously come up with one that is a detriment to our entire species. Draw from that conclusions on your capacity and will for logical thinking, sorry this has to be blunt. You are the modern day crusader. You get an idea in your head with next to no logical reasons and then start to proselytize everyone around you.<p>I'll give you another just as likely reason for past societal collapses (frankly, a lot likelier reason), and you can then fill in more if you are able.\nIn times of peace, leaders have no dire motivation to mold their citizens into specific paths that are catalyst for military purposes. This leads to societes that are directionless. Historically, only military societies prevailed because they had direction and motivation to improve. However, what's so bad about being directionless? What exactly causes the downfall of ""peaceful"" (=actually just directionless) societies? We have to dig a little deeper. You jumped the gun and proclaimed it was peace itself that was doing the damage. That sounds ridiculous doesn't it? Peace itself has millions of little and big effects on society. Among these effects is the loss of need for children, therefore inevitably marriage laws get relaxed. Humans want to have sex a lot and with many other people, and marriage gets in the way of that. In peaceful times we have seen a gradual destruction of marital laws. This leads to marriages which can be formed and destroyed at the whim of any person, and in our society today, it's even worse because women are considerably favored in the break-up. This leads to people being very cautious to form deep bonds, and this ultimately leads to a weaker society, a society devoid of the ultimate motivation for every human being: Providing and protecting your family. It's like taking away one of the primary engines of a spaceship. There is still other engines that powers it: Need for food. Need for sex. However the strongest one, the motivation to protect your own children is gone. Because there are no children, because there are no marriages, because marriages are nowadays too fast and detrimental for male parties.\nWhat we need, is actual equality between the genders.",1313826240.0

The trend is that the proportion of the population involved in the manufacture and distribution of physical goods is dropping. Follow that trend for a century, and you get a society where most people's jobs involve only virtual goods (although many of those goods will be turned physical by 3d printers or large bespoke manufacturing companies). Apple and google are the vanguard of the all-digital companies (apple isn't in the business of making stuff, only designing it). This means the majority of people will be making their money producing digital content, and spending it purchasing digital content. Already a sizeable portion of our income is spent on content (tv, dvd, games, books, magazines, ...). I see no reason why that trend shouldn't continue until we have a digital post-material economy.<p>And if we will have a digital economy, that means most people will be software users, producing content for others to buy.

As you might be aware Japan had a lost decade during the 90s. It experienced almost no growth of the GDP. There are many theories as to why, but the most convincing one is: The Japanese Baby Boomers retired during this decade. In fact the percentage of workers in the population (age 15-64) decreased by 5.6% during this time, as the number of retirees increased by 10.7%.  <a href=""http://goo.gl/kVZxB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/kVZxB</a><p>What does this have to do with anything?  / What happens when you have fewer people in the expected working age? \n2 things happen:<p><pre><code>  1. More people have to work\n  2. People have to work longer\n</code></pre>\nThe official retirement age for Japanese is 63/61 (M/W), the effective retirement age is 69.5/66.5 <a href=""http://goo.gl/s9slK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/s9slK</a> (very interesting graph)<p>My wife held a managerial position before our son was born, amongst her friends hardly any of them want to stay single, they simply dont have a choice. If they want to sustain their current life standard, marriage would be impossible. One man working has a hard time providing for his wife, kids, paying for a decent home & the mandatory elderly taxes. The taxes are almost 2000 USD per person / year, no matter if employed, or not. And those are just to pay for the pensions; insurances, social etc. come on top of that.<p>Many women still life / moved back in with their parents, even in their late 40es. It is not because they want to, or cannot find a partner (many of them look quite stunning). The pensions simply dont suffice and they feel obliged to support their parents. The same holds true for many men.<p>I very much disagree with the statement that women in Japan enjoy their single life so much, as they choose not to marry. I have yet to meet a Japanese woman, who will state this. Compared to Europe, where this kind of ideology is quite common.<p>Edit:<p>Japanese women are expected to do 90% of the housework, where as American women will only do 60% of the work. <a href=""http://goo.gl/qj64W"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/qj64W</a> This fact and the very big distance Japanese develop for their spouses are certainly not helping. <a href=""http://goo.gl/QlAfx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/QlAfx</a> Surprisingly no women I ever conversed with, complained about this lack of love between a married couple, on the contrary it is expected by the women.
