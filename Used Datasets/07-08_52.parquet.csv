But it could be a good way to <i>distract</i> the politicians that support SOPA/PIPA, at least so they don't think that what SOPA and PIPA are proposing is the only way to stop piracy. It could be useful if it creates confusion when voting for SOPA and PIPA, get them to vote against those bills, and then we can deal with the OPEN Act.<p>Darrell Issa seems to have a lot more common sense than the SOPA/PIPA sponsors, but after seeing how ITC can ban popular (HTC) products from the market over some trivial patents, I'm not confident that they will deal with the copyright issues in a sane way, either.",1324799945

5,3390676,comment,3390273.0,3390273.0,1,0,Mz,,,"I am reminded of discussions I have had on health lists about errors being made in US hospitals which can lead to patients dying. One of the things I noted: I think more mistakes get made where I work during crunch times, when more work is coming in than we can handle in a timely manner with only working regular hours, so we get pressured to work faster, put in overtime, etc.  Of course, no one is likely to die if someone in my department makes a mistake.  I've had a class on workplace hazards, eons ago.  Even at my job, where I work for a company with an excellent reputation as a fantastic place to work, people bitch about overtime, there is risk of winding up with carpal tunnel from doing your job, and so on.<p>I'm not saying there aren't real problems here, but a) almost everyone bitches about their job (and would bitch more if unemployed)and b) work will always entail health hazards (and not working is generally worse).  I do think there is room for improvement in these things and I don't want to discourage people from discussing that, but vilifying employers like this makes no sense to me.  Just like the factory workers take these awful jobs because it's better than the alternative (starvation and homelessness), the employers are also working within the constraints of real world limits.<p>At my job, we get asked to produce more during crunch times (and work overtime and all that) because a) turn around time impacts customer satisfaction, so not meeting the expected turn around time is a threat to the company health and welfare b) high demand is periodic/seasonal, so it does not make business sense to hire more people (hiring more people would hurt the bottom line, shorten turn around time further during non-peak times, thus raising customer expectation to this newer shorter turn around time, thus leaving the company in the same boat during certain seasons when demand is high but with increased overhead), c) when we get backed up, things snowball because more customers call in to complain about the turn around time, so rush requests and the like get sent over and so on which results in even more work and urgency and all that.  Ironically, rush requests take more time and slow down production even more and in many cases if they left us alone, they would get it about as fast because we would get more done generally but the customers neither know that nor care, they just want their own needs met.  The best way to deal with all this is try to keep things within the expected turn around time -- which means crunch times happen, like it or not, and it's not because the company is run by evil overlords or some crap.<p>I did write a proposal at work with intent to try to resolve some of the systemic issues and improve both company performance and the quality of the work experience for the people in production.  It got met with excited enthusiasm and then promptly butchered and bastardized into something unrelated to the analysis I wrote.  So if someone can come up with a better answer, a path forward to more humane conditions in these factories, and also find some means to effectively get the word out so people will, in fact, implement it, I am all for that.  It's easy to bitch and criticize.  It's hard to come up with real solutions that genuinely improve things -- which is exactly why the people running these factories aren't doing a better job of treating people more humanely and all that.  And even if you can do the analysis and come up with an idea with potential, you still face challenges in ""selling"" it, in getting the word out so it actually gets done.  Conversations like this tend to be long on vilifying people and short on exploring ""what would actually work to improve things?""  That never goes over all that well with me (not that anyone here is obligated to care what I feel about it, just sayin').",1324799517

Really the only thing it has going for it would be ""it's popular"", so it's likely that someone else also had error 0x8BADF00D and knew how to fix it. Hating aside, Windows being not open-source really hurts when you're trying to fix/debug something -- you can tail the error logs until the cows come home, but unless you're a Microsoft developer, it'll probably be pretty opaque (OSX is sometimes bad about this too -- ever have fun with KEXT bingo?)<p>The solution, obviously, is to just have a damn cache of these somewhere ELSE on the system (but not the registry, because the registry was one of the worst software ideas OF ALL TIME.

This creates a Zip file, with the unwanted addition of  a _macosx folder. According to this [1] article, the folder is used for thumbnails, cache data, and other meta data. I have seen these folders work their way into github repos, and I am reminded of their uselessness almost every time I open a zip archive. In the past it may have been justified (to reduce cpu load generating thumbnails and cache files while unzipping), but just like .DS_Store, the time has come to abolish these folders from zip archives.<p>[1] <a href=""http://floatingsun.net/2007/02/07/whats-with-__macosx-in-zip-files/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://floatingsun.net/2007/02/07/whats-with-__macosx-in-zip...</a>",1324796901

While the language certainly does offer some free choices, more often there are advantages and disadvantages to each, so that in any particular situation, some choices are better than others. Becoming an expert Lisp programmer requires learning about these tradeoffs, which takes experience and, usually, guidance from existing experts.</i><p>There is a saying 'perfection is the enemy of done.' In any particular situation, there is probably not a solution that is both optimally efficient and also optimally elegant. (This is true in any programming language). If you work towards that goal too much, you will likely miss your deadline.<p>But the point is, the little advantages and disadvantages don't matter until they do. There isn't going to be a big difference in most programs between using a loop to iterate a sequence, and using map nil with a lambda, and using do* (for example). In fact, whether there is any difference at all in the resultant assembly or byte code will depend entirely on the compiler implementation. It is a style thing... so try to be consistent, and work within what you are comfortable with.<p><i>That's true of any language, of course, but some of the facilities Lisp offers are rare among other languages, so that people coming to Lisp from some other language are unlikely to have experience with them.</i><p>Currently, the only thing I can really think of that is actually really <i>unique</i> is the macro facility (and that is only because, as soon as a language adopts the macro facility, it <i>becomes a lisp</i>.<p>As a programmer, the focus of my job is learning new things. I am basically a mechanism for translating the new things that I have learned into computer code. If I can't learn a few measly language features, what good am I going to be as a 'thing I just learned to computer' translator. And like I said, use what you are familiar with, until you are faced with something someone else wrote, or you have the time to learn new things. But don't punt.<p>If someone doesn't have experience with a given piece of the language that has been used, I expect them to pick up a book or online resource about it (and then, possibly most importantly, play with it). It is not hard, but it does take effort. There is nothing in common lisp that requires genius level intellect. (God knows, I'm certainly not that bright). No one requires that fresh-faced C interns be pointer arithmetic gods, but i'm sure they are expected to learn it if it is part of the job.<p><i>Oh, one point about macros in particular. If you have to resort to reading the implementation of a macro to understand what it does, the person who wrote it screwed up. Macros should always have documentation strings explaning their syntax and semantics. If you find yourself in that situation, the best thing to do is to go to the REPL and use `macroexpand' interactively to see the expansions of the macro calls you're interested in.</i><p>I'll add that in addition to doc strings for syntax and semantics, there should also be assertions written into the macro about the syntax and semantics. If I am passing a number or list where the macro is expecting a symbol, an error should get thrown during the macro-expansion phase. Macros are programs like anything else. Validating inputs and throwing an error at the earliest possible time is a good rule to go by.<p>So, macroexpand-1 is a good start, if the macro is implemented correctly, does what its documentation says, and you are simply flubbing the syntax. (Of course, it should be yelling at you for flubbing the syntax).<p>However, when there is a bug in a macro, the only thing that macroexpand-1 will tell you is that the macro doesn't work.  You'll macro-expand it and say 'yup that's the wrong generated code.' It doesn't really tell you anything about how to actually fix the macro unless you are already familiar with the macro's code. Having examples of inputs with bad outputs will aid in pinpointing the problem, but not unless I already understand how the program works.<p>Macros are lisp programs, and can be as complicated as any arbitrary lisp program. Writing a more complicated macro is not screwing up (I think this is an important distinction to make)... inadequately documenting, explaining, and bulletproofing it is. Someone might have to debug it later, so strive to write readable macro code. It isn't hard as you are just constructing lists and writing normal lisp code with minimal efficiency requirements.<p>So I guess that was a roundabout way of me saying ""I agree, mostly.""",1324796667
