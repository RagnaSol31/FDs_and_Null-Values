That interface understands Autoprotocol and executes the instructions accordingly.  Autoprotocol itself was designed to be an agreed upon standard for different types of laboratory automation (not just ours) to execute protocols.<p>An example of an experiment someone could run through our cloud laboratory interface would be to monitor the growth rate of bacteria expressing different genes.  This would be done using a protocol that contains some pipetting steps to dilute the bacteria and then alternates between incubating the plate at 37 degrees and reading OD600 of its wells using a plate reader at a specified interval for a certain number of repetitions.",1423639895.0

The rest of the submission and review process will remain unchanged, except that extensions will be automatically signed once they pass review.<p>> For other developers, this is a larger change. For testing development versions, they’ll have the same options available as AMO add-on developers. For release versions, however, we’re introducing the required step of uploading the extension file to AMO for signing. For most cases, this step will be automatic, but in cases where the extension doesn’t pass these tests, there will be the option to request a manual code review.<p>> In the case of developers who want their extensions to be side loaded (installed via an application installer rather than using the usual Web install method) the review bar will be higher, equal to fully reviewed add-ons on AMO (with the exception of AMO content restrictions). This is a convenient installation avenue for software that comes bundled with an extension, for example an antivirus application that includes a Firefox extension that interacts with it.",1423639216.0
