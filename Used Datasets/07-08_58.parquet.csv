Of <i>course</i> they make money, and <i>of course</i> they would continue producing work if copyright was only 20 years.<p>What you have to think about is the author who is <i>not</i> famous, but who makes his living off of selling books. Not the millionaires, the ones with a regular salary. They often sell old stories to short-story collections, for example, for a few thousand dollars. If this happens often enough, they can continue the life of book-writing. If not, we'll have less authors.<p>At the end of the day, if less money goes into writing books, we're going to lose some authors who <i>won't be able to afford writing.</i> Some great authors will also never be discovered, because they couldn't afford to keep writing for long enough.<p>It's a balance, and I'm not saying that the balance is right at the moment. But it's very disingenuous to say ""Disney will still make movies"", because they're not the only ones around.<p>Note: I talk about books, but the same is true for indie bands, indie software developers, etc.",1328773982.0

Don't forget, part of the point of the patent system is to encourage inventors to publicly document how their invention works so other people can use it (with licensing), instead of keeping it secret and possibly having the knowledge lost over time.<p>It seems to me that if someone can describe superficially what an invention does and you can build it on the spot, then it probably doesn't deserve a patent. For example, if you were to describe the appearance of an engine block to me, I wouldn't be able to replicate the combustion engine, and it's probably worth patenting. But if you tell me that the user clicks on one button to purchase an item without going through a checkout phase, I can easily replicate that without any knowledge of how it works.

Peace overtures were being felt out before Hrioshima, with the last being the Potsdam Declaration. This was rejected by Prime Minister Suzuki with the following statement...<p>""The only thing to do is just kill it with silence. We will do nothing but press on to the bitter end to bring about a successful completion of the war.""<p>Now consider the time that this is occurring. The armed forces of the Empire of Japan have, for four years (and for other nations like Britain, Holland, France and China, even sooner), showed that they will fight for every last scrap of land, and die trying. To be taken captive was a grave dishonour, while death in service to the Emporer, a shoulders highest achievement. Predictions for a conventional land invasion like Normandy were predicted to cost millions of allied troop lives, based on the experiences that they had witnessed first hand over the war.<p>Even when the first bomb was dropped, there was resistance to accept the terms provided, due to the belief that the United States could not have more then one atomic bomb. This was believed due to the difficulty of constructing one at the time from Japan's own research team. Even when Nagasaki was bombed, and the USSR invaded Manchuria days afterwards, there was resistance to accepting the Allies terms. 50% of the cabinet wanted the terms changed to allow Japan to disarm itself, and try it's own war criminals, and there to be no occupation of Japan. All of the cabinet demanded that the emperor's position not be touched. In fact, if the emperor's position of power could not been guaranteed, there was no opposition to continuing the war to the very end.<p>There's a lot of things that the United States, I mean Country A's, foreign policy can be lambasted for, especially as of late. But to revise history to fit a narrative is no better then those that gloss over the failings of the past when stating it was superior to today. To do so places your argument on a foundation of fine sand, ready to crumble the moment someone blows in facts that contradict your statements, like usaar has done in the statement below mine.",1328772218.0

75,3570140,story,,,1,0,unsafedrugs,Propulsid Lawsuit Settlement,http://www.unsafedrugs.com/2734/propulsid-lawsuit-settlement,"Johnson & Johnson has been showered by numerous lawsuits related to harmful side effects of Propulsid including heart problems such as heart arrhythmia and heart attack. Jury ruled in favor Johnson and Johnson in Louisiana in 2003, but several other cases were ruled against the pharmaceutical giant. Johnson and Johnson was asked to pay $100 million to ten claimants in a class action lawsuit in 2001.  Later an appeal was filed and finally the amount was reduced to  $48 million. This verdict has boosted morale of many a claimant.\nPropulsid is brand name for cisapride. It comes in both tablets and suspension. Propulsid contains Cisapride as main active ingredient. Propulsid or Cisapride is used for treatment of heartburn, which occurs due to gastric reflux. It regulates the acid level in esophagus. Cisapride increases the rate of digestion. It also increases bowel movements and strengthens the muscle between stomach and esophagus.<p>Use of Propulsid has been linked to many severe side effects. One of the most fatal side effects of this drug is heart problems including heart arrhythmia and heart attack. It has also linked to death in infants and children due to cardiac arrhythmia.<p>In 2004 Johnson & Johnson came with an offer of settlement of up to $90 million. The company tried to close all the federal lawsuits related to side effects of Cisapride through this settlement. In February, Johnson & Johnson offered between $69.5 million and $90 million to the plaintiffs for settlement of all federal Propulsid lawsuits. The final amount would be dependent on the number of plaintiffs agreeing to the terms of the settlement. It also agreed to provide up to $15 million for a fund. This fund would look after the settlement of class action lawsuits. It also became ready to provide up to $22.5 million for legal fees for the plaintiffs steering committee.<p>Propulsid was manufactured by Janssen pharmaceutical. Janssen is a subsidiary of well-known pharmaceutical giant Johnson and Johnson. It was approved by FDA in 1993. It contains Cisapride as its main active ingredient. Cisapride was discovered by Janssen in 1980. It stormed the market after its approval. It is prescribed for treatment of heartburn, which is a resultant of gastric reflux.<p>It became one of the most famous drugs for treatment of gastric reflux or acid reflux. Many patients suffered from severe heart arrhythmia while using this medicine. Many reports of death due to heart arrhythmia after use of Propulsid also surfaced. Janssen updated Propulsid label many times with added information related to its risks. But even then reports of severe side effects and deaths kept pouring in.<p>Even FDA announced about risk of heart arrhythmia after use of Propulsid in 2000. This led Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceutical, manufacturer of Propulsid, to recall this drug from the market voluntarily.<p>But in 2001 around 400 individuals filed lawsuit against Janssen related to sever side effects or death due to use of Propulsid. After recall of the drug Janssen made it available through an investigational limited access program. Through this program only those patients may get Propulsid who fulfill the eligibility criteria and fail to get any other treatment option. Even these patients get Propulsid as a last resort.\nFor more information visit http://www.unsafedrugs.com/2734/propulsid-lawsuit-settlement",1328771426.0

This is because you often end up with a slower site to the end user as you end up serving extra JS files (sometimes including jquery) not to mention noscript users etc.<p>I think the problem is that stuff that starts being pretty static can often end up getting slowly more dynamic and at some point you have to re-engineer it which becomes a pain so it's easier to plan around this from the start.<p>I took over a project which used static content to serve everything which included a lot of fwrite() PHP calls. As this got more complicated we ended up cache invalidation type issues where there was a hierachy of content that needed to be re-written back to various files every time something was changed on the site. \nThis meant that saving changes to the site became incredibly slow as we often erred on the safe side which meant we ended up re-writing some things multiple times, also the code that checked files to see which parts needed to regenerate became exponentially more complex.<p>In the end I just generated everything from the DB and used memcache in a few select places, performance for serving content was about the same as serving the static files, the code was much cleaner (which helped make performance better in the long run) and usability from the content administrators POV was much improved.<p>You should always aim to be serving your most common content directly from RAM anyway, so whether this is from the kernel's pagecache or memcache doesn't matter so much, you can probably solve this problem using clever proxying too.",1328771235.0

It's less about making mistakes and more about developer greed. They could have md5'd the email addresses before sending them or used any number of simple to implement techniques that would still have retained the original feature. Stop telling us it was a mistake! This was a premeditated privacy breach, 1st degree. They decided to hedge their bets and profit from their users by blatant disregard for their own users privacy -- the user's why they have a job and VC in the first place. In the end all this is just going to reduce the user experience with unnecessary confirmation dialogs and prompts because a few lousy startups couldn't keep it in their pants.
