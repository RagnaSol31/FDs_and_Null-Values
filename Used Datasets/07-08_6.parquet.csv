2,184304,comment,183846.0,183846.0,0,0,mattjung,,,I don't see a contradiction between social and useful. Social networks are not per se useful. But social networking features may boost the usefulness of an application. See Flickr or Delicious as very prominent examples.,1210233423

What I'd like to see is more incentive and recognition to those who push boundaries, whether it's in what the application does or how it was built.  Like someone said earlier, many of those apps exist, but they get buried in the hype that social networks, etc get these days.",1210232020

The better your prospects get the more she is likely to feel screwed. And the worse they get, the less motivating the prospect of continuing seems.<p>Any scaling equity package should be linked to dates and performance goals. You basically said you didn't want her to own the company unless it succeeded, when success was contingent on her.<p>Sounds like she trusted you. Then stopped trusting you. Then left a few months later. You screwed up. Go apologize.",1210231800

Talk to your parents, your friends, your friends' parents, your parents' friends, and anyone else who you can sit down with for 30 minutes. That should be plenty of time to listen to someone complain about their problems, and from that you should be able to make a list of possible business ideas. Then all you have to do is research them and figure out which one, if any, are viable.",1210231238
23,184283,comment,183535.0,183535.0,0,0,anerkie33,,,"I see a couple of mistakes right off the bat.<p>Write the contract so that no ownership interest is achieved until a Series A funding event.  For every hour that the technician works, they accrue the same hourly rate figure in an options account.  This way when the startup is funded, the developer's percentage is determined by the value of their options account against the VC's valuation, not some arbitrary point like 6%  It's much harder for someone to walk away from $100,000 in equity than it is a theoretical 6%<p>Should have included a clause whereby the equity would disappear if the developer quits.<p>35% is rather outrageous for any founder in a company that has raised significant amounts of funding, let alone a well paid one.<p>To echo other comments, 12 months to create a prototype in Django seems like a <i>very</i> long time.  Either the developer <i>sucked</i> or was working on other projects on the side.  It is also possible that the requirements kept changing mid-flight and this was a management problem.<p>Outsourcing to India may work or it may not.  Regardless, at this point you need to pay based on results instead of time.<p>Good luck.",1210231181
