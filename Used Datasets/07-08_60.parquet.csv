I've run several marathons and ultras and have done quite a bit of experimenting on my body over the years. I managed to borrow a copy of this book tonight and pounded through quite a bit of it.<p>From what I read, it's actually 4 weeks of bone/muscle/ligament conditioning, followed by 12 weeks of running training -- IF you can run a 5K at an 8:00 pace or faster. If you can't, then yep, you guessed it, more training time.<p>This is doable and pretty much falls in line with conventional training (though Tim reorganizes it a little bit, and throws in the all important and generally under-emphasized benefits of cross-training), but it isn't ""in 12 weeks"" at all.<p>I've done quite a bit of iterative experimenting with cross-training (especially cycling and swimming) and it unilaterally improved my running speeds and my long run recovery times.<p>His graphs and charts seem rather superfluous to me. Meant to intimidate rather than inform.<p>I'm not so concerned about permanent damage because of the initial 4 week conditioning process. If you're not already a seasoned runner, this program will take you as long or longer as Galloway or Joe Henderson's training plans.<p>His advice and data are solid, but don't meet his ""in 12 weeks"" mark.

Though I feel in the minds of a lot of people ""something that are you are"" is more likely to be fair game for rumor and ridicule than ""something (especially a trauma) that has happened to you.""
