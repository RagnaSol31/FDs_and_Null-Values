Is it a cow or is it not a cow.""  Again, why can't it be both.  At that moment in time, given the context of a farmer, it's a cow because he believes it <i>and</i> it's not a cow because it's just a painting of one.<p>I also think this need to shove everything into a boolean algebra problem is why most software is difficult.

[...] As you'd expect, the cheap make isn't limited to the surrounding parts of the tablet -- the plastic displays on the 70 and 101 suffer from the same issues. We weren't expecting Gorilla Glass quality here, but both of them are flimsy and when pressed firmly, they start to cave in quite a bit. [...] vertical viewing angles are incredibly bad. Tilting the screens slightly off axis to about 30-degrees caused a ton of color distortion, and if you happen to be standing above the displays while they are propped up on the kickstands, it's nearly impossible to see what is on screen. [...] The VGA cameras on both tablets are incredibly sluggish, and when we finally were able to snap some stills, they came out blurry and grainy. Similarly, when we shot some video, the footage was very choppy and the audio wasn't in sync with the video at all.""</i><p><a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/24/archos-70-and-101-internet-tablet-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/24/archos-70-and-101-interne...</a>",1297063665.0

He took a group activism site that basically couldn't make anything and turned it into the fastest growing company in the history of the world. They turned down a $6 billion offer and paid for all these superbowl ads.<p>The real irony here is people's principles don't actually matter. People can't help themselves and will take saving $15 on a dinner millions of times over rather than offering it up to any of their principles or supposedly lofty morals. Mason discovered the real secret here which is it doesn't matter which moral road you're on people can't help themselves.<p>The reason people think these are crass is that they can't deal with the realization of their own moral corruption and hypocrisy.
