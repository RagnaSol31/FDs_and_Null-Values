But making sure the most common cases you are going to be using it for, e.g. appointments/reminders, searching for specific things, finding a nearby hotel etc. work reliably no matter in what way you phrase it, is the part that makes it really useful. Also consider how you can make sure this works as expected by using all the context available onm a modern smartphone (location/movement, weather, calendar, emergency information, congestion) If Apple does the polishing work for that to work it will be a huge success.

If you would give Transformers 2 a 5-star rewatchability rating, you should be giving it at least 3 or 4 stars for quality, because obviously you enjoyed it very much.  Instead, many people pretend to be film critics, whose jobs are very different, and assign an 'objective rating'.  A film critic can not give personal opinions because he's supposed to speak for the masses--to appeal to some higher taste he aspires to have and that he hopes society would have.  If you loved Transformers, rate it 5 stars--period.  The rating isn't meant to be read by others, it's not meant to appeal to an idealized world, it's just how you felt about the thing.  Convince your users to rate intelligently with that mindset and you'll start to see good data.<p>All that said, more data is better than less, and if you could convince your users to double their average rating-time investment and give you ratings for both, awesome.  I'm skeptical that users would bother to rate two metrics for everything they've seen...but I think it's certainly possible they would.  Be interested to see.",1317973518

So where<p><pre><code>    foldl (+) 0 [1..10]\n</code></pre>\nwould output 55,<p><pre><code>    scanl (+) 0 [1..10]\n</code></pre>\nwould output [0,1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55].<p>(1 :) means prepend a 1 to the list it is given. The function that is passed as an argument to fix therefore returns a 1 followed by the successive summation values of its argument.<p>fix just infinitely applies its argument to itself, i.e.<p><pre><code>    fix f = f (fix f)\n</code></pre>\nIn any strict language this would ofcourse just result in an infinite loop, but fortunately Haskell has lazy evaluation. So if we evaluate the list, for example with<p><pre><code>    take 5 fibs\n</code></pre>\nthe following happens:<p>Haskell wants the first list element. The first element of (1 :) . scanl (+) 1 is 1, so there's no need to evaluate the scanl part yet. Now we need the second element. scanl first returns its accumulator, so that's another 1. For the third list element scanl needs the first element of its argument for the addition, so now we get to the recursive application. As before, the first element of (1 :) . scanl (+) 1 is 1, so the next element is 1 + 1 = 2. This 2 is then added to the next element, which is another 1, resulting in 3. Finally, we add 3 to the third element, giving 5. We now have five elements, which is what we requested, so the result will be [1,1,2,3,5].<p>I hope this helped a little.

The more people the closer taste match you will get (goes without saying).<p>I also don't see the point of giving ""quality"" scores. I really don't care if a stranger thinks some movie was of high or low quality. I'd much rather know if my taste-twin loved it or hated it. I for example thought Lord of the Rings was super well done and yet super boring. But this opinion of mine only matters to someone who resembles me in movie taste, who hates and loves the same quirky things as I do about movies. And of the two opinions i mentioned (well done, boring) its really only the latter that matters to my twin, he/she should pay most attention to that when deciding if to go and see the Lord, not if I thought the movie was of high or low quality.<p>But having said that, I like ""rewatchability"" as a concept to study further. I too would rip of my nails before seeing Black Swan again but I still thought it was a masterpiece. However, I have seen Requim for a Dream (Darren's Arrenovsky's previous movie) again and again although it was also very emotionally intense like the Swan. Just in a different way, less depressive, but killer strong in an exhaustive yet positive way. And then.. yet and still.. I would recommend both movies to everyone I meet. I think both are a must see even though one of them I would never want to see again.",1317972150

Nobody reads them except lawyers. Our engineers are told <i>not</i> to read them, because then we would pay more damages. We are probably infringing on dozens of patents every time we flush a toilet, let alone release a new product, but so is everyone else. We just pay the lawyers to keep other lawyers off our tail, and hope for the best. Business still goes on, but the same is true in North Korea - it's in spite of government regulations, not because of them"".<p>Imagine then, you get sued by a competitor for infringing on their patent. In response, you threaten to sue them back, for some of their inevitable infringements on your patents. You can bet that your statement will be paraded around in front of the judge in <i>both</i> cases, as evidence that your patent is bullshit, and evidence that you were willfully infringing.<p>I'm not saying all patents are bad. Drugs need patents, so they can pay for the huge costs of testing them to comply with the FDA, and you need this process to stop companies selling dangerous quack medicine (or just stuff that hasn't been tested properly). OK, there are some elements of the drug approval process that are a little broken, but you don't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

I don't think that's a sensible critique. Apple undoubtedly considered the hand-size issue when choosing the iPhone's screen size.<p>Clearly Apple's only goal wasn't to release a phone that everyone could comfortably operate. But consideration of hand sizes was undoubtedly a spec, to be balanced against other specs. The engineers probably got some ultimatum along the lines of: ""we're only going to have one basic model, to maximize our margin, so figure out the screen size that hits the greatest number of target customers.""<p>The iPhone is a reasonable size for people ranging from teenage girls to guys with pretty large hands. Probably too big for people with child-like hands, and too small for the big guys with massive paws, but very likely hits 90% of the potential market. I don't think the 4.3"" Android phones hit the same sweet spot. My girlfriend probably couldn't operate one comfortably with one hand.

This is because of the presumption of innocence.<p>When a murderer enters a courtroom, he's the <i>defendant</i> because he is presumed innocent.  If the jury returns a guilty verdict, he becomes an <i>offender</i>, and the roles switch back. Following the verdict, it would be justified to view the prosecution as having defended society against the murderer who committed the offense.  Prior to the verdict, the jury agrees to see things the other way around.<p>Likewise, Apple brings suit because, in its view, its patents should defend their innovations against copying.  Again, because of the presumption of innocence, Samsung (or whoever) plays the role of defendant until a verdict is returned. Should Apple win their suit, then (under law) Samsung will be viewed as the offender, and Apple will have successfully defended itself against unlawful copying.<p>Which is a long way of saying that, if you believe that Samsung has unlawfully copied Apple's innovations, then it's entirely correct to view Apple as the defensive party in this patent mess.",1317970810
