Can you imagine how big emscripten output would be?<p>I have been arguing that dart2js could have been using hand-written JIT compiler on the client side, but the startup performance compared to AOT would really be a big deal. I think a combination of AOT and JIT would be the best, but sadly it is also true that JavaScript lacks right level of abstraction. It is either too low-level (typed arrays, hand rolled allocations etc) or too high-level.",1402300588.0

If any of you have developed with the Kinect, (i spent a year on it 2 years ago) it is pretty impressive for a not too expensive piece of hardware.<p>I think MSFT is doing it right by really working on it, as we all are aware they have had their share of flops.<p>Putting out a great product specially like kinect is pretty exciting. Oculus is cool but its FB buyout puts it in a strange place and it was years out anyway from general adoption. The kinect is much simpler and cheaper and has already been out on the market which, gives it some validation. Plus, I am not sure how many people will go through the trouble of putting on goggles in wide range adoption. That being said I think simpler devices like the kinect have more mass market appeal, and thus the adoption of devices like kinect will ultimately be instrumental in the success of more complex interfaces like Oculus, etc...",1402300511.0

In this case, with a federal structure, Catalonia would like to be one of the states of that federation. If you look at the United States of America, you will realise that, with a population of about 300 million people, they have 50 states. The European union, with more than 500 million people, could have more than 60 or 70, or maybe 75 states. And why couldn’t Catalonia be one of these states, in a federal structure and with the powers of a state which belongs to a federal structure? So, with less powers than an independent country but more powers than we have today.
