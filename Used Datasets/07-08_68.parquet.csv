24,2986223,comment,2984091.0,2984091.0,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"When set up and used properly, TFS is a decent source control / bug tracking system, especially if you use Visual Studio for day to day development.<p>The problems with TFS come from a few areas. First, it's easy to set it up in some sub-optimal configuration, by putting it on insufficient hardware, for example. There's a very real and very high cost to doing that aspect right, of course. Second, if you're doing development with a small team and a limited number of branches, TFS is probably overkill, and the way the tradeoffs are balanced for TFS is probably way off from the actual tradeoffs your team needs. Third, if writing code in the VS IDE isn't the norm then you might be going against the TFS grain enough to cause serious pain. Fourth, if you don't use the bug/work item tracking parts of TFS then it'll have less value to you, obviously.<p>Finally, the biggest problem with TFS is the competition. People apply the label ""distributed version control systems"" to Mercurial and Git but that hides the important aspect that these systems are not <i>just</i> capable of decentralization but they are also extremely fully featured and highly advanced modern VCSes. If you are deciding ab initio which VCS to use it'd be silly to not choose Hg or Git for almost any project. They are free, there is tons of support, they are scalable, and they are extremely good.",1315813809
