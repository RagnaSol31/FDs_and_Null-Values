6,138780,comment,138508.0,138757.0,0,0,1gor,,,">Without a central bank, how is the money supply controlled?<p>By natural business cycle of economic expansion/ contraction. Cost of money fluctuates, when it goes up there are recessions that clear up the inefficiencies (i.e. all businesses that produce return below required market rate go bust). That's what lacking today thanks to central banks' intervention. They postpone the cleansing as much as possible, until the disbalances grow up in such a monster as we see today.<p>The problem of course is that people don't like even mild recessions and politicians are following them. The Fed system was setup in 1913 after the population was fed up with regular boom/busts of late 1800s/early 1900s.",1205739726.0

The potential for early revenue with real customers (i.e. not ads) will be more attractive.<p>I think it's unfortunate. Capital intensive start-ups will be at an even bigger disadvantage.. in this case, I would agree with andreessen: raise as much as possible. I've always believed in creating value before you capture any, and that will be more difficult if you have to focus on your business model early on.",1205739668.0

20,138765,comment,138748.0,138748.0,0,0,cperciva,,,"Standard economic theory states that during financial crises, investors exhibit a ""flight from risk"" behaviour; certainly, one can imagine institutional investors pulling their money out of hedge and venture capital funds.  However, this crisis also has the US Federal Reserve aggressively cutting interest rates, with the effect that capital becomes cheaper, given a fixed risk premium.<p>My guess is that venture capital will become harder to find, while companies which are profitable but need capital in order to grow (e.g., to buy more servers) will find that loans are cheaper.  Seed funding probably won't be affected at all -- money for that generally comes from people who believe in what they're doing (and are seeking, in part, a non-financial payoff) rather than people or organizations which are trying to maximize their profits.",1205738907.0

Central banks are strictly in the business of monetary policy.<p>Secondly, most western central banks (though not the Fed) explicitly concentrate on inflation targeting, not ""priming the pump"" (as Keynes would say). In fact Keynes wasn't really very interested in inflation, which is fair enough given that economists didn't seem to take it all that seriously until the stagflation events of the 70s.<p>But having said that, I'm more inclined to agree with you than the grandparent.
