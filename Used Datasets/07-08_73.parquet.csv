I agree that the rules of engagement were followed, but I don't believe permission to fire would have been granted if the guys in the helicopter hadn't been so scared and hadn't embellished their account of the people on the ground.<p>Are you claiming that the film was propaganda because we were shown that there were children killed?  Or because we were told that those children were not given access to top quality medical care after they ended up accidental casualties?<p>If it's propaganda to include such information, then it's surely propaganda to omit it, which is what the US did by classifying it.<p>As for the leaked information putting lives at risk, Wikileaks offered to let the US Government redact any information it saw fit to.  This offer was refused.<p>It seems odd that a government that negotiates with thugs, warlords, torturers, criminals, etc., all over the world, and let that one guy flee with $42M in US cash, will ceremoniously refuse to ""negotiate"" in a way that would have removed any chance that the leaks would have caused ANY harm whatsoever.<p>This is at best hypocritical and at worst stupid.  I should be honest it irritates me to hear anyone say ""we don't negotiate with terrorists"" because so much of what the US does is identical to terrorism -- dropping bombs from very high altitudes into the middle of civilian areas, etc.<p>The realization I've made after reading the leaks is that the US is a propaganda state every bit as much as North Korea.  The only thing we have in our favor is a far more favorable mix of natural resources, etc, so we simply had to deal with $5/gallon gas instead of being called upon to make tea out of pine needles by our illustrious leader.<p>There's an easy way to avoid ambushes:  Send the troops home.  The only rationale for staying is to essentially convert the territories into the 51st and 52nd US states.  Already we've tolerated ethnic cleansing, etc., and things are far worse under US rule than they were under Saddam or the Taliban.  We need to be honest with ourselves about this and decide if we really want two more states at the expense of so many indigenous lives.  We should not be pretending that we can wage <i>sterile</i> war with <i>smart</i> bombs and that we're fighting against evil.  We're simply taking valuable land.  It's neither sterile or smart.<p>On balance the US has caused far more suffering in the past decade than the Taliban, and perhaps the leaks will allow the public to realize what is going on and call for it to stop.  So maybe you're right, maybe Manning would emerge a folk hero, reveal one or two more key tidbits, and run for office himself from behind bars.<p>My favorite line from Sun Tzu is where he describes how a strong nation has children playing along its borders and a weak nation has soldiers lined up.  Ever since George W. Bush took office we've been acting like a weak nation.<p>Sure the leaks were embarrassing.  So fix the major security holes in military IT systems, apologize to the allies that were embarrassed, and move on.",1292485105.0

36,2011387,comment,2011145.0,2011145.0,0,0,erikb,,,"Writing code is also very important and should be taught in CS school. As stupid as it sounds, but the best way might be in the middle. Giving tasks to create code and also giving task to reuse and change code. That is how our teachers try to teach us and I feel acceptably comfortable in both situations, writing a new program as well as moving around in other peoples code.<p>One thing I want to add: The really bad thing about these ""reusing"" students is, that they have no skill to see which code to reuse. Most code you find with google is just duct taped itself. And trying to solve any problem with ducttaping an already ducttaped monster is ridiculous. What I saw in my undergrad classes from my classmates was so bad to read and use, that I decided for myself to write a lot by myself and don't rely on others. That got so far, that in one project I wrote my own linked list instead of using the Java's basic one. Of course that is a little too far, but makes for a small, funny story. I'm still not a really big fan of reusage, because design and engineering is something that is treated to lighthearted by many many coders out there.

37,2011386,comment,2011145.0,2011295.0,0,0,alanfalcon,,,"The article posits that the question of cheating isn't a matter of catching or punishing the students.  It's a matter of creating engaging learning experiences and treating students as the teacher's customers.  A student will only get from a class what they want to get out of it; seek a grade at any cost and you'll find a way to earn it, seek to learn at any cost and you'll come away better off (and likely with a good grade to boot.)<p>So the way I see it, a teacher does have two options: (1) try to force students to learn by trying to make ""learning"" the only way to earn a better grade, or (2) try to encourage students to learn by trying to make ""learning"" feel like the rewarding experience it should be.  Note that neither of these approaches involves catching or punishing students, nor does it involve forcing students to learn in order to achieve a better grade.

We had a small collection of world-class teaching professors, and each time a new assignment was introduced, there were always problems. Some starter code didn't work for students A-E. Or a requirement was so ambiguous that solutions varied in a material way.<p>Like everything else, writing a really excellent assignment is an iterative process. After two or three offerings, you finally have something your users (ie, students) really value: an assignment that teaches well.<p>And to be honest, the presence of cheating on programming assignments never made any sense to me. It's so simple to detect plagiarism: you have the source right there (and a database of all previous submissions). I really do think that CS stands out among the classes for plagiarism because of how much easier it is to spot rather than an unusual incident rate.",1292482831.0
