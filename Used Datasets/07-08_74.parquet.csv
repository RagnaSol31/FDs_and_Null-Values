A anti-shoplifter system would thus have to have several safety features in order to not turn into a no-fly list.<p>How would that system work in a fair society government by law? Would suspects not found guilty in a court of law be there? How should false positives, that is people who the computer incorrectly predict as someone else, get a chance to clear their name (face) and get compensation when it happens? Should criminals that have served their time still be locked-out for-life and denied entry to stores that share the system?<p>Like vigilantes, I have a hard time seeing a way which such system can be created without massive abuse. Let assume that 1% of scanned people will be false positives, and say 5% of records will be falsely added by clerks (they are not trained to be cops or judges, and some will abuse the system to intentional hurt people they know).
