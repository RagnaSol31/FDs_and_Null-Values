So it will be something like ~99.9% of their tests are done on traditional devices. So we can safely assume that those tests are as reliable as those from other labs.<p>So if they are same as any other legacy industry for 99.9% of the time, then why such a big valuation?<p>They should be valued same as their nearest rival (which I’m sure is a giant compared to Theranos), and if adjusted for the fact that whether Theranos is going to upset them without any secret sauce (and with fewer resources) then the valuation should be near to $0.",1446019170.0
