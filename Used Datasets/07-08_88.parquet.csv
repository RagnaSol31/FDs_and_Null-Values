I think most Haskell libraries define far more elegant abstractions than their Java counterparts.<p>However, as a user of both Haskell and the JVM, there are some things to be said for the Java library ecosystem. For instance, the most widely-used Java libraries are often more mature, maintained better (usually because its authors are paid to do so), and more API-stable (for most of my Haskell code, a dependency version bump usually implies updating my own code). Of course, this is all reasonable, since the Haskell ecosystem exploded far more recently than Java&",
