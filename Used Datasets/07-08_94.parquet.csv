The question is, why? Perhaps it's because it is so much more difficult to understand. When a dam breaks or when parts of an oil refinery explode, the result may be catastrophic but at least we can understand what is happening, on an intuitive level. When something goes wrong with a nuclear reactor, it is so far removed from anything in our everyday world that it's difficult to understand on that same intuitive level. If something is on fire then we can see and hear it and we can use our experiences of other things being on fire to understand it. If something is radioactive then neither of the above apply.<p>So perhaps there is something about nuclear that makes it uniquely frightening (even if those fears are irrational).

They think in features and whether something is ""visible for the customer"" (if it isn't, then it might as well not exist).<p>Such an attitude can lead you to having to make a decision when implementing a feature: ""Oh - this code here is really shitty. I could now a) clean this up and cleanly add the feature or b) just hack the feature in somehow, maybe breaking encapsulation a bit more""<p>Bosses and people concerned about their free time think b), I tend to think a).<p>The problem with b) is that you get to your goal much more quickly (which the feature-oriented people like as it makes you seem more productive), but you are incurring dept. Now the bad code just got worse until at one point, something really breaks badly and then you WILL have to pay the price for cleaning up. This might very well be at a time where you are pressed by some deadline which means a lot of after-hours work for you.<p>Then again, in a team, the might or might not be you that has to clean up (you certainly hope it isn't you).<p>So doing it the quick route isn't just irresponsible to the project, it's also irresponsible to your team mates because they might be the unlucky ones the bad code breaks over.<p>So if possible, try to take those extra hours to do it the clean way.

That's INSTALL Makefile.in aclocal.m4 compile config.guess config.h.in config.sub configure depcomp install-sh ltmain.sh missing mkinstalldirs.<p>This is a matter of opinion. When you have dependencies which rely on specialist tools, it is a good idea (and accepted practice, though this obviously could be argued), to commit your generated files too. This means that the files don't change depending on the version of autoconf/bison/etc that's installed on a user's machine.<p>As I recall, years ago some folks wrote up all these ""version control best practices"" for some conference, and this was one of the ""rules"".
