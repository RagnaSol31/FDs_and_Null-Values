56,8211206,comment,8208386.0,8210478.0,2,0,Erwin,,,"PostgreSQL use a &quot;top-N sort heapsort&quot; for this. You can see that in effect when doing &quot;EXPLAIN ANALYZE&quot; on a query like this. Without an index you cannot avoid a full table scan. However the top-N heapsort avoids allocating memory for ALL the rows, since you only care about the first 5 ones<p>For example, I had a 6 million entry table sitting around, and asked for top 5 rows by an unindexed column. With LIMIT 5 applied it told me:<p><pre><code>          Sort Method: top-N heapsort  Memory: 95kB</code></pre>\nWithout:<p><pre><code>           Sort Method: quicksort  Memory: 577595kB\n</code></pre>\nSo if Postgres had to store all the 6 million rows sorted it would need 577 MB of work memory. If (see SHOW work_mem) it was below that that would lead to it writing a lot of temporary files to disk:<p><pre><code>           Sort Method: external merge  Disk: 144072kB\n</code></pre>\nNote how Postgres is more wasteful with memory usage than disk writes for temp storage.<p>Generally a query that requires you to do a full table scan on a large table should be used sparingly however.",1408692537.0
