It isn't that they aren't important, but people tend to place faaaaaaar too high a value on drive layout for winter driving.<p>Now, on the track, it makes a BIG difference. In the snow, however, your goal is safety... not competitive times.",1230368193.0

Feeling that you're just cloning a succesful website without adding your own touch is just not as motivating (at least for me).<p>I'm a bit in this situation currently since I had an idea for a product that I really wanted to do, but by the time I quit my job to work on it, someone else had the same idea and implemented it for the american market... So, I let the idea by the wayside for a while but recently I decided to implement it for another market... So in a way I'm cloning someone's website (same base idea) without cloning since I originally wanted to do exactly such a website...",1230367541.0

Maybe not many of them, but my new business is based on one of them and it wasn't that hard to find.<p>The European company mine is modeled after is not doing well because they've made a fatal flaw in their implementation that's preventing their growth, and it seems their management doesn't recognize this, but other than this simple issue their business concept is sound, and when they eventually recognize this issue I'm sure they will do well.<p>But I'm American and I want to bring the same service to the USA so I'm proceeding with a slightly modified version -- one that will actually work well in the USA.  I see nothing wrong with this whatsoever, it's a simple task of bringing a good service to places where the originator cannot or will not.",1230365060.0
