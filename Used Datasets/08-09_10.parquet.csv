You might have 20% good ideas, 20% toss-outs to the PACs that elected you, 20% earmarks, 20% total crap, and 20% unknown.<p>Is a bill like that worth voting for? You can pitch it as solving a huge problem, being an indication of rampant corruption, making progress in a key social or political movement, being a vehicle for bringing money to your state, or being a terrible mistake. Fact is, it could be all of these. Then congressmen can use legislative tricks to both vote for and against the same bill, effectively rendering any kind of simple debate meaningless. Which is the exact reason why it's constructed the way it is.<p>I think in terms of startups, this is the worst bill I've seen in years. And while I'm sure professional Angel organizations are all on top of the changes and such, we need to be moving in the exact opposite direction than this bill is taking us. I think real reform is needed, but I am deeply worried that the underlying theory here -- that market risk can be managed by committee or legislation -- is deeply flawed. Adding to that structural problem I have is all of these other really bad tack-ons, like giving the FDA more control over the vitamin and supplement business.<p>Bad. Bad. Bad.",1273741096.0

That's what idealized economic theory would predict, but large corporations' internal structure is quite far from idealized economic theory. My guess would be that if you were able to set up some experiment where one employee cost $100k while somehow having $0 payroll taxes, while another employee cost $90k plus $10k in payroll taxes, the employer would, more often than not, hire the $90k employee.<p>This happens already, I believe, as regards families. Employees with families cost more in health-insurance benefits than single employees, if the employer offers to subsidize a percentage of health insurance (as most do). But employers don't pay single employees of equal qualifications commensurately more, despite what economics would predict.",1273738681.0
