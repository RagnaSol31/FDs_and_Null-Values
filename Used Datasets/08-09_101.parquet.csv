Like bright red. When you first paint yellow, let it dry and paint red over it (transparent) you will get some sort of light bending which makes the red brighter. Car painters do this all the time.<p>But the author is right in a way. By creating contrast you can paint black darker then your paint is. It's all about what's going on in the mind.",1296637081

But it gives an hint about what kind of data is available from the <i>""log files from a commercial Web browser""</i>.<p>> Targeting Google specifically is quite different than using lots of clicks from different places.<p>From the article, they have handcrafted rules for both Google and Yahoo, that together with Bing have (I think) the 95% of the market. I'd say they are not targeting Google, they are targeting the majority search engine users. There just happen to be only 3 major search engines, so a few handcrafted regexes are sufficient.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if Google Maps has handcrafted (or manually tuned) scraping code to extract reviews from Yelp and other major review sites, and same for Google News for the extraction of the news body from the major online news sources. How is this different?<p>> It looks like you work at Microsoft--can you say any more about this?<p>Yeah, I should have been more clear about this. I am interning at MSR and have some involvement with Bing (and actually worked there last year), but my comments are personal and about facts that are public.<p>BTW, IMHO using the click logs can't be considered ""copying"", more like ""a way to discover new sites to crawl and the keywords that lead to them"". This is not copying the SERP results.<p>Since it ""looks like"" you work at Google :) can you answer this question (it was also asked here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2165963"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2165963</a>)?

It is inherent in the search business that you're collaging material from elsewhere. And for certain heavily-qualified searches – long-tail, few mentions, hapax legomenon/'googlewhack' – a single source is likely to stick out.<p>Google is unavoidably a giant signal-source on the web. Even if Microsoft instead sent unique keywords to contract writers to build out findable summary/directory web pages one-by-one, what would those writers do? Research via other search engines, starting with Google, and be heavily influenced by the few (or top) results they found, highlighting the same sites. So your results would still percolate outward, via a slower, more expensive, more manual process. (Would that process, laundered through time and multiple agents, meet your ethical standards?)<p>Such is the nature of Google's position today. As Rich Skrenta of Blekko has put it: ""The net isn't a directed graph. It's not a tree. It's a single point labeled G connected to 10 billion destination pages.""<p>A little of Google's proprietary wisdom is leaking back out. The amount seems small compared to all the freely-offered info Google sucked in to create that wisdom. And, the proprietary wisdom is leaking back out via the same sort of bulk, automated mining of implicitly expressed preferences that for which Google itself is famous. So to me this seems more like karmic balance than an ethical transgression against Google.",1296636537

Lets further assume that there are M slots (or squares where numbers are placed). Suppose M is about 3*N.\nSo, on average, you'd expect each number to occur 3 times.\nIf you see that number occur only once in the (visible) column on the right, then you are pretty sure that it'll occur at least once or twice in the (hidden) column on the left. So if you see 3 numbers in a row (or column) that each occur only once in the right hand side, then you can be fairly certain that they'll occur at least once in the left side; so you're pretty sure to win the prize.<p>All you need is some basic knowledge of statistics, uniform distribution, etc. I don't see a need for high-falutin' cryptographic analysis and higher order math.<p>If you're dealing with online stuff, then some knowledge of PRNGs can help. I remember (a long time ago) hearing about some online poker algorithm which was just calling rand(), and had been seeded with unix time.
