Error handling is a tricky thing that needs thought to get right and should be expressed clearly in the code. My only complaint is that `if e != nil { return e }` takes 3 lines of code. Could `gofmt` format that into one line with no line breaking, I am already pretty happy. If they could add a keyword like `ereturn` that only returns when the last parameter (must be error) is not nil, just as an alias, I would be totally satisfied.",1421139410.0
