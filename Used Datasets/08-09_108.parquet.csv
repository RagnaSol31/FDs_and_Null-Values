The whole unit is natural and is based on things that make sense on such distances. This is same for all natural units; they grew up from usage. (This resulted in things that appears illogical, like having different with similar name for different applications, but this is only appearance. We measure water differently from oil or precious drugs and differently when we cook with water or build a dam, so it makes all the sense to have different units for different purposes.)<p>Meters, however, have a different story; the meter was invented by some French scientist about the time they were changing everything after the revolution, including month names; somehow month names reverted back to normal, but meters stayed. The meter was initially defined as 1/40,000,000 of the length of a meridian. Here only the length of the meridian is natural to some extent, although I fail to see how it is relevant to what is normally measured with meters, and the constant is completely artificial.",1418804644.0

Jefferson suggested a decimal system based off the seconds pendulum at 45° latitude. He did this in coordination with scientists in France with the direct goal of achieving a universal standard. Before congress could adopt this system, the French modified their standard:<p><i>Although French scientists working on a decimal system had originally supported using the seconds pendulum as a scientific basis, and Jefferson had deliberately matched his seconds pendulum proposal to the French one, based on a measurement at the latitude of Paris, the French decided to use the length of a meridian of the Earth instead of a seconds pendulum. This and other developments changed what had promised to be an internationally developed system into a strictly French project. Jefferson wrote, &quot;The element of measure adopted by the National Assembly excludes, ipso facto, every nation on earth from a communion of measurement with them.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_for_Establishing_Uniformity_in_the_Coinage,_Weights,_and_Measures_of_the_United_States",
