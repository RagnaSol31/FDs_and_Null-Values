This can lead to relatively small total application size and deployments that do not require any knowledge of java and java world from end user.

19,4125582,comment,4125198.0,4125452.0,37,0,loup-vaillant,,,"Let's take an example, since they seem to work best: vaccines.<p>Vaccines protect you from the risk of contracting particular diseases, some of which are crippling, lethal, or incurable.  Plus, most are extremely effective: once you take your shots, you are effectively immune. That's good.<p>There is a downside however.  Sometimes, vaccines have side effects.  Most side effects are quite benign, but if you're unlucky enough, they can be crippling, lethal, or incurable.  That's bad.<p>From a medical point of view, vaccines are a net good (let's leave aside logistic considerations, or the effort required to go to the doctor).  When you look at the stats, you stand a much better chance at life and health if you take the shot.  Even for relatively minor illnesses like the flu.<p>Now, let's say someone post a heartbreaking comment about how her 9 year old daughter died of a vaccine shot, with all the gory details about the suffering, how she couldn't participate in her school's festival, the size of the coffin I'm quite sure there <i>are</i> stories of the kind.  Given the sheer amount of readers here, maybe one of you will more or less directly relate to that.  My apologies to those who do.<p>Nevertheless, what makes a good story doesn't necessarily make good evidence.  When you know of reliable statistics, and you read a contrarian anecdote, you should shift your belief in the direction of the anecdote by a precise amount, which is almost always tiny.  What your brain will actually do behind you back however, is shifting your belief by a <i>significant</i> amount, often crossing the ""reasonable doubt"" line.  That's not rational, but that's what will happen.  Nameless statistics feel abstract, remote.  An anecdote on the other hand feels concrete, real, close.  Worse, you can spend far more time reading about the salient anecdotes than learning about the end results of reliable, but boring, scientific studies.<p>Another example: you don't win the lottery.  Period.  You don't know of any close family of friend that ever did.  But maybe one of you readers do.  Maybe that one could comment and say ""Hey, but my cousin <i>did</i> win the lottery!"".  Would that prove me wrong?  Not at all.  It's just that when the sample size is huge enough, even the tiniest chance can actualize.",1340009224.0

I left philosophy because after all my reading, note-taking, class-discussioning, and debate tournamenting, I never felt like I'd made any progress, and that mattered to me personally. At the end of the day, the questions that were hard to answer were still unsolved, and the gray ethical areas were still gray. This is why I don't do philosophy, and I why I found the science bug.<p>I get your point, but for all intents and purposes that's one of the things that makes philosophy great, i.e. the fact that Heraclitus's sayings are as actual today as they were 2,500 years ago. You'll also have to agree that deciding once and for all (or ""proving"" by scientific means) what makes as taking ""moral"" decisions, or if ""morals"" even exist at all, or what makes us not kill each other once we've stopped believing in gods etc.,  is better left ""unresolved"", because this ""philosophical quest"" is what makes us humans.",1340008978.0

The same companies that you're criticizing are actually subcontracted by Bayer, etc. to produce their products so they can be sold in the developing world. If Indian did not produce these medicines, they would not be available to the poor at all. So at least they're saving lives that the developed world wasn't interested in saving.<p>Secondly: historically, Indian pharma growth was stunted due to old British laws. Once the industry was unshackled, it grew at a breathtaking rate, mostly by building generic variants of well-known drugs. This has allowed the Indian pharma industry to develop enough local expertise about formulation, manufacturing and distribution. Now they're moving up the food chain by patenting new drugs. Ranbaxy Labs, for example, is busy filing patents[1].<p>You can't expect the domestic industry to just sprout up organically. The Indian government never spent much money on R&D, so there wasn't much local drug research. But now that they're under the same patent regime, the Indian industries will have to figure out a way to survive.<p>Having said all this: please don't assume that Western drug companies' hands are clean. They are busy trawling the jungles of Amazon (among other places) to find new compounds, often taking knowledge from local shamans, etc. without any respect for their ""IP"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.financialexpress.com/news/ranbaxy-tops-third-world-patents-list/122766/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.financialexpress.com/news/ranbaxy-tops-third-worl...</a>",1340007134.0
