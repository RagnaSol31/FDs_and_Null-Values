I know it is for running batch jobs across a cluster.<p>How big are the data sets?  How does it compare with the MapReduce paradigm?<p>I see there is this Dagman project which sounds similar to some of the newer Big Data frameworks that use a DAG model.  I will make an uneducated guess that it deals with lots of computation on smaller sized data (data that fits on a machine).  Maybe you have 1 GB or 10 GB of data that you want to run through many (dozens?) of transformations.  So you need many computers to do the computation, but not necessarily to store the data.<p>I would guess another major difference is that there is no shuffle (distributed sort)?  That is really what distinguishes MapReduce from simple parallel batch processing -- i.e. the thing that connects the Map and Reduce steps (and one of the harder parts to engineer).<p>In MapReduce you often have data much bigger than a single machine, e.g. ~100 TB is common, but you are doing relatively little computation on it.  Also MapReduce tolerates many node failures and thus scales well (5K+ machines for a single job), and tries to reign in stragglers to reduce completion time.<p>I am coming from the MapReduce paradigm...
