See, developers are easy to find (yes, probably not the best ones, but since I'm a developer myself I know a good one when I see their code), and to get an MVP going, you don't really need a highly qualified expert, just someone that can build a relatively simple and stable app (or whatever), hell, even in PHP.<p>And usually, first employees just don't share the passion for a startup in the same amount founders do, which means there's probably less self-initiative and less contributive to the product itself.<p>So why should I offer equity to someone who I can easily replace (yes, everyone is replacable, but since it's my company I call the shots :)?

It's all fine and dandy that all of them try to act professionally, but they all live in the same home-office-appartment, are close friends, some of them in serious relation or engaged, and then they all pretend that they are doing some real negotiations based solely on numbers?

23,4416541,comment,4416358.0,4416358.0,1,0,Donito,,,"""High performance"" is usually required when performance becomes a bottleneck to your applications. In the case of web apps, there's server side, and client side.<p>* Client Side: Rich/interactive application, which usually involve lots of Javascript. If not properly architect-ed and developed, inefficient code will run slowly and make the application hard to use. That's where ""high performance"" is needed. An example of such client-side applications could be Facebook. You client is handling the chat list, conversations, tickers, navigation (e.g. does not refresh), auto-scroll, and many many more client-side features. Having them all working seamlessly and smoothly running together is not a trivial task. Besides optimized javascript, there are other server-side details used to improve client-side performance such as using css sprites, caching whatever can be cached, minimizing/packing javascript, etc, etc...<p>* Server side: A lot of things are happening on the server. Again, depending on your application, performance bottleneck will appear that need to be fixed for the server to be able to handle the load in a reasonable time. Here are a few example of what those bottle necks could be, which would call for ""high performance"" measures:\n- A ""really high"" number of visitors on your site, generating a massive amount of requests to your server. \n- A ""really high"" amount of data is being stored/read in your database.\n- A ""really high"" number of simultaneous connection is required for your real time application.\nThere are many more cases, but all the above will require careful selection of server-side technologies to allow your web application to function as intended, while minimizing cost, time, and processing power. (or whichever other variable your business cares about). An example of application faced with all the challenges above is again Facebook. They have to handle millions of users online potentially chatting (real-time), looking at pictures (high requests), and posting/reading comments non-stop (read/write to database).<p>Hopefully I've explaining ""what are those application"". Now when you ask ""where are they used"", I would reply ""when they are needed"" :)",1345625124.0

37,4416526,story,,,1,0,samayaranjan,Attacks against XML Digital Signatures & Encryption,http://blog.protogenist.com/?p=262,"XML Digital Signatures are indirected signatures. To construct a signature, the content to be signed is canonicalized, digested, and metadata about the content (its location, the digest and canonicalization method) is saved as XML. This XML metadata is then itself canonicalized, digested, and the digest of the metadata is signed to produce the final signature. Key information may optionally be packaged with the signature.The order of operations for signature validation, while unimportant from a cryptographic standpoint, can have a significant impact on whether many of the attacks detailed here are available to anonymous adversaries, or if the attack surface can be authenticated.The first operation of signature validation should be key resolution. Optimally, any KeyInfo attached to the signature can be discarded, and the proper key inferred from context and provided directly by the caller. If the KeyInfo must be resolved from the signature, this resolution must be a distinct step so a trust decision in the key can be made before proceeding",1345624535.0
