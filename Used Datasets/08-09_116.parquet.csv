I should jump on the offer, only one thing bothers me  The $15 for the game for those who pledge early.<p>When a game studio goes out to make a game they want to make something that is profitable, something that will return the investment they put in the game before it hits the stores. This is the reason most of the high-quality games cost around $70 today  investors want a good ROI to go along with their popular game.<p>But with Carmageddon: Reincarnation the investors are us, the user, and we _don't_ want a good ROI, for us the ROI is a high-quality game that will give me hours and hours of fun gameplay.<p>So why is the $15 price tag is only for early pledges? Why not make it the price of the game once it hits the shelves? if the game would cost $15 when it goes retail more people could buy it and enjoy it, and every game sold after the game is funded by Kickstarter goes straight to the pockets of the studio and the developers.<p>So why does the game needs to cost anything above $15?<p>This time I'll pass on Carmageddon, but the next time one of my childhood heroes decides to drop by in 1080p and cool new features I really expect that the studio/developers will lower the price of the game after it has been funded to a point that is below the $20 mark. I won't be able to fund _every_ new game that comes out of Kickstarter-esque funding project, but I do want to enjoy the general marketplace that these kind of crowdfunding sites create and not only those games that I personally fund, so I hope this become some kind of a trend  Crowd funded games (known franchises or new ones) should have a more welcoming price, these games are not funded by big corporations, so they shouldn't have the same attributes (i.e. price).<p>P.S.\nIn a world where high-quality app for my mobile touch device costs usually less than $5, there is no reason that a game for my desktop should cost more than $20.",1338885471.0
