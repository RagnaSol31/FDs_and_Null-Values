But, and maybe it's just me, but if I'm going to have to do the legwork of wrapping some C API into a decent, lifecycle-manageable object model, I'm probably going to use the lowest-level one I can so I can state with authority that I fully understand what everything in my stack is doing at all times. Like, OpenGL's C API is super gross, but only very slightly less so than dealing with SDL. And while, sure, ""you can commit the fixes back to SDL,"" you first then have to go unwind their abstraction to actually understand what the hell it's doing--which for me, given the relatively small feature set I need, is almost as much work, if not more, than writing it yourself.<p>Also, SDL 1.x is LGPL (instant dealbreaker, I build with static libraries on a Mac to avoid dylib hell) and SDL 2.x isn't done. So there's that, too.<p>In the spirit of abstraction and not having to build the object model I'd get for free with Direct3D, I used SFML for a while; the general idea of it is promising, but the abstraction is janky, it's desktop-only, and I still have a bitter taste in my mouth from the way they handled showstopper bugs in SFML 1.x as far back as three years ago: ""Completely reproducible crashes on all modern ATI cards? Just upgrade to our incompatible 2.x alpha!"". (2.0 still isn't out, which makes it <i>super</i> groovy.)<p>.<p>I now use GLFW for windowing/input, ENET for networking, and PhysFS for I/O; I can pretty easily use each of them in a way that maps pretty well to my own preferences for an object model and a mental model. Probably not scalable (for a multi-person project or a 3D game I'd almost certainly use OGRE rather than doing it myself), but nice for my purposes.<p>The only part of my codebase that isn't pretty trivially platform-independent right now, without any special effort, is in ""platform.cpp"", which does the tremendously difficult work of finding me the user directory and the appdata directory. =) I sure haven't done anything special to make it build both in Xcode (my primary environment) or Visual Studio.",1359363544.0

This is different from many other religious groups, who claim a unique and exclusive truth.<p>In practice, there is shockingly little authority exercised in AA there is literally no person or group who can kick someone out or impose sanctions on anyone.<p>I'm not saying it's not a weird group, it is, but it was founded by and populated by people who are in dire straights.

Sure, it gesticulates at some points. Sure, you could assume the author is trying to say X, but I think that is one's own projection of the essay's vague intent. In fact, we have two comments here which potentially illustrate what I mean. You argue that the article is about fashion. Someone else argues that it's about social privilege. I argue that it's so vague that it's really about nothing.<p>I'm not sure who you're calling a ""critical-thinking-by-the-numbers guy,"" but since I was one of those criticizing the article, I'll respond that it is wrong of you to assume that our criticism must be due to the fact that we/I don't understand that fashion in some ways represents who we are. Because I certainly recognize that fashion represents not only who we are, but who we want to be. But that does not absolve the article of having made no meaningfully substantiated conclusions apart from interesting points about the anonymizing use of hoodies.<p>If you asked me, the only reason Zuckerberg wears/wore hoodies is because he is/was a twenty-something. In his case it has nothing to do with anonymity/surveillance, etc. etc. They're just what was in fashion when he was in college. They're still in fashion. I wear them. They're comfortable. For youth, they're not uncool to wear. A suit would be uncool. Imagine all the grief you'd get if you wore a suit to high school.<p>EDIT (reply to below): While your reply may or may not be accurate, I think the fact that this is yet another interpretation of what the author's point makes my argument even clearer, that the essay has no point at all.",1359361332.0

I prefer free markets but anything touched by patents is not a free market either.<p>The cost could be shared by the rich countries. Research is expensive but is a fixed cost.
