2,804525,comment,803793.0,804004.0,0,0,hristov,,,"Sorry this does not show that it was the governments fault. This shows that the money supply in the Netherlands was essentially based on precious metals without any government involvement. The only thing the bank of Amsterdam did was keep the gold and silver in a central place and issue a receipt for it, so that people could more easily trade with the receipts rather than the actual gold. In fact this situation is pretty close to the gold standard that Chicago school people yearn about. Thus, any increase of the money supply was caused by the free market for precious metals not due to any govt involvement. So it is not ""the government's fault.""<p>Also the tulip mania cannot be explained by an increase of money supply. If that is the reason than why only tulips? If there is inflation and the market behaves efficiently and rationally everything should have gone up in price not only tulips. Why for example did one contemporary state that tulips became more expensive than the ground they were grown in? If the only reason is inflation, than the ground the tulips were grown on would increase in price proportionally to the tulips.",1252054570

It's easy to slip into complacency, taking it easy. Is this typical for hackers? What do <i>you</i> do about it? What can an <i>organization</i> do about it?<p>I've observed this in myself several times & now I observe it in the group of people I'm working with. I'm at a medium-sized internet company with about 100 employees. We're doing fine: fast growth, good revenue, great colleagues, life is beautiful. But complacency is creeping in, and I see many symptoms of that: ""We have too many projects!"", ""We need to hire more people!"", ""Why do something new when we have so much unfinished business?"", ""We need more structures!"", ""We need more layers of responsibility!"", ""We should only do projects that can't fail"".<p>I'm in a position where I can hopefully nudge this group of people in the right direction, so which suggestions do you have?

The tulip bubble, which is the classical example of a bubble had absolutely nothing to do with government manipulation. The internet stocks bubble of the late 90s also was largely unrelated to government manipulation. The housing bubbles of some eastern european countries also had nothing to do with the government as those governments did not subsidise housing. Even with the US housing bubble government involvement was rather tangential, the most troubled assets were not in any way subsidized by the government.<p>"" He goes on at length about Keynesian stimulus with no mention of its dismal failures, most notably in Japan.""<p>Japan is not an example of failure of Keynesian economics, because it is not really an example of keneysian economics.

It makes any attempt to synchronize a car fleet on one-side self-defeating, even in the thought-experiment stage.
