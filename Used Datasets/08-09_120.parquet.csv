The Latin and Greek also came through a similar mechanism, though more because they were scholarly. The idea that Norman French is the source of all English French loans is pretty easy to prove with comparison - Warranty vs Guarantee, liquor vs liqueur, hostel vs hotel, castle vs chateau, catch vs chase, warden vs guardian. Some could equally have come from earlier borrowings (e.g. hostel vs hotel), but the same happens when you compare any two dialects of the same root language (i.e. Norse and Old-English dialects), so nothing is 100%.",1398846369.0
