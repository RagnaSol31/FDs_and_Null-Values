I'm sort of going by the price points from when the iPad first came out and I really don't recall the real price, but the baseline was definitely higher than today's baseline models. Quick search suggest $500 for the baseline, which isn't competitive to $300.<p>Yes, I agree that the ""incomplete"" OS is sort of a fallacy, but not in all cases. Even if the iPad started up at $300, I'm pretty sure most people, especially those who had no computer at all, would dive toward a netbook, since yes, you could run Word + Browse the Web + listen to music (no flash! no youtube!), plus, you know, type on it. The big fallacy with the article is that the author is suggesting that an iPad could have replaced a netbook, and this, I hope you agree, simply was not, and is not, the case, and I really don't believe that many people would have bought an iPad if they didn't already have a computer of some sort, though I could be wrong here.<p>In regards to how much you can push an Intel Atom. Well, let's see here. I watched youtube lecture videos, ran Python IDLE, and even had other programs open while doing all of this.

The problem is in interpretation/representation/communication of information/ideas/knowledge.<p>For example, I've built an interactive computer simulation connected to a graphing component to enable students to explore rate of change. On a computer screen the simulation and graph are thus positioned that there is a direct link between what happens in the graph and in the simulation. It doesn't fit on a smartphone. I can (automatically) change the setup to put the graph after (below) the simulation, but  if the student cannot see the graph and the simulation simultaneously, they miss out on the support for learning the concept of change in the original configuration.<p>Another example, I taught a course on regular expressions and that included a unit on deterministic finite automatons. For non-trivial examples these automatons aren't comprehensible on small screens. Zoom and pan doesn't work to get a picture of the whole. On the other hand, I can think of a simulation of an automaton that would give a better picture on a small screen how a particular automaton works by using a simplified track representing the whole and focusing on a local state and input to see the effect of connections in the track. However, this would mean two different approaches to learning automatons that aren't necessarily compatible, especially in an introductory course. Students will have different questions and problems with the different representations. They will construct different ideas about automatons that might make communicating in class about automatons troublesome as students don't understand each other while talking about the same thing. But it goes further than that, these representation will need different introductions, different exercises, maybe even a different structured learning trajectory to build a similar understanding of automatons.",1357288648.0

My goal with writing this (as stated in the article) isn't to launch some Twitter hate mob or cancel a conference, but to start a dialogue (which I couldn't continue with the organisers).

The fatal flaw of a correlation is that it can be specious  it can appear to explain reality, but really there's a third variable responsible for driving the phenomenon you're interested in.<p>In this case, lead exposure and crime rate are correlated, but maybe lead doesn't cause crime at all: maybe something else causes crime that also happens to correlate with lead exposure.  Who knows, maybe a certain pesticide was used at the same time that lead gasoline came into vogue, and that's really the true cause of the rise in crime rates.<p>In research like this, when you can't do a manually controlled experiment, you have to control for hidden variables by some other means.  And that's precisely what the investigators in this article did: they varied the input data to try to ""shake out"" other variables that might be behind the correlation.  They looked at different time scales, different geographies, and different demographics, in an attempt to control for hidden variables that might be related to any one of those things.  Every time you vary the input data and keep finding a correlation, your evidence of a causative relationship goes up.<p>The gold standard, of course, would be to expose two random, double-blind sets of infants to lead and to a control substance and see what happens.  But since that would be unethical (as we have reason to think lead is bad for you), we're stuck with animal studies or retrospective studies.

Thanks for the feedback.<p>I perhaps didn't word that paragraph as well as I could -- my point there wasn't to introduce quotas, but to attempt to nip the problem in the bud. If I'd been organising EdgeConf, and had got to ~80% of my speakers being male with no female representation, I would've dropped everything and made sure that the rest were women. I guess when you include the numbers then this feels like tokenism, but it was mostly arbitrary. My point here was that they should have realised they had a problem before it reached 100%, not start out with the intention to recruit x% women (no matter how relevant or qualified they were) -- that's tokenism, right?",1357288079.0
