Never overflow signed types.<p>3. Always shift less than the type width.  I can name architectures which implement large shifts in three distinct ways.<p>4. Know that most integers get promoted to int or unsigned, so you need an explicit cast to get 64 bits on most platforms.  So 1ULL << 48 is okay, 1U << 48 is bad.<p>5.

People just don't notice that as much if they have a single HD as that is usually active most of the time you are working. But with 2 HD's (typical SSD + HDD combination) you often have one HD sleeping and will run into this a lot more thereby. There's ways to work around it - putting the page file on the HD which is more active or not allowing the HD to sleep as often. But my favorite would still be to simply prevent Windows from even using the page-file before the memory is at least used up to 50% - which would nearly never happen on my system for example.",1338799882.0

On one side, you say that C isn't that complicated but on the other side you say you just use a small subset because you don't trust yourself and your colleagues to understand all the C quirks...<p>I think C is complicated with all the 191 undefined behaviors and 52 unspecified behaviors (source for these number is the paper that the author of the quiz wrote for specifying CSmith). One must master C before having absolutely knowledge that the code that he wrote doesn't fall into one of the two black-holes (undefined and unspecified behaviors). For instance, almost everyone that I ask, they tell me that dereferencing a NULL pointer yields 'Segmentation fault' but it's just not true. It's in fact undefined behavior.<p>The other thing is the rules for strict aliasing... It's pretty much impossible to convert one pointer to another without breaking some of the C rules. The experts say type punning is the way to go but type punning relies in another not defined behavior. Reading an element from an union that wasn't the last element written is undefined behavior.",1338799347.0

So ""for (int i = 0; i != -1; ++i)"" is transformed into ""for (int i = 0; ; ++i)"", since both are equal in the eyes of the C standard (both will iterate through all non-negative values that fit in an int, then both will invoke undefined behavior, so they are the same).<p>The funny part is that it's often better to use int exactly because of the undefined behavior on overflow.
