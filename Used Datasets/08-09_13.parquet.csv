That seems ridiculous in hindsight but Sony was pushing Atrac and Microsoft was pushing WMA. (If you ripped your CD on Windows for a while, not only would it do it in WMA format but it would add DRM which meant your music stopped working when you re-installed).<p>I'm not saying Apple doesn't still try to pull proprietary moves when it thinks it can get away with it, but I do think ""Apple=Proprietary"" is some kind of zombie meme from the last century and overstates the case.<p>As an example Apple got called out for ""proprietary"" headphones on the first iPhone just because they recessed it for greater structural integrity, yet even now it is a ""feature"" on most phones if they have a standard headphone jack.",1246438650

A culture of sharing any code that *could*\n      be a module, no matter how trivial, leads to immature crap being widely\n      used because it was there already, with a mess of forks to clean up\n      afterwards. At least most of them are test-infected...\n        Python does come with a few stinkers, mostly ancient syscall wrappers.\n    Especially disastrous because it's unscoped, and infects the whole process\n      For a language with four scoping sigils it sure fucks up scope a lot\n    The syntax practically begs you to do it, anything else would look shitty\n\n  The Matz Ruby Implementation\n    The opposite of turtles-all-the-way-down (Smalltalk crushed beneath Perl)\n    It actively punishes you for taking advantage of Ruby's strengths\n    The standard library is written almost entirely in C\n      It doesn't use Ruby message dispatch to call other C code.\n      That means that if you overload a built-in, other built-ins won't use it\n    Anything fiddly that's not written in C will be dog slow</code></pre>",1246437725

Mail has been filing emails sent from our domain (and others I've heard about) directly to the spam folder - and these aren't bulk emails, just person-to-person emails.

Not only do we not ask for payment info when you sign up for the trial, we don't allow you to pay at all in the first 7 days, even if you want to.<p>This essentially forces you to actually use the thing and decide if you want it before buying.  Before switching to this mode, we used to get a lot of signup/pay/cancel cycles in the first few days of an account's lifetime.  Since it sometimes takes a few days before our product is up and running at full force, it seemed like we were losing a significant percentage of the ""impatient"" demographic.<p>Now that we enforce a bit of chillin', immediate cancellations have dropped almost to zero, while our conversion rate has stayed about the same.",1246437322
15,682299,comment,682101.0,682283.0,0,0,yangyang,,,"I have used both, Python more than Ruby.<p>Python's iterators are more usable in many situations than the Ruby block system. I can return an iterator, stick it in a variable, call another function with it that returns another iterator, and so on.<p>Python's classes also seem cleaner and less magical than Ruby's. For example, a method on a class is just an attribute that happens to be a method. Much more intuitive than Ruby in my opinion.<p>I'm also fond of Python's idea that ""There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it"".<p>I agree that Python does have its fair share of strangeness, but that fades away with time (you don't notice it).",1246437289

19,682295,comment,680364.0,680856.0,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Interestingly you can deliver vorbis audio natively, via Java, and via Flash 10 (see <a href=""https://launchpad.net/fogg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://launchpad.net/fogg</a>), so for audio you only need one format for 99% coverage.<p>And despite that fact no-one talks about it, Vorbis is actually state of the art, competitive with both AAC and AAC-HE at their respective sweet spots but without the problem of AAC-HE degrading badly on decoders that only support AAC (e.g. Apple stuff).<p>(Vorbis is also patent clear, used widely by big companies, well supported in hardware, and music seems to have moved away from DRM so it basically trumps every objection made to Theora.)<p>For video, though people like to talk about H.264 as if it was a single codec, it's actually a family or toolkit designed to go from web video on small portable devices up to Hollywood Blue-Ray on 100"" projector televisions. (I've seen people seriously claim Theora is unsuitable as a standard web codec because it doesn't handle film grain as well as H.264. Film grain!) Unfortunately you can't encode one H.264 stream that'll work on everything as encode and decode complexity ramp up harshly as you move up the profiles.<p>I predict that since the iPhone (and similar) is the hot platform right now, and it doesn't have Flash, you'll see a lot of places following Kroc Camen's lead and encoding twice, one for Theora and one for iPhone compatible H.264 which will then be deliver by Flash for non-Theora platforms.<p><a href=""http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody"" rel=""nofollow"">http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody</a><p>The kicker here is that iPhone compatible H.264 is far from the best possible quality you could squeeze out for desktop use, but is more than good enough for most folks so the two videos will be basically equivalent in quality.",1246436829

Some has to do with the fact that Python is older - hence has more baggage to carry. A lot of it, though, just has to do with poor/missing design choices. Specifics?<p>- ruby 'block' passing convention is much cleaner and more powerful than python's 'for'/iterators.<p>- python's global functions are stranger and more ad-hoc than Ruby's strict object-orientation.<p>- ruby's mixins > python's multiple inheritance<p>- python underscore (and double underscore) naming conventions to overcome simple language features<p>Don't get me wrong: i love python - but primarily because of the faster execution and larger community - not because of the language itself.",1246435844
