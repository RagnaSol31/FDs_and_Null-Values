Freetype was not a good fit to our (very memory constrained, slow) platform. I was suprised though, how slow the library was, and did some profiling. First thing I noticed was a huge number of malloc() calls. And  they were all small. A huge portion of them were only <i>4 bytes</i>. The malloc() implementation on our platform had an overhead of at least 12 bytes per allocation, so not only was it slow, it also wasted a ludicrous amount of memory.<p>All in all there were multiple allocations <i>per glyph</i> despite the fonts being loaded and unloaded as a single unit. Yikes.<p>Since we were in a rush, my hacky fix was a search/replace for malloc()/free() to special a special version of malloc that would just grab the next free chunk from a pool, or if the pool was full allocate another 4KB block and start allocating from that, and nothing for free, and then I added code to initialise the pool and free it to the open/close parts of the font API.<p>The result was drastically reduced memory usage and at least an order of magnitude speedup on our platform.<p>(The library in question was t1lib, a library originally released by Adobe, and the stupid memory handling is still in there as of today despite sporadic updates over the last decade; I guess it&",
