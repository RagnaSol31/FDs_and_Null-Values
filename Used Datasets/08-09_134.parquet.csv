And yet, those who work in these jobs needs to be fed, clothed etc. So who provides these resources to keep these people alive while they perform non-productive, exploratory jobs? Basic income _may_, but that just shifts the cost to the entity giving the basic income, instead of the investor who take the risk and profit from the outcome of the research/exploratory work.<p>The bottom line is, there isn't enough free resources out there to support such endeavours, as much as i like it to be true. Who wouldn't want to have the freedom to do what their passion tells them, be it artistry, scientific research, or social work.

22,5657867,comment,5657675.0,5657675.0,8,0,tikhonj,,,"Heh, the car comparison really does resonate with me: I like the Porsche <i>far</i> more because it is a <i>simple</i> design, aesthetically. Sure, the actual implementation--the weird engine position and all the mechanisms needed to compensate for it--is relatively complicated. But this does not compromise the minimalist aesthetic. Quite a nice feeling, especially for a car from that era. The great performance is just a boost.<p>The Cadillac, on the other hand, is probably simpler mechanically. It's a much more conservative, reasonable car: after all, who would be mad enough to put an engine at the <i>rear</i> of their sports car? But, wow, is the design <i>busy</i>. Little fiddly bits, fins, wheel-covers, too much chrome...<p>Perhaps the best way to think about it is that the Porsche is a car with a small surface area (metaphorically) and a large depth. The Cadillac is the opposite: larger surface are but less depth. I much prefer the former.<p>And this preference carries over into programming languages. I always like a language with nice aesthetics--simple semantics--even if it's harder to implement efficiently. I want a language which is simultaneously simpler and more flexible than the alternatives. And good performance certainly wouldn't hurt!<p>At a high level, these qualities mirror preferring the Porsche, which is why I like this metaphor. Sure, it's not perfect--but it isn't supposed to be. I don't even think of it as an argument in favor of one aesthetic over another; instead, I think it's just a great way to describe why I like what I like.",1367743503.0
