How many devs knew Obj-C well before the iPhone SDK came out? How many do now?<p>It's a bitter pill for developers to swallow, but the truth is that <i>consumers</i> drive platform adoption, and developers will learn whatever it takes to have a crack at the goldmine. Nokia went well out of its way to be dev-friendly, but couldn't produce a platform consumers wanted. Having a solid dev platform that's easy to use is good, but makes little difference when nobody's wielding your phone in the first place.<p>> <i>""2) Existing tie-in to blackberry servers.""</i><p>Doesn't last forever. The consumer preference for iOS and Android device is so strong that enterprises are starting to decouple themselves from BB enterprise servers. There's a difference between the bitchings of rank and file engineers and the CEO being unable to use the new fancy sexy device because IT doesn't support it. One gets more change than the other, sadly.<p>The tie-in to RIM's proprietary servers is a stopgap at best. Without it RIM would be sinking far more rapidly than they already are.

There's different versions available (community, pro etc.). The community version has a web app scanner and is reasonably ok, but it tends to be caught by intrusion detection systems fairly easily and it's payloads often don't clean up properly. It's better suited to infrastructure exploitation, but can be used in a web app context.<p>Canvas[1] has some limited web app scanning capability but has more of a core focus on infrastructure exploitation.<p>Burp Suite Pro[2] is a framework for testing web applications. It's probably the best tool out there for testing web apps (if you know what you're doing). It's also ludicrously cheap and there is a free version for non-commercial use. It comes with a fairly comprehensive web app scanner.<p>NetSparker is a web application scanner. From what I can tell it's mainly competing with things like Accunetix. It has some features that are similar to Metasploit Pro but focuses primarily on the application layer. It sits more between Burp Suite Pro and Canvas for my purposes.

It's a compromise to provide convenience to users.<p>As soon as developers have to expend effort to get a worse version of their app running on these devices the plan falls apart.<p>Good developers will shun the device until they can be sure than they can create a great user experience and that the effort of doing so will be worth the effort.,1301300378.0
