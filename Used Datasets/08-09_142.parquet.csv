Utopic is the fastest way to see what’s popular right now, breaking it up by categories like videos, music, links, events, photos etc. Utopic gives a personalized real-time view of what’s trending today among people who matter to you the most. Instead of going through long linear feeds and tens of external websites, see hot content from friends all immediately in one place, in a prioritized order. Other data sources like Google Reader, music services and others will be added shortly.<p>Utopic solves the problems of:\n- Curiosity: everyone wants to know what's trending or hot among their friends.\n- Information overload: there’s too much content on Twitter, Facebook, Youtube etc, even among people you’re following. Utopic brings out just the important stuff.\n- Too many sites to go through: Utopic aggregates everything popular into one site.<p>Technically what we do is a pretty complex issue. Even for a few hundred users, we have indexed a few million links and hundreds of thousands of people sharing/liking/retweeting stuff in our databases. Adds up to gigabytes of data already early on. Big data & processing it rocks - something our team loves :) A bad side to it is that importing Facebook & Twitter data for a new user can take hours (yeah, their API's are slow, especially FB) so you see full advantage of the service may be only on your second login.<p>Any suggestions on how to improve the service? Anything you like or dont like? How to make it more social & viral, for it not to be a single-user tool?<p>You can also e-mail me at jk@utopic.me. Thanks in advance!",1300265231.0

You do not – emphatically do not – \n  have a responsibility to “stay on good terms” with movie \n  studios.\n</code></pre>\nJust like Moviefone has to maintain good relationships with studios, Techcrunch has to maintain good relationships with tech companies, or else its access will be cut off and things will be made difficult for it in many ways. It can burn a source from time to time just for fun, but if that becomes a habit, then it just stops getting scoops and bad things start happening. For example, some hypotheticals:<p>- pg stops sending them new YC startup launches<p>- startups start actively avoiding Arrington and his\n    reporters and seeking out more friendly outlets, e.g.\n    Startup Foundry<p>- some smart startup guy with time on his hands does an \n  investigative report on TechCrunch itself, showing how \n  the post-AOL TechCrunch has SEO'd its headlines to the \n  gills with Bieber and Gaga crap<p>And in addition to these sorts of perceptible consequences for burning sources (i.e. scoop decline = traffic decline = revenue decline), there is another dimension to this.<p>Put yourself in the position of the unfortunate PR person for Source Code. Their entire investment of time and effort -- getting the Techcrunch contact, arranging a screening, getting Alexia face time with a mercurial movie start like Gyllenhaal -- went up in smoke when Alexia trashed the Source Code game stuff. [Though you could argue that the movie sort of has higher awareness now as a center of ""controversy"", this was not the intended outcome.]<p>The thing is, PR guys are scared of talking to reporters because there are often very large sums at stake that can turn on the whim of the reporter. Anyone who has raised money in the Valley knows that deals can close -- or fall through -- on the basis of a single well timed adverb in a headline.<p>Reporters are only dimly aware of the economic consequences of their reporting, and their ability to create -- or utterly destroy -- wealth. It's like there is a river of money flowing by them, and they can either reroute it off a cliff or towards an even larger tributary, but cannot actually take a drink from the water.<p>I'm of course not saying that reporters shouldn't publish negative stories or takedowns, but rather that often they aren't aware of just how bad a negative story can be if it's the top hit on Google. For those who have built something, your heart is in your throat when talking to the first few people who are going to publicly evaluate it -- are they going to trash it to such an extent that you won't even get the resources to improve it? It's at least arguable that an alternative to the tabloidy approach of Techcrunch is the more builder-friendly approach of David Pogue and Walt Mossberg, who generally don't write about things if they're going to trash them (i.e. the sign that they don't consider something that good is a lack of coverage rather than an outright flame).<p>Finally, sometimes reporters <i>are</i> aware of the economics surrounding press coverage, but in the worst way. Think about what Gizmodo wrote about the stolen iPhone:<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-gizmodo-editor-brian-lams-email-to-steve-jobs-raises-question-would-gizmodo-have-published-iphone-story-if-apple-hadnt-spurned-it-2010-5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-gizmodo-editor-...</a><p><pre><code>  Gizmodo lives and dies like many small companies do. We\n  don't have access, or when we do, we get it taken away.\n</code></pre>\nMake no mistake, access and credibility both have business value to any media company and need to be balanced. Access means good treatment of sources. Credibility means good treatment of readers. If you are only ""credible"", you are reporting yesterday's news. And if you only have access, you are only reporting airbrushed news. There is a balance, and Carr has to acknowledge that.",1300263724.0

There is the semantic analysis phase afterwards, which is just as hard. In your example ""sizeof(struct MyStruct) = 96"" must be related to the type definition of MyStruct. Then the compilation target must be asked for the sizes of the primitive types inside the struct. Effectively, the IDE could as well execute the compiler (with a parameter not to generate code) and parse the output.<p>Maybe an IDE wants a complete frontend as a library. Feed in the file, retrieve the AST. Insert callbacks for warnings and errors instead of printing to stderr.<p>An interesting problem would be to reparse parts of a file. The parser would have to get an AST node and a file position, to ""resume"" parsing from there. This only works, if there is no context apart from the AST, though.",1300263509.0

E.g. Python has significant whitespace. The lexer (with context knowledge of indentation width) can easily emit indent/dedent tokens, so the grammar is context free. With a tool like ANTLR you have to do wierd stuff to parse Python.<p>Programming languages older than 10 years or so are usually not context-free. For example C needs context to parse ""A*B"", because the meaning depends on whether ""A"" is a type or a variable.
