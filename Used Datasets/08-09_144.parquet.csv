24,4246531,comment,4245737.0,4246018.0,5,0,jlouis,,,"Just because it is Functional Programming it does not mean to ""throw away encapsulation"". Most languages still allow you to limit the extent to which a piece of data is exposed. And that is needed for large systems - otherwise you will have to change many many functions as your data representation changes. This is also true of loose coupling. Seeking to modularize your code is always a good idea - but it is not impossible to achieve in non-OO languages. After all they also have module systems for exactly that.<p>The trick is to have a small set of functions which are very generic. And then stack these on top of each other as a mini-language from which you build up the access pattern you desire. After all it is a functional language, so these kinds of constructions should be fairly simple.<p>As for representation, consider that a book is represented as a tree: chapter -> section -> subsection -> paragraph -> body_text. But nobody said that this was the natural representation in a machine. You could have made a database table - CREATE TABLE book (id SERIAL, chapter INT, section INT, ..., body_text TEXT). Now access is by a small mini-language, namely SQL SELECT statements. Another way is to represent Chapter, Subsection, ... as dimensions in a vector space. The body text is then a point at a coordinate of Chapter x Section x Subsection. This has a KD-tree representation because it has neat spatiality for instance.<p>We could represent the book as a list: [(chapter section subsection ... body_text) ...]. A list has a formal <i>derivative</i> called a ""zipper"". This structure allows us to go ""forward and back"" through the paragraphs of the book - one paragraph at a time. This is the <i>perfect</i> representation for a screen reader. If we need to go larger strides, we can probably consider a zipper of a Rope-structure or a finger tree.<p>Finally, we could use a trick where the book is represented as a function. That is, we simply call book(3, 12, 32, 4) to get Chapter 3, Section 12, Subsection 32 paragraph 4.<p>What I really don't like about OO is when it is taken as the assumption that physical objects in our world has an isomorphic representation in the machine. This is nearly never the case. Good OO programmers naturally know when to break away from an isomorphic representation - but sadly this is not always what is taught in schools. You know, a Cat is an animal and so is a dog. Hence they are both subclasses of the animal class :)",1342341401.0

One for Strange Loop and one for a Ruby conference. The two talks are mostly the same, but it's worth watching both. Then watch all other talks by Rich Hickey too, as they are all excellent.<p><i>> At a minimum, for Java, you're going to want an object</i><p>Java, if you ask me is a degenerate case. It's a language that pushes consistency at all costs, in the face of any common sense. Most other OO languages don't pressure you into programming this way. I.e., they give you normal functions in addition to methods.<p>Though when programming in Java, I am personally not averse at all to just putting functions into an empty utility class that exists solely for holding nothing but static methods. Scala actively encourages doing this, as it provides for a type of object called a ""package object"" that exists for this particular purpose.<p><i>> I have heard of the Law of Demeter, but in practice, I'm not sure I see it obeyed that often if ever.</i><p>Maybe people in the trenches don't typically obey ""best practices"", but the OO best practices gurus all seem to push the Law of Demeter these days. I'm sure it's difficult to figure out how to do well. But then again, so is figuring out how to apply Rich Hickey's advice on simplicity!<p><i>> nobody wants to maintain those niggling chains of accessor calls.</i><p>Nobody wants to be locked into an inflexible API either, but I agree that people are lured by what is easy!<p><i>Hickey is contrasting a simple approach with software development as it happens now, typically, not as it might or ought to happen.</i><p>It would be interesting to know how what Hickey would do is different from what OO best practices gurus recommend. Indeed it's clear that in the real world, people don't often follow either advice.<p><i>> Also, for what it's worth, I don't think encapsulation is irretrievably the province of OO.</i><p>For the most part, it's usually considered to be. API's surely existed before OO, but they were typically for one program to talk to another, not for communication within a program. Before OO, different parts of programs typically revealed all their data structures, and you were allowed to go to town on them. Though, it's true that for certain things you probably weren't supposed to do that. E.g., as you said, on the malloc heap in C.<p>I believe that encapsulation as we know it today was invented by the CLU programming language. It was certainly the first language to enforce encapsulation. CLU isn't necessarily what we would consider an to be OO language today, as it didn't have inheritance, but it considered itself an OO language at the time.",1342341326.0

If you want to lose weight, and you already have a varied diet that meets your body's daily intake requirements, it can be useful to calculate your calorie consumption and burn rate and try to tweak both of those so that you end up with a caloric deficit.<p>Of course this only directly affects your weight, and you need to also take care of your body's general health.

In many cases they do not comment publicly on the web at all.  They just submit bug fixes.<p>That said, the best code I've found is the stuff that's made publicly available via internet, and I'd argue it's precisely because it allows all those ""silent experts"" to review it and submit their fixes.  It's not the best simply because of the contributions of the silent experts, but because their scrutiny raises the bar.<p>It takes a certain amount of confidence to make code avaiable for all to see.  Because it becomes very clear, quite quickly, whether it's any good or not.<p>I don't see this same type of peer review and vetting within the corporation.  The goal there is different: one need only satisfy the company's clients, most of whom cannot themselves review code quality.<p>In my experience, many of the silent experts who submit fixes work at corporations.  They are no strangers to closed source.<p>So it's all quite interesting.  Open source and open discussion in its own strange way effectively raises the bar.  But at the same time the web also lowers the bar to spreading bad code.  And disseminating much nonsense chatter about programming.<p>Hence we have lots of chaff.  Lots and lots of chaff.  The wheat is there, but you have to know where to look.  And generally, when you find wheat, you'll also find lots of ""silent experts"" submitting fixes.<p>I often wish which they were the ones making the noise on the web.  Because then it wouldn't be noise.  Many of these guys really know their stuff.  I guess over time the web has worsened things.  In the early days, many online contributors, e.g., to bulletin boards and newsgroups, really were knowledgeable in their chosen fields.  There were just less people online.  That seems to have changed somewhat, but maybe it's just my perception.<p>In any event, they might be silent, but we know they are paying attention.
