Elections were won with other topics like taxes, economy, etc, and IP policy was strictly kept quiet about, smuggled under the public radar, then finally arranged with the content industry behind closed doors (remember ACTA being declared a ""threat level national security"" issue to shield it from public scrutiny). Effectively, IP was handled as something ""too important to let the public vote on it"".<p>The problems arose when IP was started to be enforced against the public, to stop the free flow of information because few bits of this information have (undemocratically) been declared someones ""property"". Now the public was not only excluded from having a say in the prescious IP policy, they have become the primary _target_ of the IP policy, without any democratic way to do something about it. Millions of people have been threatened and sued, and to decide whom to sue, mass surveillance and data retention laws have been introduced. Even child pornography was misused as a vehicle to enable new intrusive surveillance laws with the intent to later apply them primarily to file sharers.<p>> not just unwedded to the IP establishment, but against it.<p>And not only being against IP establishment, but literaly created from scratch to fight it.

For example, in case of streaming service, we've just expanded to Latin America and the Caribbean (to 43 new countries). In case of the DVD service, we're adding a new video games catalog.<p>DVD service is still growing - it probably won't grow at the same rate for very long, but right now, it's growing. Streaming, on the other hand, is growing at a phenomenal rate. Therefore it makes sense to not hold up the growth of one service for the other to catch up.<p>In the time (about 6 months) I've been at Netflix, the one thing I'll have to call out is the absolute, undeterred focus that the company has. Simply put, Netflix fundamentally believes that it's best to do one thing really, really, really well, than to do many things reasonably well.<p>Splitting the streaming and DVD service isn't so much due to lack of ability to design the website to suit both options, but really as an indication that they are turning out to be different businesses altogether.",1316421654.0

However, one thing to remember is that the real-world performance remains very similar, and that the average person won't be able to tell the difference.

Even taking into account the fact that the G2 was factory fresh, and the G1 (a drive that does not support TRIM) was significantly slower benchmark wise, the experience of using the two machines was almost identical.

I could imagine an arrangement analogous to ""floating currency rates"" where you define a band within which the market price can fluctuate. Progressive taxation coupled with social safety net can have this effect if taken to its combined extreme. But how realistic is that sort of thing in today's monetized society?<p>On a tangent, I find it curious how we all seem to have been brainwashed somehow into taking certain assumptions _automatically_ for valid that then frame the entire discussion.<p>I mean, where does the connection between ""what you gave to society"" and your financial profit come from? It's not at all clear to me, on second thought, that they are connected so closely. Also, what exactly does it mean to ""give to society"" when your (more neutrally formulated) net effect on your environment is determined not just by ""effort"" but also by randomness and by the very environment you interact with?  Finally, it's not clear to me that everything can be quantified (in the special sense of putting a competitive market value on it). The concept of value is, I suspect, a strict superset of ""monetary value"", and it's important we understand (as a society) better what are the special conditions under which a mapping to ""money space"" makes sense.<p>Big, hairy questions, sure, but to give a concrete example for the last one: Since when does it make sense that the ""performance"" of museums or orchestras is measured in how much tickets they sell? (Incidentally, see how far today's terminology is off?) Yes, I can't pull a better answer out of my hat right now but I _am_ quite sure this question itself is framed in the wrong way because we already presuppose the applicability of concepts like ""competitive exchange"" and ""valuation"".<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm a big believer in competitive markets, private property and responsibility, and entrepreneurship. The thing is, I feel more and more that this type of thinking can only be applied to a subset of political issues, it is not a universal acid.

If learning as a general phenomenon occurs in plateaus, but turns out linearly the same in the long run for most everybody (like a graph of the prime counting function seems choppy up close but a line out far), perhaps it is the case we intuitively think some people have a talent, because they didn't experience any early plateaus, but experience some later instead, when they aren't under as careful scrutiny. In other words, it might be a statistical phenomenon of the learning progression (assuming the plateaus are uniformly randomly distributed).
