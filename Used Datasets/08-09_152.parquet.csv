I always thought caste did not matter in USA until I recently attended a seminar by a self proclaimed India expert Christian priest. The Christian missionaries are trying to convince various governments across the world to recognize &quot;caste&quot; as serious discrimination probably to malign Hinduism to further their conversion business in India. I brushed it off thinking it must be some fringe group. After few days a lady showed up at my place asking my wife to narrate the horrors she had to face back in India because of her lower caste (my wife happens to have a lastname generally associated to lowest of low castes in India). It took us a while to understand what was happening.,1453625607.0

Where Jaynes demonstrates that increased evidence actually decreases your belief in a hypothesis.<p>Jaynes gives an example of an experiment in which a psychic predicts cards, getting n out of m correct. In classical hypothesis testing H0 would be &quot;the psychic got lucky&quot; and H1 is &quot;the psychic has mystic powers&quot;. Jaynes first attempts to use Bayesian reasoning to work backward to determine your prior belief in psychics. That is, how much evidence would it take to convince you, compare that to the raw likelihood and what you have is your prior beliefs quantified.<p>He then points out that he personally would never believe the subject was psychic, this is because there are not just H0 and H1, but H2 &quot;the psychic is deceiving the experimenters&quot;, H3 &quot;the experimenters are making an error&quot; , H4 &quot;the experiments are fudging the results&quot;, H5 ... Each of these has their own prior.<p>If your prior for believing in psychics is low enough and your prior for &quot;the experimenters are fraud&quot; is high enough, the more extreme the evidence the more you will be convinced that the experimenters are disreputable con artists, and subsequently the less you will believe the subject is psychic.<p>This is actually Jaynes&",
