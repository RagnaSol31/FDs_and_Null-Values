Google today is kinda schizophrenic when it comes to this kind of policies: super strict rules about the content and the way it gets displayed in SERPs by google Search, totally non-chalant and pretty lax about Adwords campaigns that are borderline scammy.\nSometimes they look like the totally separated departments of a dystopian government from the Future, Ã  la Brazil.<p>2) Hard to do before an investigation takes place. Sure there are recognizable patterns but the easiest route is still to block and refund after the fraud has actually \nhappened.<p>3) Well, more than that the Govts should spend their money on educating people to avoid this kind of scams",1388220746.0

If you just look at taxes on wages for someone making $250k per year, you will pay about 40% in obvious taxes in California. There are sales and other taxes on top of this and some additional regulatory taxes as well.<p>Since I have operated companies with substantial payrolls in California and therefore been privy to the cost details, I can say that the total outlay to various government authorities when a paycheck is cut can exceed the total value of the paycheck in California but not much beyond that; maybe 52% to government, 48% to the employee.<p>In summary, you will only approach 60% if you include all possible taxes on the income including the spending of said income, which does not happen often in practice. Even in California, the worst case is closer to 50% if you manage your income reasonably well.<p>This still adds up to a lot of money if you compare it to a state like Washington with similar software engineering wages and no income tax, since that adds up to tens of thousands of extra income.",1388218647.0

For example: Audioengine A5 + Audioengine S8 + Behringer UCA202. DACs are grossly overrated when it comes to their influence on sound quality. Regardless, the UCA202 measures outstandingly well.<p>For somewhat less you can easily build a much, much, much, much better system. For example: Audioengine A5 + Audioengine S8 + Behringer UCA202 + MiniDSP 2x4 + MiniDSP UMIK-1 + Room EQ Wizard. This nets you basic room response correction, plus an active crossover between the speakers and sub.
