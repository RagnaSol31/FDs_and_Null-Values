Is your ideology that much more important than your integrity?<p>Apple paid Xerox handsomely, in pre-IPO Apple stock sold at a discount for a LICENSE to use the technology that Xerox PARC was developing.  Full stop.<p>Further, the Xerox systems were very rudimentary.  They were a lab, and there's a huge difference between a lab experiment and a product.  Xerox didn't have a GUI, for instance.  They had the idea of windows but they didn't work like windows, they couldn't overlap.  At least %60 of the innovations in the Macintosh were developed by Apple.  Xerox showed Apple a <i>direction</i> which was important.<p>Thus to claim that it was a ""ripoff"" is to simply tell a lie.<p>Your misrepresentation of Job's statement is also false, but at this point I've come to believe that you, and the rest of those with your ideology simply don't care about the truth.",1345798481

What we don't know is whether people pay $X for exactly our product. We have pondered a lot over the free 30x500 course materials, but haven't got around to join the course. We did not spend much on Adwords (< $100) and we did already gather some addresses. But it's hard to estimate the actual conversion rate without asking people to really pay money for it, and without screenshots and the like.<p>So, yes, we thought we could validate the idea with an Ad campaign, but we did not do it right, I think. We did not measure anything significant at all, and what we did is gather an ""I'm interested"" list. You are right that perhaps the best ways to validate a product is to ask real people - like asking quite bluntly ""Would you pay $30 per month for this product, with this certain USP?"", or even ""Would you pay me $100 upfront to build this product?"". That takes a lot more guts than just setting up a landing page and an adwords campaign, but I see that we should do it.",1345798339

It was single touch, it did not resolve touches into single pixels like the iPhone does, it thus had very large buttons.  It had no stack oriented UI, no tab or navigation based UI, no scrolling lists.  No two fingers, and really to call what it had a ""UI"" is not quite correct at all. It wasn't even a smart phone, it was a feature phone with a gimmick.   There were no apps, except for the built in features that make up all feature phones.<p>In short, none of the innovations of the iPhone were even in it, and it didn't ship until After the iPhone.<p>It was announced before the iPhone shipped in part to try and steal some of Apple's thunder but it doesn't even compete in the same category as the iPhone.  So, bringing it up is, quite simply, dishonest.<p>It really is quite astounding the level of self deception and rationalization that Apple haters have to employ to pretend like Android and all these multi-touch smart phones that came after the iPhone, are not copying the iPhone simply because someone had a device with a screen you could touch prior to 2007.<p>But when you state such things in public, you step beyond self deception and into the arena of simple deception.<p>Further, the fact that the LG Prada example has been brought up ad infinitum for the past 5 years from people such as yourself, and that you still bring it up now, shows that the actual facts of reality are not relevant to you.<p>Your only point is to defend your ideology.   And to do that, you are, quite simply, lying.<p>Touch is not what Apple invented.  There were touch screens going back in the past. Jeff Han made one using Cameras.  That's not prior art for the iPhone.  Neither is the movie 2001: A space odessy, or any of the other long refuted nonsensical claims one finds android fanatics making.<p>Consequently, I am forced to reach the conclusion that you recognize that Android is a blatent ripoff of the iPhone, and you simply don't care.  You either hate Apple or Love google, or you've attached to some anti-IP ideology, and that is more compelling to you than logic and reason, and the simple facts of history.<p>I know that this site is full of people who share your ideology and you will shout down and vote down anyone who disagrees, while calling them ""uncivilized"" and other names.<p>But that does not change the facts, and you cannot refute the facts.<p>You can only evade them.

As I understand it, we raised a fairly large round when we had almost no employees or revenue, and weren't exactly sure what we were doing. And we absolutely needed to. Hadoop wasn't mature enough for most businesses yet, most businesses weren't really looking to do the things that Hadoop is letting them do yet, and the company was nowhere near mature enough to know how to support enough big enough customers to pay the bills anyway. We needed time, so we needed funding.<p>3+ years later, everything has matured and there will certainly be no talent acquisition.<p>More generally, your claim doesn't seem to make much sense. Why does raising money make a nascent company more likely to sell out for a small talent acquisition? The real reason that companies that raise early sell more than companies that raise late is that the set of companies that raise late is a biased sample. It is, by definition, a set of companies that got too big and successful to be talent-acquired.<p>In the current landscape, early companies that haven't yet started printing money may well find that their best option is to take a fairly large check and work for someone else. I can't see how investment would make them less likely to get past that stage; investment gives them more time to figure out their business, and less incentive to sell because investors will get a cut and not really want them to.",1345796850
