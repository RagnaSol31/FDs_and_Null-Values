133,5824262,comment,5820470.0,5822748.0,1,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"It's the ownership problem that makes garbage collection useful. Tracking who owns which piece of memory at a particular point in time is a lot of work. Every API has to document if and how an object returned as a pointer should be freed and if an incoming pointer continues to be owned by the caller or not. Every single library invents its very own memory management pattern and you have to keep them all in your head or bad things will happen.<p>Look at libpq for instance. There are several functions that free memory and destroy different types of objects: PQclear, PQfreemem, PQfinish, PQconninfoFree and maybe others that I forget. For some API functions the documentation explicitly states which free function to use, for others it says nothing and for yet others it says not to free anything because another object retains ownership.<p>C++ tries to solve the problem that libpq has by using RAII and destructors, but it opened a can of worms. Now you have to deal with tons of different types of smart pointers and fancy memory management patterns coming from different libraries and frameworks. And you must never think that smart pointers are really pointers because if you do, bad things will happen:<p>Can you return the this pointer from a member function? Not if someone else holds a shared_ptr to this. Can you return shared_ptr<ThisClass>(this)? No, because now you may have two different reference counts for the same object. Can you return shared_from_this() after inheriting enable_shared_from_this? Only if at least one shared_ptr already points at this, which depends on how the caller created this. Is SomeClassPtr a SomeClass*, a shared_ptr<SomeClass> or maybe a boost::intrusive_ptr<SomeClass>? Go find the typedef.<p>So garbage collection is desirable. Unfortunately it seems to be a very difficult problem to solve in the face of large amounts of memory and lots of parallelism, which is exactly where we're headed. I wish Oracle would buy Azul and make their garbage collector available in OpenJDK. The world would be a better place and I would forgive them all the nasty stuff they have done recently :)",1370419536.0

Every possible source of leverage should be sought and turned to our advantage.<p>I have mentioned before the ""stacked panel"". Panel discussions naturally favor alliances of relatively weak partners - our usual opposition. For example, an ""unbiased"" panel on OLE vs. OpenDoc would contain representatives of the backers of OLE (Microsoft) and the backers of OpenDoc (Apple, IBM, Novell, WordPerfect, OMG, etc.). Thus we find ourselves outnumbered in almost every ""naturally occurring"" panel debate.<p>A stacked panel, on the other hand, is like a stacked deck: it is packed with people who, on the face of things, should be neutral, but who are in fact strong supporters of our technology. The key to stacking a panel is being able to choose the moderator. Most conference organizers allow the moderator to select the panel, so if you can pick the moderator, you win. Since you can't expect representatives of our competitors to speak on your behalf, you have to get the moderator to agree to having only ""independent ISVs"" on the panel. No one from Microsoft or any other formal backer of the competing technologies would be allowed  just ISVs who have to use this stuff in the ""real world."" Sounds marvelously independent doesn't it? In fact, it allows us to stack the panel with ISVs that back our cause. Thus, the ""independent"" panel ends up telling the audience that our technology beats the others hands down. Get the press to cover this panel, and you've got a major win on your hands.<p>Finding a moderator is key to setting up a stacked panel. The best sources of pliable moderators are:<p><pre><code>    -- Analysts: Analysts sell out - that's their business model. But they are very concerned that they never look like they are selling out, so that makes them very prickly to work with.\n\n    -- Consultants: These guys are your best bets as moderators. Get a well-known consultant on your side early, but don't let him publish anything blatantly pro-Microsoft. Then, get him to propose himself to the conference organizers as a moderator, whenever a panel opportunity comes up. Since he's well- known, but apparently independent, he'll be accepted  one less thing for the constantly-overworked conference organizer to worry about, right?""""""</code></pre>",1370419371.0
