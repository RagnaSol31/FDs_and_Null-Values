Ideally the flow would work something like the following:<p><pre><code>  1. Start a multipart object upload\n  2. Issue &quot;Upload Part - Copy&quot; requests for each part of an object ( http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/mpUploadUploadPartCopy.html )\n  3. Complete the multipart object upload\n</code></pre>\nAlternative flow:<p><pre><code>  1. Enable bucket versioning\n  2. Download the parsed S3 objects\n  3. Start a multipart object upload to S3 with the specified target object as the object name\n  4. Reupload the parsed S3 objects as parts of a single multipart object upload\n  5. Delete the previous parsed objects once the multipart object upload is complete (a delete marker should be added to the top of the version stack, but the previously stored version should still be available if you specify its handle/version id).\n</code></pre>\nEdit: changed formatting",1450342501.0

Improvement in luxury technology, if faster\nthan improvement in subsistence technology, would have kept living standards growing. The\nMalthusian trap is essentially a puzzle of balanced growth between the luxury sector and the\nsubsistence sector. The author argues that balanced growth is caused by group selection in\nthe form of biased migration. It is proven that a tiny bit of bias in migration can suppress\na strong growth tendency. The theory re-explains the Malthusian trap and the prosperity\nof ancient market economies such as Rome and Sung. It also suggests a new set of factors\ntriggering modern economic growth.",1450340750.0
