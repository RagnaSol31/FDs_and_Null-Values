1,993862,comment,992666.0,993468.0,0,0,anatoly,,,"Well, let's agree to disagree on the recommendation of Manin's book. I think it's confusing, rambling and often downright unhelpful.<p>The reason Godel's theorem is proved as (little other than) a corollary to Tarski's in Manin's book is that Manin presents a weaker, semantic version of Godel's theorem that is indeed little other than a corollary to Tarski's. See Manin's discussion of ""Godel's argument"" and particularly step (c) on p.255 of his book. Manin explains that Godel's proof doesn't use the assumption that D is a subset of T (all provable statements are true), but that he, Manin, doesn't think it's important to care about that, so he presents the theorem this way. In the form Godel proved it, the theorem doesn't require any semantic assumptions.<p>Manin is entitled to his own spin on what is and isn't important about the Incompleteness Theorem, but it should be apparent to you that his presentation uses an assumption that Godel's theorem in its general form doesn't require. It's interesting (where by interesting I mean ""weird, and goes toward explaining my opinion of Manin's book"") that Manin nowhere even deigns to mention Godel's <i>Second</i> incompleteness theorem, the one about axiomatic systems being unable to prove their own consistency. Now if you were to take up a better book than Manin's, say Smullyan's <i>Godel's Incompleteness Theorems</i>, and study the proof of the second incompleteness theorem, you'd find out that its proof <i>requires</i> a syntactic proof of the first theorem, the proof that Manin says isn't important. This is because proving the second theorem entails formalizing the proof of the first theorem inside the axiomatic system itself, and you can't do that with a proof that uses semantic arguments and talks about true and false theorems (why? because of Tarski's undefinability of truth!). Think of that what you will.",1260781051.0

26,993829,comment,993257.0,993257.0,0,0,miked,,,"""World-class economist Paul Samuelson, a Nobel laureate, wrote in the tenth edition of his textbook Economics: <i>“It is a vulgar mistake to think that most people in Eastern Europe are miserable.”</i> This, mind you, in the aftermath of the 1953 East German uprising, the 1956 Hungarian uprising and the Poznan protests in Poland, the 1968 revolution in Czechoslovakia— all suppressed with bloodshed by Soviet tanks. In the eleventh edition, he took out the word “vulgar.” In the 1985 twelfth edition, that entire passage had disappeared. Instead, he and his coauthor, William Nordhaus, substituted a sentence asking whether Soviet political repression was “worth the economic gains.” This non-question was identified as “one of the most profound dilemmas of human society.” After 70 years of Leninism, Stalinism, and Maoism that took at least 100 million lives, this was still a dilemma?<p>It seemed to me utterly incredible that an otherwise great economist could parrot idiotic Marxist propaganda. At a time when the magnitude of the Soviet economic disaster was apparent even to the most willfully blind Marxists in Central Europe and the USSR, the 1985 Samuelson text offered this paragraph about the Soviet economy:<p><i>But it would be misleading to dwell on the shortcomings. Every economy has its contradictions and difficulties with incentives—witness the paradoxes raised by the separation of ownership and control in America. . . . What counts is results, and there can be no doubt that the Soviet planning system has been a powerful engine for economic growth....</i> ""<p><a href=""http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/12/paul_samuelson_rip.php",
