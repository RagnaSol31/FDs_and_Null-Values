Risk and entrepreneurship is considered normal and a desirable thing to do. Due to this I know a lot of types of businesses and get access to data of their revenues and profitability.<p>The most profitable businesses I have seen built in the past 5 years, are brick and mortar, infrastructure and real estate businesses. These are not VC funded, or typical for the HN crowd. These are very offline businesses, built on angel capital (friends and family), then institutional bank loans and then directly public money via small IPOs at the best outliers.<p>A few of these businesses make $100MN+ revenues and the scenarios in which they reached here, was the Government + private contractor nexus. Privileged access to information and contracts is the only case where I have seen hockey stick growths of revenue in India. Most of the profitability comes from ""cutting corners"".<p>These businessmen/women stay off the public radar, typically run massively profitable businesses.<p>Most of them wouldn't consider going to a VC. Private Equity, sometimes yes.<p>So, in view, its a great time to be in India and to build infrastructure projects, brick and mortar things. A ""relationship"" with the Government officials is almost a necessary condition to get the contracts. I don't know how honest you can remain in this business, but I have seen so many examples of real startup like hockey stick growth. Hustlers is the word I can think of people who succeed in this type of environment.",1369990431.0

In this case they're using a single atom probe to measure a large organic molecule, apparently the ratio is small enough.<p>> Resulting movements of the stylus are detected by a laser beam<p>I guess in order to engineer a system this small, you need a probe to measure the probe.

If the warming trend for a century is 2 C, then the warming trend per decade is also 0.2 C.  Thus a flat decade is readily explainable by normal variation.  If the warming trend is instead 1.5 C per century, then a 15 year stall becomes even more reasonable than a decade had been under a faster rise.<p>The golden question then becomes how this study found a 0.15 C rise in temperature from data over the last decade.
