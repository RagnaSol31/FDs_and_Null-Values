It will simply be a small portfolio site and some email addresses, etc just a virtual company. I have been doing contracts that are structured from person/entity I am dealing with => me.<p>I have been looking for another dev. to help share responsibilities with and who would have a complimentary skill set. I am a full-stack JS dev and capable with RoR s/he would be php/mobile so we could provide a full service agency.<p>I have owned the domain for a couple months, and the mail servers are hosted by zoho.com and set up with basic functionality(i.e dev@,hello@,hr@ ) etc.<p>If I bring someone else on, especially since the company is unincorporated, I will be taking on liability. I was going to just structure the contracts company => both of us in a 50/50 split, but things like ownership of code, ownership of the website, breach of contract are concerning me.<p>The cofounder would be a stranger, further complicating matters. Does anyone have advice on how to protect myself with contracts instead of incorporation? I want to continue to take contracts and expand but don&",
