The suicide rate for Foxconn this year was 1.5 per 100,000 making it well below the national average (around 7% the national average). Even if calculated as if all the employee deaths were from the Shenzhen factory complex alone (to simulate a localised area suicide rate), which in 2010 had a workforce of 450,000, the rate is still well below the national average at 3.11 per 100,000 (around 14% the national average).""<p>Also worth pointing out, that this is significantly lower than the US suicide rate, as documented by the national institute for mental health [2].<p>Please stop propagating this myth.<p>Also, this took me LESS THAN THIRTY SECONDS OF RESEARCH.

19,3611787,comment,3611661.0,3611765.0,8,0,shingen,,,"Interestingly, Apple is placing the customer first by charging what they do.<p>Why? Because you couldn't do what Apple does with a 5% profit margin. They can ignore Wall Street, creditors (which they don't have), sharks, hostile investors (Carl Icahn etc), and so on all because they generate a healthy profit.<p>Who thinks it would be a good situation for Apple to be begging at Bill Gates' (ala 1997; whomever it might be) knees in the future if something goes wrong with an iPhone launch? I'm betting their customers don't think it would be good.<p>If Apple's customers love their products, it's in the interest of those customers to keep funding Apple's ability to keep doing what it does. What Apple does costs a lot of money. One slip at their scale could easily cost $10 billion. A 5% margin would not cover that.<p>If their next data center costs $5 billion in cash to build due to ever increasing scale and complexity, and they had had 5% margins all this time, it might be a stretch to pull it off (maybe with debt). If the global complexities of navigating a world wide mobile product increase to ever bigger scale, that 5% margin wouldn't cut it. I couldn't imagine trying to manage the iPhone at 100 million in sales, on a 5% margin. They're not selling jelly beans.<p>How about if Foxconn keeps having to raise wages by 15% to 25% per year for the next ten years. Again, 5% margins would not cut it. Or if that did happen, and Apple then finds it more cost effective to build completely automated robotic assembly systems, but it costs $20 billion to R&D and construct that... and so on and so forth.",1329727908.0

Scientific backing is not a requirement for me to try something (as long as it's safe to try, of course).<p>Of course, me trying something out also constitutes a form of science (with a sample size of n=1 and no placebo controls, but at least I find out if it works for me).<p>That being said, I haven't given NLP a serious try (yet). I have a bunch of books on it but I find it hard to get started for some reason. Maybe I need a coach, but their rates are typically way out of my league.<p>Here's an example of a book I own, which is NLP-based: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Make-People-Like-Seconds-Less/dp/0761149465/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Make-People-Like-Seconds-Less/dp/07611...</a><p>The premise of that book is pretty damn appealing. Perhaps you see now why I'm interested in this area.<p>My overall impression of NLPers is sleaziness and trying to milk me for money via their uber-expensive seminars. However, I'm still going to try and find out if the techniques are useful to me, since I do know people in my social circle for whom they seem to work.<p>The main thing I like about NLP is how it breaks down thought. It doesn't just see ""thoughts"" as atomic, but rather asks about mental images, internal dialogue, emotional associations, etc (ie the VAKOG model of sensory representation - Visual Auditory Kinesthetic Olphactory Gustatory).<p>All in all, I don't think I need to be karma-bitchslappad just for asking a question.

38,3611768,comment,3609485.0,3611418.0,2,0,ekianjo,,,"Good comment. I do not agree with everything you said, so let me elaborate a little.<p>1 - Eating too much is not the issue. Eating too much of the wrong things is the issue.<p>No, I assure that even if you eat too much healthy food, you will grow fat and obese the same. Unhealthy food may make it worse for a number of reasons, but excess is anyway going to be a problem, no matter what you eat.<p>2 - Unhealthy foods are cheaper than fresh fruits, veggies, and meat by an almost comically large margin. This is due to a number of causes, most saliently massive government subsidization of unhealthy food industries.<p>First, I would not classify ""meat"" as healthy food. That probably depends on your education and your view of meat, but you get a lot of fat percentage for the amount of calories. 50 years ago people were eating meat probably like 10 times less that we are and were (probably, I dont have numbers with me now) less sick. For your second point, ""unhealthy"" food is, I think, rather the result of people not considering food as important. Therefore food becomes a commodity. People prefer spending their money on vacation, video games, buying the latest smartphone and so on. Even those who HAVE the money. It's clearly a cultural problem: food has lost ""value"" per se. I do not know where you live so I cannot comment on that, but in most developped countries governments are also massively subsidizing small-sized farms (true in Europe and some parts of Asia at least).<p>3a. I agree with the time element, but I disagree in the responsibility. Of course, if one feels like you have to watch 4 hours of dumb TV shows every night to be satisfied with their lives, then there will no time for cooking. But anyone who can spare 30-45 mins a day in the evening can cook something healthy. Of course, it will not be something complex, but it is feasible. Please do not tell you need longer than that, of I will have to film myself cooking to prove my point.<p>3b. Now if you cannot even afford a car I admit this is a problem, especially in North America. Then it makes access to quality food more difficult. I can't argue on that one.<p>3c. Allright, of course there are poors who live in the worst conditions ever, and putting good food on the table is far from their priorities. But come on, when we talk about the obesity epidemic, we are talking about something like 33% of the whole US population having this obesity problem. You cannot seriously tell me that 33% of the US is composed of poor people living in crime-ridden suburbs. (<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/trends.HTML"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/trends.HTML</a>)<p>A number of these 33% HAVE the money, HAVE the time, HAVE the means to eat good food, but decide not to. For a lot of these people, this IS a lifestyle choice. There is noway around that, and there would be no epidemic if this was confined to the ""poor/rich"" rhetoric.",1329727215.0

96,3611707,comment,3609418.0,3611459.0,2,0,barrkel,,,"Parser combinator libraries are usually just embedded DSLs for constructing data structures (implicitly or explicitly) that are then interpreted during traversal, mostly in a way which has equivalent power to LL(1) or LL with backtracking - and frequently without the advantages of a ""proper"" analysis, such as detection of grammar ambiguities that you need first and follow sets to find. They're very cute, IMO; an appealing piece of hackery. I wouldn't try and push them much beyond fairly small ad-hoc parsing problems though. At core, they are a form of metaprogramming, where the text of your combinator expressions is a program that writes a program, and the extra distance your code needs to go through to get to the hardware is liable to introduce problems: either unforseen issues with the library, unexpected overuse of CPU or memory, or hard to diagnose errors.<p>PEGs, meanwhile, are all-out backtracking exponential matchers that try and get back the performance by spending memory on memoizing. A PEG parser would be my last choice in writing a parser, unless I had to recognize a complex language with no tools and almost no time, but plentiful CPU and memory. With tools, I'd prefer GLR parsing if the problem is hard enough; with time, I'd prefer hand-written LL(k) recursive descent, which gives substantial flexibility. Most commercial compilers use hand-written recursive descent for a reason.<p>In summary, if you have good knowledge of even just LL(1) alone, you should be able to understand how both parser combinator libraries and PEG parsers work very easily, and also see why they can be problematic. So I wouldn't be too fast to dismiss the book as dated.",1329725112.0

While I have tried to perform each test as fairly and\n  accurately as possible, it would be foolish to consider these results as\n  scientific in any way.""\n</code></pre>\nAs others have said here, comparing frameworks can be very apples-to-oranges. Still though, I do think that this type of stuff can be interesting and has its place.<p>As to the ""why isn't XYZ listed?"" questions: This started as a pet project of mine out of pure curiosity, so I initially only included frameworks that I was familiar with.
