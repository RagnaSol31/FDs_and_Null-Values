It must be reinforced with actions which may not look like they have an immediate positive impact on the company. However, employees are the only thing a company has in the end. A happy and motivated employee is many times more valuable to a company than a miserable unmotivated one, and the investment is worth it. We hope to keep this up as we grow.",1407917617.0

However, here at 15Five, and at one other job, I honestly felt like the company truly cared for its employees.<p>Of course the company must make money, and of course it must hire people and pay them a salary in order to get that done. You would have to be disillusioned to think that just because a company has values and a culture it will ignore all else. But there can be more than than that to it, and in this case, there is. Taking good care of employees and treating them right while providing a comfortable environment DOES pay dividends to the company. I cannot imagine a better win-win.<p>Many people are probably disillusioned because they have been burned in the past. They no longer believe in values, culture, and WHY. I cannot blame them. Fool me once, they say, right? However, I want to throw this out there and say that there are still places where employees are treated like people, like the work they do, are satisfied and fairly rewarded. Calling that an illusion is not fair just because you have not had a chance to experience that.",1407917354.0
