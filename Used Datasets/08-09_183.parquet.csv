Given that the vast majority of algorithms don't get patented, and that the vast majority of patents never get licensed except in bulk cross-licensing deals, this seems almost entirely untrue.<p>Aside from that, I'd point out that in the rare case when an algorithm <i>does</i> get published as a patent and licensed, that makes it entirely unusable in Free and Open Source Software as well as in open standards, for a period of ~20 years.  At least when the algorithm remains unpublished, someone can re-discover it (or something more useful that would build on it); patents force willful ignorance of an entire class of algorithms, as well as anything in the general vicinity of those algorithms.",1325840324.0

Derivative works are authored all the time. Most of what Disney ever produced is derived from popular classics from the 18th / 19th centuries (I remember that in ""The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"", the original author, Victor Hugo, isn't even credited).<p>I think it's wrong to frame the debate as ""copyright versus no copyright at all""; it would be more useful to discuss <i>copyright length</i>. But what has been happening thus far is that copyright proponents have cried wolf, advocated for longer and longer copyright protections, and stronger and meaner tools of enforcement, AND IT WORKED.<p>And there we are, discussing SOPA, or having to live with HADOPI (crazy French law voted last year).<p>It's only fair that reasonable people who think shorter copyright terms would be desirable, and SOPA should never have been drafted, become less reasonable, in order to be heard.<p>I think that's what ""zero copyright"" advocates are doing; and maybe they have a case. Would a society with zero copyright be ""<i>radically different</i>""? Let's see. Would ""<i>most people oppose those changes</i>""? Let's ask them!<p>We need to frighten the MPAA just as the MPAA has been frightening everyone. ""Stop pushing or lose it all"" is a start.",1325840111.0

Many Indian IT companies in the mid-late 90's conducted exams with difficult programming puzzles in them. This was great for a while, but soon those who wrote these exams told everyone else and the puzzle pool dried up. Future groups scored really well due to being better prepared against a known pool of puzzles. These days most IT companies have moved on to SAT/GRE style analytical problems.<p>Imagine your luck if you are at a Google interview and already know the Pascal triangle. You can just put up an act pretending to analyze various aspects before unveiling your grand solution.<p>If companies are merely using analytical ability as a filter, a SAT/GRE style exam will do better because the problem pool is much larger making it less vulnerable to preparation.",1325839567.0

But that takes me back to my original point; I love my Kindle, have read all of cstross's articles on the challenge of ebooks, and don't have any problem calling an ebook a ""real"" book. And from both a technical and philosophical perspective, I understand and sympathize with leanpub (and thanks for the links; this is the first I've heard of your company, and it's great to see you've put so much thought into it).<p>My original point was simply that I can appreciate the interative nature of writing a manuscript, and getting feedback is essential. But I think there are large swaths of literature which are simply not suitable for the average consumer to provide that kind of feedback, because the very process of reading the draft ruins your ability to enjoy the end result.

Two reasons for this. a) Adults typically do not know how to learn period. b) Adults have been conditioned to do the wrong things in attempting to learn and all books and courses are built around these wrong ideas.<p>Most important way to evaluate your learning is to ask yourself ""Do I feel like a stupid idiot as I do this?"" If the answer is YES, then you are learning. Keep it up and get to love your stupid idiot self. In time the clouds will clear and you will not be stupid anymore. Lots of people have warped adult egos which simply cannot accept these feelings of stupidity. Some people actually kill themselves because of this, others drop the studying entirely, and others soldier through and learn nothing because they have not accepted the feelings of stupidity and moved forward in spite of it.",1325839362.0

28,3432556,comment,3431492.0,3431492.0,1,0,wavetossed,,,"Be careful with online translators. They often warp the meanings of things. I find them most useful using this process.<p>First read the text (a few sentences) in the foreign language. Then run it through the translator, because you can only understand half of it and there are some key words that have you lost. Read the English translation keeping in mind that it is WRONG. However it will have clues about the structure of sentences, the meaning of unfamiliar words, etc. In this step you are not learning the foreign language, you are learning some POSSIBLE solutions to the problem of understanding the text.<p>Now go back and read the foreign language text from the top. You will find that miraculously your brain can now read and understand it almost 100%. Occasionally you will be forced to check the dictionary for a word that suffers from the problem discovered in 1966 when researchers ran ""The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak"" through and English-Russian translator and then back again through a Russian English translator. They got back ""The vodka is good but the meat is rotten"".<p>I also used this back and forth translation to check my Russian letters before I sent them. I wrote in Russian without a dictionary, then translated it back into English with an online translator. I often found words where I had chosen the wrong one of several possibilities.<p>Nowadays when people ask me ""What is the X language word for Y?"" I say, it cannot be translated. In general it is not possible to translate an English word into another language or vice versa. That is why I recommend keeping phrase lists rather than word lists because you get a bit of context which is what determines meanings.<p>When you use a dictionary and there are 10 possible translations for ""find"", look up each of the possibilities in the foreign language section and you will not only find the best word to express what you mean, you will also learn how fuzzy a lot of our English words are, and don't ask me about ""get"" and ""put"".",1325839043.0

47,3432534,comment,3431492.0,3431492.0,3,0,wavetossed,,,"Native language is English, French and Spanish in high school. German and Russian in university. I can read books written at an adult level in French, high school level in Spanish. I've used French in sales meetings with customers in Paris, and once I even presented a solution in French on my own. Learned German to an advanced level through company lessons (in London) and podcasts from Deutsche Welle. I am almost fluent in Russian, have traveled independently in Russia and Ukraine, romanced a girl on the phone in Russian, then visited her and ultimately married her. I say almost fluent because although I can watch Russian films and TV, I stumble with business/work scenarios. 10 years ago I was at the ""almost fluent"" level with Spanish after living in the Bay Area, CA, listening to hispanic radio on my commutes, reading the free Spanish language newspapers, and chatting (or ordering) in Spanish in every shop or restaurant that I visited. I am also competent enough in Italian to have traveled independently in Italy twice, once without even reserving a hotel in advance. I also spent two weeks in Bulgaria and was able to find a bus and wander around the town of Varna, shopping and visiting museums, all on the strenght of the Bulgarian I learned in the month before travel and by reading books (and listening to people) during the two weeks.<p>Why the long song and dance? Because I did it and I know how to do it. It is actually quite simple and is obvious if you think it over a bit. You have to work at it EVERY day, 365 days a year. Spend an hour or more a day. Find ways to extend that time whenever you can, for instance turn on the Spanish audio on a DVD and English subtitles instead of watching TV in English.<p>Second thing to do is to exercise all of the language senses EVERY DAY! If you sit down with a language book and spend all day Saturday on a couple of lessons learning them by heart then you are doing it wrong, wasting your time and will soon drop the studying entirely.<p>Every day you must read some of the language. Every day you must write, preferably full sentences or phrases, not just vocabulary words. For instance if you learn that sombrero means hat, then write ""El muchacho no sabe donde esta su sombrero"" or at least ""un sombrero blanco"" at the very minimum.<p>Every day you must listen to the language. In some countries there is easy access to TV or radio signals, but everyone who can read this can download podcasts. Listening to the CD that came with a course does not count. Sure, do listen to the CD, but don't check off listening until you listen to some language in the wild, so to speak.<p>Every day you must speak the language. In the beginning you can get away with reading a page out loud even if you don't understand the words. But preferably you should be speaking with native speakers. I get a free newspaper handed out every morning outside the transit station by a Chinese guy so I always say ""Xie xie) which means thank you. When I took my daughter to a birthday party and entered a room of Chinese girls I said ""Ni men hao"" which means hello everyone. Yep, I am working on yet another language since I live in China now (the North American part commonly called Vancouver BC).<p>And you must also spend a reasonable chunk of time everyday talking to imaginary friends entirely in the new language. Don't speak out loud, but hold the conversation in your head as you walk to the subway, or take a lunchtime jog. Often you will not be able to fully express your thoughts because you lack the vocabulary so practice describing what you want to say. For instance, if you don't know the word tree but want to say ""See the bird up in that tree"" then try saying ""See the bird up in that big plant, the really high one beside the park bench. What is that called?"" When you get advanced enough, that kind of mental maneuvering will actually help you recall words that you had once learned but half forgotten.<p>Don't fuss over courses. Go to a good bookstore with a wide selection and browse through the books. Buy one or two whose writer seems to write in a way that you can understand and will not get bored with. When you are more advanced look for specific types of books. A comprehensive dictionary. A grammar book. A vocabulary builder book.<p>Buy some books written for 8 year olds in the foreign language. Stick to books written by a native speaker of the language where the action of the story is set in a country where this language is spoken. Especially avoid books originally written in English that were translated. When you can get through one of these, buy some books for 10 year olds, then 12, then 14 year olds. After that go to adult books. The age thing is important because young people do not have large vocabularies. Therefore childrens' book editors spend a lot of time editing books so the child will learn the meaning of new words from the context. You will learn them too and save much time that would have been spent with the dictionary.",1325838343.0

If you're interviewing with that expectation, you'll have a huge false negative rate and only hire people with nerves of stainless steel. Even experienced programmers can make very silly mistakes when coding under pressure in front of an audience.<p>What you're expecting to see is that the person can reason, knows the basic syntax of the language he claims to be familiar with, and doesn't make any mistakes that show a total misunderstanding or unfamiliarity of how it works. (Put differently, have they read a book/website of examples of the language, or have they actually <i>coded</i> in it?)<p>If you point the experienced programmer that's very nervous a few of his mistakes, you're expecting him to show sheer terror and panic as he realizes what he's done [2]. If the candidate is showing you a blank stare instead, you might have a problem.<p>If you're only verbally interviewing and asking for code samples, you can get fooled easily. Some candidates think that if they can bullshit their way through the interview, they'll stay hired. And sometimes, they're even right, because most people don't like to fire.<p>At some point, we were having serious problems filling positions and started de-emphasizing doing bad/mediocre on the coding part of the interview, and focus more on the experience and verbal interview, on the assumption radiated in many posts here that serious coders might not necessarily be able to show their ability in a coding interview. <i>All</i> of those hires turned out to bad.<p>You'll have a hard time convincing me now that coding interviews aren't effective.<p>[1] The example here is FizzBuzz. Why is it so <i>trivial</i> that many people can't believe it works? Because even good coders will fuck up more complicated questions in interviews.<p>[2] Just as an observation and nothing more: experienced coders tend to also not being able to bear the sight of those mistakes and insist on being allowed to correct them even if told it <i>really</i> doesn't matter.",1325837928.0

[1]<p>Your cancer stat is true for prostate and breast cancer, but Japan has the best rates for some other types of cancers [2], and importantly Japanese people actually develop much less cancer[2.1], one reason for which is much better preventative medical care (for average people); the average Japanese person sees a doctor three times more often than the average Americans, and have three times more MRI scans[3].<p>Speaking of MRI machines, Japan has twice as many of them per capita than does the USA[4], and routinely uses them for preventive care. I've lived in both, and my government health insurance in Japan routinely covers MRI scans for preventive and diagnostic purpose, while my employer-suplied HMO in the states refused <i>all</i> MRI scans until actual debilitation had already occured.<p>A colleague just had a baby here, and not only is the care better than the USA (more visits, less waiting, better outcomes for <i>typical</i> people), health care for the baby is <i>free</i> until the baby is 15. Another reason that baby will see a health care professional more often.<p>I used to believe that American health care was the best, too. We hear it all the time growing up. And we spend so much. But then I moved abroad, and it turned out everything I thought I knew was wrong.<p>It's just like saying ""American education is the best in the world!""<p>Sure it is... at M.I.T. and Stanford, maybe. Across the vast majority of the population in public schools? Not so much.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality",

Looks like you're off by a factor of 1000, since Wolfram is saying the total is 131.6m sq. miles (487k sq. km). [1] But what's three orders of magnitude among friends...<p>The Antarctic Ross ice shelf is about 188k sq. miles, and up to 750m thick. Again according to Wolfram Alpha, that makes 3.65310^17 L  (liters) of ice. 92% of that is 3.3610^17 L  (liters).<p>And if you spread that many liters over the (Wolfram Alpha) area of the the oceans, you get nearly a meter sea level rise (0.9856). That's one (albeit large) shelf.<p>The Greenland ice sheet comes to almost 4.2710^18 L  (liters) of ice (based on numbers from Wikipedia and an average thickness of 2.5km) [2]. We're up another factor of 10 here, with 12.530 meters of rise now.<p>According to WikiPedia, the Antarctic Ice Sheet contains 30m cubic km of ice, and they claim it's worth 70m of ocean depth. [3]<p>But let's crunch some numbers. If you assume 92% density you get 2.7610^7 km^3. Again in Alpha I get 80.96m [4], or 265'. The truth is that, as the sea level rises, the SURFACE AREA will change (because so much land will be flooded), and so even though the combined rise of all ice melting might be 300' at the current area of the oceans, the estimates are that it would only rise about 200', plus or minus.<p>So how do the numbers not agree with me? THIS is why it's useless to take an engineer's view of something like climate change. Misplace a decimal point (or cube when you really mean 4pi r squared) and suddenly you're making all kinds of crazy assumptions. And yes, I forgot the surface area of a sphere too, but the more serious error is assuming your rusty memory of a math equation can prove that ALL THE EXPERTS are wrong and you're smarter than they are.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=area+of+all+oceans&asynchronous=false&equal=Submit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=area+of+all+oceans&...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_ice_sheet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_ice_sheet</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Ice_Sheet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Ice_Sheet</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2830+million+cubic+km+*+0.92%29%2F%283.409%C3%9710%5E8+km%5E2%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2830+million+cubic+km+...</a>",1325837657.0

63,3432518,comment,3431709.0,3432360.0,3,0,zvrba,,,"How does it have negative effect?  Consider three cases: 1) an algorithm is designed and patented, and the inventor has the right to use or license it. 2) an algorithm is designed and never published, i.e., held secret for proprietary use of the inventor. 3) an algorithm is designed and put into public domain.<p>With 3), the inventor never gets a chance to commercialize his invention: as soon as he publishes the algorithm, he will be destroyed (or assimialted) by large players. With 2), we never know how many cool, useful algorithms are rotting away in commercial products. As far as the society is concerned, the algorithm in question does not exist. With 1), the inventor benefits, AND also the society (in the long-term).<p>IMO, the patent system should be reformed so that having a large portfolio of <i>unused</i> patents becomes a liability. For example, the patent holder would have to periodically (e.g., every 2 years) apply [with fee, of course] for patent renewal. For this, the holder must be able to document that he is actively exploiting the patent (1).  There should also probably be a minimum limit for the required income from patent exploitation. Failing to do so, the patent would automatically expire. The patent office should publish an on-line database of expired patents.<p>There should also be restrictions on what can be patented: for example, work funded by government funds must not be patentable: the inventors' (in this case, mostly researchers at universities) day job is <i>by definition</i> designing things that will benefit society, are paid for that by the society, and therefore have no further rights to patent protection. (This is, IMO, fair since research is [should be] free, so the society has no firm guarantees that the researchers will produce something valuable, or anything at all.)<p>(1) By exploitation I mean either making a device covered by the patent, or licensing it to somebody who making such device.",1325837638.0
