What is being discussed in this thread is how to bridge the gap, but to suggest that information flow ""should be dictated by the recipient"" <i>instead</i> of permitting fine-grained sharing misses the <i>entire point</i> of Google+'s approach to sharing.<p>Allowing the recipient to dictate information flow is excellent for self-promotion, marketing, and news broadcast. It doesn't make sense for how people interact with friends, family, drinking buddies, and colleagues.",1310461190

Practical industry experience. I understand the full software development lifecycle. I know what it's like to work on boring, unchallenging projects and I like to think know what get's people excited about going to work in the morning.<p>2. I'm self-aware. I know our industry is universally hated by clients and candidates alike. I understand exactly why our industry has a terrible reputation and I actively conduct my business in the opposite manner to what you may have come to expect from recruiters. I don't 'key word match', money is not my primary focus, I don't try and shoe-horn candidates into roles that won't interest them and when it comes to clients I find out everything I need to know at the beginning and I try to be as unintrusive as physically possible throughout the process.",1310460545

That's endemic to any anonymous forum; the only thing that varies is the level and amount of abuse. Anonymity has its advantages, but this is an inescapable disadvantage.<p>2. People's reading comprehension aren't perfect, or even all that great. People -- myself included -- often seem to miss points being made in discussions and subsequently leap to conclusions that are usually a result of some combination of their own mood, biases, and prejudices.<p>3. I personally don't see anything wrong with you doing recruiting work here -- <i>so long as you advertise it clearly as such and make it entirely opt-in</i>. i.e., there are monthly posts on HN for people looking for work (freelance and otherwise), and as long as you were clear and asked them ahead of time if they were interested, it shouldn't be a problem. That's just my take on it though, others here may have some strong aversion to recruiters or something.<p>You do have a lot of value to offer here, you just have to be careful about that line between offering value and taking advantage -- just as everyone else does here.",1310460528

No one in the world needs to have more than 10 million dollars in total wealth.  Not just a 100% tax on income over that amount; I mean a 100% tax on appraised wealth over that amount.<p>The additional tax revenue is divided by the country's population size as a small, baseline income to every citizen. Everyone gets a small income.<p>The main reason for doing this isn't to punish the rich; no one can cry at having 10 million, inflation-adjusted.  It's to deflate power.

On-wire messaging in binary destroys transparency, which means PITA debugging and wasted programmer and API-using developer time. Programmer time is far more important than computer time or a few bytes of bandwidth in most developed nations.\n4. You have to pay for the binary serialisation with additional client-side code, which means you've actually gone backwards until you've communicated enough that the delta between JSON and binary format message sizes have outgrown this initial load time penalty.\n5. Initial load time penalties are often more important than subsequent use, since generally this is the only time client bandwidth (the only side of the bandwidth equation relevant to performance in 99.99% of cases) is going to be challenged to any serious level.\n6.
