The USD hasn't dropped in value by 50% in the last two years.<p>Most of currency is fluctuation is fluctuation <i>relative to other currencies</i>. If the price of the Icelandic krona plummets relative to USD and GBP, it doesn't mean that all the prices in Iceland immediately rise to compensate. People in Iceland are still paid in krona and buy things in krona for approximately the same number of krona.<p>But if the price of BTC rises suddenly, prices <i>do</i> suddenly decrease because at the moment it's just a proxy. There's no real internal market: there aren't people who are paid in BTC and have their savings account in BTC and make their mortgage payments in BTC and buy their food in BTC.<p>So BTC really isn't like other currencies. It's fluctuating massively <i>even from an internal market perspective</i>.",1364893173.0

5,5478315,comment,5477405.0,5477733.0,5,0,zeteo,,,"I don't even think CEOs are paid for their contacts. If you look at the number of CEOs who jump to unrelated industries, it's doubtful many of their contacts carry along. Also if contacts were so paramount, sales people would have an almost insuperable advantage - it is their job to fatten their rolodex everyday; whereas people from other departments can and often do become CEO.<p>I've been reading a lot of Thorstein Veblen lately, who is very thought provoking; and I think what he would say (not that I completely agree, but it's an interesting viewpoint) is that CEOs are paid to be the right social class. The board of directors prefer to rub shoulders with someone they can easily relate to; a person who, say, plays a decent game of golf and can casually discuss the market for mansions as well as the features of the latest model Porsche. (Let's be serious, all else being equal we all prefer interacting with someone who shares our interests.) So they are willing to sacrifice 0.1% of the company's bottom line in return for smoother interaction with the person who will, in effect, be their main point of contact. People who already earn a lot of money (and would, of course, not switch for a decreased salary) thus have a big advantage when interviewing for the chief position. In fact, if nobody in the company is already living a sufficiently wealthy lifestyle, this model would suggest it's more likely for an outsider to be brought in (upon, say, acquisition).",1364893019.0

Credit is tight - money appreciates without being invested and borrowers have to repay debts in more expensive currency tomorrow, making them more likely to default [Fisher]. People with money benefit - the rich get richer and the banks hoard capital, refusing to make loans. Inflation fuels asset bubbles as the economy over-invests; deflation fuels the opposite as the economy starves itself.<p>Yes, we have seen deflation. The U.S. and U.K. both experienced crippling deflation in the 1930s [1]. Before that, remember the American populist movement's ""Cross of Gold"" speech [2]? That wasn't a reaction to an inflationary gold standard. The euro zone offers a more contemporary view of the effects of deflation, as does my Switzerland [3].<p>Uncertainty in the future path of deflation that is more toxic than deflation <i>per se</i>. The U.S. grew through the Great Deflation in the 1870s and Japan has had mixed real effects from its almost two decade deflation [Morana]. Theoretically, if deflation proceeded at a steady clip, markets could accommodate (Milton Friedman advocated for an economy deflating at the real interest rate [Friedman]).<p>But what if we have two currencies, e.g. U.S. dollars and Bitcoin? Argentinians have a choice between black market (or ""blue"") dollars and an available but inflating peso. Tellingly, Argentinians buy dollars primarily for overseas vacations [4]. This is an example of a bad currency (the peso) and a good (the greenback). The Argentinians still execute the bulk of their transactions in pesos, not dollars.<p>Deflation is not likely to be Bitcoin's death knell, but rather a ceiling on its usage. A deflating Bitcoin will crimp transaction demand for the currency as spenders shift preference to more easily borrowed and spent dollars. Sellers would respond in kind (or, alternatively, sellers who respond in kind would gain market share).<p>Caveat: if Bitcoins are treated as a financial asset, for speculating versus spending. If so, deflation would proceed un-checked, with speculators driving out the transaction value of the currency. That said, gold has survived both deflation and speculation, so this isn't a fatal blow either.<p>[Fisher] <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/i332559"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/i332559</a> <i>The Debt Deflation Theory of Great Depressions (1933)</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0143116800/ref=redir_mdp_mobile/178-3104233-1254858"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0143116800/ref=redir_mdp_mobil...</a> <i>See Norman Montagu; British depression</i><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_of_Gold_speech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_of_Gold_speech</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1c23c088-60c3-11de-aa12-00144feabdc0.html",
