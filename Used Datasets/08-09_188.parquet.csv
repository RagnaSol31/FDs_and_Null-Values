18,4640048,comment,4639085.0,4639985.0,3,0,ErrantX,,,"Always charge expenses.<p>Of course, that depends on the expense. Generally I'd say if you need to overnight then it is an expense to charge for - if you're driving for an hour then definitely don't :) (in the UK we can get tax relief for mileage in relation to our business, so I generally don't charge for travel if I have to drive less than 3 hours - otherwise I end up being ""paid"" twice :D). Taking the piss with expenses (one place I worked hired an consultant analyst who literally charged for everything - including the 30p it cost him to use the toilet at the train station) is as bad as not charging them.<p>If they want you because you bring value they will happily pay this cost. On the other hand if they are put off by this added fee then they are probably not the sort of client you want - especially as those costs are probably a small portion of what they are paying you for a days work!<p>On the other hand; if you soak up expenses to get that contract you are a) in the mindset of letting them set the rate (even if they never knew about it) and b) eating into your profits. Neither is a good situation to be in (next time they might want you all week, and that can get expensive fast).<p>However; I don't know about your situation, but if you don't live in the valley why are you trying to compete in the market there? I live in the countryside in the UK and used to believe my main market would always be London (~3 1/2 hours away by car, less by train). I've learned this is nonsense, and even the nearest towns to me have LOTS of developer work available.<p>You might also think that being out of the hub means less money. I've also found this to be untrue in practice, because <i>no one works out here</i> (they are all focusing on the big cities). Desperation for quality talent means that often, more money is on the table.",1349945559.0

It was addictive, but not because there was an endless ocean of content; I don't know if I could think of a more useless circlejerk on the net. It was addictive because you were always waiting. Always clicking refresh, a separate tab open for every thread you'd commented in that night. Always hoping as the page slowly rendered that someone had replied.<p>As we head head first into the future, notifications are continuing on the asymptote towards real-time-all-the-time, which is to say that it's the norm nowadays to get updates on the things you care about, your facebook and your tumblr and your twitter, as quickly as possible, and I just wonder if maybe we've drawn our graph wrong. Because, at the end of the day, the driving forces behind these sites are more about satisfying ego than they are about connecting or friendship or ""social"", and when you completely remove the need for users to actually go to your site and put in their internet hours to get that dopamine hit that comes from a like or a comment or a reply, you're incentivising people to sit staring at their inbox instead of at your app.<p>The thing about forums is the grand prize, the little bit of internet satisfaction you get when you see that (1) in the title of a tab, is inseparable from the interaction; you can't know if anyone's talking to you if you don't look at every response. I wasted a lot of time waiting for replies on the Bungie.net forums but, in doing so, I continued to read and comment and engage, opening more tabs to more threads, wearing out my f5, going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole until I finally made the decision to turn off the monitor and get some sleep.<p>Last night I went to bed at a timely hour with my phone on my nightstand, nothing on my mind, and full knowledge that if anything I cared about happened, I had something that would let me know.<p>Just a couple of thoughts I had that are tangentially related to RockMelt...",1349945328.0

The idea is that the company needs the money to fund growth.\nand (b) a chance for early shareholders to cash out, more easily than via private stock sales.<p>The awkward part is that (a) and (b) tend to contradict each other -- why would you sell your share if the company is growing? (good answer: you need to sell a bit to buy a house. bad answer: you think the company has no upside potential)<p>If Facebook chose to go public 2 years ago at $20/share, it may well have seen the same hype-driven runup. Or maybe the pre-IPO pre-SEC private market auctions fed a 2-year bubble driving the stock up to ~35 based on wishful thinking and non-SEC-approved financial speculation, and the IPO was the cresting wave that took the stock close to 40 just as the wave broke and reality set in.",1349944459.0

If you're really unlucky about where you are and how the options are arranged, you might even get taxed based on the market price on <i>exercise</i>. E.g. Norway at least used to be that way a while back unless you took specific precautions to get the options issued under an approved scheme.<p>It's something to be aware of, as it means a lot of people might not be able to afford to exercise the options before they're ready to sell the shares, which means your total gains gets taxed as income most places (as opposed to if you see the company on a nice upwards trajectory and exercise and wait, in which case you may end up paying only capital gains and in some cases depending on where you are might end up paying reduced capital gains rates on the growth from your exercised onwards). The difference between a good and bad options plan can easily be 50%+ tax (e.g. UK, if you're careless you might pay 53.8% - top rate income tax + national insurance + employers national insurance contributions, vs. 10% if your company qualifies for certain incentive schemes for startups and the options plan is structured right..)<p>It might seem great to have a really low strike price, but if you expect to be in it for the long haul and might contemplate exercising options before you're ready to sell your shares, talk to a tax lawyer before agreeing to options terms.",1349943169.0
