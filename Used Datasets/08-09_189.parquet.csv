Instantly this rubbed me up the wrong way; anyone who knows about Google Analytics knows that the login details are tied to Google accounts. Which, in every site I've ever managed, or seen managed, has been the developing company. So I found it really ironic that a company who specialises in SEO doesn't understand how Google Analytics logins work. So I replied with the FTP details, and kindly told them how Google analytics worked and how I needed the SEO company's email address so I could add it to the GA profile. He forwarded that email to the SEO company, and I received an email back, with the same copy-and-pasted dot point list of FTP details (which had already been sent), and Google Analytics login details. They didn't even read my email. And it bothers me that people so incompetent are actually working and making money, and their clients are none the wiser. And that they are probably going to mess with an otherwise really good site I made.<p>Does it bother you when people are incompetent?",1353400194.0

This is especially useful for the numerous plastic-shelled landmines that resist standard detection methods.<p>Using a layered approach with these techniques, civilian demining organisations like Mechem[0] (which pioneered the use of sniffer dogs) are now able to achieve a high enough clearance rate to make areas safe, though the work is expensive and time-consuming.
