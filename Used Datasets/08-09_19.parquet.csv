Changes that need time to take effect cannot be made quickly (the same way it's not a good idea to adjust water temperature quickly while you're showering).<p>* Know yourself: Know your limits, and what makes you tick. Monitor yourself and your friends. Figure out why those people are your friends. (It helps to understand yourself better). What are your weaknesses, what are strengths? Hint: what are the things you enjoyed doing when you were a little kid? Try to find activities / work that's similar to that.<p>* Learn from others: Get to know people, who you respect, and are smarter than you; learn from them. (Also a great way to keep your ego checked)<p>* Remember to spend time with your loved ones. Do it for them, and for you.",1276160395.0

At first I assumed that everyone was like me and that everyone has a strong direction/motivation. I was wrong, most people have no idea at 19 where they want to be. So firstly don't worry about it.<p>You'll get out of University what you put in and at 19 not everyone is in a position to put a lot in. I certainly wasn't. I went to a top University in the UK and basically wasted four years. I came out a lot better off but I didn't milk it for all it was worth. You may consider a gap year but that can be expensive. Taking a year out to work for charity can help you mature and see the world a little. Gap years are no panacea though.<p>Since you don't know your story yet I recommend that you read other people's stories. You can read Founders at Work or something by Bill Gates but first I'd recommend reading Cherry-Garrard's account of Scott's attempt on the South Pole ""The Worst Journey in the World"". It changed my whole perception of life. Scott's team knew there was a good chance they would die. They knew they didn't know HOW to get to the pole. They knew they didn't know how to survive at -60c. It's an amazing story and has inspired me for 10 years now. Most things in life are a mystery but that shouldn't stop you reaching the south pole. Cherry-Garrard himself was too weak and short sited for the trip but showed so much determination and courage that Scott let him join the team.<p>Hopefully you'll find something inspiring. From inspiration comes drive and from drive comes a determination to do something. Since most of the world is a mystery you'll have to look for that something to do but it's out there, somewhere.<p>Anyway, I've prattled on a little like the old fart I am :)<p>Good luck.",1276160390.0

I understand that many of the people on HN them self attended the best colleges they can get. But they were never satisfied with what they learned in college. That is why it is frequently mentioned that it doesn't really matter which college you attend. But assuming that we don't learn anything significant in college there is still a purpose to go. Most of the students when they want to pursue a good academic life go to the reputed institutes because they will have good company and better opportunities. Good institutes have better faculties and facilities. But assuming that you don't mind facilities and the faculties don't mind you there is still the question of the peer group. As I see it the more reputed an institute the better peer group you will have. And that will of course add to your personal growth.

Stronger, faster, smarter, wiser, happier, etc.<p>But the problem with the advice ""put in more effort"" is that it isn't really that helpful. But such is life. The beauty really is in figuring out answers <i>for yourself</i>.<p>When I was younger I was obsessed with finding out answers.  I am very curious and like to learn things so of course I would read and ask people and  go on the internet and try to figure things out - in short, I relentlessly pursued answers.<p>But as I grew older I came to realize that you can't always pursue answers from external sources, because they aren't really that helpful. I am not saying never learn, I am saying answers are only the beginning!<p>Answers are abundant. PG has all the answers about running a startup. Ask any nba player how to be good at basketball and you'll have tons of answers.\nThe internet makes practically any answer ever recorded instantly accessable.<p>This probably sounds like a lot of nonsense but the point is, the answers you really care about and the answers that will shift your life and spur greatness, those answers do not exist in books - you have to figure them out yourself, relative to your self.<p>How do you do that? Be active. Keep trying, never stop, always appreciate, always learn, always read, always be humble, always be kind, be helpful, be aware, be open.<p>See there you go, I guarantee and I will stake my life on the fact that what I am saying is 100% the correct answer. But it doesn't help you much does it?<p>Be a happy, appreciative student of life, stop to say hi to your fellow humans along the way and work hard - you will be smarter my friend.<p>Take care.",1276158396.0
