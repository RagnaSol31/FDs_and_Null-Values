2,784491,story,,,5,6,atiw,Incorporation and stock sharing dilemma,,"Hi everyone,\nThis is my first post here.\nI have been just a silent reader all this time. \nFinally I get to post something as well.\nHope this helps others as well.<p>So, let's get started.\n(P.S. - I am avoiding mentioning names of stuff like university etc, since it will be very<p>embarrassing if this gets read by my future co-founder, as he doesn't know about this dilemma i am facing yet)<p>First, A little background. I graduated as a Master's in CS from a reputable university this<p>summer. I am planning to start this company that uses AI to solve some major NP complete<p>problems related to resource allocation problems. It's planned to be a software product company.<p>This has been a product of my master's thesis.\nSo, obviously the IP(Intellectual Property) is in both mine and my adviser's name. This idea is<p>basically an evolution of his idea, which his earlier students had been trying their hands on,<p>but it didn't quite work as well as it was supposed to be.<p>And finally, I came along and with all my magic touch (If you can believe that), we did it. I<p>started implementing from scratch and finally after one and half years or so, we got it working.\nNow, this product has myriad applications and all that, but we want to focus on two, at most,<p>for now, and see where we go from there. and when i say we, i mean the company.<p>I guess we have enough information now.<p>I have two major questions for you guys.<p>1. I have to incorporate this company sometime this week, since we had a demo last Friday and it<p>went very well. Now, the users are asking for this product, so this is the right time to incorporate and start selling i guess.<p>Now, I am not sure what kind of company it has to be.\nAccording to Ycombinator FAQs, we need to be a C-Corp. I am wondering ""Is that like the common<p>requirement to accept money from any of the other investors as well? or is it just YC? "".\nHow about other types?  LLC? etc etc. I am not even sure what other types are out there, except these and S-corps.\nHow about S-Corps? I have heard about S-Corp but i am not really sure if startups qualify.<p>2. And the more important one. So, I finally had the guts to ask him (my adviser) about our<p>stock distribution as co founders of this new company.\nHis thoughts were the following:<p>""We make it 50-50, except since he will be continuing his full time job as a professor/head of department and I am doing all the coding full time (most of it is done already), I get a fixed salary(not yet decided) first from the revenue and then we evenly get 50-50.""<p>Now, I was all happy with this for a few hours, thinking this is great. I start selling my<p>product, and apply to Ycombinator, which obviously is going to invest once they hear of me, my co founder, my company and my product. And I get to go live in bay area and share the startup experience with you guys.<p>And then i called people to talk about this and share this great news...\nI go : ""Hey, listen, my adviser wants to open a company with me. How cool is that? This is totally awesome. He is a genius, and \nnow he wants to partner with me""<p>Too bad, I had mixed opinions from them and that got me all confused.<p>Here's the thing.\nI am pretty sure he is NOT going to leave his job.\nAnd I am the one who has coded everything in this product.\nBut the initial idea was his. IP is shared between both of us.<p>But if you ask me, he taught me everything related to this idea, and he has been helping me<p>through the worst of my times(I was in a coma, horrible horrible stuff happened to me,and he<p>agreed to give me a chance and guide me , believed in me, when i was almost broke...so....u<p>know...he is like...i don;t know, if you divide god into half....one half....well whatever,<p>that's another long story...maybe later)<p>He is not bringing in any coding to the company, though we always talk through all features of<p>the product and decide it. He is not an MBA, he is more like a head of dept now. He has opened 2<p>startups, he has so much more experience, he is a brilliant guy and i feel so lucky for even<p>being able to work with him. He is like one of the gods of his field. \nBut we haven't decided roles specifically yet. \nAnd someone said that his offer of the whole 50-50 is unfair and all.<p>Now, I am confused here.\nWhat do people do when one of the co founders is technical, but he is more like an abstract<p>adviser, still a top guy in his field in academics?\nand in this case,he is not even going to work  full time for the company.\nbut he is like eric schmidt in some sense, that he actually manages a lot of stuff in his<p>current position (u knw, like eric was working for google and apple until recently, and like he<p>was a chairman for quite some time with google, before he switched over to google as CEO back<p>then).<p>I am not even sure at this point exactly what his role would be. \nI just know what it won't be.\nAlso, his name and reputation follows him.\nHaving him on my side is really good.<p>Just that I don't know how to make sure I don't feel like a fool later on.\nCoz I have read everywhere, it's better to settle all co founders issues from the very beginning<p>and better put things on paper.<p>So, I see these as his plus points:\n1. Co-inventor of the technology.\n2. Great Mentor.\n3. Great qualifications.\n4. Experience.\n5. Good contacts.\n6. Highly Technical guy.<p>And the minus:\n1. I am considerably younger, so getting a buddy like feeling is almost impossible.\n2. I might feel like I am working alone until I get some developers as employees, which might<p>take time since we have the product ready to sell.\n3. Not a coder. \n4. Not full time employee, more like a partner who runs other stuff as well.<p>I am dying to hear from you guys on this.",1251190623.0

In Silicon Valley, I can go to my local farmers market, and I can afford to spend money on organic produce. When I didn't have a car, and lived on the edge of the ghetto in Chicago, it was really easy to get my calories at McDonald's down the street or get crap food at the 7-11 down the block instead of walking 12 blocks each way to the grocery store.</i><p>Scratch all that stuff that defines the where and the why, and just focus on the what. You eat produce: fruits and veggies. That alone is likely why you are much less likely to develop a lifestyle disease than those who chow down McD's. The fact that it is local farmers or organic produce is at best trivial, and likely is statistical noise comparatively.<p>I realize, searching around in the HN history, that this is a matter of identity for some people; I have no intention of starting another pro-con propaganda war regarding organic food in yet another thread. But can we at least concede that produce, regardless of its source and classification, is significantly better than a Big Mac and fries?<p>The last thing we need is for people to decide that, because they can't afford the high class choice in food -- which organics are -- they might as well not bother at all, because someone is going to heckle them for not caring about their health enough. Enough people, <i>especially in neighborhoods like the ones we are discussing</i>, can't decide that organic food is better for them than conventional food. The added cost may drive them into eating sufficiently little they start suffering from malnutrition.

5,784488,comment,783918.0,784474.0,0,0,derefr,,,"You're making two assumptions here.<p>1. I never said it would be a <i>secret</i>. It would be a very publicly stated condition, told to every villager, as part of accepting the aid.<p>2. I never said that the drug would be so blunt an instrument. A drug that dropped any given person's fertility to zero would be completely unacceptable (as I said, actual culture-wide sterilization is as good as genocide, give or take a generation.) Lowering fertility, all by itself (and not as a side-effect of some other drug that people sue because of), isn't something we can even <i>do</i> right now—so if we're going to research it, we may as well figure out how to do it right. That means only affecting those people who have average-or-above fertility, and leaving those with below-average fertility right where they are (or maybe even bringing them <i>up</i> to the lowered average.)<p>See my reply to cwan, though: people can still have as many children as they want—it'll just <i>take</i> them longer, and they may <i>give up</i> before they get to the number they'd like (just as people give up today, only fewer children would be required before they'd decide to.)",1251190552.0

15,784477,comment,783918.0,784406.0,0,0,derefr,,,"The world can't sustain a population coverage similar to that of NYC or HK. Those population centers are supported by millions of acres of farmland that grow the food they eat. If there are <i>enough</i> people, then we don't run out of <i>living space</i> for them... but we <i>do</i> run out of farmland.<p>Secondly, population will peak because of the very factor I mentioned—people in <i>industrial</i> societies are too <i>busy</i> to have kids. However, one important fact about industrial societies is that they constantly seek to improve themselves and gain efficiency. More automation means more people out of work (or consumerism-for-the-sake-of-feeding-the-cycle, but I'm supposing we ignore that option.) Take this to its limit, and no one works (except on creative pursuits, but that won't be <i>everyone</i>.) What do you suppose the rest spend their time doing? I'm thinking population will start shooting <i>straight</i> back up in a post-industrial society. Not because each couple has <i>more</i> kids, but because there are <i>more</i> couples, well, coupling.<p>You haven't explained to me yet what's wrong with sterilization in-and-of-itself; you're using it like Americans tend to use the word ""socialist,"" assuming that it's scary without explaining precisely <i>why</i> it's scary. Couples can still have kids under this scheme. Couples can still have <i>just as many</i> kids. It would just take, say, ten times as long for a couple to conceive (the regular period being a month), meaning that there would be a nine-month ""fallow"" period between pregnancies. Each couple could have the same number of kids, but half the children would end up in the following generational cohort, meaning that the yearly <i>growth rate</i> would be halved. Since conception is harder, some couples would give up after a smaller number of children, lowering the total produced. This is, in the end, a much more lax scheme than even China's one-child rule.<p>I can see where you are coming from in that developing counties need to have their oppression lifted in order to stop ""investing in the future"" with overproduction of children. However, consider this: if you do kill off the warlords, and ensure that all the infant mortality goes away, but leave behind a <i>current</i> population far exceeding their own supply of resources, what will happen to that generation, and the few proceeding from it, before they reach the point where the cultural tradition of overproducing young gives way to an industrial lifestyle? Assuming the resources go unequally distributed, won't those still in poverty try to take those resources by force, and become new warlords? War and anarchy will break out wherever population greatly exceeds resources, and there is no infrastructure (e.g. police) to hold down an oppressive government from forming.<p>To beat tyranny, the population must sharply drop, or the resources must greatly rise, along with the removal of the government, or the attractor won't be escaped. Food genetically modified to lower fertility does both. It might not be the best solution, but it's <i>a</i> solution, and unlike most others, it's one that's impossible to screw up. Contraceptives can be discarded for religious or cultural reasons, but food must be eaten. Educators' teachings can be ignored as misguided, but your body's egg or sperm count is a cold, hard fact. Other resources given as aid can be confiscated by a warlord for their value (OLPC laptops, anyone?), but what value does food that lowers your virility have to a warlord that could just as well eat something else?<p>I'm not suggesting there isn't a better, social solution. I'm just saying that as purely technical solutions go, this one is pretty damn air-tight.",1251190009.0

Well, here's one thing: The instant anyone in those countries discovers what you're doing, I expect one of two things will happen. Either (1) they will completely stop accepting your aid, in which case whatever good you were hoping it would do is right out of the window, or (2) you will suddenly find a whole lot more terrorists looking to do a lot of damage in rich countries.<p>More simply, you might just like to imagine how you'd feel if the roles were reversed. So, e.g., let's suppose that the Chinese government said: ""All these Westerners are relying on our services to make lots of super-cheap goods. Why don't we put something in the plastic that makes them less fertile? It's for their own good."" And let's suppose that you have been trying to have children for a few years and failing (or some close friend or relation has been) when you discover this. How do you feel?<p>A few other obvious things that I hope you missed: (1) Different people are fertile to different extents, and if you lower the average fertility you're most likely making lots of people completely infertile. (2) Your measures are going to affect the extra-specially poor disproportionately. To make a whole country's <i>average</i> fertility go down to replacement level, it may have to reduce the fertility of those people much more drastically. Down to zero, perhaps. (3) Having children is really, <i>really</i> important to a lot of people. You may think that's irrational; you may even be right; but that's how it is, and that's why you'd most likely get the effects I described above.
