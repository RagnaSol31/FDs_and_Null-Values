In particular, it annoys me when people buy LCD TVs and one year down the road throw it away because it stopped working. The manufactures give limited warranty and suggest to buy another one. I purposely bought a TV with a much longer warranty, three years. It did cost 3x as much as a cheaper one from costco.

In recent years IE pioneered sandboxed tabs, GPU-accelerated rendering engines, and some privacy stuff (that I found incredibly boring but they thought was really important). They didn't need to do that stuff. If Chrome hadn't reignited the browser wars so strongly, I wouldn't be surprised if IE would've been closing in on Firefox quality-wise at this point.<p>In the time I worked at MS and was able to get the inside scoop on how different product teams work, I found that the cynical explanation was almost never the truth. I can't think of a single person I met at MS who was playing to lose. If the IE team is underdelivering compared to other browser vendors, it's not due to an exec telling them not to try.

Both systems are fed the same input, both track enough of it, so both could theoretically provide the same output.  (I think Darcs is a little better at it, but every merge should be done with a watchful eye in either system.)<p>But I get the feeling that the patch-centric model is encouraging users to play fast and loose with patch order.  If you wantonly reorder patches, you might get a sequence of unusable code bases culminating in the current working version of your software.  It's easy to move a patch that uses a feature to a point before the feature is introduced.<p>Basically, the claim that ""Darcs automatically groups changes which depend on each other"" is one that I can't take seriously.  How can it know which changes depend on each other, if (for example) they're in different files?  By comparison, I hear from the Git folk advice along the lines of, ""Be careful with rebase, because it is a destructive operation"".<p>And because Git is snapshot-centric, if the app crashes in testing you can look at the SHA-1 used for the build to check out the exact tree used for the build, even years later, if necessary.
