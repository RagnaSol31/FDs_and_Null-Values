There are a lot of stories on how people risk their wealth transferring big amounts of hard earned capital across the border.<p>2. Do not have to pay hidden costs of using traditional payment systems. Costs are for sellers and buyers: 1) transaction fees 2) fraud risk 3) undersupply of goods because of fraud risk or fees. Tons of business models are simply not possible without Bitcoin. And many are not open to anyone in the world because of regulations, fraud risk etc.<p>3. No cost of inflation. If you save money for buying something expensive or opening your own shop, central bank steals your wealth by printing money and giving it to privileged organisations (that are supposed to pay you back in a form of &quot;growing economy&quot;, but we have yet to see a proof for it). For almost 5 years now, Bitcoin value was significantly growing every single year, comparing to any other asset on the market. And even when/if it stops growing, the value of Bitcoin depends on a decision of every market participant, not a small group of people in the Federal Reserve.<p>4.
