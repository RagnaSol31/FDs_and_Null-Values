6,109593,comment,109354.0,109453.0,0,0,curi,,,"So the pattern over many threads is:<p>1) article says something dumb<p>2) i say so briefly. i can't very well always explain in detail when no one has even expressed interest<p>3) someone espouses some dumb and imprecise theory in reply, that vaguely sounds right<p>4) i point out a reason it's wrong (in this case, there was the ""how many?"" question which is a full refutation)<p>and then 5:<p>the first comment is downmodded for lack of detail<p>and the further detail is too nested, and too technical/precise/doesn't have the ""sounds nice"" feel to it.   and still i keep it brief because the person didn't show interest in learning.<p>for another example of the kind of followup i mean, something like ""arguments from the authority of experience are invalid"" or ""correlation is not causation"". these get downmodded. presumably b/c they are unhelpful or everyone knows them. except, they are true, and people violate them all the time.<p>anyway, does anyone know the solution?",1202199348
7,109592,story,,,3,0,rms,Are there any recommended free or pay affiliate marketing scripts/apps/services?,,"Hey everyone,<p>I'd like to set up affiliate marketing for my site and don't have much of a desire to code it myself. I know there are a number of pay solutions out here for it, but the keyword affiliate marketing is consumed by get rich quick types and it's really tough to navigate the noise.<p>Any suggestions, either for a third party service or something I can host myself?<p>Thanks,\nKevin",1202199253

It would need to have cell-network access, which is another thing lots of people are upset that the Air doesn't have.<p>Apple basically told everyone: we fit it in an iphone, but we couldn't fit it in something 10 times the size.",1202199192
9,109590,comment,109580.0,109580.0,0,0,rms,,,"OK... so this functions well as a demonstration of something you built, for applying to YC or a job at another startup. And free book exchange sites are definitely good for the community of students.<p>But the word startup implies a business that can scale rapidly. You've got a nice project here... I wish you the best of luck in expanding this to every college in the nation, but it's going to be hard as hell. Even then, your only way of making money is advertising and it takes a whole lot of users to make decent money advertising. And college students as an audience don't exactly attract high CPMs either.",1202199017

Their problem is not lack of ""living wage"".<p>No one ever brings up the fact that a marginal decrease in rate of GDP growth will leave people significantly poorer a generation down the line.<p>But measures of poverty aren't really designed to be reasonable. Everyone alive today is much more wealthy than the vast majority of people to have ever lived. Some definitions are relative: the bottom quintile.<p>If you define poverty as a percentage of the whole, unchanging, then you have defined an intractable problem. I suppose that is the point for bureaucrats and perpetual activists.",1202198759

If you want to control your destiny, stay private or at least majority private. Of course that contradicts the quest for exit that motivates so many here, ...",1202198749

It is awesome. Literally a black box for storage, will scale well as disks get faster, and I'll always be buying disks at the optimal $/GB.
