Now that I've expressed my opinion on the subject, I'd like to point out the fact that the things that the author is whining about are not specific to just Ruby on Rails. Things like learning the actual language, knowing the concept of MVC, doing TDD/BDD, knowing various templating languages, databases, Javascript frameworks, and deployment are all part of the things you need to know in order to do actual web development.<p>Also, despite how Rails makes it easier and quicker to create web applications through scaffolding, Ruby on Rails is not a beginner's framework. It has abstracted most of the concepts that a lot of experienced developers have taken for granted and spend a lot of time into to make it easier to write applications. The downside to this is that it makes it hard for beginners to understand what happens under the hood. Let's take ActiveRecord for example. I'm certain a lot of beginners don't even know what an ORM is, but I'm pretty sure a lot of experienced developers know this already. While it may seem fine at first, when you get to the point where you actually need to do low-level SQL queries, the beginners won't even know what do to do to solve their problems.<p>TL;DR: If you actually agree with this article, you probably should stay away from web development.",1362128392.0

Pascal is like a combination of everything I hate in all programming languages that I know and I'm glad that the world moved on. C is small, elegant and portable. It's a systems programming language that does what it's supposed to do.<p>I hate C with its lack of proper arrays  handling and brain dead string manipulations that open the door to so many security exploits. Additionally the lack of modules/namespaces is a joke.<p>Mac/Turbo Pascal, Ada, Modula-2, Modula-3, Oberon(-2) are all examples of system programming languages done right.",1362128335.0
6,5303440,comment,5301133.0,5301605.0,16,0,BostonCFO2,,,"It's true. Groupon's accounting gimmickry is extensive, and began pre-IPO (recognizing full purchase price of coupon when they are only acting as an ""agent"" (middleman) not as a ""principal"" (i.e., making the food, owning the spas for the massages etc.), which as a CFO I can tell you is Accounting 101.<p>Among other places:\n<a href=""http://bit.ly/Y3hfft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/Y3hfft</a><p>And yes Rocky Agrawal and the Grumpy Accountants Professors and PrivCo.<p>And the accounting tricks continue - even most Wall Street analysts covering the company for a living have not picked up on it - but for ""Groupon Goods last fall they changed the way they account for those purchases.  (Remember for Goods their ""deal-share"" is even smaller than their 37% or so for restaurants/spas/etc.  It's under 10% for tablets, laptops etc.  So when they at first sold a $2000 flat screen TV, they booked (as forced by the SEC finally) just their $200 cut.  When revenue growth slowed, they (meaning likely Eric Lefkofsky instructed) Groupon to find a way to recognize the entire $2,000 sales as their revenue.  And the only way (again, speaking as a CFO who knows this intimately - not boasting my opinion is better than anyone else's, just sharing the real facts, I don't own or short the stock - and the only way they could recognize the entire $2,000 example TV sold is if they ""took possession of it, then re-sold it"" in plain language. And one of the requirements is that Groupon has (even briefly) the ""risk of loss"" (that is, the TV breaks while legally/technically in their possession before shipped to the buyer). I.e., find a way that Groupon's technically not just a deal middleman on Goods and let the buyer and seller deal with each other, but be the Reseller like Amazon.<p>So they literally (and this is not speculation, this is in the SEC filings - not highlighted and sort of minimally mentioned, but it's there) - they literally state starting with their third quarter 2012 10Q that beginning that quarter Groupon signed a new contract retaining a 3rd party company to act on its behalf to receive the goods from the Goods merchant, then that company acting on Groupon's behalf - with a contract that says Groupon bears ""all risk of loss"" and then ships it to the buyer.  Now that sounds awfully inefficient, and it is, because it has to be shipped twice, reducing Groupon's margins to near zero on Groupon Goods.  But it takes Groupon Goods revenue from 10% of each sale to 100$ of each sale.  Starting to get the picture?<p>So in the last 2 quarters they reported a dramatic spike in Groupon Goods revenues (no profits of course) but analysts - not knowing any better - began to upgrade the stock, saying yes the daily deals business is slowing to almost 0$ year over year, but look at Groupon Goods!  Its revenue is suddenly growing like gangbusters!  (I have to give hat tip here to an Accounting Seminar that used it as an example, and to PrivCo who published a Research Note detailing it, but I checked everything in the SEC filings and can say with 100$ certainty, but of course you can confirm it yourself.)<p>So price targets were raised, and many former bullish turned bearish analysis (like Ken Sena from Evercore) turned bullish again, and said Groupon is going to surprise all the naysayers!  Groupon Goods is its true future, it's growing in triple digits in revenue now!  (Because their revenue recognized went from 10$ of each sale to 100%, by having this fulfillment company acting on their behalf briefly taking possession of the goods and contract says Groupon has ""all risk of loss"" - even though the possession was sometimes for 10 minutes, since they just put it in a box and shipped it right away to the waiting buyer who had already pre-ordered it. No inventory, just in and right out the door.<p>One more fact you should know (again gotta give hat tip to PrivCo securities lawyers on their staff who pointed this out), go to the section on ""Related Party Transactions"" (i.e. this is where a company is doing business or hiring a company owned by a senior Officer, Director or Major Shareholder).  And in that section - brief as it is - it says one of those Related Party Transactions is that they retain and have a contract with a fulfillment company founded in mid-2012 that is owned by Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell (Groupon's co-founders, Board members and largest shareholders).  Yes you read that right.  They saw daily deals declining sharply, and decided they had to find a way to ""grow Revenue"" - without actually selling any more stuff.  So they quickly formed this company that signed exactly the contract terms needed verbatim that would allow the accountants to deem Groupon as having taken possession and acting as a principal / reseller and not an agent and recognize the entire Goods amount purchased.<p>And most Wall Street analysts (Evercore's Ken Sena was on TODAY on BloombergTV still touting the Groupon Goods revenue growth as reason to buy the stock, even though daily deals fell for the first time ever year over year.) He's clueless, and he's telling his clients Buy based on Groupon Goods revenue growth spurt since last summer.<p>I'll let the HN crew react to above instead of just saying out loud what I think of that or what you should.  Share what you think of that.",1362128327.0

8,5303438,comment,5293619.0,5302481.0,1,0,pron,,,"Yes, well, you summarize most of my points but one: the importance of callbacks is not just in the database triggering application actions (as would be done with asynchronous queries or the message bus you mention), but by scheduling application code to run on appropriate CPU cores.<p>Our ultimate goal isn't to make a new programming model for its own aesthetic (or non-aesthetic) sake, but in order to take advantage of multiple cores -- namely, for the sake of performance. So the database does not ""control"" the application -- it actually parallelizes it.<p>And as for SQL server, yes, I guess it's a similar concept but a different kind of database. I advocate that the database should be part of the application; they should be sharing the same heap in the same process, and only then should the applications let the database ""drive"". That is why I also don't quite agree with your wording of ""centralizing logic in the DB"" because the DB and the application are one; certainly the DB is not more (or less) centralized than the app. Once you get that, there is no point in being ashamed of it. Just like you let your web-app container parallelize your presentation layer, you let the database parallelize your business logic. In both cases the middleware shares the same process as the app, and the leap of faith required isn't big at all.",1362128283.0

13,5303432,comment,5302667.0,5303013.0,3,0,pjmlp,,,"> The popularity of programming languages is entirely a matter of historical accident. C flourished while Pascal languished because UNIX was written in C. Was there really a deep technical reason for preferring C to Pascal? No, not really. Indeed, for most of early history, Pascal had far superior tooling to C.<p>C and Pascal were developed almost in parallel.<p>Being the UNIX's systems language, it meant if you wanted to develop on UNIX C was the default option for most developers.<p>> How else do you explain the popularity of languages like Javascript and Objective-C?<p>There is no other option to target the browser, as JavaScript is the only language natively supported in browsers.<p>Objective-C is the only proper way to develop iOS applications, thus you need to use it if you really want to fully explore the platform.<p>All the languages you mentioned only became famous because developers were forced to use them commercially.<p>Back in the MS-DOS days I had zero need for C, Turbo Pascal was enough for everything (with a bit of Assembly).<p>But the commercial sucess of UNIX meant eventually I was forced into the realms of C. Luckily C++ was around the corner and provided an escape path for a saner language.<p>I still miss Pascal and the derivative language (Ada, Delphi, Modula-2, Modula-3, Oberon(-2), Active Oberon).",1362127903.0

If you're not a founder, this isn't your magnum opus - you're there to help someone else realize their dream and learn in the process. Every month you stay there is more money, more experience, more credibility. If you are feeling trapped, try to find something you can learn from what you are doing and recognize that you're experiencing something very common. When we first start on a new software project, we are learning at a very high rate and once we get into the daily grind, that thrill goes away. If you push through it, you may find a kind of beautiful zen calm that is just one of the best feelings in the world and you can find it almost anywhere. that being said...<p>2) There's nothing wrong with looking for a new job while you have a job, provided you make it clear why you are looking and that you will need time to organize your current work if you choose to change. Don't tell your company about it - it feels weird at first, but it's your private business. Staying professional and detached while doing creative work is one of the many secondary skills you will need.<p>3) It my be different for your generation, but in my experience talented programmers that are passionate about the craft are rare and valuable and are often the mythical high productivity multiple engineer from the mythical man month. The question is, how can you prove your skills to someone else? It's important to note I said skills, not (so much) potential - it's about what you can build.  The real answer imho is you can show code, you can show demos and you can get vouched for by other people in the high productivity club. I've found a great sense of community with other early childhood programmers, which is why I took the time out of an overscheduled work day to try and give you an advice.<p>4) Where's your code? Any open source contributions? TopCoder? I want to see artifacts. A particularly useful artifact is a git repository for a project that would be reasonable to complete in one week. This shows how you solve problems and what you can accomplish in a typical work week. If you're highly productive, this will be impressive. If not, then you can show it to people and learn where you can improve.<p>5) As far as google specifically, google employees aren't going to give you much insight because they have to sign NDAs and they work there and actually you have to sign an NDA just to interview. Plus, those people that don't make it aren't as likely to volunteer information on the process. They apparently care very much about your fit in their culture and your enthusiasm for the company and interest in their products. Next, it's about your problem solving abilities and particularly data structures and algorithms - checkout a course on coursera or algorithmist. You really need to hit those hard for their kind of work and also learn how to answer questions like this : Given {data structure} execute {algorithm} but do it with {very large data set, very low latency requirements, using a large cluster}.<p>6) Remember, be just aggressive enough! Once you are all prepped so you know that you will do well in a phone conversation, start sending emails, making calls and talking on linked in. Be polite but persistent, send links to your work and resume and request 30 minutes of an engineer's time for a phone screen because you're passionate, you're talented and you're exactly what they are looking for. If that doesn't work, find some people somewhere that work at google or that used to work there and send them a note offering to take them to lunch for an informational interview and make your goal understanding not just the hiring process, but the company, it's technology and its organization. (this is a common technique where you are just asking to meet with them for their expertise, most people say yes to flattery and free lunch) Google has their engineers spend their first bit of time reading papers, so try and find that paper list and start reading it. Keep on doing this, build and maintain those relationships and pretty soon you will strike up a friendship and then it's time to leverage that to get an on sight interview.<p>I don't know you at all, but it seems like you are doing very well. You could be concurrently enrolled in college, launching your own project, networking with other engineers and building a web presence or polishing skills that must need some of that at your age. If you are feeling trapped, I'd separate that feeling from the decision about whether to stay at your current job. Professional decisions should be made heartlessly, as much as possible.<p>If you are unhappy or just really into google, well find a way to make your code demonstrable in any of a million ways :  Write some weekend project that uses a google API, win a topcoder contest, contribute to open source, continue your education and get involved in research projects.<p>anyway, I have spent far too much time on this, so obviously my altruism is leaking into procrastination...

Gay parents would probably be accepting of any sexuality and supportive which would free a child with a non-normal sexual identity from judgement and provide more support.  If however the child was straight while the parents would probably be supportive he wouldn't necessarily know what his traditional gender role in a relationship would be from observation of his family.  (Which could be a help or a hindrance in the dating world) however I'm sure that could be easily counter-balanced by the accessibility of straight role models in normal society who could give advice and guidance.,1362126994.0
