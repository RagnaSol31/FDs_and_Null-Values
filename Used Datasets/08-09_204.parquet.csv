The big problem is that you have to get all the manufacturers to agree to use same battery pack on all their models.  If every gas station has to keep a stock of dozen different batteries with a dozen different swapping procedures it will get too expensive to implement.<p>Another aspect is a question of manpower.

I was a. ery heavy smoker (over 2 packs a day) but the trick was that I eally, really wanted to quit. It was not something people around me asked me to do, or a fear of getting sick in some distant future, it really was me, now.<p>The reason I wanted to quit so much was I felt enslaved; when getting to a place for dinner for example, the first thing I did was check where I could buy cigarettes and at what time the tobacco shops would close, so that I would not be short on the drug -- although I also carried at leat two new packs with me at all times. It was cazy.<p>The hard part is the first week, which is quite horrible, but after that it gets easier.<p>That said, I had started smoking relatively late (at 23). In my eperience, people who started young (16 or younger) can never really quit. They sometimes stop for extended periods of time (5 years maybe) and then invariably start again...",1440921869.0

Nuclear waste, even when not processed, is not that large in volume and it can be stored in a space on the order of a hectare (about 2.5 acres) for the entire US nuclear waste production over several decades. Consider the comparative amount of storage needed for just coal ash, as well as the environmental hazards that presents.<p>2. The reason the US does have comparatively more waste is because the government forbids any reprocessing of nuclear fuel. For example, merely separating out the more radioactive isotopes, you can greatly reduce the volume. Reprocessed fuel can also be partially reused in a nuclear reactor and the French have great experience with that.<p>3. Even reprocessed &quot;spent&quot; fuel can be useful in 3rd and 4th generation reactors. Spent fuel today is still a valuable future resource, so it needn&",
