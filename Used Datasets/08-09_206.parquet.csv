10,4093740,comment,4092446.0,4092446.0,2,0,cbennett,,,"I lived in SF for nearly 2 years immediately after college graduation and just left a few months ago. I think the OP's question, although pretty vague, is interesting and conforms to my experience- life in SF, although good, is not even <i>close</i> to what you're paying for. (in other words, if SF were a stock, I would sell). 3 quick lines of evidence:<p>1) Weather is a huge influence on quality of life no matter how you cut it, and SF's weather is surprisingly bad. Not in the Nome Alaska objective sense of it (awful climate), but it in the 'oh its  49 degrees and rainy in July' sense of it. Sure there are some beautiful weeks in september and may but on balance its just gray, rainy, and temperamental. Oh and if you liked seasons, too bad.<p>2) SF is in the midst of a huge financial and commercial real estate bubble that has turned the city into a generally overrated, overpriced, and ultimately overcrowded bedroom community (you would think higher prices would drive down demand but that's not the case because other folks from around the rest of bay and entire nation are still flooding in).<p>3) Public transportation is just awful for a city of its size and density. Goes along with point 2) about overcrowding but buses are extremely slow and you hardly have room to breath. Muni and Bart are great but only services 1/5 of city or so.  Obviously its not car-ridden like LA but we are talking about entirely different scales here. For a better comparison look to NYC or DC, SF is just leagues behind (I realize there are geological constraints here, but that's a whole other can of worms)<p>I'm not trying to paint SF as a bad place- yes, it has charming victorians, nice little micro climates/neighborhoods (I lived in Hayes Valley, one of the better ones), a lot of cultural diversity, great food, and I enjoyed my time there. That said, I would absolutely not move back-- SF is unprepared for the growth it will continue to get in the next couple years with a huge startup/employment diaspora. In truth, comparisons between SF and the world's great cosmopolitan metros like NYC, London, Paris, are really silly;  due to a variety of financial and geological constraints on building future infrastructure, SF will basically remain the bay area's wealthy bedroom community for years if not decades to come.",1339404997.0

22,4093727,comment,4093351.0,4093351.0,2,0,adventureful,,,"Something that a shift to robotic manufacturing plays to is the theory of inflection points in systems. In this case, the inflection points are very very long markers in time.<p>1) You start at highly domestic manufacturing for most goods (mostly the case right up until the mid 19th to 20th century).<p>2) Global outsourcing brings huge efficiency gains through specialization and optimizations with regulation and labor costs.<p>3) The inflection swings back to domestic manufacturing of most goods. If the US could automate the sewing of its clothing, why not most every other country? There's no reason Italy couldn't buy enough materials to then sew all of its own clothing domestically; ditto Spain or Belgium or whomever.<p>The swing back also brings all sorts of benefits for security when it comes to being less dependent on other nations for your basic goods. If you could make your own clothing at a cost parity with outsourcing it to China, why wouldn't you do so? And even more important than a cost parity, is a net value parity: the capital kept domestically, the jobs kept or created domestically thrown into the value calculation.",1339404719.0

26,4093723,comment,4091133.0,4091133.0,0,0,peterkelly,,,"So here's an idea:<p>Pretty much every site with a login facility has an ""I forgot my password"" option where you put in your username or email address, and it sends you a link to reset your password. This is effectively a second form of authentication - the ability to receive email at that address implies the ability to log in to that account.<p>So what about an authentication mechanism that works as follows:<p>1. You type in your username<p>2. The site emails you a one-time authentication token (as part of a link)<p>3. You click on that link and then you're logged into the site<p>Of course, there are a few obvious problems with this: it's a bit cumbersome to have to do for every login, email is unencrypted, and message reception uses a pull-based mechanism.<p>So I could envisage a standard, incorporated into browsers, as follows:<p>1. When you first launch your browser, you log into an authentication server S, supplying your password (either manually, or automatically via a saved password)<p>2. When you want to log in to a site, you type in your username, and the site sends an authentication token to the server S<p>3. S sends a push notification to your browser with the authentication token<p>4. Your browser passes this token to the site, and you're logged in<p>This way, your (hashed + salted) password need only be stored on server S (in the first example, this corresponds to your email server). This means that apart from S, none of the sites you use need to store any password information at all.<p>I'm sure this basic idea has been implemented previously in other contexts. Why are we not using for all our web logins?",1339404622.0

41,4093708,comment,4092986.0,4093180.0,4,0,einhverfr,,,"I think something does force taxes to be complicated though and that is the fact that taxes are a useful tool of public policy and it is often one of the easiest ones to use.  For example the federal government in the US can enact income and excise taxes to accomplish things that are otherwise outside the general powers of our federal government, such as heavily restricting machine gun ownership.<p>I think as soon as taxes become a political tool, or a tool of public policy the question isn't whether they will become complicated but rather how complicated they will become.  The floor here seems to me to be based on the willingness of the average voter to put up with the complexity vs the desire to see their public policy goals enacted.<p>I think that these play out in two ways:<p>1)  Local taxes tend towards less complexity than taxes which are national.<p>2)  Taxes which everyone reports tend towards less complexity than taxes which few people report.  Consider the current trends in state sales tax reporting vs trends in state income tax reporting......

I'm -very- happy that mines are re-opening in other countries, and I hope that they're around long enough that home-grown manufacturers become reliable customers.<p>But they simply won't have enough mines and production capacity to secure the supply.  Molycorp is small enough that China can flood the market with cheap rare-earth metals just long enough to mess up their $753 MM investment in that mine and knock them out of business again.

Watch the trends in the states regarding ""streamlined"" sales tax to see the problem (ok, maybe it's ""streamlined"" for legislators because they don't define tax categories).  Also I have done enough sales tax compliance work in other countries to have stories you won't believe.<p>For example this one is pre-HST in Ontario, CA and so I don't know if it changed when HST was accepted, but before HST, the question of whether provincial sales tax (PST) was applied to a muffin you buy at a coffee shop depended on what else you purchased and some other factors.  The rules were as follows:<p>If the muffin is not individually wrapped and you buy fewer than six then it is taxable if and only if the subtotal of the muffin and any other prepared foods and beverages purchased is greater than $4 Canadian.<p>On the other hand, if the muffin is individually wrapped, then it is always subject to PST.... unless the customer also purchases another item of prepared food or drink and the subtotal is less than $4 Canadian.<p>Here's the problem as I see it:<p>We all have to file income taxes.  Only businesses have to file VAT.  What this means in political terms is that if you annoy the population enough regarding filing, they will vote out folks in office and vote in people promising to simplify things (see Reagan-era income tax simplification).<p>On the other VAT and sales tax are only reported by businesses.  You still have all the incentives to make policy by controlling tax rates.  However most people don't fill out the returns.  Moreover big businesses can afford to do whatever they need to in order to fill out the returns, but smaller businesses will struggle.  I will say that in my experience very few small brick-and-mortar businesses that do delivery of goods even make any attempt at being compliant with ""streamlined"" sales tax laws (where typically you have to report per tax jurisdiction goods are delivered to).  Consequently it becomes another formal barrier to entry, another regulation that small businesses ignore because they have to, and another one that allows governments to adopt a ""show me the man and I'll find you the crime"" approach.<p>Sales taxes tend towards <i>greater</i> complexity than personal income taxes.<p>Additionally if you mandate that VAT is built into the prices, you create a perfect way of hiding that complexity from the average voter.<p>Hence I see that as a very, very bad idea.",1339403131.0
