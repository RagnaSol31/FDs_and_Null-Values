You can ssh into a box, provision it however you want, save that image off, and then run arbitrary commands/scripts on instances of that image, on the CPU type you want, and pay only for the seconds of usage you have. (Their ""s1"" core type is $0.04/hour: <a href=""http://www.picloud.com/pricing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.picloud.com/pricing/</a> ) They also have a system that lets you mount the same shared ""drive"" from multiple instances at the same time, so if you're doing file-based stuff, it's easy.<p>The thing I like about it is that running another instance of your script on a new machine (or 2k of them) is trivial.

Though you'd have to have the support of the government even if you can defend yourself from guerrillas/militias and thieves, but by simply receiving this support in a messed up country with ""alternative governments"" fighting for power, you'd end up taking sides, loosing your neutrality and becoming vulnerable to all sorts of bloody acts, even if they are directed against the people you help and not against yourself - <i>imagine you're helping a school and a bunch of guys from a local guerrilla fighting for power show up and take the school children hostages and tell you they'll kill them if you don't pack your gear and leave the area: even if you have the resources to kill the untrained kidnappers and save all children, by doing so you seriously piss up the fraction that sent those guys and open things up to other alike situations that will not all end well.</i> Something like a PMC force would only be usable against thieves / poachers / drug-dealers... any other ""defensive"" use would be ""taking side"" and pull you out of the neutrality zone messing up everything.<p>To actually be able to use a PMC for such situations, you'd need the kind of force that <i>could win a fight/kidnapping situation by using non-lethal force against lethal force</i>, because using lethal force will put you on one side or another and compromise everything. And to be able to reliably win a non-lethal vs. lethal force situation you'd basically need your PMC to be <i>more advanced and well trained than the US military (!!), at least on the non-lethal weaponry and people manipulation parts... and at that point something like the US (or other ""big guys"" with interest in the region) would perceive you as a potential treat to them, despite your humanitarian mission, bringing up whole new levels of ""fun"" :)</i><p>Sorry for the pessimism, but these is why I don't like touching this kinds of problems, as I can only find an infinite amount of reasons of why things wouldn't work.",1363595561

They think about things rather than accepting an arbitrary criteria such as whether someone is born or not.  For most it is whether the bundle of cells is a sentient being capable of experiencing, something a zygote most certainly is not.<p>It doesn't seem that way.<p>Most efforts to legalise abortion are based on the argument 1) that women have a right to do what they want with their own body, or 2) that abortion has social benefits.  And since the progressive side of politics is making no real effort to stop abortion after the embryo has become a foetus and developed a nervous system it's probably safe to assume that women's rights and social benefits are far more important to them than whether an foetus is 'sentient being capable of experiencing'.",1363593792
