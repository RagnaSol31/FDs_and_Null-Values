I hope not but if so, perhaps you should read this[1], where the particular criticism I'm concerned with is the irresponsibly zealous research funding on a malaria cure with the consequence of alienating other important fields of research that are just as important. Ironically enough this is exactly the sort of thing government funding is so notorious of, namely, ignorance or ulterior motives that lead to a less efficient budget that could have been employed is so much better ways.<p>However, that is only one wealthy man, not enough data for a solid argument, but even on a purely rational basis, I would very much, rather the money was in a place where the general population had, at least in theory, some say on where it is to be spent. To me it seems that by going from public to private funding one is exchanging inefficiencies. The inevitable economic inefficiencies of bureaucracy for new inefficiencies in the way the money is allocated from the perspective of what benefits the citizens of the nation.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation",

The iHub is closer to a typical hackerspace than the others, which are more concerned with startups actively seeking investment than meetups and such.

I'm happy to hear you like it.<p>I'm still working on the details, but I want to create an easy way for someone to sell their blog's content as an ebook subscription that works on any eReader and isn't locked into a single platform (I'm working on adding PDF output and some more formats soon!). There are two models that are possible: monthly fee, or percentage of sales. I think I can do both -- percentage of sales for people who are just starting out, and a monthly fee for heavy users who want a volume discount on their sales. I apologize if this is a bit vague, but I'm still trying to figure out what will be the most fair and sustainable way to do pricing.<p>I'm also working on the terms, right now I just prohibit using this for anything illegal, which would include redistributing content you don't own or isn't under the Creative Commons.

14,4965523,comment,4964917.0,4964917.0,17,0,jsz0,,,Every time I've used a WP device I've walked away disappointed. Haven't done an extended test just 10-15 minutes on various devices. If I had to point to any one thing that leaves me disappointed it's probably the excessive amount of scrolling and swiping required. Even on the larger display devices the amount of information I can see without scrolling/swiping is a fraction of what I'm used to from iOS/Android. It leaves me with kind of a stuck-in-the-mud feeling that I'm just doing a lot of extra work to access the same amount of information. The same type of problem pops up with apps in a different way. They tend to be fairly basic and lacking features. I guess this is to be expected for a relatively young platform but it's really difficult to step away from these iOS/Android apps that just have so much more functionality. Between the apps and UI style it almost just feels to me more like a glorified feature phone. People said the same thing about the iPhone but it had some really killer features. To get a real web browser I was happy to give up the unified messages system on my BlackBerry. I can't really find the killer features in WP that would justify the trade-offs. Honestly every interaction I've had with WP so far makes me very happy to return to iOS/Android where all my apps pack tons of information on the screen and have just about every feature I need.,1356425638.0

17,4965519,comment,4964227.0,4964867.0,2,0,calciphus,,,"> The only thing we need to fear is crazy people who have guns. And that's a relatively easy problem to address: require thorough mental and background checks for anyone who wants to buy a gun.<p>This statement contains at least two problematic assumptions: \n1) Only people who have committed violent crimes in the past will commit them in the future. (see: ""background checks"")\n2) People who are mentally ill are inherently dangerous, or at the very least ""could be"" (see: ""mental checks"", ""crazy people"")<p>The problem with (1) is that a background check will not reveal very much for most folks. Sure, if you've got a lifetime of criminal mischief, a felony or two, that will show up. But that time you argued with someone and threw a brick through their window, but the judge let you off with a ""public disturbance"" - not gonna show up. For the vast majority of the country, a background report would not be a useful or helpful qualifier. For the worst of the worst, we can't pretend a black market on guns doesn't exist, so it would not help there, either.<p>The problem with (2) is that you have now decided to deny what is otherwise a fundamental right, guaranteed in (an amendment to) the Constitution to all citizens of legal age. Your logic for stripping a large number of citizens of this right is that some of them might do bad things with it. There is no clinical diagnosis for ""is likely to go apeshit and shoot someone"" - in fact even among schizophrenics there's no clear indicator of ""violent tendencies"", let alone an actual predictor.<p>Another problem with (2) is that you assume that mental health is constant throughout a lifetime. If I'm 18 and go in for a comprehensive mental status evaluation, I may come out just fine and start buying guns. But what happens if I present as Bipolar at 30? Schizophrenic at 40? Do you get to come and take away all my guns at that point? Should that be the duty of a psychiatrist - to determine who is allowed to own weapons? What if the psychiatrist gets it wrong, are they liable? Even if we assume somehow a psychiatrist was able to make that diagnosis and be right 99% of the time, you've now introduced a fairly major reason NOT to seek mental health care - they may take away your guns (or prevent you from getting one).<p>Sadly, throwing out ""it's only crazy people with guns"" is a somewhat disingenuous statement. Most gun homicides in the US are committed criminal-on-criminal, or criminal-on-victim. Very few are acts of ""a crazy person"", and even in those cases very few have ever been diagnosed with or presented psychotic symptoms prior to the commission of a gun-related homicide.<p>I therefore reject your guarantee that it would ""actually make us safer"". I also am pretty sure it would run afoul of ADA, and the 2nd Amendment, though that's a question for expensive lawyers.",1356425553.0

The problems with realising what is left to restore seem to be technical (again, I'm unsure of details). The support staff themselves have helped a lot.

The most important files <i>were</i> backed up, at least to some degree. Having said that, Dropbox <i>is</i> used by myself and many others as a semi-backup solution. My personal strategy is to backup the whole Dropbox folder to an external disk every few weeks, but rely on Dropbox for everything else. This is <i>not</i> a good backup solution, but realise that for most people, it's not ""Dropbox vs. a real solution"", it's ""Dropbox vs. no solution at all"".<p>I'll close with the same message I give to most people - Dropbox is brilliant, most of the time. It's <i>not</i> a great backup solution, but it's better than what most people do.

People that work smart, hard, and efficiently are not common but those that do, or at least occasionally approximate it, generally do well over the long term no matter how their ""luck"" plays out.<p>Where would you be if you were born in Somalia to average Somali parents?  How much hard work would it take to bring your average per-capita income of what, two hundred bucks a year up to something we Americans would call success?  I'm not saying it couldn't be done, just god damn, you'd have to be an incredible human to pull it off.<p>I mean, the majority of the humans in the world live in places where our average yearly per-capita of forty-eight grand or so a year would be a staggeringly large income; I think your average per-capita worldwide is well under ten grand a year.   Just being born in the wealthy parts of the world means you are very lucky, and that you've cleared an enormous hurdle.<p>Race and gender.  And height.   I mean, sure, here in America, Women do make it sometimes.  In my field, at least, they are at an obvious disadvantage, but it's something they can overcome if they are smart, lucky and hard working.   But if she was born in Iran?   Overcoming that birth handicap would be incredibly difficult.  I'm not going to say impossible, but you'd need to be truly incredible, one out of a million, to get as far as I have as a mediocre, maybe one in fifty, if that, white guy born in the US to poor-ish but educated parents.<p>And what if you are born stupid? That's luck, too. I mean, sure, it's a mixture of genetic and environmental factors, but hell, you don't have much control over the environmental factors until you are mostly grown, so either way (environment or genetics) a lot has to do with the luck of choosing the correct parents (either as genetic materiel donors, or as keepers of your environment.)<p>Sure, there are some things you can do after 18 to move the needle in either direction, I'm sure, but man, you are really behind the kid who got lucky.<p>As a good friend (who is vastly more intelligent than I am, but maybe 6 inches shorter) said:<p>Me: ""I don't believe in luck.""[1]<p>Him: ""that's because you are lucky.""<p>And yes, most of the luck was me having the good sense to choose sensible parents.  (And vs. this guy, I mostly got lucky in terms of height... I think I could argue that my ability to project confidence was at least partially learned through my own hard work.  Part of it was the luck of the parents;  my dad did encourage entrepreneurship;  I had real sales experience at the age of 12 (low dollar; we grew pumpkins, and I walked them around the mobile home park in a wheelbarrow, knocking on doors ""twenty five cents for the little ones, seventy five for the big ones.""  (I mean, obviously, at 12, he did a lot of the work.)   I can claim some credit for expanding on that, but from what I know of his early family life, I got lucky in that area, too, and he got particularly unlucky.)<p>Confidence is obviously bullshit, but it has a huge impact on your income.  But this guy, for that matter, was pretty lucky, too.  I mean, the poor bastard had to work for me for a while, which I'm sure is miserable, but a real employer did eventually notice him and he makes reasonable money now.   He's lucky for being born here in America, where he can make a decent living because, well, he's brilliant, rather than some desert or jungle where he'd have died an early death for being easy to beat up.  I mean, he could have done a lot to generate some fake confidence.  It'd probably improve his life a lot.  I'm just saying, because of the extra six inches the genetic lottery gave me and not him?  I don't have to try nearly as hard, in spite of the fact that he is better qualified, by virtue of his superior intellect, for nearly every job I've had or applied for.)<p>Now, if you are saying that it is better for a person who is easily discouraged to believe that there is no luck?  sure, you are absolutely right.   You can't change luck. I mean, it's a little bit like AI, once you figure out how to change something, it's no longer luck.  So yes, if your brain, for whatever reason, can't handle the fact that most of your potential was set before you reached the age of majority, yeah, you're better off fooling yourself.  Because focusing on the bits that were luck is useless.  You've gotta focus on the hard work part, 'cause that's what you can change now.<p>(Recognizing what you have the potential to be good at is useful... but it's also really hard to do, and it's easy to make expensive mistakes.  Figuring out how to work as hard as you are able, though?  nearly always pays some dividends.  So sure, until you figure out how to work as hard as you are able, that should be your focus.)<p>[1] Yes, I actually say things like that.  Part of the practice for that confidence thing.  You know, pretending to be white, and all that.   It's kinda ridiculous, sure, but eh, you can pay me to look a little bit silly.<p>The thing is, you need a certain, I don't know the Chinese for it, but the translation is ""Good face"" to do well.  There is this whole set of social rules you need to follow- this whole set of, well, this identity you need to assume to do business... or really, even to get someone else to hire you to write code.   I call assuming the required mask in technical/business situations ""pretending to be white"" - because the most accessible and understandable 'good face,' for me, at least, is the ""Real American"" face.  It's seeped into the rest of my life by now, too, which I find hilarious.   I'm not the sort who can switch masks on the drop of a hat.  It takes years, for me... So this bleed over into the rest of my life feels honest, authentic.  I really am, in a small way, becoming a ""Real American.""
