There can be less interuptions at home, there's less time wasted on commuting, and more flexibility - allowing (for instance) people with children to have a better work/life balance, which should hopefully make them more effective workers.<p>There's also things like the simple cost of the building - if 20% of your staff are typically at home on any given day, you need 20% less floorspace etc (I know it's not quite that simplisticaly linear, but you get the point).<p>For meetings, things like Facetime can be remarkably effective at getting someone ""in the room"" when they are physically at home. It's not quite as good as them actually being there, but it's remarkably close.<p>Obviously there's a balance. There are quite definitely upsides to having people in the building - a quick 2 minute chat at someone's desk with a piece of paper and a pencil can sometimes be as effective as a Visio diagram and an email that took an hour to write, and even more importantly having people sat right next to you can make working far more collaborative.<p>But depending on what your job is, having the flexibility to work for a day or more a week at home can be hugely valuable.",1341564965.0

The bad news is that at least 37,000 Americans still die on the USAs roads and highways each year, and almost all of them die due to persistent and, in some ways, increasing driver errors. Indeed, drivers are the most vital variable in car wrecks and other traffic accidents  not weather, defective parts or road conditions.

Clarity and conciseness probably took the back seat to optimization hacks, so writing the comment to describe the original intent of the code actually was vital.<p>Peter Norvig's old Lisp programming book has a nice illustration on how the programming style in Lisp has evolved from the 70s to the book's 1992: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=QzGuHnDhvZIC&lpg=PP1&dq=paradigms%20of%20artificial%20intelligence&pg=PA30"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=QzGuHnDhvZIC&lpg=PP1&",

You are obviously keen to write good quality code in a modern-ish framework/paradigm.<p>---<p>You have to realise that the company you are working for now might be suffering from industrial inertia - also, unless you are privvy to their financials, you probably have no idea of any pressure they are under to make ends meet. In general, selling something that you've already sunk costs into is more cost-effective than writing something new and then selling it, so if their primary objective at the moment is to make money and they have a system that is working, they will probably keep pushing it. It is rare, though not unheard of, for a company to be so developer focussed that they will undertake a wholesale refactor of their code base if it is currently bringing home the bacon. Also in something very old and convoluted (as you've said pull on one part and another part will collapse), refactoring is often less time-efficient than simply writing it from scratch. Ask yourself ""if I manage to refactor this into a best-of-breed code, will I be enjoy putting the time and effort into it on a daily basis? or will it just be an albatross around my neck every morning until it is done?""<p>Consider your goals - you could consider staying at the company and learning about the business end (i.e. actually selling the software), maybe make some valuable contacts - that's a good goal but it might not be the right goal for you. If you currently just want to write beautiful code, then find somewhere else to work - perhaps a more greenfield development without legacy code.<p>edit to add a potentially relevant link on stackexchange that i've just come across:\n<a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/155488/ive-inherited-200k-lines-of-spaghetti-code-what-now"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/155488/ive-in...</a>",1341562796.0
