And you know how in the back of your mind, you wonder, “I wonder what it’d be like if a game actually designed its gameplay around those concepts rather than just duct-taping them on through noninteractive story?”<p>>Papers, Please is that game. It manages to ask (and importantly, not answer) questions of duty, safety, privacy, family, self-interest, and morality through an incredibly simple, focused set of mechanics based around checking transit papers and stamping passports.<p><a href=""http://www.heyash.com/why-i-like-papers-please/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heyash.com/why-i-like-papers-please/</a>",1394784220.0
