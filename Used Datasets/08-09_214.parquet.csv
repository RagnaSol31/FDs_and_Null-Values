Under such a system, I'd have still gotten loans, but I'd rather see a system where some percent of people who make bad choices suffer from their choices, but where educational loans are widely available than a system where few are ""allowed"" to make bad choices, but loans are more narrowly available.<p>I don't want a world that's even more ""rich get educated, poor don't"" than today. If I look back at my family, my generation is much, much better off, primarily via education, than my grandparents who very literally mined coal and worked in a steel mill. They scrimped and saved so my parents could go to college to become teachers, who in turn ensured we did as well. That's no college to no-name college to top-name college in the span of two generations.<p>Of course that's only one data point, and if I read it in a paper, blog or on news.YC, I'd roll my eyes at the cherry-picking, too, because it'd be 1 story hand-selected from 100s of millions. In my case, it's 1 of 1, so I want to ensure we preserve the conditions that let my parents work hard to forge a better life for themselves and my siblings. Maybe in a world where college loans are hard to get (such as the world they lived in), this would all work out similarly, and easy college loans are in fact part of the problem, but I think there's been heaps of hidden benefits to having education being more widely available and more common that people overlook when they see Mr or Ms Bad Choices as an adult with untenable student loan debt.",1368434817.0

One example: if I've got a file open in Komodo or IDEA or whatever and I'm ready to commit it, I always diff it first in Araxis Merge. I'm likely to make some final changes to the file at that point.

E.g. you might have a layer containing really high resolution national boundaries. Most tiles won't even contain any part of it, and those who do will either contain a small subsection or a vastly simplified version. If you were to try client side rendering based on that, you're potentially looking at gigabytes of data to transfer to the client.<p>What they're doing is essentially doing all the steps apart from the final rasterisation, and then storing that vector data on a per tile basis, so that they can process only the relevant vector data - whether to serve it up as is, or rasterise it.<p>One major advantage is that things like styles (line widths, colours) can be modified without having to re-render the entire map data set. Instead you just have to on-the-fly rasterise the already prepared tiles, which you can do without totally killing performance.",1368433592.0

125,5697652,story,,,2,5,axefrog,Ask HN: How to channel excitement for new ideas back into the current project?,,"I deeply want freedom. Freedom from having to work for someone else, freedom from basic financial problems and freedom to work full time on the projects I have queued up in various to-do lists and brainstorming documents. To this end, like many of you, I spend a lot of my free time working to build some kind of revenue stream that will allow me to achieve this.<p>Now, I am very good at finding time to work on projects outside of my day job, and I am very good at focussing on that project - for a while. Then I hit mundane parts of the project and the excitement dries up. I keep working on the project of course, but then what happens is something comes along, whether a distracting, time-expensive feature in the project that's not required for launch/MVP, or an unrelated idea altogether, and it starts to steal the available ""excitement mindshare"" I have. The project then slows to snails pace while I start to try to juggle multiple projects or subprojects, the first being what I know I need to keep working on, and the second existing because I can't get it out of my head.<p>When I try to clear a budding distraction from my head by writing it down, the act of writing it down becomes a days-long exercise of brainstorming that steals from my core development time, self-fuels the fire of excitement about the idea, and that ends up turning into an early-stage prototyping of the idea, further stealing time from what I originally committed to.<p>Excitement about ideas that are NOT what I'm currently trying to bring to completion are deeply distracting and destructive to my productivity. But excitement fuels productivity in a huge way, so how do I take the excitement I'm feeling for a new idea and channel it back into what I'm supposed to be working on? Is it possible to forcefully reallocate that passion to where it's needed most?",1368432398.0

Almost nothing derives purely from genes; it's a complex interaction of genes, epigenetics (environmental and hereditary factors other than genes that control which genes are active), and socialization.<p>Males and females are treated extremely differently <i>from birth</i>. Literally, in the very first day. Thus, it is nearly impossible to actually prove scientifically that a significant difference comes from genetic and biological factors. The socialization is a confounding factor that's impossible to separate out unless you're willing to do a study where you raise kids in isolation from society so you can treat them identically.<p>And even ""inherent"" differences are often easily overcome with social solutions. There's research to suggest that the difference in spatial reasoning is societal.[1] Furthermore, I believe I saw a study suggesting that even in our society, if you put everyone through a proper course teaching them spatial reasoning, the women catch up to the men. So society can choose to eliminate ""inherent"" differences by devoting a few resources to something that helps one group catch up to the other.<p>Furthermore, it ultimately doesn't matter that much. Western society has decided that we want equality between men and women. If that's not happening, then we've committed ourselves to make it happen. There are currently differences between men and women, largely from socialization. Since our society was largely built by men, it unsurprisingly is oriented toward having successful men in it. That doesn't mean we throw up our hands and say, ""well, this is how our society is structured, and our society socializes men to win in that structure. I guess equality is inherently impossible."" No. We find ways to reduce gender socialization (see: radical schools in Sweden). We find ways to restructure society so that there are fewer barriers to some groups' success.<p>1: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/7fk/gender_differences_in_spatial_reasoning_appear_to/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/7fk/gender_differences_in_spatial_re...</a>",1368432208.0

All current browsers will make a GET request in the onbeforeunload event (onunload in Opera).
