92,7345945,comment,7345556.0,7345894.0,6,0,gamblor956,,,"I did before I wrote the comment.  There are two statutes: 1028, and 1028A. (See for yourself: <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1028."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1028.</a>)<p>Only one of the statutes in question mandates consecutive sentences, 1028A. The maximum sentence for these counts is 2 years for the crime charged.  (He was not charged with a terrorism offense under 1028A, so the 5 year sentence is not applicable.)  The way this statute is written, this 2 year sentence may not be concurrent to any other sentence for <i>any other crime</i> but multiple counts of the same crime can be served simultaneously.  (Note that 1028A is an &quot;enhancement&quot; charge, similar to the gun enhancements I mentioned earlier. They are add-ons to other crimes, and cannot be charged separately. Basically, enhancement charges are used when additional circumstances covered by the enhancement make the underlying crime &quot;worse&quot; than a normal instance of that crime.)<p>1028 imposes a maximum sentence of 15 years for the gravest crime listed in the statute. Assuming he is found (or pleads guilty) this yields a likely maximum sentence of 17 years, or a potential maximum sentence of no more than 33 years.",1394007433.0

It might seem crazy today, but if and when the exchanges develop a strong reputation for financial soundness it may be very hard for them to resist the profits from a small, very safe under-reserving. Customers are likely to go along with this because 1) after all, the BTC exchanges have a strong reputation for safety and competence! and 2) some will likely share in the profits through interest on their deposits. Of course, these small, very safe overcommitments will likely turn out to be the first step on a slippery slope, but so it goes.<p>(I am not an expert on anything.)",1394007230.0
