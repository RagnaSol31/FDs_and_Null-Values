A major part of ok cupids system is that it tracks views and informs the people WHO checked you out.  The other dynamic is that people are shy and they need to be pushed to set up a visible profile quickly before they lose confidence.  At that point they are contactable and datable.<p>So no guest mode for OK Cupid.,1378886544.0

All in the name of &quot;we wont be able to catch criminals if we cant listen in on communications&quot;. Up to that point in time, encryption and secure communications was reserved for agencies and those in power, it was not for the plebians. See for example how it went for PGP.<p>I guess a route that US agencies took is to &quot;we will recommend good standards for you, because you know we also need security, but you shouldnt know all those standards and implementations will be compromised so we still retain the ability to spy on you while you wont be able to spy on us and if you do then you&",
