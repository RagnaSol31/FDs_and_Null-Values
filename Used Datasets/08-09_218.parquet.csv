And even things that look great (video phones and flying cars famously having been around for a loooong time) who knows if it will be something like Google Glasses or not? Hard to predict what will be adopted, and what it will be competing with to get users to adopt it.",1354264389.0

115,4852357,comment,4850428.0,4852288.0,3,0,pbiggar,,,"> Wow, you read a way more argumentative tone into my comment than I intended. It's all good, I'm trying to expand my understanding. :) Though I'm not sure I agree with your characterization of my points as ""nonsense.""<p>Indeed, that was much too harsh and I retracted it. I thought I might have retracted it before anyone noticed, but I guess not. My bad, sorry about that.<p>> Unless I'm missing something, I think you would be very hard-pressed to generate basic blocks of native code in only a few dozen lines of platform-dependent code.<p>Whoops, I thought we were still talking about token-threading. I believe people implement token threading by fiddling with the compiler output. John Aycock had a paper about doing this for Perl or Python as I recall (also, since you're into JITs, you might enjoy his ""a brief history of Just-in-time"").<p>> Also, once you are generating basic blocks of native code, I would consider it a JIT at that point,<p>Yes, people often consider this to be a JIT. However, its much much easier to write than a ""real"" JIT. The complexity of writing a method-jit or trace-jit is very very high. This could probably be done in an afternoon by a great hacker.<p>Don't underestimate the work of writing the assembly language interpreter like Mike Pall did. Most incredibly hardcore compiler guys with whom I have discussed it were simply blown away by it. It might be one of the most hardcore feats in VM implementation history. He manually register allocated across dynamic flow control boundaries for gods sake!!<p>> reasonable choice for interpreters written in C<p>But not a fast one.",1354262867.0
