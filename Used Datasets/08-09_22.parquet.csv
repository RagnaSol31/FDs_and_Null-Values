I just read the architecture document for Wayland, which can be found at:<p><a href=""http://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html</a><p>The document explains that the Wayland compositor, when receiving an input event coming from the kernel input drivers, decides which window has to receive the event and sends it to the application.<p>If it really works that way, native Wayland clients could be isolated from other clients and they would not receive input events directed to another client. But, in practice, the Wayland server could have facilities for clients to register and receive all the events, so I'm not sure how all of this would turn out.",1303635345

It's a lesson learned regularly by programmers as they gain experience and move towards conservativism, after having seen all their silver bullet attempts go up in flames.<p>A similar tenet holds for the opposite direction - the performance junkies; the tendency with experience to move away from locking in specs early and doing heavy micro-optimization, towards writing the initial code in a way that tries intentionally to make it easy to modify.",1303634672

He started GNU, wrote emacs, glibc, gcc and probably others. He created the concept of free software and wrote a license as good as GPL to defend it.<p>He created the concept of 'Free' (note the capital F) software as his definition of free. People were sharing source code beforehand. The source to Unix was available under licence, there were plenty of tools available (ISTR TECO, EMACS' predecessor being open source for example) with source. I can create a definition of something that distorts other peoples' views of the truth and misappropriate it as my own.<p>Secondly, he wrote all of those things as part of his GNU OS, which he never finished. As someone who's written hobby OSes before I can understand that GNU was a massive undertaking, but he's not the only guy ever to write an OS and deserves no more kudos for it than the BSD guys or any other OS developers.
