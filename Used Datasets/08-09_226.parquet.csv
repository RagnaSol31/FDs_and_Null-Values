I encapsulated each chunk of code that does a single task into its own component, so an individual component (ie diagram) never had more than a few high level ""things"" connected together, so you can tell - at a glance - what does what. Of course, this means that there are many layers of components, from very high level all the way down to low level, but the point is that with proper encapsulation, visual languages are no harder to understand, read or manage than textual ones and I personally feel that, in many ways, they're actually easier.<p>I also found debugging Max/MSP code to be the best debugging experience that I've ever had, due to the fact that you can visually see where data comes from and flows and you can intercept it at any point to see whats happening.<p>I also found Max/MSP a dream to do experiment-driven-development and code design and far superior to using the Python and Clojure (the two languages I use most at the moment) REPL's. I think one of the reasons is that while I'm  still experimenting with concepts and design/algorithm ideas, I do not need to name things, I can just lay down a few components, connect them and see what happens. In textual languages, everything needs a name, so often you end up with a, b, x etc. I should point out, though, that when I design software (architecture or algorithms), I do it with boxes and lines, so graphical languages may just be a good fit for how I think and I guess not everybody is like that.<p><i>Don't even think of keeping things tidy, wires will be everywhere, and the auto-arranger doesn't work well.</i><p>With proper software engineering practices, this is not an issue. Without proper software engineering practices, we have the same issues in textual languages.<p><i>Modern Tools</i><p>This is a very good and important point, but its not inherently a graphical language problem. Things like version control and diffs - sure. They <i>just work</i> in textual languages, but in general, all languages start off with tooling problems. I do believe that good diff tools could be developed for graphical languages and that they would be at least as good as for textual languages and writing a git-compatible file format is obviously possible too (in fact, Max/MSP files look a tiny bit like JSON IIRC). This of course doesn't change the reality that currently there definitely is a tooling problem, so you are very right! But it need not always be that way.<p>My only complaint about Max/MSP is that I'm one of those people who hates the mouse... I spend most of my days in a keyboard-centric window manager using vim and a keyboard centric web browser, so graphical languages aren't exactly ideal from that point of view.",1347526645

It also says <i>nothing</i> about the process to be used to select the sprint goal and the PBIs to be completed in the sprint.<p>All Scrum says is that:<p>1)  there are things on the backlog (it doesn't specific what product backlog items are or should be - they could be user stories, they could be old-fashioned requirements docs, they could be use cases - Scrum doesn't care).<p>2) there is a Sprint Planning Meeting where the team and the product owner agree what the sprint goal is and the team forecasts the Product Backlog items it will deliver to meet that sprint goal.<p>The rest is up to the team.<p>Teams decide to track hours or points or story counting. Teams decide whether an estimation process is useful.<p><i>Also, you cannot substitute points for stories - that's the whole point of the estimation process.

Whether you share in the postmodern sentiment, understanding the context is incredibly rewarding, emotional and thought provoking.<p>Tragically, the movie's creators did not understand this and lost the <i>the whole point</i> and very soul of the novel, transforming the antihero, Ozymandius, into a lunatic and villain. Understandably, this is likely the source of your misunderstanding. Ironically, the replacement of the antihero with a villain could itself be construed as an unintended commentary on the persistence of our world's delusions.<p>The theme itself is metaphorically mirrored internally within the ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" story. The Black Freighter is a tale of a hero's lamentable decent into darkness as he loses his grip on reality to become the villain he was running from by ultimately in ignorance murdering his last tie to his world (the light), his wife. It's a commentary on the world of Watchmen itself (the world in which the heroes exist, not the heroes themselves), and the manner in which they metaphorically murdered their once heroes and only hope of salvation to descend into irrational darkness. Make no mistake too, the salvation brought about by Ozymandius is no salvation, but instead the coup de grace of a once rational world's beyond salvation ultimate embracement of the darkness, the conclusion of the novel.<p>The greatest tragedy of all though, is the spiritual death of its heroes. Alan Moore sums it up well with his inversion of the famous satirical quote, modernly taken as a criticism against political corruption, ""Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"" (""Who watches the watchmen?""):<p><pre><code>    ""'They're watching out for us, who's watching out for them?'""[1]\n</code></pre>\nIn an irrational world, only the irrational is rational, and the core of who we are becomes backwards and called into question. Do we define ourselves by the changing world around us and betray who we once were, forcing us to withdrawal into ourselves, Nite Owl, or do we ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light"" to our ultimate destruction, Rorschach?<p>Or do we embrace the darkness, as Ozymandius did, or as so poignantly put by Harvey Dent / Two-Face in The Dark Knight:<p><pre><code>    ""You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.""\n\n\n</code></pre>\n____ Update<p>This post led me to read a little more on Moore's own interpretation of his work, and while Alan intention is for us to question the need for heroes, and a call to personal responsibility, specifically anti-Reagan, I don't find this to be inconsistent with my analysis. I would add this:<p>My romanticism of the heroes may at first blush seem inconsistent with Moore's intent. However, as you can see in my conclusion, I point out that the heroes themselves become corrupted by their own roles in a world that rejects them. Moore himself is equally inconsistent in his own analysis of his work, claiming it to be a criticism of the Reagans (""invulnerable"" ""heroes"") of the worlds that lead us to the brink of madness, yet it's the world that rejects the heroes in its madness that drives itself to brink of extinction.<p>Moore said writing Watchmen allowed him ""to purge himself of his nostalgia for superheroes."" Something I feel is best illustrated in the inconsistencies between his own motivations and my analysis.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tcj.com/a-portal-to-another-dimension-alan-moore-dave-gibbons-and-neil-gaiman/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tcj.com/a-portal-to-another-dimension-alan-moore-...</a>",1347524066

The wheel of incarnation is still turning guys & gals.<p>Since the economics of systems have not changed much (70% of the cost of a system is in maintenance) I find it humorous that nobody has mentioned making code clear for the poor maintenance (enhancements, refactoring) schmuck. Everyone including the hoodwinked managers are focusing on the ""window of opportunity"" a.k.a lost opportunity cost of getting the project done - to market. This is as wrong headed now as it was in the '80s.<p>Unless you are writing one-off systems that have a real world, crucial deadline - think new scud detection techniques during the 1st gulf war [done in Lisp BTW] - just focus on making systems that can first and foremost be comprehended quickly by someone else. You're working in a team. Right? All the rest of the hyper-fast development hoopla is self aggrandizing and for the most part a waste.<p>I must admit though that the reminiscences of the days of ""feeling like an artist"" contained in this thread bring back heady memories. I hear the egos of me and my prior associates sprinkled throughout this thread.<p>Bon chance.",1347523426
