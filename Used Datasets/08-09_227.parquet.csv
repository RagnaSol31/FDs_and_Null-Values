FWIW I can offer you some anecdotal evidence. Shortly after the original Galaxy S (GT-I9000) was released, my partner (who was by then using Android) saw the advert for it and said ""crikey, that's a bit close to the bone, isn't it?"" refering to it's similarity to the iPhone. She said this before any of the brouha-ha had started. Again it's purely anecdotal so take it at face value.",1344416350.0

This more specifically applies to business customers. For example, my carpentry business could use Amex as the company card, and while I could spend a lot of money per month buying carpet to install, it doesn't mean that I am rich.<p>* Higher income can disproportionately correlate to dispensable income, and credit cards are more likely to be used on dispensable income (e.g. restaurants) rather than more core needs (e.g. rent)<p>* "" Various sociological statistics suggest the severity of wealth inequality 'with the top 10% possessing 80% of all financial assets [and] the bottom 90% holding only 20% of all financial wealth.'""

There have even been a few interesting projects done with Ocaml (mldonkey, unison), which is a pretty good choice for system-level programing and has a pretty fast compiler. Also a lot of people are using Erlang for it's supreme concurrency support and stability.<p>Which is why I don't doubt that there'll be quite a few people using Rust and/or Go. But I'm really not sure whether either of them will move beyond this tier into the PHP/Python/Ruby territory. A framework like Ruby would certanly help, and that can come out of nowhere. But I wonder whether the day of killer-feature frameworks aren't numbered, i.e. whether something like this can happen again.<p>So I think in the end it comes down to which of the two will do better in the Haskell/Ocaml/Erlang tier.

There are always problems and people never like it at first. Then they get used to it and quality of life improves over time.
