Elderly subjects showed such a pronounced sensitivity, that the induced 0.4 degrees C <i>increase</i> in skin temperature was sufficient to almost double the proportion of nocturnal slow wave sleep and to decrease the probability of early morning awakening from 0.58 to 0.04. Therefore, <i>skin warming strongly improved</i> the two most typical age-related sleep problems; a decreased slow wave sleep and an increased risk of early morning awakening.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18192289?dopt=Abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18192289?dopt=Abstract</a>",1422434970.0
