No mention of Open Source, something like this will likely not survive. I´m very skeptic in regards to something like this on crowdfunding. I´ve had a bad experience on indigogo where I lost $200+ because I trusted the creator.  Besides it´s just bits and pieces of different services already created. iGoogle, Google Plus, Google Music, Smugmug, Plex? Gmail, Pushbullet, Google Calendar, Google Drive/Docs, Lastpass although I´m soon moving to Mooltipass. CMS? Wordpress,Ghost, Pico. There don´t seem to be a need for something like this, except perhaps your own control where OwnCloud covers quite a bit of it. And if it isen´t open source and you don´t host it yourself on your own servers then  you aren´t in control.",1445417805.0

11,10424328,story,,,1,0,doublegg,TransitArt: new software for smart cities from Poland,,"Inovatica (http://inovatica.com), IT company from Lodz, Poland, has created a start-up that streamlines work on websites and applications for smart cities. TransitArt: Material Timetables UI KIT(http://transitart.io/) shortens work on this type of solutions. Thanks to it, timetable data integration takes just few minutes, which translates into a huge savings of money and comfort of the entire team.<p>With TransitArt developers can independently integrate public transport timetable data with their own project. Timetable data is converted into easy-to-use JavaScript code (just copy it to the source of your project). Another way is to use ready-made components for the most popular CMS (such as Wordpress, Joomla or Liferay), or use a well-documented API to create their own solutions for smart cities. TransitArt also allows the design, development and implementation of dedicated services for publication and visualization of passenger information.<p>TransitArt allows users to intuitively check the timetables of public transport carriers, plan travel with different means of communication (multimodality) and track movement of vehicles in real time (real time journey planner). Each of these functionalities can be implemented in a dedicated mobile application, supports RWD (Responsive Web Design) and is compatible with Google GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) standard. This international format for storing information about timetables of public transport combined with geographic information, is commonly utilized by modern cities.",1445417672.0

Fifty-nine samples were analyzed for volatile\norganic compounds (VOCs) and gasoline range organic compounds\n(GRO; defined as the hydrocarbons eluting between\n2-methylpentane and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene; approximately between\nnC_6 and nC_10), and 41 were also analyzed for diesel range\norganic compounds (DRO; defined as the hydrocarbons eluting\nbetween nC_10 and nC_28)&quot;</i><p>Results:<p><i>&quot;Trace levels of GRO and DRO compounds were detected in 9 of\n59 (0–8.8 ppb total GRO) and 23 of 41 (0–157.6 ppb total DRO)\ngroundwater samples, respectively. Although the highest concentrations\nof GRO and DRO were always detected within 1 km\nof active shale gas operations, this difference in concentration\nwithin 1 km (n = 21) and beyond 1 km (n = 20) from shale gas\nwells was only significantly higher in the case of DRO&quot;</i><p>Discussion:<p><i>&quot;In this region, there are multiple potential sources of elevated\nDRO in groundwater, including (i) upward migration of naturally\noccurring, formation-derived organic compounds over\ngeologic time; (ii) lateral transport of drilling muds, flowback, or\nproduced fluids from faulty wells; (iii) leaking oil and gas waste\ncontainment ponds; (iv) input of organic contaminants from\nsurface spills of either raw chemicals or residual fracturing fluids;\nand (v) leaking underground storage containers or local traffic.\nTo evaluate these sources systematically, we used geochemical\nfingerprinting of inorganic constituents (i.e., Br/Cl ratios),\ngroundwater residence times (i.e., 4\nHe concentration),\nand dissolved methane concentrations, coupled with our\nGRO, DRO, and geospatial analysis.&quot;</i><p>1) Upward migration: should result in higher levels of 4He in shallow groundwater. Highest DRO and GRO concentrations occur in young groundwater and with low 4He levels.<p>2) Lateral transport from wells: should result in higher GRO concentration but relatively low levels of DRO (because GROs spread faster), and higher levels of methane. Samples with high methane levels show no correlation with GRO or DRO.<p>3) Leaking waste containment ponds from fracturing operations: They don&",
