It is definitely not a disparate group of people and organisations trying to make an effective and functioning society.  It is <i>sinister</i>\n> Intelligence services watch your children naked.  Seriously - this is disturbingly dark.  In nealty 10 years of service neither I or anyone I ever met in my employment ever saw a child naked.  Honestly; that comment hints at real psychological problems. \n> Government oversight of communications travelling along copper wires is the same as pre-WW2 Nazi Germany\n> Assertions we live in a police state etc etc.  Which is hilarious because I have been to actual police states and very few people assert online they live in a police state.  You know, on account of that not being wise in an actual police state.<p>I could go on but this is beyond absurd.<p>Privacy concerns? Legitimate. \nAnything else? Hollywood-isation of actual intelligence work.  99% of it is seriously boring and no one gives a fuck what porn you watch.  Bit busy trying to stop actual people getting killed.",1403078590.0
