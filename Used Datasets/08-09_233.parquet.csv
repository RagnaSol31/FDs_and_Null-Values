A good debugger lets you set breakpoints against your app while it runs, and have the breakpoint log a message instead.

We must also realize that life is the shared experience and combined knowledge of humanity insofar.<p>You pose that they ""are just someone's experience and our experiences vary,"" and I would say that is the entire point of posts like these. Experiences do vary, and you cannot experience or test for them all. By sharing our experiences -- good or bad -- they present you with invaluable information. The proverbial mile in a man's shoes. A man who can feel like the Emperor has no clothes, and feels compelled to cry out against the social trend. Or a person who was empowered by social media, because of an unexpected exchange on a whim. Which brings me to my point.<p>For the longest time, I didn't understand Twitter. There was a fundamental disconnect, and all the weird syntax and limits were off putting. Then one night, during a the intermission of a hockey game, a humorous moment happened between the analysts. In that moment, I recalled I was following Jeremy Roenick, one of the analysts involved in the exchange, on Twitter. So I pulled my phone, tweeted at him, ""LOL. That was awesome."" And slipped my phone back in to my pocket.<p>Imagine my surprise when the intermission had concluded and the puck dropped for the third period when my phone buzzed. It was Jeremy Roenick on Twitter, just saying thanks. No, really, imagine my surprise. This is old hat to everyone already on the Twitter tip, but my mind had just been blown to pieces. Imagine trying to break that scenario down for anyone around the dawn of television? I used a device to talk to the man on the TV, and he talked back, in real time. Modern witchcraft. In that moment I switched from ""Twitter is stupid,"" to, ""Twitter is the single greatest thing since the last wild declaration I've made."" I understood it finally, Twitter connects the world, directly.<p>You can say that he ""doesn't know how to use Facebook"" and even be correct, but that doesn't matter. To him, until he gets new information or insight, his opinion and experience with the product is absolute. It happened and here's how he felt. There's valuable information about the human experience in why he feels that way, and discussion to be had about why people seem to experience this duality. And the discussion is only going to evolve and change as we both grow the web and social, as well as when more of the world's youth who have never lived without these tools continue to grow online; as more of the world's cultures begin to increase their presence online and inter-mingle.<p>These posts, while agreeably fixated on the opinions of individuals, are part of the process for all of us as a whole.

It may not be as dirty as gasoline or coal, but it's still the same kind of thing fundamentally.<p>If we're going to retool <i>the entire transportation infrasturcture</i>-- engines, pumping stations, and refineries-- I think we should aim a little higher than a minor improvement.  The big problems with gasoline are the public health problem from exhaust fumes and the fact that we will run out of the stuff eventually.  Natural gas doesn't solve any of those problems, and it adds transportation and potential safety problems that gasoline doesn't have.<p>I'd be interested in hearing from a physicist / engineer how much greater the safety problems are with natural gas.
