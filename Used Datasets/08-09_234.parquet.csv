Job's single defining contribution to the Apple I was ""hey we should sell this!"", he did literally NOTHING else.<p>That's true, but that was essential. I was there, I met all the principals, and Jobs made Apple. He didn't design the computer, he sold it. Later, he met and persuaded financial backers to fund Apple's growth.<p>Wozniak's contribution cannot be denied (who would want to do that?), but without Jobs, it wouldn't have become Apple. The reason? Woz wanted to give his design away, to his peers, an instinct I share now and shared then. That's admirable, but it wouldn't have resulted in the Apple Computer of today, for better or worse.",1353661163.0

There's nothing wrong with it, and he is certainly <i>very good</i> at certain things, like creating minimal circuits that do several things at once.<p>But to say he understands UX is not really true. Having run a music festival and having taught kids makes him certainly (a little bit) more qualified for it, still.<p>You see, the problem with people who are very good with technology is that they will overcome any usability problems to use said tech. To be good at UX you need to put yourself in the shoes of your grandma and see things as she sees it, which is the opposite of the 'tech' way of thinking.",1353661143.0

21,4821434,comment,4821161.0,4821161.0,9,0,jammur,,,"Saying that ""Improving is not Apple-style innovation,"" seems kinda wrong. Yes, they've had a few brand new product launches, but most of their time has been spent improving existing products. The progression from the original iPod to the current version has been a series of incremental improvements over the course of the last 11 years. Same goes for all the Mac computers. If anything I think the opposite is true, that Apple-style innovation tends to be improvement, with a few big leaps once in a while.<p>Also, new isn't necessarily better. I think Microsoft is in a position right now where they have the choice of duplicating the iOS/Android experience, or trying something completely different. Since they've shown a willingness to spend tons of money on new projects and play the long game, I think their strategy of trying new things is good for them. Products don't generally start out great, but rather get there over time and over multiple incremental iterations. I think Microsoft is essentially still searching for v1. Apple on the other hand already has a product that people love and buy in huge numbers. They have their good v1 and are now trying to make it great through incremental improvements.",1353660864.0

The impression I get from non-technical people that I know is that they think of search engines as being somehow ""part of the browser"" or ""part of the Internet"". They often don't even know which one they use. They'll refer to searching as ""Googling"", but they're using Bing because it was the default with IE or they're using SuperGreatSearch 3.0 because Norton installed it and they haven't noticed the difference.<p>And you're suggesting that in a market like this, a silly name is a <i>bad</i> thing?",1353658309.0
