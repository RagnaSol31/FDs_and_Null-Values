3,668457,comment,668183.0,668309.0,0,0,Maro,,,"If you have a 'strong pure math background', chances are you won't like theoretical physics. Physics is all about positive thinking, results and moving forward. As a result the 'theories' aren't theories in the mathematical sense, to a mathematician they're just a bunch of equations thrown together. (My point is, once something 'works', physicists aren't interested in making it mathematically rigorous.) There are no definitions, clearly stated theorems and proofs, instead we have 'physical insight'. They always say the language of physics is mathematics. My take is that physics borrows the syntax of mathematics, but not the semantics. That may not be an exact statement, but hey, I'm  a physicist myself =)<p>You will never ever be able to have a 'solid understanding' of modern theoretical physics in the sense you have a solid understanding of complex analysis, noone does. (A notable exception is Relativity.)<p>Nevertheless, some books.\nFeynman lectures on physics (3 volumes): to learn the 'physical insight' part. Really really good.\nLandau (many volumes): I personally don't like Landau, but it's pretty standard and comprehensive.",1245660956.0

Of course, if we were to catch the very specific form of H1N1 with the genetic coding that matches the swine flu epidemic, that'd be worse.<p>It's worth remembering that in almost all cases, it's not the flu that kills you - it's the onset pneumonia, diarrhea and dehydration that takes you down. The best survivalist method is to remind yourself how to treat cold/flu symptoms, stock up on meds, and sweat it out. Helps if your health insurance is up to date too. :)",1245660664.0

Speaking in generalities, I think that the system over there privileges ""methodologies"" and certifications over both core skills and core CS concepts.<p>I have talented Java engineers working for me who I have had to teach regular expressions to.  Many American engineers with graduate degrees in CS from a good university would be able to predict that /ab+/ matched the string ""abc"".  It would be unlikely in the extreme for them to have never heard of the word ""regular expression"" before.  I am oh for five on this with my most recent five Indian engineers.  Even after teaching them basic regular expressions I have not found them capable of using them to accomplish tasks without specific direction.<p>(For example, if someVariableName is used in the project, and the customer later informs us that our naming of it does not match their understanding, we might have to rewrite that variable name and associated variables and methods globally.  It should be trivial to find all instances of that with a search by regexp, right?  But they don't hear that in the instruction ""X is now called Y, change all appropriate variables and methods"" -- instead, two days later I'm told they're done with a job that I expected to take a few hours, and then I fire a regexp against the source tree and see that 40% of it is still not done.)<p>I have frequently had to explain bugs to our engineers which resulted not from chance or carelessness but from simple ignorance of core CS101 concepts, such as pass by reference.  (Example: In our first code review, I noticed a lot of reuse of HashMaps to carry parameters to DAOs.  I told folks to not reuse them, because that introduces the risk of somebody changing the HashMap in the DAO, thus causing later users of the map to have unexpected behavior.  I was told, by our most talented Indian engineer, that this would not happen because the values in the HashMap would magically spring back after the DAO was done with it.  This does not happen, and it is a CS101 misconception.  Sure enough, we had bugs caused by reuse.  So, after a remedial CS101 lecture to the team, I reiterated that maps were not to be reused, because they would cause bugs.  What do I find in Code Review ",
