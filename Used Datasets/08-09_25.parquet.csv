The nice thing about this method is that it converges nicely even if you make errors (arithmetical or rounding) along the way -- so you can start by working with only a few digits and only use full precision right at the end.<p>You could compute square roots using a direct NR iteration (Y := (Y + X/Y) / 2), but that requires that you perform a division at each step -- most people find multiplications to be easier and faster.",1240736063

13,579809,comment,579690.0,579690.0,0,0,a5huynh,,,"I'm currently a UCSD comp sci undergrad, and overall my experience here has been great.<p>Academically, our curriculum is one of the best (although, IMHO it is getting a bit dumbed down, focusing more on Java than C/C++ as it did when I was a freshmen). We're in fact one of the few schools that requires you to take the compiler construction class, which is perhaps one of most grueling (yet intellectually stimulating) classes in the CSE curriculum. We've also got Dasgupta, the guy who practically wrote the book on algorithms, teaching algorithms here (<a href=""http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/book/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/book/index.html</a>). For research we've got Calit2 (<a href=""http://www.calit2.net/about/buildings/ucsd/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.calit2.net/about/buildings/ucsd/index.php</a>) which has a bunch of cool projects going on at all times (just pop on in and ask around, people there are always happy to show you what they're doing)<p>Socially, I'd have to admit that if you're the ""bustling"" city sort of guy, La Jolla doesn't really cut the cake. But if you like the laid back ""chill"" attitude that comes with being practically right next to the beach, then we're pretty much the place to be. Picking the right college is also an essential part of the equation. For comp sci (and engineers in general) Warren seems to be the best choice, and basically surrounds you with students in similar majors, which really helps when you're on those late night study/hacking sessions because they'll be people across the hallway doing the exact same thing.<p>As for students with interest in YC, I think there's plenty. In fact I'm one of them. The trick is getting into the right circles, talking to the right people. Joining orgs on campus that have especially dedicated/passionate students is the best way by far. I recommend orgs like TESC (<a href=""http://tesc.ucsd.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tesc.ucsd.edu</a>) for engineers in general or CSES (<a href=""http://cses.ucsd.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cses.ucsd.edu</a>) for comp sci. Both these orgs are filled with people who like doing what they're doing, and usually have fun projects/events that enables you to meet the right kind of people.<p>Now, I don't really know what life is like at UCLA, but hopefully my post gives you an idea of what its like to be a current comp sci undergrad here at UCSD.",1240735374

15,579807,comment,579344.0,579741.0,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""It's the concept that society is the way it is because a process of darwinian selection has settled on the arrangement and it is dangerous to wantonly mess with this complex system.""<p>An economist sees a $100 bill on the sidewalk.  He neglects to pick it up because it can't possibly be real.  If it were, an efficient market dictates that somebody would already have picked it up.  A five year old follows behind, picks it up, and exclaims ""Look ma, I just found $100.""  The economist turns around and says, ""See?  I was right.""<p>Just because Darwinian selection gives better results than any individual decision does not absolve you from making individual decisions.  It works because of the presence of mutations: take away the mutations, and evolution ceases to give useful results.  You see the same problem in finance: the market is efficient only to the extent that people do not believe it is efficient, because once people start believing that it's efficient, they'll invest in index funds and nobody will actually scout out the information needed to drive good stocks higher and bad stocks lower.<p>In short, I think that culture is a complex, self-regulating system, and that alone is why it should be messed with.",1240735237

The first was in summer of 1918 - very unusual, as influenza normally falls to extremely low rates during summer. Note that the current outbreak is also highly unseasonal.<p>The 1918 pandemic killed with a very unusual age pattern. Instead of peaks in just the very young and the very old, there was a W shape, with a huge number of young and healthy people who would not normally die from influenza. There are various conjectures as to the cause of this. The current virus is also killing young and healthy adults.""<p>In the first argument it isn't even clear why and if it's dangerous. Did the 1918 flu kill so many people because of something related to it being a summer outbreak, or would deaths have been even worse if it were a winter outbreak?<p>Those were just similarities just mentioned to make people think ""Oh no! It's 1918 all over again!"" without actually having to prove that it is. Pretty low debating tactic.",1240735197

34,579788,comment,579690.0,579690.0,0,0,kyro,,,"I went to UCSD for my first two years, majoring in biology, and transferred to UCI, not because it was tough, but because I HATED the school.<p>Please, please, please consider campus and social life. I held the belief prior to entering college, one probably inherited from my traditional familial roots, that social life and location really doesn't matter - it's all about the academics and doing well. It's not true.<p>I was admitted to UCSD's Sixth College, and I was even given a student apartment, which as a freshman was pretty amazing. Problem was, I got it in some forrest-like part of the school. I felt like I was going hiking every time I'd walk to the bus stop. I started off on a bad foot.<p>I tried looking past that, though, and tried to find the social scene. The school is very very disjointed, having 6 separate 'colleges,' all with their own dining hall, etc. You don't feel like you're part of one big amazing school. Come 6pm, the campus is pretty empty, as the main hubs where students are supposed to be hanging out are quite far from their dorms. Everyone hangs out in their dorm building. It's depressing. Very very depressing.<p>Sure, La Jolla is a beautiful city if you're a 35+ moderately wealthy individual who likes to kick back on the patio of an Italian restaurant and watch the waves go by, or if you're a surfer. Me, I'm  a city guy. I wanted a bustling city, where there was always something to do. The closest 'city' to La Jolla is downtown SD, which is nice, but you won't find yourself hanging out there too often. La Jolla just isn't a college town.<p>I couldn't bear it any longer after two years. Home was an hour and a half drive away, all my friends were at UCI, there were more things to do in Orange County and at UCI, and at UCI, I just felt like I was part of one proud campus. Although I do commute from home now, I often stroll into campus with my friends late afternoon, and attend lectures, free movies, etc., that are always happening on campus.<p>My brother, and good friends attend UCLA and from what I've experienced there, the social life is quite amazing. If anywhere you feel proud of the school you attend, it's UCLA. You're a Bruin. And although I hate the school and everything about it, due to some residual hatred from being rejected, I can say that UCLA/Westwood, compared to UCSD/La Jolla, is magnitudes upon magnitudes more bustling, exciting, and social.<p>I can't speak to the CS part of your question, but I can definitely give you some info on campus life with respect to UCSD. I had such a crappy experience, and really advise people not to go unless they are that type of individual that enjoys the laid back, surfer type lifestyle.<p>Campus and social life matters. Big time.<p>BTW: Since some SoCal HN readers seem to be popping up in this thread, we should really network and maybe throw a little get together. I've been trying to find people on here from SoCal for ages, but no one really responded to any of my inquiries.",1240733565
