Material and methods<p>Subjects.<p>[Ethical committee disclaimer]. [All subjects] were screened for morningness or\neveningness according to their timing preferences as defined by two questionnaires\n(MEQ (1) and MCTQ (2)). The two groups were matched according to age, sex and\neducational level and did not differ in their anxiety and depression levels as well as in\nsleep quality and day time sleepiness (all ps > 0.1; Table S1). Morning and evening\ntypes significantly differed in their scores on the two chronotype questionnaires\n(MEQ and MCTQ). Exclusion criteria were reports of medical, psychiatric and sleep\ndisorders, medication or drug consumption, alcohol abuse, excessive caffeine\nconsumption or physical activity, shift work within the three past months, and\ntransmeridian travel or disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle within one month before\nthe experiment.<p>Design and Procedures.<p>An overview of the study design is illustrated in Fig. 1 of the main text. Individual\ntimes were scheduled according to each volunteer’s preferred sleep and wake timing.\nCriteria for such timing preferences included sleep schedules adopted on free days as\nassessed by the MCTQ (2) and after interviewing the subject to ensure that the\nscheduled timing was as close as possible to the schedule that he or she would\nspontaneously adopt. In a second step, the screened subjects came to the sleep facility\nfor a habituation night. After this night, they were asked to follow the sleep schedule\n(± 30 minutes) they would spontaneously adopt while free from any social and\nprofessional constraints. Target bedtimes and wake times were determined for a sleep\nduration of about 8 h (± 30 minutes). To assess the subjects’ compliance to the\nselected rest-activity patterns, motor activity of the non-dominant arm was recorded\nusing actimeters the week prior to the experimental sessions along with sleep-wake\nlogs. After this week under actimetry recording, subjects came to the sleep laboratory\nfor 2 consecutive nights. The precise schedule of each session was individually\nadapted according to the subject’s habitual bedtime on the basis of the mean timing of\nthe subject’s sleep midpoint derived from actimetric data of the preceding week.<p>Subjects reported to the laboratory 7 hours before habitual lights off on day 1. After\nthe hook-up of the electrodes, they continuously stayed under controlled conditions in\ndim light (< 10 lux) in order to avoid the influence of bright light on circadian\nrhythmicity parameters (3) and in the aim to equalize pre-scan conditions between\nsubjects. Subjective sleepiness (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Karolinska\nSleepiness Scale (KSS (4))) and objective vigilance (a modified version of the PVT\n(5)) were assessed at hourly intervals while awake. Furthermore, hourly collected\nsaliva samples were assayed for melatonin using a direct double-antibody\nradioimmunoassay validated by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy with an\nanalytical at least detectable dose of 0.65 pg/ml (6). Circadian phase was estimated\nby the calculation of the mid-range crossing time of salivary melatonin (7, 8). For\neach individual curve, the maximum value and the minimum value was averaged\n(mid-range value pg/ml) and taken to determine the mid-range crossing time (time of\nday, h) on the abscissa.<p>Polygraphic data (see below) were recorded during the nights preceding fMRI\nsessions. After lights off, subjects were allowed to sleep for 8 hours. Then, 1.5\n(morning session) and 10.5 (evening session) hours after wake up of scheduled sleep\ntiming, they underwent a fMRI session during the practice of various cognitive tests,\nincluding the psychomotor vigilance task on which we focus here. For half of the\nsubjects, the morning session followed the first experimental night and the evening\nsession the second night, whereas for the other half of the volunteers the morning\nsession followed the second experimental night and the evening session the first night.\nSubjects were allowed to leave the facility between the two experimental nights. They\nstayed in the laboratory under dim light conditions (<10 lux) for at least 4 hours\nbefore the scanning sessions (see dashed line in Fig. 1). They wore protective glasses\navoiding excessive light input when going to the scanner room.<p>The order of selected cognitive tasks was counterbalanced across subjects and\nsessions. Before the start of the experimental protocol, all subjects underwent a short\nhabituation scan session in order to familiarize them with the noise and the body\npositions associated with the fMRI environment.",1247474699.0

If a person spends USD 10 bidding on a product, the mere possibility of having a USD 1200 product for such a low price may be more valuable to him than Swoopo's valuation of the transaction (USD 10).

But I'm sure you can find examples at all ratios.<p>I'll look at what I use. Both Weebly & Dropbox (I use the free of both) follow a true freemium model. IE, they both offer a perfectly usable free version. I'm not sure what percentage they do, but 1% - 10% sounds about right to me, especially if you discount those who are really sampling vs those who actually use.<p>I also use Gmail & Gdocs. These are theoretically freemium too, but at a much higher free/paid ratio.<p>You're going to see quite a lot in the professional/business software category. My explanation for this is that it is software people pay for. If you can sell your software/service, maybe can probably sell it with a freemium model.<p>If you can't sell it (eg photo sharing/search/etc.), maybe you just can't sell it. Freemium isn't magic.<p>The percentage has to relate to your marginal costs in some way. Even 1:2000 can be fine if your marginal costs are zero. You care about conversion rates only inasmuch as you care about absolute numbers.<p>*I recoiled a little when I read Anderson quoting an actual ratio. I think that it's a bit off.
