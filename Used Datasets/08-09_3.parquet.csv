Instead focus that the doesn't have a lot of google results. Because most peole do not use the adress bar they use google to find a webpage. I don't claim this is totally but Mr Godin got a point there.<p>Regards,\nMarco",1227171314

Because ""just getting big Adsense check"" isn't that easy to do, especially with a ""bad site"". ;-)",1227171012

Multiply that number by 2 to be conservative, or 4 to be more ambitious, and you have a valuation anywhere from $250,000 to $500,000.<p>having said that, any potential buyer would need a lot more information before making that kind of decision, such as what their revenue growth looks like, what it would look like realistically projected into the future, etc.",1227170879
5,370475,comment,370159.0,370225.0,0,0,jwilliams,,,Makes you wonder if there was another reason - e.g. they had an internal reason to get c/c++ running on the VM - then they figured they might as well open source it.,1227170854
6,370474,comment,370258.0,370258.0,0,0,EastSmith,,,"When I had to chose a name, I somehow came with a shortlist of three names. Then I put these three names on my desktop as a wallpaper. I wrote them in different fonts, colors and in these three variations: Google, google, GOOGLE. \nOn the first day I hated how one of it looked and dropped it. Then for a week I asked couple of close friends, who are not in the industry which one they liked and there was a clear winner. Of course, you have to be careful in case someone steals you .com registration before you decide.<p>The other thing I looked for while chosing a name is that important international names are still free: google.de, google.co.uk, etc.",1227170718
7,370472,comment,367153.0,367484.0,0,0,mdasen,,,"Oh, you can totally automate that kind of thing - it's just a lot harder than being able to predict.<p>Like, because Hulu deals with a comparatively small set of videos that are uploaded by staff rather than end users, they don't need to build as much.  If there is a workflow that must be followed to upload the videos, that's fine.  It's a lot easier to develop for internal use than for end-users.<p>Likewise, with 100 videos a week Hulu could have one of their programmers manually deal with a lot of stuff that YouTube couldn't since having a person sort through or run a process on their millions of videos just isn't the same.<p>It's just an easier task.  Yeah, clearly YouTube is possible, but it's hard.  You have to store a lot more data, you don't have staff entering in nice meta-data and making sure they're aren't dupes, you don't have the option of telling a user, ""encode this on your computer and then SFTP it to here"", you have a ton more videos, you don't know what's popular.<p>It's a lot more software to write.  It's what I find so impressive about YouTube.  Hulu is nice, but it isn't that impressive.  With the little amount of data they're storing it's easy to design databases and file storage systems that will accommodate that and there are challenges pushing that much data over a pipe as it's a popular site, but nothing like YouTube's challenges.<p>Look at it this way, YouTube has over 65,000 videos uploaded every single day!  And that's from way back in 2006!  YouTube has increased its presence since then.  That's huge.  Everything has to just work.  Hulu gets what?  10 videos a day and they have several fulltime staff?  Heck, they could do most things manually.  Something is a little glitchy, they can just deal with it manually.",1227170499

When you do this, you really have to pay attention to your text colors and typeface choices. I guess it's a little like losing your sense of sight and your hearing becomes more acute. Designing outside your comfort zone can be a great learning experience.",1227169143
16,370463,comment,369932.0,369932.0,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"All that talk about unions misses one much more systemic point. It's that linking social benefits to individual employment relationships is a bad idea. It creates dependencies that make the system inflexible. It reduces worker mobility. It creates long term obligations that individual companies, not matter how large, can never garantee.<p>It's a paternalistic model that puts companies in the position of families or states that care for people based not on merit but on human needs and dignity. Both are important but mixing them creates a conflict of interest.<p>Money is flexible. Use money to pay people for work. Not health plans and pensions, not stock options, just money and people can go and buy all of the former. Keep things simple.",1227168549

Is it anyone's fault but your Dad's that he's only qualified to work in a factory? Is it anyone's fault but my Dad's that he didn't learn about computers even though he saw them appearing everywhere?<p>My Dad was able to learn some new skills and eventually land on his feet after being unemployed for quite some time.
