I think that language matters, and I am concerned about the influence of language on my four daughters (aged 3 to 13).  I'm not saying that this is the most important issue, of course-- but I also don't think that sexist language should get a free pass in the name of some higher efficiency.<p><i>Learning more personal finance, investing, and negotiation will massively help anyone's career success, including women.

Attitudes like racism and sexism are maintained though a variety of means, including casual acts that have largely symbolic value.  If you reject the parallel to race, how about we draw an alternative parallel to sexual orientation?  I know that in my lifetime, there have been major shifts in both the discourse around homosexuality and the rights gay people have won.  I firmly believe the two are related, and that using ""gay"" as a perjorative has a (subtle, but real) damaging effect on society.  Similarly, pretending that ""he"" is gender neutral supports unconscious assumptions that do women no favors.<p>The historical use of ""he"" to refer to both genders should, in my opinion, be relegated to history.",1291797806.0

I think you missed mine though - my point is that you have a limited amount of time each day to direct your attention. If you want to be more successful, or want women to be more successful, then focusing on he/she pronouns is a very bad use of your time. Focusing on creating wealth, learning management, networking, investing, saving, become more disciplined, fit, healthy, exercising are all good uses of time.<p>After the majority of women are well-informed and well-educated on the topics of nutrition/fitness, finance, investing, negotiation, accounting, self-discipline, goal setting, etc, etc, etc. - after all that's done then let's turn our attention to pronouns. In the meantime, it's rather like stepping over dollars to pick up pennies. Learning more personal finance, investing, and negotiation will massively help anyone's career success, including women. Having everyone switch to singular they will not make so big of a difference.<p>> Casual minor acts of racism probably have very little effect on Michael Jordan.<p>I'm getting better at predicting what people's responses to my comments will be - I knew someone would play the racism card. Well done. Comparing the historical use of ""he"" in English for a singular pronoun to racism smacks of <i>really</i> missing the point though - the point is, pronoun usage is going to have a trivial impact, if any, on people's successes.

It's not your right to prissily look down on the human race from your ivory tower of Math and grumble about killing.<p>What I see when I look upon our history is a series of people taking their actions seriously.  I see a series of people that slowly, agonizingly, painstakingly turned away from violence in order to serve those 'side-effects' that you think we killers disregard.<p>And that's the crux of it.
