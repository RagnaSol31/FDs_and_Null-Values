Yet, even Darwin himself struggled with the ramifications of what we truly are (and aren't) after his mind numbing discovery. The truth is far too devastating for the majority, and it is this fact that divides us. A brain can only be of three dispositions: one that understands reality, one that refuses to, and one that doesn't. A subset of the last is a brain which simplifies a complex, poorly understood reality into one that is far easier to grasp. This last one is where the majority find comfort.<p>Human motivation is frighteningly simple if looked at objectively, and it is this truth that we hide from ourselves at all costs to preserve our sanity.",1319273926.0

20,3143181,comment,3138826.0,3140008.0,6,0,FD3SA,,,"Hero worship exists as a powerful evolutionary parasite, designed to extract submission from a competing male from within your tribe. If a member of your tribe is climbing the totem pole rapidly, you can either let him by or challenge him. If you challenge him, you need to believe that you are better. This is risky, since objectively measuring human ability has proven difficult even to this day. Thus, personality cults emerge whose purpose is to make one seem superhuman with wild stories, and discourage potential challengers. Whoever has the strongest personality cult wins the status challenge, and moves up. The one who submits to the personality cult without challenge preserves his status relative to others, and is not removed from the totem pole.<p>Competence is a necessary, but not sufficient, trait to reach the top. There are a great many people in the world more competent than Jeff Bezos. They do however, lack the cult of personality and thus are not at the top of their own totem poles.<p>The lack of personality cults in Microsoft and Facebook is the reason why they always receive bad press for not having ""visionary leaders"" or ""creative energy"". This is all code speak for the fact that employees do not fear the personalities of Zuckerberg and Gates (and Allen), so they have less respect for the company and thus believe it is not a place worth working for as they'd rather not ""work under an equal"". Simply put, Zuck and Gates did not cultivate their personality cults enough for the average employee to fear AND respect them as a superhuman CEO demigod. And they pay the price to this day by being on the receiving end of slightly veiled slander at their abilities and thus, their right to rule.<p>I wonder how many people realize this as they read about Steve Jobs, the tech CEO who should have been a politician.",1319272719.0

25,3143176,comment,3142875.0,3143145.0,-4,0,chugger,,,"I posted this on another thread but I think it's worth repeating. Here's why Larry Page is doing poor job.<p>A company's Return on Invested Capital is the ultimate measure of a company's valuation. it's not the PE, EPS, etc. Basically, ROIC is a measure of how efficient a company is in using its capital to generate returns. Warren Buffet uses ROIC to evaluate companies.\nLet's compare Apple and Google's ROIC. Apple's return on invested capital is 30.4% with a 5-year average of 26.1% despite Apple having lower gross profit margins compared to Google. a 30.4% ROIC is amazingly high for a ""hardware company"". Google's return on invested capital is only 18.3% with 5 year aveage of 17.2%. Why?<p>Different types of growth earn different degrees of return so not all growth is equally value-creating. Growth strategies based on organic new product development (ie. iPod, iPhone, iPad, iMac, etc.) frequently have the highest returns because they dont require much new capital. Apple can add new products to their existing factory lines and distribution systems, without much capital expenditure. The investments to produce new products are not all required at once. If preliminary results are not promising, future investments can be scaled back or canceled. Contrast this with Google's growth strategy of acquiring companies (Motorola, Youtube, Android, Doubleclick, etc.). Acquisitions require that the entire investment be made up front. The amount of up-front payment reflects the expected cash flows from the target company plus a premium to stave off other bidders. So even if Google can improve the target company enough to generate an attractive ROIC, the rate of return is typically only a small amount higher than its cost of capital. Factor in the additional traffic acquisition costs and costs of running hundreds of thousands of servers to support Google search, Youtube, Blogspot, GMail, etc. and you'll see why Google's return on invested capital is much lower compared to Apple. Google has a habit of wasting money on money-losing initiatives with low ROIC (Google's $280-million solar power initiative, self driving cars, etc.). Wall Street perceives the $12.5 Billion Moto acquisition as an expensive and inefficient use of capital that will further dilute the company's ROIC. Motorola's acquisition does not create or add value to Google. it actually destroys value, at least until Google recoups the $12.5 Billion acquisition cost. \nThis is the reason why Apple is the most valuable company in the world. Meanwhile, Google's market cap's been stuck in the $170-$200B range for a couple of years now.<p>Here's the number one rule of conservation of value: anything that doesn't increase cash flows doesn't create value.",1319272444.0
