Narcisism is beeing in love with oneself.<p>What the OP describes is an internal drive to push oneself forward when the oppurtunity is given. A seed of entrepreneur, hero, leader,.. I guess not everyone has such strong incentive. He expect it and will find it normal if it happens. Which is good thing.<p>He expressed his frustration that it didn't happen yet and start to wonder if he is not wasting his life.<p>I find it very interesting from an AI perspective. We can clearly see a fundamental drive of the human behavior.<p>It's not much different from the love drive we have when young. We are also frustrated when we have to wait for it to happen. This frustration is shared and contributes to overcome all our fears and natural protections. Instead of waiting overwelmed by the frustration, one should prepare oneself for this moment to be attractive and make it a success.<p>So to the OP I would suggest to use the frustration as a push to prepare yourself to do great things. \nHe experience a valuable and positive drive. It's normal. He should now prepare himself for that to have the maximum competence when this happens. He should also keep in mind that the great thing that he is expected to do may happen when he is 50 or 70. Thus don't wait for it to happen, because it might not be soon. It's like love. Finally he should also keep in mind that he'll also have his part of the job to do for it to happen. I.e becoming President of the uSA. It doesn't fall upon you like that.",1343549131.0
