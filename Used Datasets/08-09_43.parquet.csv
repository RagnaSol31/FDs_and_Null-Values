It feels like you've read the first part about the sphere inside the other spheres, but not read the rest that talks about the other reasons a sphere is ""spikey"".<p>You say:<p><pre><code>  > It's not the spheres that are ""spikey"", the cubes are.\n</code></pre>\nIt's true that cubes are spikey, but it's in an obvious and easy to visualize sense.  Take an ordinary 3D cube, stretch out the corners and you've got the idea.<p>The reason high-dimensional spheres are ""spikey"" is more subtle, harder to visualize, and easy to get wrong when working in machine learning.

However, I found this one to be a bit incomplete near the end:<p><i>The input string : beep boop beer!</i><p><i>The input string in binary : 0110 0010 0110 0101 0110 0101 0111 0000 0010 0000 0110 0010 0110 1111 0110 1111 0111 0000 0010 0000 0110 0010 0110 0101 0110 0101 0111 0010 0010 0001</i><p><i>The encoded string : 0011 1110 1011 0001 0010 1010 1100 1111 1000 1001</i><p>This makes the encoding look much more effective on small strings than it really is. Namely, just like you need an ASCII table to convert the first byte (0110 0010) from the input string to a ""b"" (but virtually every computer has an ASCII table - or a font - somewhere!), you need the huffman table, stored in some efficient way, to be able to interpret the compressed string. Storing (and reading) a huffman table size-efficiently isn't perfectly trivial either, and no matter what it would blow up the ""compressed"" string to be bigger than the original.<p>In other words, IMHO this article only explained half of what Huffman coding is about.",1337503225.0

If two people know each other deeply enough to get married, their communication is hopefully open enough to be able to have a rational discussion about anything, including prenups, without hurting the other by bringing it up.  After such discussion, if they come to the decision that the existence of the prenup would psychologically decrease the success rate of their marriage, they are welcome not to enter into such an agreement.  But if they don't feel that that's the case, it makes a lot of logical sense to have one.<p>Disclaimer: I'm not married, and I honestly don't know which camp I'll fall into.",1337501376.0

Let me summarize.<p>If you look at high-dimensional cubes it's pretty obvious that the corners get further and further away from the center as the dimension goes up. People (quite rightly) feel that this can be visualized as taking an ordinary 3D cube and tugging on the corners, stretching them out and thus making them ""spikey"".<p>With spheres, though, there are no corners, so people think they remain ""smooth"". Which they do, in a sense, but that leads to the wrong intuition.  Lopping off a high-dimensional spherical cap gives you virtually no volume at all, and in our 3D world the shape that is as symmetrical as you can make it, but which when you chop it off, has almost no volume, is a spike.<p>Add to that these comments: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3997551"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3997551</a> and <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3997681"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3997681</a><p>These allude to the fact that when you've on the surface of a high-dimensional sphere, almost every step takes you out.  Getting into the interior is like trying to get into the interior of a spike from its tip.<p>Does that help?",1337501252.0
