Heartfelt apology, total acceptance of responsibility, comes straight from the top, makes full amends to customers, identifies specific changes made to address problem in the future, closes with thanks to customers.<p>Edited to add: For extra credit, it might have been worthwhile to apologize to the merchant for failing to prevent a situation which caused their wares to be presented in an unflattering manner.<p>This probably stands reality on it's head, but what actually happened on one particular day in Tokyo is not maximally relevant to Groupon's Japanese business, and having a reputation for being magnanimous and savvy to how the game is played can only help them in the future.

And I still think no wind is a useful simplifying assumption for them, particularly on power grounds.<p>A constant wind I agree looks like it would be within their capabilities, though their route planning software would need to take account of it and approach the target from upwind by default - not impossible but another thing to account for.<p>The real issue for me is gusting. They are definitely small and light enough that power-to-weight issues, particularly when carrying a load with a higher surface area to the wind than the craft itself, means that it <i>will</i> get knocked off course by gusts. That obviously needs allowing for when navigating to and from the construction site, but particularly when dropping off a load - if the release comes at the same point as the gust, the part simply won't end up where they wanted.<p>Do I think all of these problems are unsolvable? No, but it makes a useful simplifying assumption for their version 1 that they don't have to deal with any of them because they're flying indoors.",1295254640.0

So there should be no stigma on asking stupid questions or any questions at all, in fact, most stupid questions when looked at in some detail turn out to be not that stupid at all.<p>The most frustrating part of asking 'stupid' questions is if the person that you're asking them off tells you to go away because it is a stupid question or because 'you wouldn't understand', typically if someone has a superior attitude towards a subject but refuses to answer stupid questions it turns out in the long run they didn't know quite as much about it as they suggested in the first place.",1295254368.0

I use Redis for several projects and for me it serves well. Particularly, I know the limit of Redis and can predict how much memory it will eventually eat up with respect to the growth of site. Besides, Redis has a small code base that I can tinker around (It is c!) which would be nearly impossible for me to tinker around MySQL with confidence. Tokyo Cabinet has a nice code base too, and I liked it a lot but the limitation is: Tokyo Cabinet provides either a simple key-value db (b-tree/hashtable) or a full flee of table-like db. The former one is too simple to actual usage and the latter one is too complex (from my point of view, it is just SQL without parser, I even programmed a SQL parser on top of its table db). For my usage, a document-based db (MongoDB) or Redis which has sorted set/set data structure is enough and since MongoDB is complex in terms of code base too, Redis becomes my first choice.<p>Although Redis is critiqued for its VM implementation, I found that it is good enough for my specific usage: I have around 2 million or so keys and the workset is about 25k keys average.<p>Yes, Redis is not a universal solution to everything, and I am a little worried about its current proposal of disk-based system (to me, Tokyo Cabinet's disk op implementation is more mature and antirez should do more analysis on the comparison to Tokyo Cabinet and Berkeley DB since these two are only known k-v based disk DBs that tested in battle field).",1295254028.0

We're currently seeing small proof-of-concept machines lifting small, light parts, but the machines needed to lift useful construction parts will need to be many times larger and heavier, and if they're going to run for any serious amount of time (as would be needed to be useful) then they either need very much bigger batteries or large fuel tanks, which again means extra weight which means more power, more noise and more energy to lift the extra weight of the energy. It's not impossible but it's a vicious, not virtuous, circle.<p>I relatively regularly have the local police helicopter overhead and it's definitely loud enough to keep people awake, sometimes to wake you up in the first place. A whole fleet of these withing 1/4 mile of you will be loud, noticeably louder than a usual construction crew, and I'm still concerned about the neighbours complaining about the risk of this fleet of robot helicopters crashing into each other or dropping parts.

However, the amount of paperwork required to qualify for it and rigorously document how you arrived at the number you quote the IRS doesn't make sense until you're closer to a Fog Creek or 37Signals than to a sole proprietor.<p>A different option is to use the time you've spent on the project as part of the basis for the IP you're developing, and claim a non-zero basis when you sell, thus reducing the amount of capital gains taxes you have to pay versus having a cost basis of $0.  Again, this gets heady quickly: talk to an accountant.<p>Personally, at my scales, I find it easier to bill clients $10 than to decrease my tax burden by $1.",1295251653.0

Many of the technologies at the higher level are directly written in C, and its going to be a while before the C goes away.<p>I.e.: its like a world where all our cellphones/email still, under the covers, run over fax, and we still need a fax machine in every house to make this possible. =P<p>Without people to write the languages in C, and without people to hack on the kernel in C, there will <i>be</i> no more languages, and existing C based languages will get no more features.<p>The best you can do now is write one high-level language in another, and that tends to be reasonably slow.<p>Just because you don't understand something, or because you don't know anybody who does, that <i>doesn't</i> mean that technology is disappearing, it just means you're in a selective circle.",1295251603.0

I was surprised to find at the last dinner I attended that there were still groups at the very end of the 3 month period that didn't know each other personally. That blew my mind, as I was on a first-name basis with everyone in our batch by the third or fourth dinner, and the interaction with the other founders was the most valuable part of the YC experience for me.",1295251368.0
