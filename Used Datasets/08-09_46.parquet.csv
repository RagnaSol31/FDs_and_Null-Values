All the synchronizing between the cores happen at L3 cache layer and QPI, because caches are inclusive and L3 is common to all cores. When a core writes to L3, it invalidates the same cache line in L1 and L2 caches of other cores. Therefore if your cores write to the same cache line, you have a big problem regardless of the chosen memory order model.",1448787380.0
