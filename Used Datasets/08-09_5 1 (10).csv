Any computer scientist will tell you that ""a factor of two is close enough"".<p>I'm joking, but there's a hint of truth here.  I can't imagine any level of wealth at which suddenly having half (or twice) as much would make any difference to me at all.  A factor of two either way really wouldn't change my life appreciably.",1337515745.0

You place your index fingers on the f and j keys, and from there the correct finger for each keys is simply the one closest to it. If you do it right your hands should move very little if at all. It might help to switch to a new layout such as dvorak or colemak, to start with a clean slate and learn typing with ten fingers from the ground up. I agree with the others that typing is not the bottle neck in programming, but typing correctly will also be less straining so I think it's worth the effort to work on it.",1337515263.0
