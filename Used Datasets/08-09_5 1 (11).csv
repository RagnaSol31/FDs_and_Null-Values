I drink a good deal of coffee and tea, but when I worked out the calorie math, it's actually pretty insane how much sugar is in cola:<p><pre><code>  - 250 ml (about 8 oz) of cola has 120 calories\n  - 350 ml (about 12 oz) of tea or coffee gets 2-3 sugar cubes\n  - 2 sugar cubes is 24 calories\n  - Cola has 10x the calories/volume as sweetened coffee or tea\n  - I drink 1-2 liters of coffee + tea + cola daily.\n</code></pre>\nSo even switching from cola to sweetened tea is a big cut back.  Other than that, I just do restraint at the grocery store.  Usually I'll allow one chocolate bar every couple weeks.<p>One thing that I learned when we were out in California for the summer is that the portion sizes in the US can really get you.  I shot up <i>15</i> pounds (175 -> 190) in 3 months without noticeably altering my diet.  After 4 months back in Germany it was gone again, without any intentional intervention.",1264687188

The CPU architecture is the same (ARM) and the peripherals are the same (video, etc.).  It is an Apple ARM-SoC[1] rather than a Samsung/PortalPlayer/TI/whoever ARM-SoC[2].  The functionality is a perfect match, the physical size is likely to be a close match, the speed is <i>much</i> better, and the power efficiency appears to be similar or better (the iPad undoubtedly has a much larger battery).<p>Look at the heritage: PA-Semi created a remarkably fast, remarkably low power PowerPC architecture SoC.  They are <i>very, very</i> good.  Apple bought them so that they could use that power, speed, and efficiency knowledge to create the A4.  Reports are that they used the fast ARM Cortex A9 core and did their magic on the peripheral parts of the SoC.  That is exactly what all the other ARM licensees are doing, except the others (arguably) don't have the same talent level as the PA-Semi engineers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System-on-a-chip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System-on-a-chip</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/consumer_electronics/ipod_faq/ipod-processor-type-portal-player-samsung.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/consumer_electronics/i...</a>",1264687031

Apple was the first to pioneer the idea that you could put a touchpad at the bottom of the keyboard and give the user a place to rest his/her hands in the process. Now everyone does it because it's such a head-slappingly good design idea you would be crazy to do anything else. I'd venture to guess most average computer users have no idea Apple is the origin of this design. But I'm sure it irks Jobs a little bit now and again when he sees cheapo netbooks using it.,1264687030

Or the fact that war was primarily Indian tribes vs. other Indian tribes, and the Anglo component was less than 20% of the winning side. But, you can't let the facts get in the way of a good story.<p>I imagine Zinn himself would agree he was more of an activist than a historian, and he fits history to his activism. The uberpatriot people aren't any better and might well be worse, but the message is more important than the messenger. Pointing out that a man claiming to be a historian is leaving out entirely crucial historical details is important.",1264685215
