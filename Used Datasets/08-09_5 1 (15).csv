After 45 minutes or so cortisol (stress hormone) levels rise and a process called gluconeogenesis sets in - your body begins burning muscle tissue for energy. The net effect of this is to lower your resting metabolic rate, which is what burns most of most people's calories. Which means you can cut back on the calories you consume, train like a madman <i>and still get fatter</i>.<p>3-4 sessions of 45 minutes per week, at a decent level of intensity, is about right for most people.",1219075172.0

2,279331,story,,,1,3,joeter,Ask YC:  Non “camp” seed funding alternatives?,,"Hi everyone, as an aspiring entrepreneur, I faced an uncommon problem set. I just graduated from Rhodes College in Memphis, which wasn’t conducive to people interested in technology or entrepreneurship, so the majority of my learning was done with out guidance, where I would spend my time scouring the web and using Delicious to create a topic textbook of sorts.<p>I’m an economist and non-coder, yet I felt fully capable of tackling the larger issues.  I wanted to fix the current state of music by creating a viable business model that could disrupt current market conditions.   Despite a lot of negative feedback – “you can’t start a tech company if you can’t code it” - I persevered and after a half year, came full circle on a solution to the current music problem.<p>As a sole non-technical founder, I looked at programs like Ycombinator and Techstars only to realize that I would not be fully considered.  I decided to sign on Prototype Invest to act as the technological strong arm for my venture.  I was very impressed with their insight and their proposal for development milestones.  Our first beta should be finished in October.<p>With the recent controversy over Pandora, I am sure people are now aware of the financial challenges music startups face. There are separate fees from both publishers and labels for selling digital downloads and then to add streaming capabilities, the fees imposed by the labels become enormous.  But the pioneers get the arrows, so I feel there is impending change.<p>I plan to raise a seed round of under a million, to pay for all legal fees, set up an office in NYC, and bring on board an experienced COO.  While looking for seed funds, most seemed to follow the camp model.  Here’s a short list of the funds I think I could reach out to.<p>http://www.nycseed.com\nhttp://www.mailroomfund.com/submit.html\nhttp://www.crv.com/quickstart\nhttp://www.tandementrepreneurs.com/\nhttp://www.nyangels.com<p>Does anyone know any other groups that I should be pursuing or have any further advice?  Also, should I only be focusing on the east coast or should I pursue more West Coast groups?  I plan to send out my applications to all these firms before the end of the week.  However, since it’s crucial I also protect the integrity of my business model, I am a little skeptical of venture firm’s that may be using seed program offerings as a way to accumulate market research.<p>Thanks for reading this longer post.  This sight has been an invaluable resource in my quest for a better understanding of web dynamics and I really enjoy the community PG has fostered – even if I can’t directly be part of it through startup camp.<p>Thanks in advance,\nJoe\nMusic Mobile Global",1219075019.0
