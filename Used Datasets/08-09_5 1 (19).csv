2,929439,comment,928054.0,928981.0,0,0,camccann,,,"<i>Okay, but that suggests wave function collapse is erroneous whereas many-worlds is more likely. Based on that alone you can see why I'd consider many-worlds silly. Also, I'd say anyone entertaining it as plausible or even likely is probably reasoning from a purely mathematical vantage point, which is simply not accurate enough to draw such conclusions from. I can't see how else they'd arrive at its feasibility. I don't believe Shrodinger or Einstein would ever propose it.</i><p>Wave function collapse wouldn't be so much erroneous as an illusion; it would still describe the way in which other quantum states would decohere and become inaccessible from the perspective of an observer. Remember, these interpretations are equally supported by experiment at this point. Far from being silly, that's exactly <i>why</i> many physicists consider many-worlds to be more likely--wave function collapse seems to be an unnecessary addition that complicates the theory for no benefit (see also: Occam's Razor).<p>Furthermore, reasoning from a purely mathematical perspective is generally <i>better</i>, in this case. Our intuitions about reality are so shaped by the size and energy levels we experience that thinking about quantum mechanical or relativistic phenomena in terms of ""physical reality"" instead of mathematical structure is likely to lead to misunderstandings and mistakes. Some physicists would argue, actually, that wave function collapse is exactly that sort of mistake.<p>There are a few well-known physicists in favor of many-worlds--Hawking and Feynman, for instance, the latter of whom won a Nobel Prize for his work relating to quantum mechanics. As for Einstein, you may recall his unhappiness at quantum mechanics being nonlocal (""spooky action at a distance"") and nondeterministic (""god playing dice with the universe"")--whereas the many-worlds interpretation restores both locality and determinism.<p>In the end, I'm no expert, and can't really make any statements about what is or isn't <i>likely</i>, but calling many-worlds ""silly"" is almost certainly incorrect. It's no sillier than quantum mechanics as a whole.<p><i>Hmm, here I won't argue directly against that statement, but instead offer this: If a tree falls in the forest when no one is around does it make a sound? I'm pretty sure you know the answer is 'No', and that's more of where my conscious observation of reality statement came from.</i><p>That question depends on the definition of ""sound"", actually. Does it mean ""longitudinal pressure waves in a physical medium"" or does it mean ""the subjective experience a human has when perceiving pressure waves in air at certain frequencies""? The answer to the question is completely obvious, and different, in both cases.",1257699476

Sorry about that.<p>However, I had to be taught to read <i>aloud</i> fast, for competitive speaking purposes.  I'm told by other people that did the same exercises that I did that their silent reading speed increased, as we were constantly pushing our speaking rates up and you have to read faster than you talk or <i>bam</i> problems.  (Competitors in collegiate forensics often speak more than several hundred words per minute.)<p>The easiest way to acquire the ability to speak fast is to drill, drill, drill -- pick a newspaper and start talking, then go faster.  The thing to keep in mind is that your eyes have to arrive at the word faster than your lips do.  As you do that, you'll discover shortcuts which ""work for you"" (largely subconscious for me -- I know, because I've made mistakes in ambiguous sentences, that I must not actually be reading everything my brain processes as being there).<p>(Sidenote: if for some reason you need to be able to speak faster or with more confidence, I recommend shadowing a newscaster: just repeat what they say, as they say it.

The difficulty I have had in trying to explain this intuition is that there <i>is</i> a feeling of confusion attached, which superficially seems like it just goes to prove her point.<p>I don't think it does, though, and hopefully I can argue my way through this without stepping on any traps.<p>The argument of the author seems to rest largely upon the function of the amygdala. Because it lights up when exposed to stimuli where the recipient has a memory of that stimuli associated with some undesirable outcome, her assertion seems to be that amygdala must be the basis behind our reaction to all things our memory has build intuitive associations of outcomes around. I think this is a conclusion we can't yet draw. Because these research subjects are able to isolate important photos in a series based upon some intuition of a prior exposure, this doesn't mean I will always build an intuitive order of things based upon my own prior recollections about my emotional state of mind. As Mz points out as well, it makes a tremendous assumption about memory.<p>This almost reads like she <i>wants</i> this to be true. If this is the case, she is not the only one. I've had a number of discussions about this with other people who seem emotionally reactive toward things, who have expressed a desire for similar findings, because then they can declare that the emotional snap judgments they had which resulted in very bad outcomes were as good as they could've possibly done.
