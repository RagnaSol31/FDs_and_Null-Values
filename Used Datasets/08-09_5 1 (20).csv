She said that one of the biggest differences between the engineering cultures of the two companies was that engineers at Google are encouraged to make ""product"" decisions themselves, while Microsoft engineers basically stuck to code.  If a spec was unclear on some point at Microsoft - say, what color of blue to use for the border on some dialog box - the engineer would throw it back over the wall to the PMs and wouldn't work on it until they got further clarification.
