My first (and best) programming teacher was a woman, and since then I've had woman as collegues and subordinates. Also I've met a very good (and respected) woman manger.<p>So I can't help but ask (I'm from Eastern Europe): other then being few, is there really so much discrimination against women in your culture? Or obstacles against choosing this career or advancing in it? Again, in my environment things are exactly the opposite: any young women programmer is always encouraged to continue working, and they tend to be quite enthusiastic too.",1241045967

Even though such viruses might theoretically develop into pandemic viruses, in Phase 1 no viruses circulating among animals have been reported to cause infections in humans.<p>In Phase 2 an animal influenza virus circulating among domesticated or wild animals is known to have caused infection in humans, and is therefore considered a potential pandemic threat.<p>In Phase 3, an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.<p>Phase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause “community-level outbreaks.” The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk for a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a forgone conclusion.<p>Phase 5 is characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. While most countries will not be affected at this stage, the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication, and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.<p>Phase 6, the pandemic phase, is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5.

I don't know what you mean by ""change what i++ means"" since you can't redefine ++ for any types for which it has a meaning in C.

After all, there's much more to the guide than that.  I'll readily admit that select() is absolutely dated and inefficient, but it is also POSIX-compliant, and the guide is about (specifically) beginning network programming in (specifically) C, not event management or Python or tcl.<p>Plus, I just updated it to IPv6, man!  Cut me some slack!  :)  I could take the select() thing out, but then I'd instantly get questions about it in the mail.  But honestly, I'll take any serious feedback, including ""give it up""--it is a time sink, and if it's not worth it, it's not worth it.  Contact info's in the Guide.<p>All that being said, adding information about the inefficiencies of select() (and poll()) and a pointer to something better (e.g. libevent) would totally be a good addition.  Additionally, a quick section about ""why use C for network programming when every scripting language makes it easier"" might be good (at least ""because the rest of my project is written in C"" comes to mind.)  What do you think?<p>Are the other (preferably cross-platform) competitors to libevent that might be useful?
