Shows how important having good (read genuine) set of core values are and how important the ""Do Good"" principle is in today's world.<p>The problem in today's world is the menace of ego, actions and decisions coming from ego-driven values. PG talked about ""Doing good"", but where does one draw the line between good and bad? As long as the ego controlled mind exists and controls all our actions and decisions, the ""Doing good"" principle will be merely reduced to just another mechanism for satisfying the ego's ulterior motives.<p>I might be sounding a bit idealistic here, but what do you guys think?",1215734378

3,243056,comment,242799.0,242946.0,0,0,eznet,,,"Disclaimer: I am a noob, so take this for what it is worth.<p>After/during school I played in Ruby, Perl, PHP and most recently Python.  I love Python and find it making sense where the other languages and frameworks seemed unnecessarily confounded at times.  After a week in Python, I felt like I absorbed more than a month in any of the others (although PHP is 'easy' to pick up, its peculiarities are a bit cumbersome to work around).<p>After forming a fondness for Python, I decided to start on Django and love it.  I am currently working on a couple of small apps based on the framework and feel the rate of progress concerning both my learning and development to be extremely rapid - far more so than was the case in reading through the various rails tutorials (just for contrast - no flaming please.  I admit my complete and total ignorance in advance to any fanboys currently mumbling ""idiot"" as they read this).<p>I personally recommend checking out <a href=""http://www.webmonkey.com/tutorial/Install_Django_and_Build_Your_First_App"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmonkey.com/tutorial/Install_Django_and_Build_Y...</a> 1st to wet your appetite - its quick and allows you to see the power of the framework in no time flat.  When you finish there, head to <a href=""http://www.djangobook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.djangobook.com</a> and start working through - I am and am having a blast doing it.<p>I know it is a bit cliché, but Python + Django has been a pleasure to program in.  Although I may not be able to etch out a living doing it right now, I think this is where I will be spending my recreation time for a while.",1215733886

6,243053,comment,242745.0,242745.0,0,0,akeefer,,,"I've had the same experience when writing, whereby my bad stuff was intertwined with my good stuff to the point where merely editing it was not worthwhile, and found that I need (at least) one draft to organize my thoughts before writing a final draft from scratch that generally needs very little editing.  The conclusion I came to was that I just need to always write that second draft, rather than Stephenson's conclusion that he just needs to write the better draft the first time.  To each his own, I guess . . .<p>But comparing writing a novel to programming a complex system seems pretty naive, to say the least.  The first obvious difference is that a novel (generally) comes out of one person's head, but most larger projects end up far too large for any one person to truly keep it all in their head and understand all the interactions.  That immediately makes it pretty much impossible to just do things right the first time; there are always things you don't understand or forget about when working on a larger project.  There's also the fact that vagueness is tolerated and often desired in a novel, whereas it's not an option when programming; that just means there are more details to ""get right"", more decisions to make, and more interactions to worry about.  In addition, a program generally has a definite purpose, and you can't re-define your goal as easily based on what it actually does (though sometimes you can; when writing, you often have an idea of where you're going or what effect you want, but if you end up with something different it might still be fine.  There are a ton of other differences as well, of course; those are just the ones that first come to mind.",1215733499

It's not true in the long term for older people.  Your metabolism results in different kinds of intracellular junk and intercellular junk accumulating.  After a certain point, it reaches the level of pathology.  But before that happens, using those metabolic pathways does tend to make them stronger.",1215732944

Furthermore, if one is taking a risk by innovating in one area of a business, it's better risk management to be more risk averse in other areas of your business.  That will allow a greater chance that the business will survive in the longer terms and that you'll be able to test out new innovations and really contribute something.<p>So, I would guess any skill in conforming would certainly be an asset in innovation, and that this would at least counter-balance any negative effects.",1215732875
