So, if the community <i>did</i> start adopting Mono as a major platform and developed a lot of good software for it, that is when Microsoft would pull the trigger.  So, either way, Microsoft gets what it wants.  They limit adoption by holding patents that could be later used against the community, and if it <i>does</i> get adopted they can start suing.<p>I say this as someone who really likes the .NET platform and think it could add a lot of value to the free software community.  But I have to agree with the FSF on this one.",1248350291.0

Having transitioned from maker to manager over the past couple of years, I was just commenting to a co-worker yesterday that I find it almost impossible to finish the maker-like tasks on my to-do list (mostly writing and reviewing long documents).  I've been feeling a lot of guilt about this, but I couldn't see a clear way out.  After reading pg's post, I'm thinking about blocking off some afternoons for maker activities.  Thanks!",1248350152.0

Almost certainly including Microsoft.<p>MySQL has bugs, but the basic functionality works on Windows.

(I wouldn't know, of course -- I use Mac OS and Linux.)<p>I'm sure the bugs are annoying, though. Maybe the people who care about them should get out the GPL source code and fix them. Or maybe they should pay someone who knows how to fix them. Or maybe they should do what just about everybody else seems to do -- calculate the price of options one and two, compare them to the cost of running Linux, and deploy on Linux.<p>Or they can bang on the table and cry in the hopes that someone will fix their problems for free.
