What makes a bike a pain to store besides length is the handle bars and foot pegs stick out. So design a handle bar with a pin so it can be rotated alone the bikes axis when parked and folding pedals. Then you can box store them narrowly akin to bus lockers.<p>Still the primary deterrent to theft is putting it where its at risk and if that means not taking it, well.",1407843902.0
