45,8809369,comment,8808675.0,8808675.0,0,0,restalis,,,"The Mongol invasion, although destructive for probably all civilizations of the time, had definitively a positive effect to the survival of eastern romance culture. In the dark ages the amount of migrating population was so great that for quite some time they outnumbered the descendants of the former Roman Empire around Carpathians and Balkans. The dominance of the vulgar-Latin speaking population suffered serious setbacks and were being confined to smaller and smaller less accessible areas like mountainous regions. The west-most areas of the Mongol raids were around Carpathian Mountains up to Pannonian Basin and were they went through, they basically cleaned the densely-populated lowland of the most of its inhabitants. Its a known fact that the Mongol incursions were disastrous for Hungarians, Poles, Russians, and other populations that were in the region at the time, but on the other hand they were vital for romance population. Of course, the romance population suffered from those raids too, along with other cohabitant populations, but after that, that mountain-descending romance population become dominant again. Have not Mongols come, the fate of the eastern romance population around Carpathians would have been the same as the one of the former eastern romance populations south of Danube - for a while they probably would have managed to manifest some cultural and even political power (like the Vlach-Bulgar Empire of Asănești), but in the end they would have been assimilated completely.",1419852598.0

Specifically, it concatenates the master password and the domain name of the Web site (masterpassword:domain.com), hashes the result at least ten times (and until it satisfies the generated password requirements), and cuts the result to the desired length.<p>Yikes! MD5 is known to be broken, and 10 rounds of hashing is no defense against brute force attacks. Hashpass uses SHA-256 (not broken) and does 2^16 rounds of hashing.",1419851076.0

If you think about it, some websites have conflicting requirements.<p>It would be great if there was a site ran by a widely-trusted body (EFF for example) that tracks the various password requirements and limitations of websites. That way password managers, such as this one, can query that authoritative database for the idiosyncratic password rules for each domain and generate a password of the maximum allowable length and with the largest possible alphabet.",1419851044.0
