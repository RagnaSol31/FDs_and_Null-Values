This kind of approach would allow people to distribute documents using the web without having to trust them to a particular server, which can be very convenient if your target audience is in a country where access to the server storing your documents can be closed.</i><p>I just can't see the gain here. You need <i>a</i> server to distribute the URLs in any case. You are just moving the data from the server that served the document to the server that servers the URLs.

Assuming the HN traffic was during period which saw 6-8% conversion, the real cause of the low conversion rate is almost certainly due to people clicking through from HN, watching the video and leaving without looking at the site at all. I don't even own an iPad, and frankly when someone links a video on HN or similar social sites, I watch the video and leave, regardless of the video sharing site.<p>I'd assume their more day-to-day traffic is getting there via other sources. Perhaps people saying ""check out this app"", perhaps people coming through search engines looking for ipad related video - essentially a much more targeted audience.<p>I could be completely wrong. Based on the information presented, I've made a huge number of assumptions. However, I'd be truly surprised if decreasing the load time of your static assets is really the driving factor in visitor conversions.<p>Edit: It seems their ""App store downloads to web visit ratio"" isn't really a conversion factor as much as a comparison of the two. My interpretation of it is that they now receive 28% of their web visits in downloads (for every hundred web visitors, they receive 28 app ""downloads"" (although it's not clear whether a ""download"" is a video load, or an app install)). Surely that's just because their web traffic has fallen after the HN spike? I'm not convinced that there's any real basis to the key claim made at the bottom.",1325249625.0

15,3407446,comment,3405585.0,3406843.0,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> False. It's the opposite actually. A site continues to have existing safe harbor protection UNLESS it does this. Even Congress knows you can't put this type of burden on sites.<p>So any site can continue to operate as long as they pointedly don't police user content?  Considering that would make the legislation entirely ineffective, I suspect it'll get conveniently ignored.  It would also then <i>remove</i> the ability of sites to enforce their own terms of service on user content, for fear of losing protection.  (Consider that YouTube already lets copyright holders police user content, primarily because they got sued and more or less forced to.  That would then make them lose their safe harbor.)  And in any case, that would still force non-US sites to adhere to US regulations or get blocked, which remains a serious problem given the set of regulations the US would like to enforce on sites.<p>> False. Individuals and corporations cannot DNS blacklist, or block from Google results. That's only allowed based on a request from the Attorney General, requires approval of a Judge, and only applies to foreign companies that explicitly and solely exist for the purpose of copyright infringement.<p>Oh, and that makes it OK then?  That process seems likely to become a rubber stamp, especially for requests made by the companies that bought and paid for this legislation in the first place.<p>And considering that the congresscritters that approve the legislation often don't bother reading it before doing so, and rely on summaries instead, I'd hardly fault Tom's Hardware for relying on the general summaries provided by other technical sources concerned about this legislation.  SOPA has also undergone numerous changes and amendments since its introduction, none of which make it acceptable, but many of which make the details somewhat less concrete.  The article got the major points right, and the details close to right.",1325249253.0

This is the first patent granted for the use of DCA to treat cancer, and represents a significant milestone in the Company's growth.<p>Since filing the application, other companies and research entities, both in the US and internationally, have also done much work to validate and unlock the value inherent in utilizing DCA as a therapeutic agent.

For example, Apple could have every RAM module run for months at above-spec frequency, temperature and humidity to weed out bad modules. I do not think they do such severe things, but I do think (without having any evidence, except for the 'evidence' of their pricing) that they buy slightly/somewhat better batches. That does not guarantee that their products are better, but it will weed out the almost-dead-on-arrival ones.",1325246691.0
