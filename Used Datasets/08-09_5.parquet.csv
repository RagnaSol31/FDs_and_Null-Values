I've never lived in the Valley, or in any other stereotypical ""tech hub"" though, so I could be wrong there.<p>I'm currently working for what I consider to be a startup in a small town in the UK. We're making software that is applicable to a specific industry, and the industry is <i>very</i> hungry for it. I'm currently the only programmer.<p>What looks like the probable course for us (and probably for other people like us - people starting up software dev stuff in smaller areas), is that once we've sold what we're working on right now, we'll probably move on to doing more interesting things, and form a small software development house of sorts.<p>What we're doing right now would be utterly impossible without the internet, if only due to communication-over-distance issues.<p>I think that the stereotypical ""startup"" is just the start of what we'll continue to see as more and more people realize that they can make their livelihood online. What I'm doing doesn't fit the stereotypical startup mold, but is the type of thing that I think we'll see more and more of, assuming nothing majorly bad happens to the internet or society in general.",1239784038.0
