All it does is read commands from stdin, one per line, and keep a desired number of processes running until all command lines are exhausted. Simple.<p>I wrote my own because I got tired of all kinds of substitution and quoting issues with xargs. With spawn I only need to generate the shell commands and instead of piping them to bash I pipe them to spawn. Also, this means I can easily review your command line generation with less (so that quotes etc. are good) until I eventually switch to sh or spawn.",1287392055.0

As I programmer I already have to deal with 2949832 platforms, isn't it the packager's/sysadmin's job to make sure it integrates into your specific system provided that the programmer writes general usage instructions?<p>> Honor the TMPDIR environment variable.<p>Funny. My software used to honor $TMPDIR until a sysadmin complained to me that it <i>shouldn't</i>, and should honor some other my-app-specific env var/config option instead. And he's a competent sysadmin.<p>> Don't work around the limits that have been put in place\n> on systems, they are most likely there for a reason<p>My experience is that the limits are very, very often <i>not</i> there for a reason and the administrator didn't even know about the limits until my software hits those limits.<p>One good example is the file descriptor limit. If too many clients connect to my server then the fd limit will be hit, but instead of raising the limit it would seem a considerable number of people to go my support forum to ask what's going on. I'm considering increasing the limit automatically on the next version just to get rid of the support emails.<p>Another example is the stack size. A major user accidentally set his system stack size to 80 MB. My software creates a bunch of threads but after a while it runs out of virtual memory address because of the huge stack size. We found out about the 80 MB stack size after a while and we had to explain to them why that was a mistake. They fixed it afterwards but we wanted to avoid support questions like this again so from that point on we hardcoded our thread stack sizes to 64 KB.",1287391965.0

Young people who do that are going to be successful, no doubt.  The big problem is that a 20 year old has to listen to, and accept advice from, a 40 year, something many have problems with.",1287389339.0

We cant snoop your credentials at all, you dont enter it on our site.\n2) Sure authentication is an easy feature but this way we dont need to ask you for your details again, you let us talk to your service and use your existing information.\n3) You can kick us off from your Twitter account from Twitter itself and at any time, see Connections section under settings.<p>Some people might be conscious about us being able to access your Twitter or OpenID information but its mostly available to the world on these services anyway. OAuth (which is the underlying technology behind this authentication) is being used more and more. It's much better and safer for end users, its just that initial hurdle to get mass adoption. Its the end users decision if they trust the site or not. Most people have trusted us today :)<p>We cant make any changes to the app whilst its being judged, not one line of code. I do agree that we should look at implementing a base user signup sans-OAuth provider but we cant do anything until Rails Rumble has been judged and voted.

Is it in the way they create an index that can quickly be searched even though it's got billions of entries? I read lots about how it's based on the number of links pointing to pages, but isn't that just a matter of creating a big graph of all web pages and counting the links between them?<p>I'd appreciate any info on specifically what technical problems have been so ingeniously solved to create PageRank.",1287389153.0
