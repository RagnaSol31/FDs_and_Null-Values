Perhaps Russians were funneling money again (like with egold when it was shut down) and completed their trial run. Perhaps some investor got wind of this cool thing called Bitcoin and told his assistant to buy in $150k (that alone would move the price +$10), then sold a week later. Or perhaps it was the non-stop increasing media coverage of Bitcoin in the past month. Or perhaps it was the weekend when it's harder to get money into MtGox and the psychological perfect storm of speculators manifested.<p>TSR was around since February, with steady growth up until the recent spike when they closed to new users. Perhaps that was a factor, but I doubt it was a significant one. I imagine most people who bought coins don't have Tor installed.",1307866730.0

It's turtles all the way down--while I know Joanna herself was one of the folks behind the Bluepill attack, why trust Qubes to not be vulnerable to its own version of the attack? (This is obviously an oversimplification and executing such a task is nontrivial--but breaking out of a VM was thought to be a lot harder than Bluepill made it, too.)<p>The closest thing to an answer to that, as far as I can tell, is multiple computers. Assuming Qubes works as advertised, however, it seems as if it doesn't really scratch the bigger itch--the technology seems cool (I haven't dug deeply into it), but does it address the social/usability problem of security, even for these professionals who need that high security environment?<p>From reading about this, it seems as if you could have stopped at ""it's a niche operating system,"" because to my mind it seems like professionals who need a high security environment will just have multiple computers. If a segmented system like Qubes is not going to run the stuff that your hypothetical professional will want to run (games just being an example, and one that seems to have been misleading), then why would it be preferable to just rolling multiple computers? (Cost, which is the only advantage I can think of, doesn't strike me as a significant factor to folks who are actually doing things that necessitate this sort of security.)",1307866438.0
