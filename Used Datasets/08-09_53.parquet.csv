I think that's rightly so, but it seems silly to write about a lack of redistribution in the US. In fact, the top 50% of households in income paid 97% of income taxes in 2008.<p>What is troubling, and what the author ignores, is the changing distribution of returns in our economy. There's no point in trying to legislate it away, but more and more work is becoming automated. We're in the middle of a second industrial revolution, and many kinds of work that people rely on for income and identity will go away over time. Will we end up in a society where 90% of us, who don't have the skills to be productive, are subsidized by the remaining 10%? That seems like an awful outcome from a social perspective, but I'm not sure how we should respond to it.<p>From a policy perspective, I would like to see a higher short-term capital gains rate to limit the attractiveness of financial instrument trading, and I think carry income (on VC and private equity) should be taxed as income, not at the lower rate for capital gains. But apart from those areas, we need to address the long-term trend of growing income inequality as a society, not with legislation.",1301820182.0

China, in particular, has the highest number of coal mining related deaths in the world, with official statistics claiming that 6,027 deaths occurred in 2004.[19] To compare, 28 deaths were reported in the U.S. in the same year.[20] Coal production in China is twice that in the U.S.""<p>So counting deaths of coal mining from countries were human lives are considered to be expendable resources sounds a bit dishonest. Not that I want to promote coal mining, but I don't trust these PR pieces, sorry.<p>I think that article also counts accidents from people colliding with coal transporting trains? How is Uranium transported, are there never any collisions?<p>Also, abandoned mines seem popular for storing nuclear waste.

Gravity and inertia are also fundamental elements of nature, which kill far more people than radiation.  Do we refer to automobiles as ""fundamental force of nature containment technology""?<p>The main problem with radiation is that it's invisible and poorly understood by the public, and has been overused in movies as a fear device.

Obviously you need to invest in a company before its popular for it to be a good investment. A company with a fully stable profit won't even take your investment most of the time. ""Mining"" is just the process of investment! However, I do not think this is the point. The important point is not that ""mining"" and the markets are evil, but that founders shouldn't be investors. If you start a company, you should be interested in BUILDING A COMPANY, not selling a big company and making a boatload. Obviously, people want to make money, but for some reason the misconception that the cash in hand for a crappy company is worth more than the cash in stock for a great and growing company. Great companies start with people who want the company to succeed and investors who want to make a buck, not the other way around.",1301817686.0
