Inertia is the strength of the recurrence relation, the degree by which previous thoughts determine present thought. This is measurable as neural adaptation and learning. Ego or self is an observed distribution of thoughts occurring during a certain duration. As with statistical distributions, we tend to construct parameter estimators to make sense of the data[1].<p>Now, as with statistics, whether these generated parameters contain information and are useful in describing the distribution is up for debate and dependent on the question the investigator seeks to answer. But simply stating 'there is no object' is as sensical and productive as claiming 'there is no mean, there is no standard deviation'.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_moments_(statistics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_moments_(statistics)</a>",1313916615.0

31,2908774,comment,2908696.0,2908696.0,10,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Not sure if this belongs on HN or not, so I won't promote it or flag it. But, if it does get legs, there are a couple of points in the article I'd like to counter. For background: my mother (and most of her family) suffers from bouts of diagnosed clinical depression, sometimes acute and sometimes chronic, and sometimes as severe as leading to self-harm. I'm not immune; although at an early age I developed some mental safeguards against the worst of it, I am actually right now quietly battling the worst case of severe depression that I've ever had. There are a lot of articles out there written to be helpful to those that are depressed, or those who are not but have friends or family members that are. Most of them are terrible.<p>So, from the article:<p>> <i>But talking about depression easily and openly isnt impossible.</i><p>Yes, it probably is. Unless you are <i>very</i> close to the person, it's really unlikely that they're going to talk to you about it, and prying is only going to cause them to withdraw more. Because of the stigma attached to depression, withdrawal is a common tactic, and the more that a person withdraws, the worse their depression gets.<p>> <i>Better to say: ""Well get through this.""</i><p>Ugh. Written by someone who's never experienced this. The withdrawal mentioned above is caused in part by a severe feeling of being alone; there's no such thing as ""we"" to someone who's truly depressed. Nor is there any way to convince them that the future will magically improve; a depressed person doesn't see any chance of that happening, and saying ""we'll get through this"" just tells them that you aren't taking their problems as seriously as they are.<p>Think of it like this: to a depressed person, you and they are in the middle of miles and miles of desert, with no resources anywhere to be found. They are at the bottom of a deep pit, and you are still topside. When you say, ""We'll get through this"", it's the same as yelling that down from the top. To the depressed person, you aren't both in the same situation, so while <i>you</i> may get through this, they have at the time no hope of it.<p>> <i>Better to say: ""Do you want to talk?""</i><p>Again, they're most likely to say, ""No."" Yes, they <i>want</i> to talk, but no, they won't talk, because they're not likely to get anything helpful from it.<p>> <i>Better to say: ""This can happen to the best of us.""</i><p>Meh. This really depends on just how well the depressed person understands depression. In my case, I'm aware that far more people struggle with it than many believe, so I already know it can happen to the ""best of us"". I think there's some danger there though in implying that the depressed person isn't one of the best of us, which probably isn't what you intended.<p>> <i>Better to say: ""Theres a lot of help out there.""</i><p>This is just horrible. It feels like you're dropping them off at someone else's doorstep. ""There's a lot of help out there"" implies, ""You should get some help! Good luck!"" And, meddling with their doctor or appointments is probably not wise, either; depression is often a very private matter.<p>...OK, so that's the article. Now here are my suggestions:<p>First, be sure that you <i>want</i> to get involved. Depressed people can be extremely difficult to work with. They can, and often will, drag you down with them, no matter how strong, self-confident, or happy you are. You may as well think of depression as a force of nature in this case. If you aren't prepared to deal with that, then don't -- you'll only be hurting yourself. <i>As much as you may care for someone else, you must put your own needs first.</i><p>Second, if you're going to get involved, be prepared to get <i>very</i> involved. Don't half-ass it, because that won't help anyone. This doesn't necessarily mean meddling, though; it just means, you have to commit to following through and sticking with it. Depending on the person, this could be a week-long, several-month-long, or life-long commitment.<p>Third, make an effort to understand their problems. I believe very strongly that few people are truly depressed without cause. I think that psychological depression is a kind of magnifier; when things start to go bad, for a depressed person, they go <i>really</i> bad. Is the person depressed because of relationship problems? Is the person depressed because of financial trouble? Personal health? A project not going well? You have to figure out what the root cause is. If you can figure it out, you might be able to help them address it, and <i>that</i> is probably the most helpful thing you can do.<p>Fourth, distract them. One of the damnable things about depression is that it feeds into itself quite nicely. The depressed person starts out with a problem, they begin to become depressed by it, they start to obsess about the problem. Many depressives are self-aware enough to know at this point that they're becoming depressed, so then they start to become depressed that they're depressed, and so on.<p>You have to take baby steps though. A depressed person is likely also having self-image problems, so a lot of social events are off the table. Offering to take them out to coffee or lunch can be a good first step; an outdoor physical activity like a hike or walk is a good one, too, if they're up to it; spending a few hours with them playing a favorite game of theirs or being otherwise social with them in a comfortable environment can help a lot.<p>When you leave, they'll still be depressed, but they'll recognize that, for a while, you made them a little happier, and that will have a huge impact on them.<p>Hope this helps someone.<p>edit: This wasn't quite long enough. :-) The article mentions briefly that changes in habit can be indicators of depression. I can't really emphasize this enough. Depression usually disrupts a person's normal habits, and that's one of the best indicators of depression. It's also a good way to help a depressed person get back on track: you can gently guide their habits (sleep schedule, eating, exercise) back into a normal routine. There may be resistance to this, depending on what's going on, but it's a good thing to look into. For example, if you suspect a friend may be suffering from depression, and you sometimes attend a gym together and have noticed that they haven't been there lately, call them and ask them if they'll meet you there to spot you on some equipment. It can keep you from getting too invested in their issues, while also helping them regain a little stability in their personal life.",1313914911.0

I've got a few friends who raised money for a good-cause startup, but the problem is they got that money as a grant from a charitable foundation - terrible idea!  The founders now have enough cash to pay themselves and to hire people, but because the money won't run dry for a few years, the market forces aren't kicking them in the ars. The result? The team's pretty smart, but they've been in ""stealth"" for as long as I've known them because there is absolutely no motivator for them to release and iterate.<p>The article says that young valley millionaires see investing into startups as a game, as a badge of honor. If that is so, I hope more of them could re-invest the proceeds into smarter causes. Maybe if there was enough of competition between them, as to whose educational startup is the coolest, then founders would be reluctant to eat taco-bell and work 80 hrs/week.<p>As per the rejections you got from the VCs, sorry to hear; the first batch tho had very legitimate concerns.",1313913775.0

I just showed this to my black, British cat, Mr. Fluffer Wickbidget, III, and he spit out the milk which he had been lapping from the palm of my hand.<p>You should sit down with the brilliant Hongwei Xi, the creator of the amazing ATS programming language, and see what he thinks of your jocular comment.

Worst time is c) and beyond<p>I've only had experience working with my one childhood friend whom I've co-founded all my projects with. We've worked together since we were kids, building dinky static web pages with Dreamweaver. So I've never had the experience of bringing on another co-founder, or working with someone I didn't have an extensive history with.<p>The reason I think its A) is because its not quite as important as to WHEN your co-founder joins, but WHO you co-founder actually is. A friend or someone you've worked with in the past is someone you can trust. Someone you can trust is someone you can bounce ideas off of and have ""chemistry"" with. The sooner the two of you have your brains firing off and inspiring each other with a concept or product, the better. This means you can argue sooner, and shape out what it is you want to build far more effectively. Ideas will constantly change, but the person you're stuck with will not. So the sooner you find the right person, the better!",1313913608.0
