It seems that Sun was an outlier in the huge-company-enterprise space in having a great hacker culture, and that brought in some people that would otherwise be more at ease in smaller companies.<p>Oracle can't/won't/isn't interested in keeping that culture around, and it is questionable what that culture actually brought about in value at Sun. After all, they weren't very good at making money. Oracle, on the other hand, is very good at making money, and perfectly happy letting the cool people work other places, acquiring their work if they decide they need it.",1280134793

What's your chance of passing this on to your child? If you said that it depends on the genotype of your spouse, you win! If your spouse doesn't have phenylketonuria, what's the probability? If you said 1/4, your right!<p>Now, let's say you've met someone and convince them to get a genetic test, and they turn out to also be a carrier, what do you do? Do you risk the 1/4 chance? One of the really interesting things about the human genome project was that the scientists involved knew that these sorts of hard questions would come up, so they really emphasized the human and counseling aspect of the research, in addition to the hard science. These are the types of people who are upset that 23andMe has mostly undone what they were attempting to do by emphasizing a holistic approach to people understanding their own genetics.<p>Also, I just have to point out how ironic your example is. In fact, this information is rather useless. Phenylketonuria is a relatively easily managed disease, and all children born in the U.S. (and many other countries) are already tested at birth, paid for by the government who did the studies and decided this was a good test to do. You actually didn't learn anything you wouldn't have potentially found out anyway (and at no cost to you).",1280134600

If we must really flog a tortured analogy: This is not like going to your local mechanic friend and asking for car buying advice. It's more like this guy named Karl Benz comes and tells you he's got a great new invention called the internal combustion engine and you should definitely buy it. So you go to your friend the steam engine mechanic and ask him for advice. Sure, he understands the principles, maybe, but this is something completely new!<p>If you must appeal to authority, consider you have two experts in this thread telling you that even they think the topic is too complex to draw useful conclusions. If you don't trust random people on the internet (not that I blame you), then go to the source. From the article:<p><i>There are valid scientific reasons for different estimates from different companies, such as: companies employ slightly different statistical models for making risk estimates; companies establish different criteria for the inclusion of associations in their reports; new associations are being discovered at a faster rate than companiesâ€™ development cycles; companies may test for an imperfectly overlapping set of genetic variants for reasons including the ability of different genotyping technologies to assay certain variants.</i><p>To be clear, this is not a case of Car and Driver favoring German engineering but JD Powers always skewing towards American manufacturers (completely contrived example, BTW). In this case the statistical models <i>are</i> the science, not just some interpretation of the science. This field is young. Too young.

If instead you shift the palette by 1/6 every frame (so after a shift of 1/6, you are using 5/6 of colour x and 1/6 of colour x+1), you get a much smoother effect. The computation is trivial, since you are only changing the palette, so you have at most 768 bytes to recalculate.

Looking at the UK, the largest proportion of debt was 'financial', which I assume is debt owned by businesses operating in the financial sector.<p>If so, is this even a bad thing? For example, does a hedge fund (which borrows large amounts of money to amplify it's wins and losses) naturally have a large ""base"" debt? Does a large financial sector just mean large financial debt as a matter of course?<p>UK household debt is also high. I'd expect a significant part of this to be mortgages. The combination of the culture of home-ownership (as opposed to renting) and high property prices (small island, lots of people) leads most people into a long-term mortgage quite early (and has for a long time).<p>Does that mean the UK's position isn't perhaps as bad as the ""overall"" graph paints it?",1280131588

For several reasons:<p>1.  I don't know how clean the place will be.  With a 3 or 4 star hotel with good reviews online, I can be fairly certain I'll get a place that is clean.\n2.  I don't know how secure the place will be.  The rooms I booked all have in room safes, so I can leave my netbook in my room and be fairly certain it will be there when I get back.\n3.  Getting a private apartment on AirBnB isn't that much cheaper than a hotel.  No offense to the hosts offering a room in their place or their couch, but when I'm on vacation, I don't want to share a place with people I don't know.  I'm just not that type of person.<p>All of that adds up to general uncertainty over the use of AirBnB.  And if a company I was interviewing with wanted me to use AirBnB to find a place to stay, well, that would give me serious reservations as to whether or not I'd want to work there.  The possible exception would be if I were interviewing with AirBnB themselves.",1280131487
