Look at China's game industry, where it is virtually impossible to buy games because folks stole them so much the industry gave up trying to sell them.  Instead, <i>everything</i> is a ""free-to-play"" online game, with monetization through in-game purchases to get through the heaping helping of sucky grind added to the base game.  US gamers are voting for this future every day with their purchasing habits -- namely, stealing anything that isn't nailed down while simultaneously making Blizzard and Zynga rich beyond the dreams of avarice.<p>I'm not in games but I do desktop software and web apps.  It seems hilarious to me these days, but I used to actually worry mildly about piracy of my application.  Three of the top ten search suggestions Google gives (which are created from popular search terms) for my product's name are incitements to theft, even in my decidedly non-technical niche.<p>Hah, those were the days.

I think there's really two models here.  Refer a product and refer a site.  Refer a site would be a prime target for the long-tail, especially if you only charge them on a successful sale (not just a referral submitted).

Our economy is based on <i>value</i> propositions—that's why we can charge 100x the price for a box labelled ""enterprise edition"" that contains a stream of bits no different than the one labelled ""home edition."" The enterprise values the software 100x as much, so we make one exchange of value with them, and then make another value exchange with (presumably a larger number of) home users for a smaller price.

I think the hardest part would be coming up with an adequate monetization strategy for the purchasing sites.  It may be a long-shot, but you may be able to do something like, user submits a referral.  Referral receives a potential discount, original user can now redeem the discount promised.  Your company receives x% of the purchase by the user using the discount.  The existence of your service basically garnered 2 extra sales for the site, but I think it would be difficult to charge based on just the usage of the service.  I think it would be an easier sell if you only charged if the referral resulted in a purchase.  That way it costs the company nothing to try and get the free sales.  The problem is, the take rate may be completely out of balance for the loads.  Either way, done right it sounds like it could benefit the seller, the buyer, the referral and you, which is usually a pretty good sign of something worth trying.",1273135136.0

The sheer number of experiences I could have is uncountable, breathtaking, and I'm sitting here refreshing my inbox. We live trapped in loops, reliving a few days over and over, and we envision only a handful of paths laid out before us. We see the same things every day, we respond the same way, we think the same thoughts, each day a slight variation on the last, every moment smoothly following the gentle curves of societal norms. We act like if we just get through today, tomorrow our dreams will come back to us.\nAnd no, I don't have all the answers. I don't know how to jolt myself into seeing what each moment could become. But I do know one thing: the solution doesn't involve watering down my every little idea and creative impulse for the sake of some day easing my fit into a mold. It doesn't involve tempering my life to better fit someone's expectations. It doesn't involve constantly holding back for fear of shaking things up. This is very important, so I want to say it as clearly as I can:\nFUCK. THAT. SHIT.""\nxkcd",1273132834.0
