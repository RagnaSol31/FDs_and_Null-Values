If it misses, it's just a little wasted electricity.""</i><p>Caches have limited size. If it misses, it also evicts something else from the cache. If that is what is actually needed, this costs performance.<p><i>""and are pretty close to the original cache line's (virtual) address""</i><p>Why does it have to be 'pretty close'?<p><i>""Now if these values happen to be sane virtual addresses in the current process""</i><p>That sanity check would involve visiting the paging tables, so it would require at least two indirections (<a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/253361/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/253361/</a>). If a cache line is 16 bytes, you would have at least 4 positions where a 32-bit pointer could be present. So, at least four times two memory lookups would be needed. I think all of them would go through the same cache, but even assuming that the CPU has ways of signalling that it should not recurse, I do not think it is practical to do what you describe (disclaimer: I am not an expert on CPU design)<p>What is possible is to guess at where data is to be found. That allows CPUs to read and speculatively execute instructions from the physical memory that they think backs the virtual address of the PC while they, in parallel, do the lookup to verify that. See <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2000101&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=100791476&CFTOKEN=34252430"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2000101&dl=ACM&col...</a>.

Sketching/prototyping by hand is orders of magnitude faster than on an iPad, and it wouldn't even be worth it to try to produce anything resembling deliverable work. The required depth of interaction, breadth of options, and fine-grain control just isn't there.<p>For musicians, I think it's a different story because the iPad usually augments an existing setup; it can be integrated with other devices to fill a specific need that can be solved by a touch interface into highly customized software. In this case, the iPad is actually allowing totally new interaction that wasn't possible before.

Google, Java is blind and deaf. It can't be used for much, if anything. Even ""Hello World"" requires APIs<p>That's just not true.  You can create your own classes for IO, or anything else, implemented as native methods.  The only problem you have is if you want to <i>copy</i> the whole structure, sequence, and organization of <i>Sun</i>'s API that <i>Sun</i> designed.  For instance if you want the use the C library functions to implement your new Java classes, that's fine since you aren't copying the SSO of them.<p>I think a lot of people have to jump to these 'sky is falling' 'it'll break the internet' arguments because they refuse to accept that Google is the bad apple here.  Google copied Sun's work, didn't pay Sun for it, and at the same time destroyed Sun's future revenue from Java licenses (as everybody just used Android for free).  This was probably a significant factor in the decision to sell Sun (the Schwartz mentioned for instance that some companies were not renewing their Java license).<p>But this is capitalism not morality, and when somebody else creates something you want you pay them for it.

It seems like every 6 months they're doubling the raw benchmark performance of these Android devices, and releasing some stunning hardware, but when you open an entirely native ListView (like a settings page) on a flagship Android device <i>it simply does not scroll smoothly</i>. Arbitrary web pages scroll more smoothly on an iPhone 4 than native ListViews on a flagship Android device (the speediest Android devices I've used extensively are the Galaxy SII and Galaxy Nexus).<p>I am always tempted to feel pretentious about my preference in this regard (likewise, with my inability to use a PC with noticeable mouse acceleration).

Go do a benchmark with a nib loaded with UINib, and then with your ""non-trivial view"". The difference is negligible. You won't get more than 1-2 fps more by keeping it in code. And honestly? If you're that desperate for 1-2 fps, you're not likely bottlenecked at drawing code.<p>B. If you scroll by one pixel, at most, you'll have <i>one</i> new cell to redraw: the one that appeared on screen at the end. You don't redraw everything all the time.<p>C. I find that custom code is usually <i>slower</i> than loading some images and placing them on screen. CoreGraphics functions, for example, don't use the GPU. Set the wrong property on your layer (try touching CALayer's shadow properties on a large scrollview)? You lose ~20FPS.
