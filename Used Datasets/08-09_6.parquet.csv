For an ordinary sequence type that's fine, but some years ago I had code like this:<p>if not self.db: self.db = bsddb.hashopen(...).<p>I just couldn't find out why my process spent valuable seconds apparently reading in the entire bsddb database into memory at random times -- but that's because bool(self.db) above turned into len(self.db.keys()) != 0",1215593881

Judging from what I've read I think Hans's courtroom behavior and crazy explanations led the jury to find him guilty.  I'm glad he didn't take his lawyers' advice to keep his mouth shut.",1215593769

My eyes just seemed to get tired more quickly.<p>Having done some fiddling around with fonts after noticing this effect I've found that I prefer serif fonts for large / long lumps of text. However, I'm sure if you ask around you'll find lots of people who prefer it the other way around. I've been thinking of adding a little control panel to some of my sites to let people easily switch between the two. It's probably not worth it for short pieces, but for articles it could be worthwhile.",1215593317

He had his passport and several thousand dollars in cash \non him.<p>4. He kept removing the battery from his cellphone, after he was interrogated by police.<p>5. He bought a few books on homicide investigation, after his wifes homicide investigation began.<p>6. He lawyered up quickly.<p>Numbers 1-3 seem very reasonable for someone living in their car. 4-5 make sense for someone who has just been  interrogated by the police. And 6 is always a good idea - for anybody - before talking to the police.<p>Taken with the fact that his wife was dating (and recently broke up with) a confessed serial killer I'd say we have reasonable doubt.<p>He was, of course, guilty - I just don't think you could reasonably conclude it from the evidence presented at the trial. I think Plato said that knowledge must be ""justified true belief."" I don't think the jury could have known that he was guilty at the time they convicted him, because such a belief wasn't justified.<p>It's kind of like a broken clock that just blinks '12:00.' By looking at that clock you can't know that it's noon, even if it incidentally is at that moment.",1215593314

After a few weeks, it had so many rabbit holes of data in it (each one created by different users who created different organization systems) that I stopped using it because I had no idea where to look any more.<p>But that's not really a fault with Basecamp itself - it's just as much of a problem with any system that allows users to create their own categories or folders, like SharePoint.<p>It was doubly annoying that I was forced to use two systems for communication - Outlook and Basecamp. First someone would go into Basecamp and write a message - and because they had subscribed me to it, I'd get an email with their note included.<p>To reply to it - instead of using Outlook, which normally would be dead easy since I could just click ""reply all,"" I'd have to figure out where to go in Basecamp to reply to it - which was so difficult to do that I never did. Instead, I'd typically just reply to the message using Outlook, which of course defeated the purpose of Basecamp.",1215592719

Look at the way Karen Sabin speaks. The love and passion for her dream is clear in her statements. This woman is going to make it big. And I'm sure she's soon going to be the poster-woman of every business magazine very soon. Enormous passion! I bet she'll even easily crush Google if there's something called Google Pet Food.<p>Its a treat to aspiring entrepreneurial minds to read stories of such people with unique ideas.<p>Go Sabin! go!,1215592085

One of the strengths of a collaboration app, in particular if you grant customers acces to the workspace, is that you are better able to focus on the value that you are delivering, not the hours you are working. Clients pay for results not hours: I question why the strict focus on hours. We use CentralDesktop and are happy with it, but I would never confuse it with a time tracking system.",1215591759

He wasn't interested in what was true, only in whether or not he had been treated fairly.""<p>I think that being treated fairly is a pretty important point. It's pretty obvious now that he was guilty; but, from what I've read, at the time of the trial the prosecution didn't come close to meeting their burden.<p>I would prefer to have a system where everyone is treated fairly, and some guilty men go free.<p>Robert Nozick raised an interesting question about this problem. Any system of determining guilt has some false positive rate (let's call it X). You can trivially cut X in half by flipping a coin after determining a person's guilt and only actually considering them guilty if the coin is heads.<p>I've always heard that it's better to let 10 guilty men go than let one innocent man go to jail. What about 11? 15? 100? 1000? Assuming we can accurately gauge our current jury system's effectiveness (and we can at least come up with a reasonable lower bound using appeal data), it would be trivial to achieve whatever ratio we desired using a simple RNG. So, what's the magic number (1:10, etc.)? And should we do so?<p>And yes, the reporter was being a total asshole.",1215591011
