The first has been mentioned — slurping data from the local address book and feeding it to any site.<p>The second I can't test, but looking at the screenshot, it appears that Safari actually fills in the text field with the contents of the auto-fill, before you actually choose that auto-fill, and it highlights that text so typing something overwrites it, which is a standard way of doing autofill. However, using script to ask the textbox for its contents then exposes sensitive data. In contrast, other browsers display the sensitive data in (inaccessible to script) browser chrome, so no data is exposed.<p><pre><code>  Safari:    R|*obin Message* (in the textbox itself)\n  Firefox:   R|\n             Robin Message (in a popup, push down to get to it)</code></pre>",1279788994.0

Instead of the ability to directly call and be called by C/C++, include a really kick-ass Foreign Function Interface that can JIT the hookups and wrappers.  And more important than <i>call</i> compatibility IMO is C++ object ABI compatibility.  (I realize there is no universal C++ ABI; just pick one and be compatible with it.) If you can declare a struct or class in the language and make its layout match a C or C++ class/struct to the point of being able to pass them back and forth, that's the important feature.  The other important thing is some C API's use callback functions, without passing a user object that you can use to implement a closure out of it.  A language with the ability to dynamically emit new functions (built in JIT) would be able to build a new C function just for one object to receive a callback.<p>2. Fuck the C preprocesser.

(It's not just HN.)<p>The net lets us see all the great output from the most talented writers, thinkers, doers of their fields -- including people who we could imagine to be our peer group. But what we see is not an accurate sample -- it's dominated by the most remarkable, outliers by both skill and luck. (That is, there's massive survivorship bias; see Taleb's <i>Fooled by Randomness</i>.) Still, if we choose to look, it's in our face every hour of every day, in our news feeds, our Twitter streams, our Facebook statuses.<p>(Compare also: the quality of social networks whereby for almost everyone, your friends will have more friends than you [1]; the Matthew Effect, whereby small changes in initial endowment of power/fame/success can compound [2]; and how viewing top athletes can actually decrease someone's coordination in following challenges [3].)<p>In the plant and insect world, sometimes as one organism thrives, it sends off chemical signals that suppress the growth of its siblings/peers/neighbors, in an effect called <i>allelopathy</i>.<p>Information about others' great works and successes, transmitted by the net, may sometimes serve as a sort of memetic negative allelopathy. The message is: this territory is taken; you can't reach the sunshine here; try another place/strategy (or even just wither so your distant relatives can thrive). This can be be the subtext even if that's not the conscious intent of those relaying the information. Indeed, the reports may be intended as motivational, and sometimes be, while at other times being discouraging.<p>What to do? Not yet certain, but awareness that this mechanism is in play may help. You can recognize that what you're reading is not representative, and that comparing yourself against prominent outliers -- or even worse, <i>vague composites of outliers who are each the best in one dimension</i> -- is unrealistic and mentally unhealthy.<p>Actual progress for yourself may require detaching from the firehose a bit, picking a narrower focus. (HN's eclectic topic matter can be inherently defocusing.)<p>And remind yourself that despite various reptilian-hindbrain impulses, most interesting creative activity today is far from zero-sum. The outliers can win, and you can win too (even if you don't achieve outlier-sized success). Their success can expand your options, and they may wind up being your collaborators (formally or informally by simply participating in a mutual superstructure) moreso than your 'competitors'.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200911/why-your-friends-have-more-friends-you-do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundament...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect</a><p>[3] Can't find the reference at the moment, but the study I recall showed people video of a top soccer player, and subsequently they performed worse on tasks requiring physical coordination.",1279788674.0

15,1537689,comment,1534905.0,1535678.0,0,0,dejb,,,> One shouldn't think about legal issues in quantitative ways.<p>What about evidence? Presumably the copyright 'deriver' isn't just going to honestly detail how they stole the work. Surely an important part of the evidence is going to be what process was used to derive the work? If it can be established that an existing software package would produce an identical derivation surely that would be an important part of the evidence. Without understanding the processes of transformation (i.e. the spinning process) it may not be possible to accurately gauge the likelihood of the work having been derived versus a coincidence. This all seems to be firmly in the realm of quantities to me.<p>> It's this technocratically warped world view that lies at the basis of the bigger part of misunderstandings about the legal field and how it relates to technology.<p>I think the 'technocratically warped world view' is based on the notion that the function of the legal system is ultimately to serve society - not the other way around. Given that technological change is the major driver of social change it will necessarily also drive changes in the legal system. Situations where ancient laws and ignorant judges determine cases represent failures of the legal system and the more it fails the less relevant and powerful it must become for society to flourish. Inevitably it will be the legal system that needs to 'warp' itself towards the technocratic one rather than the other way around. Of course what I'm talking about is a medium/long term trend. Anyone expecting this to happen in any individual legal case would be making a big mistake.,1279788119.0

I think it is a result, but the aim isn't to affect their revenues, the aim is to ensure fair competition, by preventing the ISPs from abusing the monopoly that the public have granted them (exclusive frequencies, cabling, etc). That is, I see it as an anti-monopolistic measure.<p>> The FTC's trial balloons [...] are also motivated by the desire to provide a 'level playing field' for newsgatherers and story-originators, where a near-monopoly like Google, or thinly-staffed all-cut-and-paste-no-research aggregators, can't capture all the value news media create.<p>You point out and I agree that Google is a near-monopolist, but that fact doesn't automatically make these measures anti-monopolistic in spirit. They are measures that would regulate any provider of aggregation.<p>Wouldn't implementing such rules suggest that we see aggregators as simply parasitic? And if that's the case, why can't we just let the newspapers be protected under good old copyright (another public-approved monopoly)?

You're worried about the ""smart"" label and not the, say, persistence, hard-worker, stick-to-it label.<p>If you are interested in finishing something, I highly recommend read the posts on <a href=""http://www.justfuckingship.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justfuckingship.com/</a> - you'll probably find them right up your alley.<p>Take heart, by the way. Finishing and shipping is a skill, like any other, you have to do it a lot to get good at it, but it's totally learnable. As is entrepreneurship.<p>Oh, and take all these people here as a challenge, not a reason. You aren't competing with them. You're the only person who will ever be ""you."" Let their accomplishments at being the best of who <i>they</i> can be inspire <i>you</i> to be the best of who <i>you</i> can be.<p>Sounds a little woo, but it works.",1279786177.0
