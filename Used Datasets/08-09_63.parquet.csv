You just haven't tried hard / long enough.<p>It's not just about the durability of your business / value delivered. It's also about the number of people who know or can learn about your offering, competition, etc. Neglect can make you very vulnerable in those areas.<p>But, on second thought, I do agree about it not being about age or stage for different reasons. That is, neglect at <i>any</i> stage can ruin your business. It just tends to evidence itself more harshly and more quickly in startups--<i>particularly</i> those that have yet to gain traction.",1366534716

There is a breaking point in number of developers where it becomes more efficient to distribute the work trough a package manager but then you also introduce package hunting which can become quite a time consuming task.,1366534568

Most likely the banker is given a big pile of documents, then they work through it. One confirms your address, the next your income, the other is some other piece of evidence.<p>I particularly noticed they would be sitting there shuffling back and forth between the paper & then shuffling back and forth on the interface. It caused a lot of rework, and required you to remember where you were at with both.<p>The Web Interface was waaay to rigid. Want to add a party - you need to enter their name and work details. So you'd have to track down that information. Even if it wasn't 100% required to get a provisional. You could enter whatever value you wanted for the income at this stage, so why force the banker to enter work address and work phone? They can do that at final docs when you're required to provide a payslip (for example!).<p>Paper & terminal worked because you could move quickly between disconnected parts. Enter the person's name and DOB. Then jump to income. Back to their home address. Over to some kind of KYC information, etc, etc.<p>So I came up with something that was a bit more of a mind-map. Each node indicated if it (and it's subnodes) were complete or not. You could jump around and enter data in whichever order you liked & not have to think too much about what we left to do. Then the nav was about quickly moving up & down the tree (keyboard being a big factor).<p>It focused on making the data capture piece much more organic & goal-based. You only needed to enter discrete information to get a provisional, so use flags to tell the user what's needed. Then they can populate the space in any order they like.<p>Was waaaaaaaaay to weird for a conservative bank to consider :-) So I never really got to try it out.

Factor can strip this out if it isn't used of course, but can you really maintain <i>all</i> of these libraries? If you just add random things to Factor itself you're eventually going to end up with something that is impossible to maintain without a very large number of invested people.",1366532362

86,5584262,comment,5583573.0,5583573.0,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"This is a great piece for putting the energy problem into stark perspective.  I do quibble with a few of the arguments and some numbers.<p>Of the numbers presented by Ms. Carlyle, the one that's probably most arguable is the growth rate of solar.  Installed capacity (that's a measure of peak output, not actual power production, more later) is doubling about every 3 years, not the 10 she suggests.<p>Solar energy <i>capacity</i> (power output, in GW) translates to <i>energy output</i> (GWh) based on capacity factor (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor</a>).  This varies by type of solar (it's higher for concentrated solar power, CSP, lower for photovoltaics, PV), and siting.  A low range of 13% for PV in Massachusets, a high of 75% for CSP in Spain.  Let's call it 15% on average (conservative but realistic).<p>Global solar capacity was around 69 GWm in 2012.  Let's call that 7 GW after capacity factor.  Oil produces roughly 500x more power at present, or 9 doubling periods.  If solar output doubles every 3 years, we might be able to match existing oil capacity within 27 years.<p>That's not great, but it's within reason, and may be soon enough.<p>There are other tools in the toolbox:  nuclear, particularly in the form of thorium or TerraPower reactors.  Wind.  Perhaps even large-scale geothermal development (Iceland, Kenya, Japan, New Zealand, Italy, Indonesia, the Philippines, and US all have significant developments in the 500 - 3000 MW range).  Anathema though it might be to the wilderness crowd, the Yellowstone caldera represents an immense potentially for development, and unlike many other geothermal opportunities, is within transmission range of significant population and industrial centers.<p>The other problem with oil, of course, is that nagging little climate problem.  Yonatan Zunger posted a charmingly bleak piece on that here:\n<a href=""https://plus.google.com/103389452828130864950/posts/SgzQU5DM3LQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/103389452828130864950/posts/SgzQU5DM...</a>",1366531550

Which while true, it doesn't mean we celebrate Maxwell and Tesla for IBM's work.</i><p>Yes we do. We celebrate Maxwell and Tesla, along with all of the other great scientists back through history, because without them and their discoveries the things we create today wouldn't be possible. That's the entire <i>meaning</i> of Newton's phrase about standing on the shoulders of giants. We may not mention every link in the chain every time we talk about any given product, but it is implicit that the chain is there. Every new scientist adds on to what we already have, and if their contribution is significant enough, the next generation of scientists will learn their name along with the ones we learned.<p>Ritchie built C. He built on Thompson's work with B, but the C programming language is Ritchie's creation. He was also not part of an established team when building Unix. He and Thompson built and led the team after leaving Multics. Considering that he wrote the language they built the system in and was also one of the two leaders of the team, your presumption that the same work could have been done without him is a bold one.<p>Steve Jobs sold some products for a while, and he did a really good job of it. He had a significant economic impact, but it was a temporary one. Future generations are not going to build on top of his work, because he didn't create or discover anything to build on top of. He was a businessman, and history will remember (or forget) him as such.<p>Valuing great work and discovery is not a naive programming concept, it's an inheritance from the scientific community. We honor those who have gone before who make it possible for us to do what we do. Without Dennis Ritchie, my working life and the things that I create would be very, very different. Without Steve Jobs, they'd probably be the exact same.",1366531308
