She asks: ""How well are our resources allocated?""<p>I think there's a strong case that we're under-invested in some of the largest problems of society - personally I'm working towards reforming government <a href=""http://votereports.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://votereports.org/</a>, and I can tell you the government directly spends some 40% of the GDP, and indirectly affects every other bit of it.  Do we have anything close to 40% of developers working on disrupting our stodgy old government?  How about 5%?  1%?  I know of 3 good folks I work alongside (including these folks: <a href=""http://circlevoting.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://circlevoting.com/</a>), and a handful of other part-time, side-job efforts.  But is that a proper reflection of the relative return of the problem, when compared to hundreds of facebookers or dozens elsewhere?<p>Health care is 17% of GDP.  What are the big, disruptive health care startups?  Who is going to build the tool that enables doctors and patients to circumvent the worst of the system? Or something that serves the economic purpose of insurance while avoiding the onerous regulations thereof?  I've had the pleasure to meet with Jay Parkinson of <a href=""http://thefuturewell.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thefuturewell.com</a>, and I'll bet he could put the 30-some foursquare developers to better use.<p>Again, this isn't an either/or question, but a question of resource allocation.<p>Perhaps what we've done so far has made sense because those are the easy questions to answer - the money is there and the consumers are willing.  But sooner or later we're going to have to recognize that the biggest problems of society deserve more of our attention.",1286528370.0

Some of us like to remember things like what branch we're in, the file system structure of our project so we can edit in vim without needing NERDtree or some other IDE that organizes stuff, we like to know our libraries so we don't need auto-completion, and then there's the opposite people. For myself, I think the remember-for-me tools have their place, and I'm a fan of Flex's Flash Builder IDE even though I use vim for everything else, so I won't begrudge someone for choosing not to remember something. That's what doc is for.<p>On the other hand, in this case I frequently just use 'git status' which reports my branch anyway among other info I want to double-check just in case I somehow forgot, and this is really just a neat shell trick rather than being really useful, like the one that prints a green ':)' when the last command succeeded and a red ':(' when it failed...",1286527763.0

Politics, headcount, a bulky codebase and sheer inertia make it really hard for them to quickly copy you unless they were already headed that way before you popped up.<p>- When speaking w/ potential acquirees understand that they see dozens of companies a month. They are in no rush and can 'pass on the deal this time' all day long. Assume its not going to happen and never jeopardize your business for talks.<p>- There is never a 'final offer'. If they want you and talks fall through, they'll be back in a few months.<p>- Always keep it professional even if talks get heated. Any possibility of a deal can be destroyed if you are a dick. No matter how badly they want you, it raises serious questions about whether the acquisition is the right fit. I have heard of talks breaking down right at signing b/c the CEO didn't like the vibe from the startup CEO.<p>- Cliche, I know, but the best strategy for being acquired is to not need to be acquired.",1286526921.0

Government administrators--local, federal, and state--don't let anyone get near it.

Unfortunately, the barriers to entry to running your own school are high; credibility requires accreditation, proper teaching talent, financing.<p>Most of the time, I don't have a problem with the school. I have a problem with the teacher, for either being unqualified, or just being a bad teacher. I can't submit a pull request like I can in Github to rectify the issue with my own fork. In other words, we're stuck with each other. Even if a teacher is very qualified, the teaching style may be incompatible with a particular student. Sometimes there's nothing wrong with the student or teacher, it's just that neither work together effectively. And it's difficult to move a student to another teacher's class if spaces/funds/instructors are scarce.<p>School administrators aren't educators today. They're bureaucrats. It's no longer about the education, but how they can optimize business processes. Teachers, as frontline personnel, are fully aware of the problems with education. Talking to a language teacher trying to bring Chinese into a district made me realize that it's very political; teachers teaching German feel threatened, others who have been affected by cuts, such as the music department, feel insulted.<p>School is a highly subjective issue.  Some students weren't cut out to be students. Students ahead of the curve are impeded by the traditional curriculum. No Child Left Behind under the guise of making a ""difference"" forces schools to play games with its students. Instead, schools don't teach anymore, but teach students to prepare for the metrics that will give them funding (attendance/grade fixing/""standardized"" testing).<p>I'd like to fix the problem when I see it. But unlike software, having forks or different tags and branches are impossible in the teaching world due to the many reasons above.",1286525581.0

I just wanted to let you know that the reactions to this incident where it seem defending peoples own right has priority over defending peoples security gives an impression of selfishness and short sighting.<p>Eh, a lot of Americans feel like personal rights <i>should</i> be a higher priority than security.   A very famous and admired American once said<p>""Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.""<p>So yeah, I guess that is selfish, but it is also a very American value;  when you get down to it, we are a selfish people, and to some extent we are proud of that selfishness and independence.<p>I strongly disagree that it is short sighted.   The thing is, governments have a way of getting out of hand if the citizenry doesn't keep it in check.  I think that long term our distrust of our government will serve us well.  In general, I think in any organization, listening to the dissenting voices is good for the health and long term viability of the organization.<p>Edit:   Yeah, we probably are a little bit different than the rest of the world in this regard;  part of that, i think, is that it's been so long since any other country posed anything like a credible threat to us.   We have to worry about our government like everyone else does, but unlike everyone else, there's really no realistic chance of anyone else posing anything like a credible threat to our safety.",1286525561.0

Maybe democracy of one place, but when the Russian revolution happened democracies <i>everywhere</i> were afraid it would happen to them so they responded to <i>Russia</i>.  That's what I'm talking about.<p>>I would classify that as primitivism, despite the presence of agriculture.<p>Perhaps, but the point is that it's conceptually possible to have relatively large groups of people without government.<p>Personally I consider primitivism a non-idea because of the simple fact that primitivism can't support the amount of people we have today.

The Perl community abused things like AUTOLOAD & monkey-patching some years ago and learnt hard lessons and have now established good practises for their use.  I feel Ruby/Rails world is going through the same growing pains but it does look like they are now maturing (eg. Rails 3).<p>Now IMHO I see a <i>builder</i> as a good case for a <i>method_missing</i> mechanism (I think there were a <i>few</i> others mentioned in thread/post).  No magic, just a simple one-to-one relationship between code and what it does (result):<p><pre><code>  b.name ""Jim""    =>       <name>Jim</name>\n</code></pre>\nHowever I feel something like <i>find_by_name_and_address</i> in ActiveRecord is <i>cute</i> (both in nice and ugly sense!). There is so much more going on underneath an ORM that I'd be wary of the extra layers of complexity upon what is already an (acceptable) <i>impedance mismatch</i>.<p>Bottom line, an ORM is important to me and I don't want any loose cogs lying around!
