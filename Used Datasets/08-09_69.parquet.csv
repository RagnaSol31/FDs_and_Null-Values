If you don't hear it, I would venture complaining about 3GS phones just isn't interesting anymore, the performance issues have been accepted.<p>As far as the responses he received to the fan noise - fan noise like he described isn't normal. If the fan is running loud it's because the machine is hot and needs both fans running at high RPM. Something must be causing that because loud fans just aren't part of an Apple product(unless you're talking about a Power Mac G4 with the mirrored driver doors - those were LOUD - like airplane loud - but I digress).<p>I would characterize that response as normal. Since the machine shouldn't do that - my first question as well would be what are you doing on the machine? When it was pointed out that it was a Google spreadsheet in Safari I would go look at the CPU usage for Safari and see if it's pinned. If it is - it's a software issue. If it's not, it's a hardware issue.<p>There's no blame to be placed here without that key piece of data - this is standard troubleshooting. Is this blaming the user? No - it's understanding Apple's reputation for building solid products and the experiences of their users that this scenario is not normal, which is leading them to question what is different about the situation.<p>Overall it really seems like this was a viewpoint in search of a story, rather than an actual insight into something deeper about Apple's products.",1325232905.0

Unfortunately, as my local cinema no longer has a projectionist and no staff are apparently watching the movie people talk, they text.. some even get up and run around. I don't bother going much now.<p>I was watching the Harry Potter part 8 movie and teens came with their dad. They talked on and off for the first half of the film.  Their dad did nothing. It wasn't until I turned around in my seat and told them to shut up that they actually did.<p>Flash back about 10 years. Maybe a bit more. There was a projectionist. There was often a staff member sitting by the entrance of the movie. Some kids would mess around. The staff would wait to see if it settled down for a minute or so then a flash light would come on and out would go the talkers.<p>I forget what film it was but there were 4 major distractions where staff had to come in and order people out. As we left staff members apologised and handed out vouchers because they knew the screening had been ruined.<p>I don't mind people gasping or saying ""Oh no he didn't!"" during scary films. There have always been idiots at the cinema. They have only started ruining films of late because cinemas have lost the will to deal with these people.",1325232498.0
