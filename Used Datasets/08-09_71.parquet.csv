They seemed to treat their jobs as actual professions rather than as temporary stepping stones to something else.<p>After the bust, companies reigned in their (perhaps overly aggressive) hiring and IT growth, leading to perhaps an over-abundance of recruiting firms.  But at the same time, new recruiting firms emerged staffed by low (no) quality keyword-searching resume-pushing monkeys who would work for peanuts.  Thus, the real recruiting firms cut staff so severely that the remaining few were buried under resumes of all the IT people displaced (let go).<p>Companies still had positions open, even advertising them, but hiring managers were very reluctant to actually fill those positions.  Despite approvals to hire, nobody wanted to take the risk of actually spending the money on more staff.<p>This led to the growth in low skill H1-B labor, which further reduced the need for quality recruiters.
