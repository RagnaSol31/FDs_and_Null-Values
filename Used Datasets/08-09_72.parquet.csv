I mean, what percentage of a typical project would be macros?<p>I ask the question because you can achieve the same results in most dynamic languages by grabbing the string representation of a function, run it through a parser, modify the resulting AST and then regenerating the function string before passing to an eval (CoffeeScript being a good example of this approach).  Sure, it's messier than in Lisp, but in return for the messiness of macros, you get much easier to read syntax in most of your code.  Is the use of macros really such a big part of Lisp programs that it justifies the lack of syntax everywhere else?",1312361960.0

One way to do this is to set aside the high bit, giving you seven bits of length value storage in each byte. The high bit is set for all bytes of the length value, except the last one. If there is only one byte of length value, its high bit is not set. So for example, strings of length 127 or less would have one byte of length value. Strings of length 128 to 16383 would require two bytes of length value, etc. This way the length value can have arbitrary values, yet still consuming no more space than necessary. Loading and storing the length values could be efficient with hardware support. I would suggest storing the length little-endian. -- F""<p>""Length-prefixed strings do have many advantages, but I hate to think of the interoperability issues. These days you're probably safe with a 32-bit length, but there'd still be systems around using 16 bits, and you'd try to talk to them on a network and things would be all crazy. Not to mention endinanness issues. As well, null-terminated strings have some optimizations you can do by pointing into part of the string. e.g. you can have the strings ""foo bar"" and ""bar"" occupying the same memory space by pointing the latter at the middle of the former. It's common to do this when parsing a string, incrementing a pointer to the part you're interested in. An alternative might be to have length + pointer, pointing to a string somewhere else (which can still be null-terminated for compatibility), instead of length as a prefix. It's worth noting that the Lua language does something like this. You might also be interested to know that a buffer overflow exploit was indeed one of the earliest tricks hackers used to get into the PS3 system. A device known as PSJailbreak exploited such a vulnerability in the kernel's USB device handling to take over the system. (And getting into the console was sort of the first step of the PSN issues, since 1. Sony reacted very poorly and ticked off a lot of hackers, and 2. PSN was designed with the assumption that anything coming from a PS3 could be trusted.)""<p>And more.",1312360607.0
