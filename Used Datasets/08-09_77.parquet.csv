From my experience, I feel there isn't any specific book or instruction manual to follow. I've always felt that learning code is a simple three step process, no matter which the language.<p>1. Understand the logic of basic commands that you will be using, for example, in java script, event listeners is a pretty important concept.<p>2. After reading the core concept briefly, have a run through the syntax. Remember, you can always refer the syntax of a language, do not mug it up. The syntax will come to you after some practice.<p>3. Implement it practically. Make a personal website or simply start coding a few plug ins. This is where the actual learning happens.<p>I've always followed this paradigm and its worked out okay for me so long.<p>Although for a few initial concepts, <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3schools.com</a> is pretty good.<p>Also try reading Oreily books on Javascript, HTML5 and CSS.

5,4992229,comment,4989579.0,4992147.0,3,0,mrb,,,"I fail to see your point about the threshold of replacement. Assuming that enterprise-class drives get replaced sooner because sysadmins monitor SMART, it is still widely acknowledged that SMART errors are a strong indicated that the drive <i>will fail</i> soon. For example the Google study on drive reliability showed this correlation on consumer-class drives [1] There is no reason to believe this correlation doesn't exist with enterprise-class drives (or else, what would be the point of SMART?). Therefore the replacement threshold is mostly irrelevant as the enterprise drive replaced due to SMART would have failed soon anyway.<p>I really don't understand this skewed perception of consumer- vs enterprise-grade harddrives. Do you believe that enterprise CPUs are more reliable than consumer CPUs? How about enterprise NICs vs consumer NICs?<p>Consumer-grade drives are sold in volumes so much larger than enterprise-grade drives, that vendors have strong incentives to make them as reliable as possible. I would even say they have incentives to make them more reliable than enterprise-grade drives. Because a single percentage point improvement in their reliability will drastically reduce the costs associated to warranty claims and repairs.<p>My own experience confirms the CMU study. I have worked at 2 companies selling each about 2-5 thousand drives as part of appliances, to customers across the world. One company was using SCSI drives, the other IDE/SATA. And the replacement rates were similar.<p>I can see your point about the usage being different which could invalidate the CMU findings about consumer vs enterprise drive reliability. But I don't personally believe it explains it. The CMU study + my annecdotal evidence one 2-5 thousand drives + the fact that no study has ever <i>showed data</i> suggesting enterprise drives are more reliable, makes me think that they are not.<p>[1] <a href=""http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/archive/disk_failures.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrust...</a>",1357030658.0

It was fast enough to run a web browser and most of the CPU intensive work (compiling etc) was done on a remote server anyway. The build quality was actually about the same, the main difference was the lack of an optical drive (which I didn't need anyway).",1357028510.0

Not much code, and it runs reasonably fast, but making lots of asynchronous calls to load, convert from IBM floats, and visualize data, is the kind of stuff that sharpens up the Javascript skills pretty quick.<p>The neat thing about something like this, is that everything you need is online.
