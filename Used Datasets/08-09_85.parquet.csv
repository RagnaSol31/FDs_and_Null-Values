Would you be blocking off April for a consulting engagement in these circumstances?<p>This sounds a lot less like ""contract signed and PO for pre-payment cut"" and more like ""strong interest in resuming discussions with you several months from now.""  That isn't a no-op in terms of negotiations, but you're well aware (and I learned the hard way, multiple times) that there is a very-much-nonzero probability that the discussion in April begins with ""Well, startups move fast.  Conditions have changed and we can't bring you on.  [Optional: But we're really really interested in talking to you in July. (+)]""<p>+ Newbie consultant mistake which I'll confess to: this basically happened exactly when a potential client slow-rolled actually getting a contract signed for three months -- I need CEO approval for this, your point-of-contact turns out to be swamped in the engagement month so let's defer for a month and so we'll defer signing for a month, hang on the contract will be signed any week now but the CEO is busy, hang on we just hired someone and need to get him to speed on this before bringing you on, etc etc -- and only then expressed negative interest in an engagement, after the date had slipped multiple times.  This, naturally, has downsides for the business, both because it consumed a lot of my time in stressful will-they-won't-they admin and because I blew several weeks of availability on the ""Sorry, can't work with you in $YOUR_DESIRED_TIMEFRAME, it's already committed"" basis.<p>Older-and-wiser me would have a) been more aggressive about  getting them to commit to a contract (rather than a weekly or semi-weekly ping which practically oozed with ""I don't <i>really</i> need you to take immediate action on this.""), b) released the optimistic lock on the schedule the first time the client had any issue, and c) if that particular client were to contact me again, they'd get a two line email with a contract and wiring instructions for their 100% deposit attached, to assist them in efficiently administering their vendor relations.",1356771419.0

16,4981539,comment,4980131.0,4981077.0,2,0,primitur,,,"In my case the personal answer is that there is simply nothing productive, at all, about using Facebook.  It is indeed a total waste of time - for everyone.  I've yet to see anyone actually get any work done while facebook.com is up on the screen.  Perhaps some small businesses use it to communicate with their customers - I don't know, because I personally cannot ever associate Facebook with ""service I want to use"".  Facebook is a service I _have_ to use, only because my friends and associates don't know how to use email properly.  Sad but true fact: everything I get from Facebook, I also get from my Email system - its just that, well, some people just cannot learn to use Email effectively, but certainly logging onto Facebook and dynamically updating the web page in front of them, for some reason, is 'easier'.<p>Personally I think Facebook - and similar services - are a manifestation of Mob Think, and little else.  Its an 'associative' function, building associations.  Unfortunately, association is not the only form of reason - differentiation, identification too - and where these ""beams get crossed"" is where Facebook tries to sit.<p>If Facebook died, all I would have to do is send an email to the important folks in my life informing them ""Please use email.  This is the cc:, this is what its for.  This is the bcc:, this is what its for.  Here is how to add an X-header in case there is something special we need.  Also, GPG.""  Probably it would cost me a week of question-answering, but I'd sure love to be rid of Facebook forever, personally.<p>People are noisy, especially when they 'think' that folks are listening.  Facebook is a proxy for friends who don't normally pay as much attention as we'd all like, and the sad fact of the matter is that most of us don't ever get as much attention as we need from our social sphere ..",1356770768.0

The reason, however, is a bit more subtle. Haskell is the dominant language for programming language research. So publications tend to use it, and Haskell is better adapted at being Haskell than Scala :) There is also more stuff being published in Haskell for this reason.<p>However it is not correct to say that Haskell is more expressive than Scala. It is in some ways but Scala is more expressive in others. There is a paper that discusses type classes in Scala and show they have some advantages over Haskell's implementation. As more people use Scala and discover neat things you do in it, this is feeding back into other languages.

But if it was practical ten years ago in manipulating multi-hundred-megabyte files, certainly it would be possible now, for what are usually plain text files.<p>Instead of just doing a diff or git bisect, imagine being able to load up the commit of a file with one of those ambiguous changes, grab a slider (or your favorite keyboard equivalents), and scrub back and forth through a condensed replay of <i>someone else's</i> actual changes exactly as they were keyed.<p>I'm not sure this would always be a good thing (a form of surveillance?), but it would certainly be useful when the original author of the code is unavailable.",1356769203.0

And assuming you have the time and the ressources, you will still be comparable to the many gym lovers in a few years. Your life will be probably better but you won't be a superhuman.\nThen there's martial arts? I've done kung-fu and karate but I never felt like I was getting superpowers either.  Many people do martial arts and they walk in the streets every day with us and we don't notice their black belts. Actually, I think that most of the martial you'll do won't compare to what a MMA fighter can do. So no superpower there either.

I'll gladly recommend this over any book of philosophy.  (Different philosophers click with different people.)

Dancing, chopping onions, running, lifting weights, you name it.  I use it anytime I need to do something where the real intelligence at work is not part of my conscious mind, including controlling my emotions, but it works best with physical skills.<p>Gallwey wrote some other ""Inner Game"" books, but he was a Division I college tennis player, and this was his first book.  This is the book he wrote about the sport he knew, without knowing it would be a best-seller.  I don't know if the others were written to the same level of quality.",1356768328.0
