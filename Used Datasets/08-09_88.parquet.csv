I don't believe that's the case - so either the government hasn't been responding to the desires of the disadvantaged or the government has been rather ineffective at it.<p>Second, your description of a volunteer organization is so ridiculously counter to reality, I'm certain you've never spent time working for one. Here's how something like a county food bank actually works: civic organizations (mostly churches, but also groups like the Rotary and Lions Club) organize food drives and solicit donations. Grocery stores and restaurants donate food as well. Volunteers sort and bag groceries and man the food bank during pickup hours - anyone who wants the food gets the food. (Other volunteers drive food to elderly or disabled people who can't make it in.)<p>No one is paid, no one even has the ability to handle credit cards, and no disadvantaged people are paraded around in fundraising pitches. Donations of food mainly come from everyday people, and are widespread throughout the community. We serve a lot of people in our county, not a 'very, very narrow sliver'. You calling the work done by volunteers 'poverty tourism' is just you being an ass.<p>As for whether the food bank encompasses 'prevention' - no, it does not. There are plenty of other community organizations that do, though. The biggest and most effective are probably the marriage counseling and parenting classes provided by local churches to their members.",1353919193.0

A few points on this:<p>* 'code-as' is a bit of a strange statement as it implies two-steps from an original object - as you are taking something encoded ('code') and translating it to something else ('as').<p>* 'code-as-text' should be 'code-as-representation' at least (you needn't represent anything as text if you dont want to - it could be coloured geometric shapes...)<p>* I don't understand what 'code-as-procedure' means either. Is this an abstract-syntax-tree or just platform-executable-code?<p>* 'code-as-data' is meaningless because everything is data, both the text and procedure... Does the OP mean something platform-executable? Or something within a type system?<p>Good topic to launch discussion on though....",1353917839.0

So we wouls probably have been faster with Rails.<p>If we need to build another product from scratch again though, we'll definitely be faster with nodejs.
