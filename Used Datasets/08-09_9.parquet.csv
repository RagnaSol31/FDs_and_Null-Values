27,1331731,comment,1331591.0,1331591.0,0,0,10ren,,,"A great read.<p>One thing troubles me is that ""great businesses"" that make more money for their owners and raise prices for customers, seem to be less <i>socially useful</i> than the others, such as those in the airplane industry.<p>Here's the arithmetic for the 15% pa business, paying 35% tax, annually vs. after 30 years:<p><pre><code>    1.15   ** 30 = 66.2117720;   * .65 = 43.0376518\n    1.0975 ** 30 = 16.2980583\n</code></pre>\nBTW: My Buffett-based investment approach is to get the total stockholder equity from a while ago (eg. a decade) and now, and calculate its annual growth rate [1], a kind of $-acceleration. Then qualitatively understand what makes the business profitable, and consider whether those factors are likely to continue for <i>x</i> years. Finally, use the growth rate to project <i>x</i> years into the future, and compare with investing in an index fund; but normalize by today's price of the stock (ie you usually pay more than $1 for $1 of shareholder equity). You can see how long it will take before the stock outperforms the index. If it does, with a margin of safety, buy it.<p>[1] It doesn't account for dividends, and includes valuations of IP and goodwill (which are opinions, not cash), and I'm sure has other flaws. It's crude, but accurate enough if you use a margin of safety; I tend to think more precision is spurious and misleading, like those 7 decimal places above.<p>Does it work? I've looked at about 10 likely companies, but only one looked really good (30% pa growth rate, and an artificially low price due to bad news). After 5 years, my return today is 212.20%, ie it's worth over 3 times what I paid (and that's ignoring its dividends). Theoretically, it would be 1.3 * * 5 = 4.7, but I paid more than $1 for $1 of equity; the growth rate subsequently dropped to 25% (which is still fantastic!), and the current market is a bit low. So, the margin of safety is important.",1273393141.0
