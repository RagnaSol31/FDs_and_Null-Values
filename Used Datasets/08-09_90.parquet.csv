Frameworks and SDKs cannot overcome shortcomings of your language and/or language implementation (and often you don't have the luxury to switch gears, because there is only one reference implementation).<p>When I studied Erlang's support for concurrency, I realized how hard it would have been trying to do that in another language.  Yes, you could somewhat manage to replicate that, but:<p>- your language implementation could lack microthreads, thus impacting how concurrency would scale;<p>- you may need to follow some protocol in using the framework, otherwise you could fall into one of many pitfalls, which aren't there in the language you're using as a model.",1295341180.0

Just because most people are uninterested in making predictions doesn't make them especially hard. Just about everything he's claimed as 'correct' was being researched in some form at the time he made the predictions, and was certainly in science fiction long before that.<p>So considering that, mostly he put dates on a random set of things coming to pass. Then he uses extremely generous criteria to define when something he predicted has occurred and essentially throws out the actual timeframe when doing so. And that was the only bit he really predicted in the first place.<p>Somehow it works on people though. Just go ahead and anoint him your High Priest, save yourself the confusion.",1295340451.0

It presents a quandary: Facebook's main (only?) source of revenue comes from advertising, but if they make too much too public too soon, they'll lose their entire user base. So, they've been making changes over the last few years that greatly facilitate advertising, while minimizing the rate of increase of user dissatisfaction.<p>It bothers me enormously that users have complacently allowed Facebook to operate in this way. What's more fascinating is the level of innovation we see from a company that employs over 2,000 people: it's not too incredibly impressive. I'm sure most of their work is in maintaining their 60,000 servers, but even still, for the amount of salaried engineers they have, wouldn't we expect something more impressive than a product that has remained relatively unchanged for the last few years?",1295338377.0
