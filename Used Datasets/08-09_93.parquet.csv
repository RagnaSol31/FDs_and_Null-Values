I am talking that we should treat the healthcare system the same way that we treat power plants and energy distribution utilities. A system of grants and loans that ensures long term supply of goods. So you pay your bills each month but the government takes care of you not being price gouged (except in California)<p>In the US (disclaimer - most I know for the healthcare is from the media, non US citizen) a good starting point will be forfeiting and subsidizing medical education so the graduates will be loan free. Also the government should not leave R&D to the private sector but create human health Manhattan project - this will have the benefits of everything that comes out of it entering public domain so no royalties patents and other shit to take care of.<p>A good healthcare system should be like interstate etc. It is there it is low margin but enables the society to move faster towards the future.",1373792290.0

My experience is that a 2x2 array of 2560x1440 displays is simply not reliable under Linux.  The same worked fine with Windows.  The total number of pixels is one factor that seems to trip up Xorg (or something); the above setup had a total resolution of 5120x2880, yet a 1x3 array totalling 4320x2560 worked fine.

Some CAs will generate a key for you and claim not to keep the private half once you download it, but any security-conscious site will opt to upload a signing request for their own public key instead.<p>So, that rules out the possibility of passive spying on HTTPS traffic.<p>As for active spying, a CA could certainly produce a certificate for a MITM attack, but many modern browsers or browser extensions will rapidly detect that, so doing it on a large scale will fail and be detected.  The same goes for most security exploits: a large scale systematic exploit will not pass silently.<p>MITM or exploits on a small, targeted scale have some chance of working, depending on the target, but if a government-scale entity targets you <i>personally</i>, you&",
