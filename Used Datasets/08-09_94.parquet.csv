There were improvements in functions inlining (including inlining of constructors). There was some cleanup in invocation sequences for functions and we enabled type feedback for function calls through local variables on x64 (which opened the door to all optimizations that were dormant at such callsites: e.g. inlining or direct calls).<p>Other notable things in the runtime: new GC has landed and was tweaked for quite some time. Unboxing of double arrays and tracking of smi-arrays (should not affect node.js though).<p>I think the only way to see which changes in V8 resulted in throughput boosts is to get per-V8-revision measurements.",1340700103.0

It's similar to a stripped down JIRA - just the main features, without the plugins - and at a reasonable price, I think.<p>I've been running a low-key free beta for a while, and have had a few signups (I've not charged anyone yet, so no paying customers), but most don't seem to use the tool. They sign up, then are never seen again.<p>I'm not sure if it's just that this type of tool ends up generating a lot of people who are just taking a look, and very few usually carry on to use it, or if there's some serious problems with the app.<p>I'm not anything much in the way of ""not seen you for a week"" or ""how are you finding it"" emails - working on those next.<p>I've emailed most of the signups over the last week to try and get some feedback (and get a few of the older signups to have another look), and have had a few responses, most of which were positive.

105,4160756,comment,4159744.0,4160589.0,2,0,strictfp,,,"Wow. Complete cognitive dissonance between us :) I was reasoning about the plant as a biological device which has adapted to life according to Darwin's theory of evolution. Since gravity, as you point out, is quite constant on earth, one could expect that a plant has come to rely on it for its existence. Unless trained otherwise. So I was contemplating that the ability to survive without gravity would have had to be a skill learned off the surface of the planet. And if it has never experienced such an environment before in its evolutionary development, one could consider it extreme luck that it kept on living without the previously nearly constant gravity parameter. If the plant manages to survive in spite of fundamental environmental changes without previous training, it must have a very robust design. It's like a computer program which would keep on running if you removed main memory. Not impossible, but very unlikely that it wouldn't be dependent on main memory by now. If it still works, must it not be designed in a very robust manner?<p>Are plants this robust? One could be lead to believe that this is indeed a useful property in a evolutionary sense. But it must surely also have high costs. So it is nonetheless a very interesting question in my opinion.<p>Addendum:\nRegarding cells not being dependent on gravity for growth: In the article is was mentioned that plant in fact <i>are</i> dependent on gravity for their survival, in fact very much so. Without gravity the plant would not be able to physically locate its root system correctly or get its leaves above ground. It was, however, also mentioned that the plant survive in space just fine.",1340697769.0
