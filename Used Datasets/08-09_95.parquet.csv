See \nMartin Haspelmath's 2010 paper at www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/staff/haspelmath/pdf/WordSegmentation2010.pdf His abstract:<p>'''The general distinction between morphology and syntax is widely taken for granted, but it crucially depends on the notion of a cross-linguistically valid concept of ""(morphosyntactic) word"". I show that there are no good criteria for defining such a concept. I examine ten criteria in some detail (potential pauses, free occurrence, mobility, uninterruptibility, non-selectivity, non-coordinatability, anaphoric islandhood, nonextractability, morphophonological isiosyncrasies, and deviations from biuniqueness), and I show that none of them is necessary and sufficient on its own, and no combination of them gives a definition of ""word"" that accords with linguists' orthographic practice. ""Word"" can be defined as a language-specific concept, but this is not relevant to the general question pursued here. ""Word"" can be defined as a fuzzy concept, but this is theoretically meaningful if the continuum between affixes and words, or words and phrases, shows some clustering, for which there is no systematic evidence at present. Thus, I conclude that we do not currently have a good basis for dividing the domain of morphosyntax into ""morphology"" and ""syntax"", and that linguists should be very careful with cross-linguistic claims that make crucial reference to a cross-linguistic ""word"" notion.'''",1315558425.0

The structure is loose, perhaps it's testing something I've written in another file in a statically-typed language. As the code evolves, I slowly give it more structure by reworking it. At some stage I MIGHT put some code into methods.<p>But before that stage, nested scopes are useful because I'm <i>far less likely</i> to pass the wrongly-named variable into a function when I'm cutting and pasting code. An example coding snippet...<p><pre><code>    def out= new File(""blah"")\n    try{\n      def testdata= ""abcdefg""\n      def result= SomethingToTest(testdata, out)\n      assert result == result.getSth()\n    }\n    try{\n      def testdata= ""hijk""\n      try{\n        def result= SomethingToTest(testdata, out)\n        assert result == result.getSth()\n      }\n      try{\n        def result= SomethingToTest(testdata)\n        assert result == result.getSth()\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf I use testdata1, testdata2, result1, result2, etc, I might forget to rename a variable after cutting and pasting, and think a test works when it doesn't.",1315556293.0

What gets me is that, in my opinion, most people think that learning to code starts with coding.<p>Really, I think the most difficult aspect of programming is taking the real world process, as you see it in your head, and turning it into an automated process using a programming language and all of the ""best known practices"" that have come about over some 30 to 40 years.<p>I suggest you look into Behavior Driven Development (BDD). BDD forces you to look at the why and even forces you to run through the ""does it even make sense to make this"".<p>You have the chance to describe the Behavior of your program in something that looks almost like English (you should also use mockups of how you want your program to run using pen/paper or something like balsamiq mockups).<p>Then, you start writing the minimal amount of code to make the program do what you described using BDD (Gherkin).<p>This will allow you to focus on learning a few aspects of programming you need to make that one behavior work.<p>I also wrote a book on programming that focuses on the ""why"" (I was able to keep the number of lines of code down to like 10 if I recall).

Oregon has (nearly) a flat income tax at 9%, while California has a progressive income tax topping out around 9.5%.  The CA income tax advantage shrinks as you make more money.<p>On the other hand, if you don't make a lot of money, then you probably have a lower savings rate.  If your savings rate is low, then a large portion of your income is subject to the 7-9% sales tax.<p>It'd be interesting to draw a surface map.  On the two horizontal axis put income and savings rate, and make the height the difference between the total effective California tax and Oregon tax.  I'd do this now, but I need to sleep instead.<p>Additionally, one should compare CA's Prop 13 with OR's Measure 47.  Both limit the rate at which a houses assessed value can grow, but Prop 13 allows for discontinuities of assessed value when a house is bought, while Measure 47 doesn't.  As a result, new home owners in OR pay much lower property taxes than new home owners in CA.  (By new home owner, I mean someone who newly owns a house, not someone who owns a new house.  Measure 47 favors old houses.)",1315555259.0
