Often this is a good opportunity for the governments to grab more power and take away our freedoms.

Billions of taxpayer money is being spend on solar panels which we are not sure if they will work. Same amount of money could have produced more energy through conventional means, supported more industry and helped few more million people get out of poverty, I am not sure that by using Solar panels Indian government has saved million people in future.<p>I think a small invention like a floppy disk might have saved more trees that all government efforts put together.
