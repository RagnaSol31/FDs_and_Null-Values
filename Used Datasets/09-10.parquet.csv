Is there some sort of API or query system so someone at the networks can throw this shit together out of the raw data in real time?",1258883428

It's remarkable the amount of content we actually generate and the number of services/mediums we generate them on. Simply fetching all the data and hosting it centrally is a large enough problem, let alone indexing all of it.",1258882692

9,955587,comment,955076.0,955168.0,0,0,selven,,,"This is a fairly serious issue in some free software places (eg. Slashdot). It seems that copyright when used by big corporations is evil and restrictions are good, but when the GPL gets weakened by them it's suddenly a bad thing. Unfortunately, you can't have it both ways, sometimes in life you need to take the bad with the good.",1258882350

It has a really neat programming model, it's implicitly parallel and uses events as it's primary means of inter-object communication.  Through the use of components like the scratch board & lego WeDo it allows one to quickly build programs that interact with the real world.",1258882177

Most ships are closer than /halfway around the world/ to pieces of land as they travel from one side of the world to the other.<p>Where do you think all of the sulphur and CO2(also mentioned in the article) goes? It doesn't float off into space.<p>In London, I'd be way more worried about the air in the subway system.  The London subway has some of the most filthiest air you will ever experience.  It has that tar sulphur smell to it.",1258881701

Which means you have simultaneously solved a ton of outstanding optimization problems in science and engineering, and would allow for the creation of AI, clean renewable energy and practical space travel. Obviously those innovations would lead to the biggest change in the history of human civilization, and probably would cause lasting world peace.\nAll from something as ""useless"" as factoring integers.\nTrue story.",1258880736

Give your music away for almost nothing (or dirt cheap) and then play your own shows.<p>Record sales as a way to profit probably should never have existed. I would not be surprised if music historians in the future look back on the 20th century record industry as an aberration that existed only in the time when live performances stopped being the singular way to hear music, but creation and distribution of recordings hadn't yet become trivial.<p>I have no problem with this model. For every musician that hit it big with a record deal and marketing promotion under the rule of the RIAA, a hundred or more went into debt after failing to sell enough records after signing their contract, and a thousand more never even got the contract. I'd much rather be able to work and see my effort pay off in a tangible way than play the lottery.",1258880610
