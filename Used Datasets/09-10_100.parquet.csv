Nobody cares about the driver interface to the rendering pipeline any more - I imagine it's heavily dictated by the need to make open standards fast (eg. OpenGL). Power saving? That's a whole different ballgame.<p>It's a real pain that there are no useful standards for power saving - I've had to disable almost all of the cool processor features on my DAW (C-states, core parking, EIST) because they completely wreck real-time audio latencies, and cause clicks and glitches in DAW software (using external FireWire audio hardware). I notice that Cubase on Windows 7 dynamically installs a different power saving profile on startup, but presumably that means running it as Administrator, and we're back to the bad old days of running as root everywhere.",1347616743.0

I don't want an entire configuration and toolchain for each assembly and target platform (x86/x64/ARM RT/ARM WP/Silverlight) for example which we deploy one shared assembly to. It's hassle. The CLR is a virtual machine and one of the important things is that this problem goes away.<p>2. I would rather the compiler decides the optimisation for me. I really don't want to deal with that side of things. What I want is something that makes the problem go away which it does and let me deal with writing code rather than playing with compiler flags (I did a fair bit of VC++ and the CL.exe compiler optimisation options are crazy complicated).<p>3.

Also by giving the software for free; when an employee leaves the company; due to his/her interest in what the software product can deliver; they become lifelong customers - buy product upgrades and related software.<p>as far as attrition goes; well I guess it is bound to happen in case of experienced employees, no matter how great the company is; 'cause as one moves up the ladder;  number of higher positions(across various teams) start to decrease.  Talented employees hungry to explore their capabilities will leave for sure due to lack of opportunity.<p>As far as people outside MS wanting to join - guess will automatically happen if MS meets their requirements(job satisfaction + money + environment). The case most generally is that a company will find a replacement for a vacant position on its terms(there may be exceptions).
