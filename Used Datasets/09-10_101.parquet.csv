If the user interface would not fit in the fixed size screen of the card (it was 640x480px in the beginning and became resizable later on), it could be organized into multiple cards, each containing parts of the ui and with some navigation ui elements to browse between the cards.\nSecond, the card could serve as a database record. In that case the card would contain editable widgets to make a form (for example for addresses), then the card was declared to be a template (in HyperCard notation a &quot;background&quot;) and then as many cards were created from that background as database records were required. In that case field-widgets served as database columns, cards as records and backgrounds as tables.\nThird, the card (and its template-variant, the background) could contain code. Events (like a mousedown etc) were sent by the engine first to the respective widget on the card, then, when not handled, to the card itself, then to its template, then to the stack.\nThe HyperCard stack was the app, and a stack was a collection of cards and cards served as user interface canvas, and, very much depending on the application logic, additionally as code or data containers.",1392975389.0

First of all it was a proper programming language and not a toy project. The graph structure visualized recursion and re-use of variables very well. The code could be evaluated and edited at the same time by collapsing parts of the graph. You could collapse every iteration of recursion in the graph.<p>The most striking difference with normal programming languages was that all names were purely optional documentation.<p>Too bad I can&,
