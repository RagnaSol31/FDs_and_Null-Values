8,1850554,comment,1848485.0,1848485.0,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Yes the question of P versus NP is a tough, highly curious question.  So far the interest is, something like the continuum hypothesis and model theory, more philosophical than practical.<p>I like the question of P versus NP and believe that attacks on it will yield important and useful progress right along, long before the question is settled.<p>But of the proponents, such as Vardi, of the importance of the P versus NP question, many of them are less than accurate or honest.  E.g., Vardi wrote:<p>""Garey and Johnson's classical textbook showed a long sad line of programmers who have failed to solve NP-complete problems.""<p>Nonsense.  Total cooked up, clearly wrong, outright deceptive nonsense.<p>Vardi is talking about the cartoon early in the book.  There was a long line of computer scientists with one at the front explaining to a business executive behind a desk that he, the computer scientist, could not solve the businessman's problem but neither could any of the other computer scientists in the long line.<p>That cartoon was always a big deception:  Almost certainly the businessman's problem could be solved, and maybe some of the computer scientists in the line could solve it.<p>The businessman's problem was to save money in his operations.  So maybe some operation was costing him $200 million a year, and an optimal solution to some integer linear programming problem (ILP), and ILP is known to be in NP complete, might save him 15%.  Actually the 15% is somewhat realistic:  The work for the book was at Bell Labs; one of the main business problems being considered was the design of long distance telephone networks; and there was some empirical evidence that an optimal solution could save roughly 15%. So, that would be $30 million.  Nice.<p>Such design is an old problem:  MIT Dean T. Magnanti gave a Goldman lecture on the problem at Hopkins, etc.  Various large Internet and multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) network operators have continued to consider the problem.  Especially considering the need for growth and the uncertainty of the future products and flows, it's a tough problem.  For the deterministic version of the problem, at least one company in Texas, with some expertise from SMU, got venture funding to work on the problem.<p>They flew me down for an interview.  At one point I mentioned that my last effort into ILP was to get a feasible solution within 0.025% of optimality to a 0-1 ILP with 40,013 constraints and 600,000 variables in less than 905 seconds on a 90 MHz computer.  The misunderstanding, of even several students from SMU, about NP complete led them to conclude that I had to be lying, that no such progress could be possible.  The progress was possible, and easy:  The problem had <i>special structure</i>.  So, except for 13 constraints, the problem was <i>separable</i> and easy to solve.  So, use nonlinear duality, put the 13 constraints in the objective function with Lagrange multipliers, and do some <i>Lagrangian relaxation</i>.  After 500 such iterations, I had my feasible solution and a duality bound that established the 0.025%.  Did I have an algorithm that showed that P = NP?  Nope.  Did I get what I wanted in the real problem?  Yup.  The dual problem is to maximize a concave function given by an intersection of finitely many closed half spaces (in this context, always true, no matter how nasty the original problem -- the proof is easy).  So, this dual problem is just ordinary linear programming, and for it I used IBM's Optimization subroutine Library (OSL).  Given the dual solution, the solution of the separable problem was fast.  So, I exploited ""Solving ILPs for Fun and Profit 101 for Dummies"" -- exploit special structure.<p>In a back room they had a nice, high end Dell computer with a copy of C-PLEX and were ignoring them both and trying total enumeration.  Net, they didn't want to work with me, and I didn't want to work with them.  Poor venture firm.<p>Later a company in France got with C-PLEX founder R. Bixby and got some work done.  Cisco bought them to get a system configuration aid for their MPLS customers.<p>But back to the cartoon:  The businessman's problem was to save the 15% of the $200 million, that is $30 million or so.<p>Here's the big lie:  The businessman's problem was to save nearly all the $30 million.  So, saving $29,999,999.99999 would be just fine.  Presto:  (1) Saving nearly all the money was likely quite doable.  (2) It is not clear that algorithms for such approximate solutions are in NP complete.<p>Indeed, for positive integers <i>m</i> and <i>n,</i> for the traveling salesman problem in Euclidean <i>n</i>-space on <i>m</i> cities, just find a minimum spanning tree of the <i>m</i> cities (using a polynomial algorithm), and construct a traveling salesman tour of the cities by slightly modifying a depth-first traversal of the spanning tree.  Presto:  With a reasonable probabilistic description of the problem, as the number of cities <i>m</i> grows, this solution comes as close as we please to optimality with probability as close to 1 as we please.  So, the problem has a polynomial algorithm that provides approximate solutions.  This is an old result with details in:<p>Richard M. Karp, ""The Probabilistic Analysis of Some Combinatorial Search Algorithms,"" pages 1-19, 'Algorithms and Complexity:  New Directions and Recent Results', edited by J. F. Traub, Academic Press, New York, 1976.<p>So in the cartoon, the computer scientist was standing there arguing that the difficulty of guaranteeing to save the last tiny fraction of the last penny, exactly, always, on worst case problems, the worst that could exist even in theory, with a polynomial algorithm meant that no computer scientist in the long line could solve the businessman's problem which was and remains total deceptive, incompetent, made up, academic make-work, junk-think, busy-work, prof-scam nonsense.<p>Net, the computer scientist was passing out a big lie just to avoid real, useful work and go for a very long term job in philosophical curiosity and intellectual self-abuse.<p>And Vardi is still pushing that nonsense.<p>Vardi is saying that the difficulty of exceeding Mach 50 means we can't take a plane to California and then wants to be funded for life to work on exceeding Mach 50 or maybe just the speed of light.",1288432531.0

If so it isn't compatible.<p>It's very simple. You're not supposed to submit an app that makes Apple legally liable to fulfill the requirements of a license. You, the submitter, have to fulfill all the license's requirements yourself, without Apple being involved.<p>If your app uses something with a license fee, you have to pay it, you can't have the licensor bill Apple for it. If there's a contract with a rights holder, you have to sign it, Apple doesn't sign the contract.<p>The app has to be unencumbered and safe for Apple to distribute via the App Store, with the App Store's policies and methods. If the license requires action on Apple's part to be in compliance, <i>You Shouldn't Submit The App</i> because it's not compatible with the App Store.<p>(Examples of ""license requires action on Apple's part"":<p>1. If Apple would be required by your app's licensing to distribute the app without DRM, it's not compatible with the App Store. DRM was part of the deal. App submitters know that going in.<p>2. If Apple would be required by your app's licensing to distribute the app's source code, it's not compatible with the App Store. Apple-distributed source is not part of the deal. App submitters know that going in.)<p>I assume the 3rd party licenses the end-user agreement is mostly talking about are things like content licenses, like art and other media in movie tie-in games. Or books downloaded into the kindle app.<p>A kindle book is probably licensed from the author to the publisher, and the publisher to Amazon for distribution rights, and from Amazon to the end user who buys it. That's a lot of 3rd party licenses, that are compatible with the App Store.",1288430545.0

79,1850478,comment,1849619.0,1850410.0,0,0,pak,,,"I read your comment with great interest as it reflects a lot of my reactions when I took economics, particularly from the way Mankiw teaches it; much like this blog post, he starts with roughly 10 ""assumptions"" that the course will make comprising general consensus opinions that most economists use to make their theories.  These are such broad assumptions like ""people always make rational decisions"", ""people always think at the margin"", ""the market is comprised of many different roughly equal players that can freely enter and exit"", etc. which I found hard to swallow and made me wonder if there was going to be anything valuable in the conclusions.  Once I got over that hump, I did find that economists have come up with some interesting ideas in their dabblings with logical purity; sure they only work correctly within the artificial sandbox, but <i>once in a while</i> things line up well enough with the real world that you can make fair comparisons.  I'm sure that the more you delve into economics, though, the less overlap you will find between any ""simple"" model and the behavior of societies, since economies in the real world almost always act on a societal if not global scale, incorporating causality in a way that definitely evokes ""the butterfly effect"" or chaos theory more than a few silly equations...<p>Among your many colorful examples, I'm going to call out your transistor and grain market examples, because they seem to be a misrepresentation of supply and demand.  S&D doesn't say that ""if we buy more transistors the price will go up"", that's a misrepresentation of the theory.  The whole point of S&D is that there is a <i>relationship</i> between the two and you can only predict price shifts (and quantities purchased) by seeing how <i>both</i> behave, not just one, and certainly not by just looking at quantity purchased.  So demand for transistors has picked up over the decades, but the supply side has responded at an even greater magnitude, owing to improved technologies bringing the cost of supplying transistors down.  This is the reason price has shifted down while quantities have risen.  If anything is pretty unassailable in micro, it's S&D in a fair market with commodified goods.  The numbers there actually match reality fairly well, once you have data on the shape of each curve (ah, econometrics).  And it is totally legit for either curve to evolve over time; that's part of how you assess how people will react to taxes, supply shocks, etc.  I would fix your examples for this point, the others seemed more legit.<p>Silly ASCII diagram for the transistor market:<p><pre><code>  P                      P\n  |\   /S -->+4          |  \     S\n  | \ /                  |   \   /\n  |  X         ==time=>  |    \ /\n  | / \                  |     X\n  |/   \D -->+2          |    / \D\n  ---------Q             ---------Q      \n\n  ++demand, ++++supply\n  => quantity purchased increases\n  => price goes down     \n</code></pre>\nAs for how economics treats technology, one of the more interesting conclusions of Mankiw's macro syllabus is that in the long run, only greater efficiency can increase the rate of growth of GDP.  Simply increasing the growth of labor supply, growth of money supply, or capital investments, or decreasing rate of aggregate consumption has no long-term effect.  Efficiency is essentially output per worker, so things like education and research are apparently the best effectors for accelerating GDP (and therefore the most important to preserve long-term).  I can't argue with the sensibility of that result ;-)",1288429398.0
