Cells membranes are basically fat and fat is also a very clean,dense and &quot;slow&quot; form of energy.<p>Based on your activity level:<p>- Couch potato: Eat very low carb (basically no starches, under 50g per day).<p>- Light activity: Eat low carb (under 100g per day).<p>- Moderate activity: Eat moderate carbs (under 200g per day). I am here, weight training 3 times per week, with 2-3 long walks (about an hour)<p>- High activity: Eat high carb (>200g per day)<p>- Eat between 1 and 1,5 g/protein per kilo.<p>- Adjust fat to achieve your desired calorie intake. For most of us, between 2.000 and 2.5000 kcals/day is a good target.<p>The key here is to stop demonizing carbs/fats and recognize that they have its place in our diet.<p>I have also observed that, regardless of your activity level, starting low-carb when you are obese is a good thing to do, but after 1-2 years, low-carbs diets go against you.",1439542905.0
