Unless you have some super lame vidoe card I do not see how one can not make HTML5 player work.  My experience:\nHTML5 player works really well on youtube, been using it for at least a year (well possibly +- couple months) exclusively. No problems after configuration, machine is quite old q6600 cpu that is 5-6 years old and GF220, which is also quite old now. Full hd video ON Linux (!), Firefox no problems (though possibly just 30fps, not sure if I ever try 60fps). And people complain all over the place about HTML5 youtube on Linux.",1436778836.0
