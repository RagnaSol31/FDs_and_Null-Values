It just hasn't borne out in practice for us. Email is critical to us, and it gets delivered just fine the vast majority of the time.

They told me a ton of interesting things about how this stuff actually works.<p>Getting high deliverability is actually incredibly complicated. You need a dedicated IP address to send mail from, which you need to be whitelisted by the big ESPs (E-mail Service Providers). To get it whitelisted, you need to ""warm it up"" before you start using it properly. You need to be very careful about setting the right headers. You need reverse DNS configured correctly, you need SPF and DomainKeys set up, you need to make sure the IP/domain you are sending from hasn't previously been used for spam... and even after all that, you probably need to set up a relationship with AOL/Gmail/Yahoo etc to make sure your stuff gets through. You also need to watch for their bounce / rate limit notifications and dial back your sending rates to match.<p>There's a whole lot more to it than just setting up an SMTP server.",1295344390

Further, we're mostly <i>worried</i> about the prospect of AI, rather than naively hopeful for some geek rapture, because self-improving AI is likely to turn out quite badly for us unless we're exceptionally careful.<p>""Faith"" only enters into this when deciding whether you believe the probability that we can build self-improving AI any time soon is significant or not, and I'd argue that it's not so much faith as slightly-educated guessing (predicting the probability of a tech breakthrough is an extremely difficult thing to do, so sure, there are high margins of uncertainty).  You may disagree as to whether that probability is 1% over the next 20 years or 1% over the next 100, but we're hardly talking about the odds of virgin-birth here, so I find it completely unfair to call the whole idea ""religious""...frankly, either of those probabilities is, IMO, worth worrying about, given the stakes.  And you're flat out delusional if you don't admit a 1% chance of strong AI within 100 years.<p>I was going to more specifically tackle the other claims in this post, but ultimately, it's not worth it.  When it comes down to it, Szabo assumes that the main thing that would make strong AI ""easy"" (or at least relatively easy), the existence of a general algorithm for reasoning, doesn't exist.  If you take that as gospel, then sure, it's going to be pretty difficult to construct AI.  I can even see why he'd think that, having used genetic programming and other ML techniques and finding little success (IMO we haven't pushed the genetic programming paradigm anywhere <i>near</i> far enough, but that's a story for another day).<p>Plenty of people see things differently, and think that a general purpose intelligence algorithm is within our grasp; I'd argue that there's some loose evidence that human cognition largely owes itself to exactly such an algorithm, though in our case it's probably a bit more complex than we'll be able to come up with from scratch.",1295343167

Better internet infrastructure than many countries, educated workforce, socialized health care, a culture very welcoming to immigrants, easy access to the US market, and proximity to Canadian and US investors (particularly Bay Area and Seattle).<p>It's also easier to get foreign workers, generally, into Canada, so you have your pick of the local workforce, as well as the rest of the world (even Americans!).<p>I've worked for a startup in Vancouver that took advantage of all the above. Vancouver is one of the best places to live in the world, period, and it's especially great for raising kids or if you're into outdoor sports. So it has its charms even if you already work in a startup hub like San Francisco. You could probably do something similar for Montreal or Toronto, although it would be a harder sell. And the startup would have to be pretty hot or pursuing a unique niche.<p>If opportunities were equal, there would be very little reason for a startup to choose Canada over the USA.
