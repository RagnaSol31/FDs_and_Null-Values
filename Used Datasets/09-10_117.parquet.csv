This means that you get a higher resolution as well as a higher framerate, but on the downside seems to introduce additional artifacts depending on how these two interpolations interact.<p>I have not yet read the technical paper and only watched the video without sound, but from this video it seems that moving sharp edges introduce additional artifacts (can be seen when looking at the features of the houses in peripheral vision at 5:11 in the video). This is what you would roughly expect to happen if both pixel grids try to display a sharp edge, but due to their staggered update, one of these two edges is always at a wrong position.<p>This problem could probably somewhat alleviated through an algorithm that has some knowledge about the next frames, but this would introduce additional lag (bad for interactive content, horrible for virtual reality, not so bad for video).<p>I intend to read the paper later, but can anyone who already read it comment on whether they already need knowledge about the next frame or half-frame for the shown examples?",1406626900.0

As a biologist I have a firm grasp on what a nanometer is, how big a protein is, what to expect when I &quot;glue&quot; two of them together or what happens when I pour formalin over a cell.<p>It is extremely hard for me to talk about work to a layman who does not even know what DNA is. Try explaining that every base pairs is about 0.3 nm apart and we have about two meters of DNA, spread over 30.000 genes. What does it mean for promotor accessibility related to transcription factors? It would take some time to calculate these things but I have a pretty nice picture in my head of vibrating proteins and the chaos it is down there (Movies such as this one: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKW4F0Nu-UY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKW4F0Nu-UY</a> are extremely misleading!)<p>I had a colleague who got the molecular structure of optically active molecules in his head when he saw the absorption and fluorescence spectra of molecules.<p>But try getting that into the mind of an infant who learns by doing. Would it make sense? It reminds me of a piece from the book of Woz, where he explains how significant it was for his development that his father explained the workings of a transistor by explaining the flows of electrons. It made understanding much easier for him.<p>I guess, when a kid is ready I won&",
