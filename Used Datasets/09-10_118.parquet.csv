Since then, the storage sizes have gone up dramatically, so an increase in price is certainly warranted.\n* This is the move of the ZP after negotiations failed. Their negotiating partner, the bitcom made an offer that basically called for keeping the old price.

I am the original author of Photon and today PHP is extremely robust and you can catch all the exceptions/errors (outside the ones which are making your code invalid, but hey, do your homework). The current PHP 5.3 is also wonderful at not leaking memory. So you get the speed of bare PHP with a framework (because nothing is reloaded, the framework can really load once, reuse many times).<p>On a small system, a standard HTTP request through Mongrel2, to the framework and back is about 2ms (including 1ms of network latency between the hosts, data from my production monitoring). This is the ""hello world"" latency. It makes using PHP very fun and very fast. Also, a single PHP process running in the background uses about 12MB, it means that with 12MBx3 + 10MB Mongrel2, you can serve 1000's of users with nearly no load on your system (if you push the load only when needed at the DB level). Tracing a PHP process, you can run it without system calls at all (only gettimeoftheday for logging).<p>But, this is cutting edge, so, you need to be open minded and ready to dig in the code (less than 25k SLOC anyway I think).",1338975315.0

Also, Sprint introduced a reasonably priced uncapped plan around 2002 or 2003 or so, coinciding with the introduction of one of the Treo models, so there wasn't really a data-charges problem. In fact, the data plans got <i>worse</i> for a period later in the decade. There was a time in the late-2000s when Sprint re-introduced per-MB bandwidth charges, except that Palm phones were grandfathered in on the old plan, so you got unlimited data on Palm, but not on anything else.<p>It's true that uptake has increased over the last decade, though. Partly due to product improvements, but I think largely due to cultural changes.",1338974742.0

Steel has good thermal conductivity, and therefore steel structures start to bend greatly when temperature hits 600C in a single floor. This usually causes a collapse. It's very important to quickly evacuate steel building if it's on fire.<p>With massive wood structures the situation is different. The wood is very good heat insulator, so if the skin gets to 1000C the inside might still be lot less than 250C. Wood doesn't burn that quickly as it has to evaporate first (we usually call this smoke) before it can burn.<p>Of course this is all dependent of scale.

93,4072942,comment,4070845.0,4071948.0,1,0,m0nty,,,"I work in education so it's a mixed bag. Children like computers for youtube, facebook, etc. They have no inhibitions about technology and don't think it's OK to be clueless. The staff I work with divide into those who use computers all day, every day, and those who only do it occasionally and reluctantly. They tend to take up undue amounts of my time asking for support with trivial things, and I have on occasion been shouted at, whined at by email, screamed at from a distance of a couple of feet, and emotionally blackmailed by a teacher who would break down into tears if I didn't fix her problems immediately. But all the people who do stuff like that (i.e. show extreme discomfort with technology and take it out in inappropriate ways) just love iPads and iPhones. It takes all the crap out of the situation, and it (perhaps most importantly) takes me out of it - I think they feel less dependent when they can install their own apps, etc. The things I dislike about the iPad are what they like most.<p>I think they discover Dropbox via the iPad rather than via the PC. I don't tell them about it because it can be a bit confusing explaining how it works. But there is no confusion if they find out (for themselves) that it syncs their iPad to their PC and vice versa. Solves a very immediate problem in a hassle-free way.<p>I'm sure there are plenty of problems waiting to be solved in eduation. For example, multiple logins - to Moodle, Google Docs/Gmail, various other websites. Would love to see an app which sits in the tray and aggregates all these logins so a student can click to say ""log me into <i>everything</i>"" without ever typing a password except to get into Windows in the first place. (There's not much of a security issue with keeping all these logins in a central database since it's not that sort of login; just a way to play educational games or whatever.) Other things would include ways to get iPads out of the classroom. For example, some of our staff use them to film/photograph students playing sports so they can check their posture. For cricket, for example, it can be very difficult to prove to someone that their arm is bent at the point of delivery (which is a ""no ball""). The iPad removes all and any doubt by showing the bowler a movie of his ""action"". Also, field science, etc - counting how many bugs are in a square meter of grassy ground, using image recognition to look up insects in a DB and say ""That's a wood wasp"" with a link to Wikipedia, etc.<p>You did ask ;) I'm sure you could find hundreds of things to do if you're looking for a project.",1338974113.0
