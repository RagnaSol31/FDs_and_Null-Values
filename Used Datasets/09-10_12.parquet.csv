Data being big rarely causes it to be much more interesting. There can be much more actionable information in a few hundred records than in billions, depending on context, proper experimental design, and so on.<p>Also, an often overlooked point is that precision of statistical estimators (e.g. width of confidence intervals)  typically scales with the square root of sample size; yet the cost of processing an additional observation is typically constant (e.g. with distributed systems like hadoop). So in many cases there are decreasing returns to data size.",1344765327.0

One thing I would say, however, is that the reason OnePage didn't succeed was not because the domain wasn't onepage.com ;)<p>We have a long way to go with Buffer but I'm very happy with the growth so far: we're a top 4000 website (alexa) and with almost 300,000 users we see 130,000 shares per day via the platform and are fast approaching a $1M annual revenue run rate through our freemium model. We also have some top investors on board in our seed round we closed at the end of last year. We've done all this with the domain bufferapp.com.<p>I'm not an expert of anything, this is just how I would approach naming a new startup if I were to start something today. I agree your suggested title is perhaps more appropriate. That said, I did draw attention to a few other successful startups, and some of them have been running for a while now.",1344764824.0

That great big ""merge & close request"" button seems nice and handy, but if you press it, you're doing it wrong.  You should probably be merging it locally, running your automated tests and some manual sanity checks, and then pushing it to github.   What github should do is have a button that pops up a dialog containing some commands you can cut and paste to the command line to do just that.   My flow looks something like this:<p>- click around to find the author's repository URL<p>- git remote add it<p>- git fetch that remote<p>- copy the author's issue branch name from the pull request page<p>- git merge that<p>- run the automated tests, and check functionality<p>- then either git push or delete my own master branch and then check it out as a tracking branch from origin/master<p>That last step is probably suboptimal, but it doesn't happen  often and I know how to do it that way.   It illustrates my point, though:  why doesn't github tell me how to do it?",1344764043.0

Through necessity I've had to learn a LOT of languages over my career and I have to agree with you that learning different types of languages will always be more beneficial to learning any one specific ""special"" language.

The stumbling point for me is finding interesting starting projects to work on to learn them(I can't and I assume a lot of other developers can't) just read a book on a new language and get comfortable with it.  Even the best language books have pretty painful starter projects for experienced developers.  What we need(or what I need to find if anyone knows one) is a site that lists a bunch of interesting projects that target the specifics of different languages with a repository system for people to upload their results to for any potential feedback.<p>Hello World or my CD collection manager is no fun for anyone that regularly just glances at the obvious first chapter of any language book(variables) for basic syntax.",1344762859.0
