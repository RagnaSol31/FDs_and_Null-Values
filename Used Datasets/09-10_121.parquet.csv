I did some research on PHP back in the day, and reckoned that a huge number of types (80%-90%) could be inferred - but I didn't run it on anything like Facebook's codebase.<p>Also, more info on the type inference please :) Context-sensitive? Do you model reference counts in your analysis? If so, do you get optimizations out of that?<p>Did the article really say a compile is 15 minutes? That's insane - how is it so fast? Does it limit the optimizations? You mustn't be able to do very deep analysis - or do you cache it somehow? What about FDO?<p>I've argued for years that the PHP interpreter's implementation leak into the language semantics, but you seem to have cast iron proof about the refcounts. Is it just destructors, or do you see errors due to copy-on-write semantics (like the weird array semantics when a reference is in a copy-on-writed array)?<p>(Sorry for all the questions, it's just very interesting)",1333706343.0

6,3806553,comment,3806152.0,3806448.0,9,0,andolanra,,,"Rust is emphatically not a scripting language. It is a systems language with many features drawn from functional languages (e.g. tagged unions for data types, pattern matching, a type class system, type inference) as well as a strong type system with the addition of type states, which are assertions tracked by the compiler. Yes, its syntax is C-like, but I'd assert that it has more in common with OCaml than Dart.<p>With that in mind, the suggestion that it'd be more worthwhile to strap static types onto Ruby is like looking at engineers designing an aerodynamic, fuel-efficient, high-speed dragster and suggesting they stick a bigger engine in a sedan and call it done. Yes, Rust has adopted a feature superficially similar to Ruby's; that does not mean it wishes to fill the same niche or that Ruby's goals align with Rust's in any significant way.",1333706125.0

They might not take money for their work directly from the users, but there is still some moral obligation if you create something, release it to the world, praise its virtues and persuade people to use it. As it can be seen in the thread, lots of people already invested lots of time into building things with Go and now they're in serious trouble. Instead, many people in this thread try to somehow downplay the problem, advocate changing hardware (that's something quite new in the programming language world) or following some pretty absurd guidelines. This might or might not be representative of the whole community around Go, but it surely leaves a bad taste, hence the slight irony.",1333704297.0
