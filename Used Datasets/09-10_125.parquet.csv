I have started adding in unit tests in the past, but they are rarely worth the time (in these circumstances). I estimate that creating unit level tests and fixtures would probably treble the time needed for features, and would catch maybe 10% of the bugs that appear.<p>Uses request a feature. I build it. I show them, ask them to test it and tell me if they have a problem. I get plenty of testing done.

I ended up having to adopt comma-first to stay sane in larger/deeper templates, ( e.g. <a href=""https://gist.github.com/insin/8e72bed793772d82ca8d"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/insin/8e72bed793772d82ca8d</a> ).

Current ilastik development seeks to bring the power of interactive machine learning to very large data sets and a variety of tasks.<p>Janelia Research Campus, HHMI (<a href=""http://www.janelia.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.janelia.org</a>) in Ashburn, VA, one of the premier centers for the neurosciences and biomedical research worldwide, is funding a Junior or Senior Scientific Software Developer to reach that goal. Specifically, the goal is to implement in ilastik a pipeline for the tracking of multiple animals in video, a modality that allows biologists to study the social behavior of animals under various experimental conditions. The envisioned software shall be able to correctly track multiple subjects over hours of continuous observation, comprising numerous social interaction events between individuals. When success is achieved, the resulting software will exploit world-class tracking algorithms (Hamprecht Lab) and will be the field-standard, open-source animal tracking software, enabling cutting-edge studies of complex animal behavior across biomedical research.<p>Practical tasks include the integration or reimplementation of advanced machine learning and image analysis algorithms; the integration with existing tools; and the implementation of a graphical user interface for exploratory analysis of results as well as targeted proof-reading.  The software developer will be guided by Kristin Branson (<a href=""http://www.janelia.org/lab/branson-lab"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.janelia.org/lab/branson-lab</a>) and Marta Zlatic (<a href=""http://janelia.org/lab/zlatic-lab"" rel=""nofollow"">http://janelia.org/lab/zlatic-lab</a>), as well as a senior core ilastik developer at Janelia, and will interact with scientists and other core developers at the University of Heidelberg.<p>Salary is commensurate with prior experience and will be competitive for well-matched candidates. The position will be located on the beautiful Janelia Research Campus. The successful candidate will be in a position to help shape a project that is becoming an enabling technology in one of the most interesting fields conceivable: the deciphering of the inner workings of the brain.<p>Please send full details to Stuart Berg at bergs@janelia.hhmi.org and attach or link to a representative code sample demonstrating your skill.   \nSkills & Requirements<p>The position requires<p><pre><code>    a strong background in either C++ or Python\n    experience in developing user interfaces\n    experience in software engineering applied to large projects\n    familiarity with modern design patterns\n    the skills to integrate existing algorithms and functionality into a unifying biomedical image processing framework.\n</code></pre>\nExperience with C++/Python interoperation, Qt, numpy, and scientific parallel programming is a plus.
