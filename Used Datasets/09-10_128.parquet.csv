Regexes are intimidating at first, but when you get the hang of them they are a fabulously powerful tool that absolutely every programmer should learn.<p>As for 'laziness', I don't buy that regexes take any longer to write than the linked method. The third example can be done (in python, but I'm sure the ruby equivalent is just as simple) with:<p><pre><code>  re.sub(r'from\s+(\w+)\s+(\w+)\s+to\s+(\w+)\s+(\w+)', r""{'from': '\1 \2', 'to':'\3 \4'}"", ""from 4th October  to 10th  October"")\n</code></pre>\nWhich is only ten characters longer, requires no external dependencies and can be used with very little modification in (almost) every other language.",1349344761.0

I remember sweating it out at the workshop fabricating a continuous variable transmission (automatic transmission) unit by hand from scratch.<p>I went on to work with a ""leading education company"" in India and we rolled out an ""innovative"" program for engineering college students. I was fresh out of bschool and was mainly involved in preparing the presentations to be presented to the top management.<p>The plan was supposed to connect the student community with the industry to facilitate final year projects for ""free"". I was happy because this entire ""outsourcing of projects"" was always one of my pet peeves. I later found out that the real plan was to do the above, but do it slowly and when the students were running out of time, make them pay up and ""sell"" them a project.<p>The service didn't take off and boy was I secretly glad!<p>What did I learn from the exercise?<p>1. There is a booming industry to sell projects.<p>2. There is immense demand. The moment we started \nadvertising, we got tens of thousands of calls every day.<p>3. The students just want to get done with the projects. Why? They already have job offers from one of the various software companies and this is just a formality to get their degree certificate.<p>4. They just aren't interested.<p>5. We approached engineering colleges as part of marketing and most directors/principals we met were @$$holes who asked us just one question - Will this help me get more admissions for the next academic year?<p>6. Most HODs wanted a cut out of the entire deal.<p>7.

In programming in most cases you are working on projects. Once you deliver the code that project is essentially over (minus support and bug fixing of course). In a management role many of the key activities never really conclude. For example, resource allocation overall and amongst various projects, is something depending on circumstance, you may have to revisit on a weekly or monthly basis.  So you don't get the satisfaction of ""delivering"" anymore and items stay in your inbox much longer. This for me is the key difference.",1349342515.0
