Having a salt at all mitigates rainbow table attacks, having a unique salt per password also limits brute-force attacks (you can't brute-force the whole table trying out cleartexts with a given salt, you have to brute-force each password individually).<p>Having a global unique salt is already better than no salt at all.",1339063191.0

3,4078247,comment,4075873.0,4076895.0,14,0,masklinn,,,"> Am I misunderstanding?<p>Aye. There are two points to the salt:<p>1. Avoid precomputed hash attacks (""rainbow table"") where the attacker has a big list of hashes:password, and can just walk the table of (leaked) password hashes to get the cleartext. A global salt is sufficient for that, and where it's stored does not matter (can be a config file or a config table or whatever)<p>2. Avoid the attacker being able to brute-force the whole collection at once, there each password needs its own salt: the attacker needs a pair of (salt, hash) to be able to brute-force <i>each and every</i> password, it can't just compute a million (salted) hashes and cross-check all the table, it has to do so for each and every password it wants to crack. This requires a unique salt per password/hash, and the salt can just be stored with the hash.<p><i>Salts are not secrets</i>, they just exist to make the hashing of a given user's password unique. They are generally returned as part of the hash function's result (alongside the number of rounds, so the result has the shape <i>(cost, salt, hash)</i>), it's understood and expected that the attacker knows them: it does not matter to their purpose.",1339063100.0

I see a lot of bad advice on HN as well, so I should probably paste how I see it here as well:<p>1. DO NOT check whether or not your password was compromised via services like leakedin.org. If you've used LinkedIn, it was stolen. They only RELEASED around 6 million passwords, though LinkedIn has 161 million users. Odds are, your password is not found from the publicized list. There's very little reason to assume, that those password-hashes were the only ones out there...<p>By using such services, you just guarantee that your password-hash ends up in a web-server log to be stolen or outright to a hash-dictionary. Especially since most of us are stupid and recycle passwords from other services, you'll just intentionally leak your weak password to a 3rd party.<p>(Besides, leakedin.org DOES leak that information to a third party. They use an analytic tool, getclicky.com, which commits your search parameters back home every time you do a page reload/search.)<p>2. As far as we know, LinkedIn HAS NOT DISCOVERED HOW THE ATTACK WAS MADE NOR BLOCKED THE VULNERABILITY. So even though we've all been clever and changed our passwords before any damages were done, the new one might as well have been leaked already. This is especially bad, if the new password is a recycled password as well. So if you lost your LinkedIn & Gmail -password before and replaced it with your FB-password... Congratulations! Odds are that you lost your FB-password as well.<p>Also, change your password again once LinkedIn has given a statement of fixing the vulnerability. If they don't... Well, sell your NYSE:LNKD.<p>3. For every leak we know of, there's dozens of leaks we don't. Assume that your password gets stolen. Don't recycle them. Use a Password Manager (I use 1Password, there are others, cheaper and free ones, though. Don't know how good they are.) and/or a system such as passphrases or <a href=""http://safeandsavvy.f-secure.com/2010/03/15/how-to-create-and-remember-strong-passwords/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://safeandsavvy.f-secure.com/2010/03/15/how-to-create-an...</a> .<p>4.

Money laundering.<p>(<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/eetu-korhonen/about-the-linkedin-thing/10150925856481878"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/notes/eetu-korhonen/about-the-linke...</a>)",1339061691.0
