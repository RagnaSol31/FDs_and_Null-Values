Just the same way you can make a face or a zoo animal from a pattern of water vapor in the sky, you're making a failure out of a pattern of events in the past. In both cases, it's illusion.""<p>I don't often recommend Tony Robbins, but one lesson from his work that is stuck with me is exactly that.<p>The way he puts it: ""Our brain is amazingly good at answering questions. Any question you ask yourself, and your brain will come up with an answer. So if you ask yourself 'why am I such a failure?', you'll get an answer. On the flipside, ask yourself 'Why am I such a success?', you'll also get an answer. The trick is asking yourself the right questions"". (This is <i>heavily</i> paraphrased, as I'm doing it entirely from my memory of a tape from 10 years ago).<p>This is also why I think the best self-help tool is the famous saying: ""Fake it til' you make it"". <i>Pretending</i> you're the kind of person you want to be is a great way to trick your brain into getting the patterns and habits such a person would have, and the fact that you essentially realize you're ""fooling yourself"" actually doesn't matter that much.",1359194376.0

12,5119922,comment,5090717.0,5118462.0,4,0,tikhonj,,,"There's a difference between a type like Object and a polymorphic type. This is easy to see with generics in a Java-like pseudocode:<p><pre><code>    public foo(Object o) { ... }\n</code></pre>\nis very different from<p><pre><code>    public foo<A>(A o) { ... }\n</code></pre>\nIn Haskell, you always use the second style of function--there is no sub-typing, so there is no real equivalent to the Object type in Java.<p>We can imagine something similar for read. If we didn't know anything about the type, it would look something like this:<p><pre><code>    public Object read(String s) { ... }\n</code></pre>\ninstead, it's actually something like this:<p><pre><code>    public A read<A>(String s) { ... }\n</code></pre>\nSo whenever you use read, you would be specifying the type it returns. I imagine it would look something like this:<p><pre><code>    read<Integer>(""10"") + read<Integer>(""11"")\n</code></pre>\nThis is exactly how read works in Haskell. The important difference, however, is that the type system can infer what type read is supposed to be. So the above code snippet would look like this:<p><pre><code>    read ""10"" + read ""11""\n</code></pre>\nIf you made the types explicity, it would look like this:<p><pre><code>    (read ""10"" :: Integer) + (read ""11"" :: Integer)\n</code></pre>\nSo you always know what type read has when you use it. But what is the type of read itself? The Javaish version looked something like A read<A>(String str). The important part is the generic A: it's a polymorphic type variable. In Haskell, the type is similarly polymorphic: String -> a.<p>Of course, the type isn't quite this general: you can only read things that you have a parser for. In the Java-like language, it would probably look roughly like:<p><pre><code>    public A read<A extends Read>(String str) { ... }\n</code></pre>\nIn Haskell, we do not have any concept of ""extending"" a type: there is no sub-typing of any sort. Instead, we have typeclasses which serve the same role, so the type ultimately looks like this: read :: Read a => String -> a.<p>Hopefully this clarifies how you know what type read has. Really, it's no different from any other class like Show. There is a very clear parallel between show and read:<p><pre><code>    read :: Read a => String -> a\n    show :: Show a => a -> String\n</code></pre>\nBeing able to take advantage of this sort of symmetry in the language is extremely useful. My favorite example is with numeric literals, which are polymorphic:<p><pre><code>    1 :: Num n => n\n</code></pre>\nIn my previous Java pseudocode, this would look something like:<p><pre><code>    1<A>\n</code></pre>\nand would be used like:<p><pre><code>    1<Integer> + 1<Integer>\n    2<Double> * 3<Double>\n</code></pre>\nOf course, this is <i>hideous</i>, which is why type inference is so important.",1359194218.0
