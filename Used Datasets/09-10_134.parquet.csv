For off-grid systems this seems very useful.  Also, there was a news story recently about the German grid having problems with load balancing - apparently they want to put panels on west and east facing roofs to try and get a more even load throughout the day.<p>I guess that as panels get cheaper, it might be best to have static panels facing East, South, and West.  Have we got to that stage yet, where this is cheaper than the moving parts?<p>About your trackers - do you have any more info?  Why did you go for 2-axis rather than 1 tilted axis?  Were your problems due to inexperience/teething-troubles, or would you have the same issues if you were to do another system?  I&",
