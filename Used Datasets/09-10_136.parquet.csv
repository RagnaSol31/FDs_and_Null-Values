Google's handling of what used to be a good browser has provoked me to the point that I do not feel comfortable using Chrome. I've moved back to Firefox because it's a browser which I can control, not a browser which controls me.<p>Chrome's primitive and failed extension-model (still) also makes Firefox look better when compared head to head.<p>Chrome used to be a browser for techies, but is now merely a good mom & dad browser. Because Google explicitly drove development in that direction. It will probably gain market-share as consequence of that (and because Google is advertising it fucking <i>everywhere</i>). However, power-users will probably leave Chrome now that Google has used them to promote it and no longer sees any need to appeal to them.<p>In fact, Google seems outright hostile against any power-user needs at every single point, bar the web-development module. Everywhere else Google is dumbing things down at the expense of technical detail. As a power-user I find this extremely unsexy.",1309773404.0

It remembers position in the stream when you click the back button rather than refreshing the page, it is faster and lighter weight.<p>I've only used Google+ the past couple of days but I already am sharing more content on it than on Facebook, I can share specific content with specific groups. My family doesn't care about git, but my co-workers probably do. My boss probably doesn't care for me talking about what beer I am going to knock back a six-pack of on the 4th, but my friends sure wouldn't mind discussing that.<p>Google's Circles has already made that much simpler. As for addicting features, faster page loads (Facebook uses a lot of JS and it can cause the page to crawl), instant updates (I was on the phone with my friend, and I heard him click his mouse and the post was already displayed on my screen), and the picture quality since it uses Picasa Web as the backend is much better than what is available on Facebook, and best of all Google seems to know how to run a CDN since I don't have to wait minutes for an image to show up.<p>As already mentioned the mobile interface is miles ahead of what is available from its competitors, and having used the Android app I can say it is absolutely fantastic. As I am personally an iPhone/iPad user I am looking forward to seeing what the app will look like once Apple approves it.",1309772998.0

That was probably because it was focused towards developers, though, which is another mistake they made.<p>But I think the UI was 60% of the problem. When I first started using it, my brain started to hurt. They didn't even follow the golden rule. They had 2 same width columns in there. And everything looked cluttered and complex. Not very intuitive at all.<p>Another issue with it was confusing marketing. They called it e-mail 2.0, when it was nothing like that. People used it more as a collaboration tool. I had to use it every day for 6 months, too, and I didn't like using it at all.<p>Now, whoever even compares Google+ with Wave and says Google+ might fail the same as Wave, simply doesn't get it.
