You should try it and come back apologize for your ignorance.<p>Installing Linux with all the customized hardware inside, just get an X screen/GUI is non-trivial, even on old Macs.  Check out the Bumblebee Project to get an idea of how painful it is to just leverage the two graphics cards properly.  This is not to mention even on Debian Wheezy (stable), you will load without the proper HW-interfacing components to spin up the fan.  You can see how that is dangerous for an amateur, and you will know three hours later while configuring when your thighs turn bright red.  Not that it happened to me though.<p>This is just one small thing, go to any Linux distro wiki, how about Debian for example[1] if you cannot tell my bias, and read the MacBook page, then read all the personal blog posts, for old and new Macs and see the pain it takes.  Even though it is annoying, I will give them credit as properly the only laptop popular enough to force even barely useable UEFI support.  But Macs also half-ass that too.<p>Seriously, if you are a Mac fan, but like Linux, you will end up in the end saying fuck Apple for all the unintentional pain they inflict on you.
