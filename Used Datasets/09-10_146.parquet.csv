For example, there have been various discoveries that seem to indicate our language has an effect on what we can know and understand [1, 2, etc.].  Perhaps there are dramatic differences in what each of our brains are capable at the ""hardware"" level, but the ""software"" (language) dampens the effect.<p>[1] The Piraha can't learn numbers after a certain age because they have no words to describe them<p>[2] An article a few months back about deaf people growing up without any language ended up bringing out the fact that some asian languages have words to describe some aspect of color that westerners do not.  Babies are able to see the difference but gradually lose the ability as they grow up with no way of expressing it.",1299059933.0

The ongoing debate is about German consumers not consuming enough and saving too much. And because Germans are saving so much they tend to be very aggressive inflation hawks, which led to the ECB _raising_ interst rates in 2008.<p>Still, I think, it is deplorable how little respect the Germans get for simply making what others want. They're doing that very well and other European nations should ask themselves how they do it instead of complaining about a two speed economy. Get up to speed guys!",1299059786.0

What Responder does is it takes (or acquires) a memory image and reconstructs the processes and left over memory modules. It also reconstructs details of open files, sockets, registry entries etc. at the time of the snapshot.<p>Responder Pro has a thing called Digital DNA (which backs up nearly all of HBGary's enterprise products) - it's a mechanism that looks for potentially malicious code (I say potentially because it's easily triggered by things like McAfee because it has a load of strings in memory at any one point in time). Digital DNA uses known indicators to look for specific signs of things like keyloggers. It's not 100% but it usually reduces analysis time by a lot.<p>There's a fairly straight forward disassembler, you can look at strings tied to processes and memory modules, check for hooked SSDT, IDT entries etc. and there's a canvas type function for mapping out a processes' structure.

The country rebooted from scratch in '48 with the most unsocialistic / market-libertarian constitution / law landscape the country has ever had so far. Immediately there was the ""German economic miracle"" (not a miracle at all) but since then socialism has grown every year. Notably faster paced since 1990 but ""dialling down socialism a bit and the free market up a bit"" is optimistic and illusory. Once this beast feeds and grows, there is no real turning back, all you can possibly adjust is timing. They now have not just income taxes but taxes on everything that moves and every step of every transaction or value chain. Once these taxes exist, they are never removed and keep being raised. Continuous talk about new taxes. All political parties are various shades of socialism and this is apparent in legislation. They make it harder for productive people and firms every year and the real miracle is that there is still ""power in the power house"", and I'm convinced they're still riding on the momentum of the 50s-70s. All these various 100s of ""social state insurances"" schemes and constructions are about to collapse a few years down the road and every euro spent on them whether through taxation or debt will not prevent this and just be a waste and destruction of productive human energy.<p>I dropped out, I stay a perpetual traveller and out of Germany because my conscience forbids me to feed this corrupt destructive apparatus and the greater EU with the fruits of my labour. The only legal way for me to still be able do this and keep my citizenship is to stay outside the country for 180 days or more a year, and not stay inside more than 2 months in a row -- roughly.
