1,3942945,comment,3940073.0,3942828.0,2,0,fdr,,,"> The only grudge I have with PostrgreSQL is that when confronted with this problem PostgreSQL fans respond with ""We've got MVCC so it is supposed to be slow. Stop thinking it's supposed to be fast."" not with ""Hmm... Maybe we should introduce new facility similar to indexes where you could define what you want to count and the db will count by this conditions and provide results for you fast.""<p>Plausible, but somewhat bothersome.  It could be a special case of the materialized view problem, but it would take some convincing that to suggest that a special count-optimizing physical structure is worth the additional knob and maintenance burden it brings with it.  Not impossible to convince, but it would require some tight argumentation with ample evidence.<p>In my quick assessment, the need for faster counts over lots of data is subsumed by materialized views, which unfortunately is a very tough feature to write, but has the advantage of generally considered being being worth it.  A cut-down version of materialized views that just supports counting on various dimensions that adds more bulk to the planner as well as requiring execution maintenance and bug-fixing seems less-worth it.  Somewhere in-between is a variant that supports more aggregate functions besides count(), particularly ones where one can define an inverse transition function (which in the case of count is ""add one for every record"").<p>There are many interesting features one could add -- and this is one of them -- but at the end of the day there is going to be an assessment by the long-time community members who have the privilege of fixing obscure bugs for years as to:<p>* Who is going to write it?<p>* How long will it take vs. other features?<p>* Is a feature is going to be maintained to a level of quality we find acceptable into the foreseeable future?<p>* Is the impact worthwhile?<p>* Could this in any way be done as an extension?<p>The level of the bar of quality has changed over time, too, pretty much inexorably moving up.  Getting LISTEN/NOTIFY in now would be much harder than when it showed up in...Postgres95 (and, granted, it was pretty busted back then, apparently, along with...a lot of stuff).  LISTEN/NOTIFY turned out to have a good impact/complexity ratio, so it gets good maintenance, but in a hypothetical world where it was not already committed with a good history of service and use I bet it would have required quite some convincing to add.<p>There is some old code in existence now that would not be accepted again today.  A more sad example is dusty implementation of hash indexes that thankfully few people use or see reason to use.  Hash indexes possess ample warnings in the manual to <i>not use them</i>.  Yet, it doesn't seem reasonable to deprecate them for people that rely on them, and nobody seems to care enough to improve it, or even convincingly whine about improving it.  The community is pretty sensitive to these code barnacles, so if one goes in wanting such a feature, one has to be well-prepared to argue both feasibility of implementation and size and duration of impact.",1336471126.0

I think most of us who have the resources to begin a startup or afford renting a coworking space also have the ability to be somewhat mobile within our local geographic area.

6,3942940,comment,3942745.0,3942818.0,3,0,Xylakant,,,"From my experience neither is true.<p>> PHP is cheap to host<p>This used to be true in some respects. Free webhosts often offered PHP as the only scripting language but the offers were often severely limited in which extensions were available and in other respects. Deploying a moderately complex application often was work for a day [1] - which translates to at least two years of paid hosting on a decent hoster. Ruby on the contrary used to require specialized hosting or a dedicated server. With the rise of heroku, this point became moot.<p>> cheap to find decently priced & skilled programmers<p>The lesson I took from being technical lead for a 50+ dev team is that it's easy to find cheap php developers, but they often turn out to be Net Negative Programmers. Decent PHP programmers take decent salaries (just as decent ruby/python/java programmers) and - as every decent programmer - are quite well capable of picking up other languages in a short amount of time. If you're just doing ""standard websites"" cheap developers might be just what you need though (you could go for cheap rails developers as well, they exist).<p>> quick to code in if you know what youre doing<p>There were times when I considered myself a skilled php programmer, but compared to what I can churn out in ruby, php flat out looses.

You may think, why synchronise if they're not using each other's memory? Well it can be extremely hard to work out a priori if two threads are using the same memory or not. In fact for some problems, such as many graph problems, working out what memory they're going to use is the same problem as the problem that you're trying to solve in the first place.<p>STM is like having a single lock for every single word in your memory, and then magically always acquiring every lock that you will need at the start of the transaction in a determinate order, so that you don't get deadlock.<p>If two threads enter an atomic region, but do access each other's memory, then the transaction is silently aborted and restarted. Ideally these aborts are rare and the program runs very much in parallel.<p>A more concrete example - in Java if you have a hash table you will usually lock during all reads and writes. If you used STM, and two writes accessed different buckets of the table, then there's no need to lock. The STM works this out for you.",1336471013.0
