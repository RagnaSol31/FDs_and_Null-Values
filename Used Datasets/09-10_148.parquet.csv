It has to be earned<p>> Millennials have grown up at a time where they were told one thing and shown another, said Adams [SVP and Head of Innovation at Vice Media]. Climate change denial, the financial meltdown in 2008, old media was seen as the harbinger and the bringer of lies. “At best traditional media seems irrelevant,” he continued and “at worst it seems like it’s part of a vanguard that can’t get away with what its been getting away with for too long”.<p>> Vice plays in the middle of this shift, embracing classic programming but also mindful of the tension of new media to craft content that rings true with readers and viewers. “If you’re not open and transparent, you’ll be torn pieces,” warned Adams.<p>However, some statements in this article also suggest to me that Vice is willing to participate in crafting and shaping content for advertising purposes:<p>> [Vice recognizes] An engaged community can be as potent as any media buy. [...] So how does a marketer go about identifying a busting community capable of exponentially amplifying their messages? Unsurprisingly, Adams thinks publishers like Vice and the insights they have into their audiences are key.<p>> “Media agencies can do amazing things but advertisers need to work with someone like us in order to get that initial early adopter curve of anyone who’s going to truly care about that campaign,” he continued. “A campaign should be designed with <i>somebody who really understands content</i> and doesn’t just think about obsessively about CPMs and the efficiency of reach because this will not be the future model.” (emphasis mine)",1448703164.0
