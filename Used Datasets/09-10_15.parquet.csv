It really was something else.<p>The quality of the file system and the way its advanced capabilities were fully utilized throughout the OS was also novel. Here is part of an old article written by Scot Hacker, who also wrote the BeOS Bible, which explain some of the advantages: <a href=""http://www.osnews.com/story/421/_I_MacOSX_Week_I_Tales_of_a_BeOS_Refugee/page13/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.osnews.com/story/421/_I_MacOSX_Week_I_Tales_of_a_...</a><p>Much of what the BeOS had going for it is now available in other OSes, in various shapes or forms, but what made the BeOS such a joy to use was how it all came together in a unified way. The Tracker, for example, which is the equivalent to Finder on Mac OS X, treated attributes as first-class citizens, making it very natural to set up views like the example in the article above, focusing on Category, Title etc.<p>Another thing that really stood out was the quality of the icons and the look of the window manager. The icons are everywhere on the web today, and while the UI might not be considered sexy by today’s standards, the yellow tabs that could be dragged along the top of windows were cute as hell. Other little touches, like the built-in desktop switcher that allowed different resolutions and color depths for each desktop (excellent for web development), are not commonly found today, afaik.<p>It will be interesting to see what the experience is like now, after so many years with Mac OS X. Will definitely install.",1252921373

16,821383,comment,820244.0,820683.0,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Having worked as a trauma nurse for years, I really can't believe that the entire hospital staff was conspiring to keep him there because he had good insurance.  More often than not, we are kept entirely in the dark about people's insurance.<p>They may well have had a poor bedside manner, and they may well have tried to pressure him into having a surgery they thought necessary, but doctors disagree with treatment methods all the time.  That doesn't mean that they were necessarily evil in disagreeing with the doctor in Boston.<p>It's also fairly standard practice for insurance companies to decline to pay a patient's hospital bill if that patient signs out against medical advice.  So, if they said that he would have to pay out of pocket, they may well have been telling the truth.  If he was signing out against medical advice, he may well have been responsible for the entire transfer bill, which would likely have been in the tens of thousands of dollars.<p>Also, if the hospital was the closest qualified trauma center, and if it was deemed by the Attending Neurosurgeon that he have surgery soon or risk permanent paralysis, it's understandable that they would have been reluctant to transfer the patient.  And, if he was refusing emergency back surgery and if he was demanding transfer, he may well have been risking permantent paralysis as well as being financially liable for the hospitalization.",1252920854

Rather, I think it makes an interesting story about trying to get in to a decent product launch conference - we get told by the main main we've got 80% chance getting in [yah!], we don't get in [boo!], we get email saying 'actually you are in' [yah!], but then we realise we can't do it [boo!]. I'd hope it's at least vaguely interesting, regardless of the conference.<p>I agree there is a danger of getting caught up in the TechCrunch hype bubble, just as there is in getting caught up in the Y Combinator programme hype. As has been pointed out, the reality is that 99.9%+ of successful web startups have nothing to do with TC50 or YC. Nevertheless TC (just as YC) have had some notable successes that fuel the hype - just look at Mint (TC40 2007 winner) being acquired today.<p>I'd say that in terms of web product launch conferences, TC50 is about as good and prestigious an opportunity you can get. However after that it is unlikely I would have a need to attend again - it's not the sort of conference where you sell your service.<p>Part of the reality check we took in saying ""no"" to this opportunity was to remind ourselves that it is ""just a conference"" - it's not the be all and end all. It won't break us not to attend. I think that shows that we were able to resist the hype. As is said below - we want to do things right - not do something for the sake of it.<p>wrt to DemoPit - according to the information we received, the DemoPit was only for the TC50 semi-finalist companies. I haven't seen any mention of being able to buy your way in otherwise. That said, if you did want to do DemoPit you had to pay a few thousand dollars. In that regard it becomes just a regular exhibition. We were offered a free DemoPit place just in case we weren't actually needed on the stage.",1252919034
