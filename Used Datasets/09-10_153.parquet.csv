I had been doing it on the side for 8  months... and it was a great experience so far. I had great clients and I absolutely loved working with them.<p>But things changed soon couple of weeks back when I happened to look for another contract where I could put in 20-25 hours weekly - I had that slot empty after leaving a job. I landed up one with a decent hourly rate.<p>Firstly, it was not a typical job that I took up earlier - it is a &quot;developer&quot; job and less of consulting. In the test assignment - which was supposed to take just couple of hours, I had spent 3-4 hours. Around 1 hour was setup time and a very small bit of learning was required on that task. I also mentioned that clearly to the client.<p>Now, my workdays with the client are miserable. This client has been pushing me on timelines - Example: I have 7 hours of work-slot spread in 3 alternate days and he would call me on the non-working hours. Additionally the expectations are too high - He says &quot;this is a one hour job&quot; - And it takes me 12 hours to finish that. I am confident it is not a 1 hour job and doesn&",
