All the advantages of anonymity and irreversibility are voided if there is every reason to keep hold of your money and let it increase in value. Several people on HN claim to have hundreds of thousands of bitcoins, making them worth more than 0.1% of the entire economy. Whilst the real world has its (possibly unfair) share of billionaires, the majority of these have come through substantial business innovation. Bitcoin ""billionaires"" come through luck and early adoption, and in my view it makes it more unfair than our current system.<p>I think that bitcoin will continue to have some success in areas that wish for privacy, but will not reach the heights that some people predict.",1337680532.0

And if you've put in enough effort, you will not want to waste that by eating junk. Solid exercise involves a lot of physical pain and once you learn to deal with that your willpower will be off the charts and sticking to the right food will be a breeze.<p>I was out of shape until I did P90X last summer and now I'm a different person altogether. You would be surprised how much can be done in three months of proper hard work. But it does not have to be a full blown fitness program. People aren't always aware of the options. When thinking of weight loss, jogging is the first thing that pops to mind. I have always found it extremely challenging mentally and I was never even overweight. Commit yourself to a few basketball games a week, or a cycle, a climb, a hike, skiing, whatever you enjoy. If you push that little bit harder every time and get some sweat going, get your heart racing, you will be surprised what it will do to your body.<p>Also a tip for motivation is to focus on performance. If you can run faster and farther, jump higher or feel better, just keep progressing and the weight will come down naturally.",1337678942.0

They might not be quite as mentally engaging as commenting on HN or programming, but they provide the same functionality.<p>Making a distinction between time spent playing video games and time spent doing other leisure activities is fairly pointless. Managed properly, there's no real physical difference between playing a video game for 20 hours a week and reading a novel, watching TV, commenting on HN, programming or any other fairly motionless activity. I know that I (as a relatively fit 21 year old) spend quite a lot of time sat in front of a computer. Physically the activity is fairly irrelevant.<p>Perhaps the only thing that video games have that the other activities I mentioned don't is that they have a fairly high potential to be addictive. I'd imagine most people who've played video games at any point know what it's like to play for 10 hours straight for an entire weekend. You don't have to do that, but people do.<p>Regardless, a sedentary lifestyle with no regular exercise will lead to health problems which increase the likelihood of death. That's something we've known for decades. Don't count ""time spent playing video games"", count ""time spent sitting down"".",1337677398.0

It won't be a case of everyone who gets arrested having it scanned. Firstly there isn't any authority to do so, secondly it isn't worth it time wise.\nI used to be a cop in Scotland and I never arrested anyone where there was a need to do anything with their phone other than try and work out how to turn the damn thing off...",1337677259.0
