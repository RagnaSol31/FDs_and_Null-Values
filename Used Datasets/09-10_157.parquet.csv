You should not need to give the same order every evening, right? And even in this case, if your gf/bf just fell asleep next to you, would you not prefer some silent way to give this order?<p>I agree too that touchscreen is not the last word in HCI. But I still don't see a future of people talking to robots. More precisely, I think that robots will always be machines, and that the main interaction channel with machines will not be sound waves carrying human language. I'll try to explain why.<p>The most useful and powerful tools and machine we have today, from chopsticks to pen and paper to cars to computers, are all using hands and fingers. Human being are as much defined by their language capacity than by their crafting-by-hand capacity. When sound channel is used, for example for sherperding and hunting, it is because it can reach far away, not because it is particularly convenient, and it is not using normal human language anyway.<p>Most powerful tools are powerful because they have near infinite precision and expressivity. Think a Chinese brush, or a violin: human language is extremely rough compared to the range of actions allowed by these. Try to voice-control a pen to draw a single smiley face, I would be surprised if we would recognise the thing. In fact, I think next and next-next generations of electronic devices, be it phones or glasses or implants, will go closer to the tight coupling and immediate feedback we have with pens, brushes, pianos, and even hammers or game controllers.<p>Many (if not most) of the interesting interactions we can have with machines and tools are not worded and cannot be expressed in current human language. This is a bit out of sight these days, but not everything need to be words or text. Reading famous chefs recipes will never help you cook food if you do not have the ""hand"" (and taste) for it. The HN crowd is a bit biased, with so many bloggers and blog-readers, but many people do not consume as much text as we do here.<p>The many attemps to use human natural language to describe the behavior of systems have all failed hard, and we have to fallback on programming languages, which, from linguistic perspective, are abominable caricatures of human languages. This is telling. In order to control properly a computer, we need to talk in the computer's language. Not necessarily because it is not clever enough to understand human language, but because human language is not the right tool for the task. Human language is very efficient in communicating with other human beings, but not so with machines, and useful robots will be machines.<p>The future will them me right or wrong, I hope to grow old enough to see it.<p>But allow me to imagine the intelligent glasses UI. It can display anything on the screen. Very good, so it means that, except when alseep, the audio channel is not needed not receiving feedback from the glasses. Talking to the thing using human language is a possibility, but only one in many other possiblilities. Imagine there is a very well thought ""UI"" that is sensing the taps of your fingers on your forearm, or your leg, or whatever part of your body is easily accessed. Imagine you can give ""input"" to your glasses by drawing shapes on your blue jeans, or tapping little rythmic commands, ""tap-tap-tap"" is cancel, ""slide-left"" is next, ""draw a round"" is repeat, etc. I think this could be worth trying.",1357290214.0
