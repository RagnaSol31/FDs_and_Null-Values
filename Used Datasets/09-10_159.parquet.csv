I have actually thought about such a service a while ago, because I read about those online leeches who pretend to be poor girls from a developing country (actually they are mostly middle aged men). They keep in contact for years, urging their ""host"" to send them money to support them, and sometimes even help the host find a job when he is fired. The hosts readily send even huge sums just so they can connect to somebody emotionally. This clearly shows there is a lack of warmth and connection for people in our society, and I can think of better ways to help them than through online leeches.",1336384539.0

I meant, ""in a day"".<p>What I really had in mind is about a day's work, like an extended interview, but paid.  Basically, someone saying, ""Look, I don't know how to tell a hadoop expert from someone who can only code bad html and bad php"", so instead of three unpaid interviews before you land your next job, how about one 8-hour paid interview (320 dollars).  If you're what I'm looking for I'll hire you on the spot, but if you're just full of BS like the last three guys I couldn't tell were BS artists, when I'll just have to make do with a tiny bit of progress.<p>My point was, interviews are also an opportunity cost, and that not being able to tell apart bad php coders from awesome database engineers is also an opportunity cost.  Also I don't know what market you have in mind, but 40 dollars an hour is more than what someone who just does some html and php badly (i.e. couldn't complete fizzbuzz) is worth in almost every city.  That would be 80k per year salary.<p>I think the point is to bridge the gap between ""completely unpaid interview"" and ""I have to pay you 100 dollars an hour for a week"".  How about an 8-hour or 4-hour ""free trial"" before I take you on full-time at 200k per year?  Only instead of actually free, I'll actually pay you 320 dollars for your audition.

You could make a case that governments should protect minorities. But I see a couple of issues in this case:<p>The competition commission doesn't have a legal mandate to give preferencial treatment to minorities. They have a very clear mandate and they should stick to it in the interest of seperation of concerns.<p>The particular minority concerned in this case is a rather wealthy one that benefits from free markets in other respects more than the average person. They don't need extra help from governments.<p>Helping minorities by fixing individual prices tends to be inflexible because any change in the underlying economics or social culture has to be to be compensated with new regulation which often doesn't happen in a timely fashion.<p>Preferencial treatment for minorities should, in my view, focus on life and death issues, freedom of expression, legal matters, etc.",1336384085.0

How it works internally is that for images to be processed you create a header (with usual image header info) which contains a pointer to the actual image data. There are two ways to do it: one you create the header and then create the image data separately and the other you create the image all in one go. I ended up in a situation where the image (it was going through a couple of different filtering algorithms) would get processed and be displayed <i>regardless</i> of whether or not I had set the pointer to the image data. That image data was already in memory since it was getting read from disk in a separate step, but there was really no way for the library to know its location in memory. I spent a day trying to sort out what was going on -- and threw my own schedule -- because I had to assume something was seriously wrong and would lead to other unintended consequences. I never did figure out what it was but after a lot of testing I decided it wouldn't cause any other problems (it never did, the library I was writing is still the core of a product I'm selling today).<p>If you don't know it OpenCV is about as mature as a software project can get. It was most likely the best tool for the job I had to tackle. But even with the library's stability and widespread use there was just plain voodoo that set a project I was working on back. Other 3rd party tools can be much worse. I don't do any web stuff but I have had to integrate Facebook Connect into products. Interfacing with Facebook can be a nightmare. Their API changes fairly regularly and the documentation can be a mess. Even using a 4th party, regularly updated, helper library I've seen bugs that took ages to sort out.<p>And that's just talking about integrating 3rd party, hopefully mature, components. I don't care how good you are, writing new code means a lot of testing and debugging. I've never seen new code that didn't introduce some voodoo of its own into a project.",1336382944.0
