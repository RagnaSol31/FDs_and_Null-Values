In fact Mono is actually available for more platforms than QB64 is.<p>Classic VB is Windows only AFAIK though I've had a 100% success rate with VB under WINE. But suggesting VB6 was pretty dumb on my part anyway; aside scripting variants (eg VBA), it's a pretty much a dead language.<p><i>> Also, VB is pretty GUI and event-centric. QBasic is a pretty good local maximum of being quite expressive while still being a strictly procedural language.</i><p>VB.NET supports procedural CLI apps. But if you could equally write an OpenGL / DirectX game procedurally if you wanted (events are there to be used, but you don't have to create event handlers). However I don't really see the point in wanting to avoid using events; he's using a mouse, so it makes sense to have a mouse click event. The code would be a lot cleaner and the interface more responsive than having a looped procedure checking for mouse button states (believe me, I've had to do both - and the one thing I don't miss from writing DOS GUIs in Pascal was having to create a psudo-event wrapper to handle input devices).",1366279000.0

Yes Sony Music could have done the same (maybe they did but I can't remember) but a store with a seemingly random selection of about 25% of pop music doesn't make a great hit in the era of Napster and when they are still pushing DRM (which Steam also uses).<p>I don't believe that as a company with about 25% of the music market could legally impose pricing conditions on it's competitors (Valve may allow flexible pricing but iTunes did not at least at the beginning and I don't believe was such a proportion of the market at the time).,1366278836.0

Though, I myself was not very active on HS and never visited after this. There was one more incident that I couldn't find in my browser history.<p>It's not sth serious but I was very disturbed to see how one guy had raised a valid concern and almost everyone jumped on him with logic like ""this is from a star personality"", ""it was not posted by someone from the company"" and ""one person didn't find it relevant, others did"". The last one was very odd and even more add was the related founder's reaction. The guy (who had originally raised the question) had just mentioned and pointed out the similarity and the he(founder) was like <a href=""http://hackerstreet.in/item?id=23917"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackerstreet.in/item?id=23917</a>.<p>And worst of all, people found it irrelevant when someone wanted to share a simple nice feedback(<a href=""http://hackerstreet.in/item?id=23765"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackerstreet.in/item?id=23765</a>); even forum owner(pd) frowned upon it(well, he was the firs one). And the entire community showed its double standard when it came to someone more successful, known on forum. Sadly the guy(who had first raised the concern) didn't post anything after that and neither the guy whose post was frowned upon.<p>Maybe rightly so, because I guess it was just me and that guy who found it odd or maybe some more people. This doesn't happen on HN. Here are too far many people for one post's fate to be decided by a small circle.<p>Here, if you deserve it, you get it!<p>@prateekdayal: Please understand that I didn't mean any offence if you took any. I had the almost the same questions and if you check my ID there(same as HN) I hardly participated, I was just a lurker but still I found it odd and not well handled. Maybe HS needs to mature and more members with down-voting power needs to be there, which shall certainly take time. 'People known to forum owner' was a remark marked as a 'maybe' and that's what it was. Yes, it did sound like an allegation of some sort(apologies, if it did) but then again it was based upon the behaviour I observed.<p>Thanks for coming here yourself and replying.",1366278818.0
