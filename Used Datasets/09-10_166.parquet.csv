From my perspective money was never a problem. The problem was to find partner who knows how to promote and sell product. Or at least someone who want to learn it. \nIMHO this person is worth its 50%. Or 33% if there are 3 founders (marketing, programmer and graphics designer). Even without any up front money. So this $5000 makes this offer even better.<p>For me this proposition would look better if instead of money it would contains some milestones. At each milestone we will define some metrics and based on this metrics we will decide if we move on or pivot/drop the idea. For example:<p>M1. Agree on problem we want to solve and the way we reach our customers. I would love to change the world not just make money. Can we agree on it? etc.<p>M2. Create and promote MVP. Example metrics: how many people clicked learn more button?<p>Good partner is more worth then invested money. But that's of course my point of view. I don't need money and can spend half my time building the product (The other half need to make living :-) )<p>But I believe for many people it could be great offer. And I wish you best luck.

I could use Go to get proper work done; I probably couldn't in Algol-68.

45,5042027,comment,5037089.0,5041213.0,1,0,jhuni,,,"> <i>What?</i><p>The principal application of C was to build the UNIX MASOS. C gained popularity on UNIX systems because they already had support for the language. The vast majority of C programs use UNIX features that will be obsolete on a SASOS, so running these C programs will come at a performance cost.<p>> <i>You can run C on machines without a MMU, without an OS, or even to implement an OS.</i><p>In my previous post I was referring to C programs which include C standard library files such as stdio.h which will be obsolete because it uses the file system and signal.h which is used for IPC. If a C program uses any header files at all it is obsolete because it should be using functions rather then files as its unit of composition.<p>> <i>What if people want a filesystem?</i><p>As persistent data (data that is independent of the lifetime of the program) is always mapped to a single global virtual address space in SASOS, there will be no need to have a file system. A file system interface can be provided, but it will be just another way of accessing virtual memory.<p>> <i>They can't have one because the machine designer liked ""single address space orthogonal persistence"" better?</i><p>Although eliminating file systems will be enormously advantageous to developers, it will also be equally advantageous to users. Whenever a user of a UNIX system changes an object that user has to save those changes, usually by clicking File/Save in a drop down menubar. An orthogonally persistent system will be more accessible to ordinary users because they won't have to handle the details of saving data to the file system.<p>The user interface expert, Jef Raskins, set out to design a user interface based upon the needs of the user rather then from the needs of software, hardware, or marketing. The product of this search was Archy which is an orthogonally persistent system.<p>The hierarchical nature of modern file systems also isn't ideal from a user interface design perspective. Forcing users to fit their data into a hierarchy is problematic. Using tagging and search will arguably make for an easier to use interface then a file system.<p>> <i>Just because a language is ""dynamic"" doesn't mean it can take advantage of generic ""hardware support for dynamic languages"" to be as fast as highly sophisticated and language-specific VMs like V8 or IonMonkey.</i><p>The V8 virtual machine is implemented with a high degree of sophistication so that it can run large JavaScript programs. There will be no need to waste memory storing such a sophisticated VM in a Lisp machine because all large programs will be written in Lisp instead. JavaScript will only be used for small scripts in web pages, ensuring that users won't fall into the JavaScript trap. In this sense, JavaScript may run somewhat slower without a sophisticated VM, but that performance difference will be irrelevant because the language will only be used for small scripts.<p><a href=""http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html</a>",1357897304.0

This belief is shared by many mindfulness practitioners: that there is an epidemic of overusing the rational mind to distract ourselves from what we are thinking and feeling.  We have a thought, then a feeling, and then what Tolle calls ""the mind"" kicks in primarily to distract us and make us feel better, not to extract new insight (though it does that too sometimes).<p>The word ""thought"" here really means something we intuit, by our main mode of non-rational thinking, which typically strives for accuracy based on past experiences.  Rational thinking, on the other hand, can take us very far from reality, which is what makes it so dangerous, especially since it can be fueled by motivations like obscuring reality!  Awareness is yet a third function.<p>If you are ""observing the machinery"" then you are successfully disidentified with it, which is a big part of Power of Now -- to realize the ""mind"" is not us, meaning we don't control it and we don't have to agree with it or act on it.
