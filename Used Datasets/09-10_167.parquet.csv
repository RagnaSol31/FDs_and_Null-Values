When logging the user in, you should store this information in a cookie: [user_id, login_timestamp, authentication_token = hmac-sha256(nonce, login_timestamp, password_key)]. Then, on every subsequent request, you would verify that the authentication_token matches what you'd expect based on the login_timestamp and user_id that the client has provided. (Substitute this for any equivalent-security scheme and crypto primitives.)<p>Now, if you have such a scheme in place, a secret token would provide no additional security. You really shouldn't be storing session information in cookies, but if you must, you can use a key derived from the nonce to sign the cookie, removing the need for an app-global secret. But really, don't do that, you should use a server side datastore for session information (like shopping carts, etc.).<p>If you do not have such a scheme in place, you app is much more vulnerable to attack. Something based on one global secret token (which by default is checked in to your source code) opens up many more attack vectors that might compromise the security of your app.",1369042541.0

You can only apply for, and enter on a non-immigrant visa if you don't have immigrant intent. If an international student, for example, applies for a green card, this shows immigrant intent and they could find it difficult to renew their student visa or even to re-enter the US after traveling.<p>Obviously this wouldn't be a problem if the green card itself were quickly approved, but the process is bureaucratic and can take years even for people with advanced degrees.<p>H1-B visas, on the other hand are one of the few visa classes that allow ""dual intent"", meaning that while they're non-immigrant visas, H1-B holders are also allowed immigrant intent. Which makes it a good visa to have before starting the green card process, if you want to be able to travel (e.g. to visit family) while your application is pending.",1369040525.0
