For me it ruined much of the experience. \nTake for example payments, they scraped old admob payment system and integrated admob into adsense payments. In effect, I now can`t receive payments by wire, my only option is check (last I checked it is twenty first century).\nSecond, I have money stuck in the old admob. In their help doc there is a statement that all money from the old admob would be issued on regular monthly base but that is not happening. And guess what, you can not contact anyone about it. Only place where humans are answering is admob sdk google forum, and they just say they can not answer about payment issues and that is that. \nThird, from the new admob I received damaged check which bank would not take. I thought, ok, no problem, they will send me another one, but... First you have to wait 60 days (no problem) and fill out a form in their help system which is there just for that purpose (check reissue). That form says that someone will answer the request in 48 hours tops. I filled that form 4th time today, first time about 3 weeks ago and nobody answered, not even an automated response that request is received or something. \nAnd can you pleaseee stop using &quot;Serbia and Montenegro&quot; in the country list. That country split a decade ago and I live in Serbia. I really don`t care, but, when you select Serbia, you require 6 digits zip code, and Serbian zip codes are 5 digits so I must lie about my country. I explained this like 10 times to various places on google websites, help docs, people, etc, but it is still not fixed and I guess it requires less time to fix it than to read this rant here.\nI am kind of tired of this &quot;I don`t give a !@",
