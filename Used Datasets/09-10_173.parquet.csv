You can certainly do modern web dev in a Java stack (we were Struts, Hibernate, Spring, and an internal framework).  It just fought us every single step of the way, and every time we had to do something new (that couldn't be templates off of working code) they'd have to get one of our three best engineers to spend a week fighting the new library into submission.  Sometimes the libraries won.<p>The easiest way I can describe it is that everything you like about e.g. Rails was designed as a specific dig against the Java stack.  I am told Play is less painful.<p>On the plus side: Java devs are plentiful, the library support is worlds deeper than the ruby ecosystem (particular around enterprise-y needs), and it plays well with teams of dozens (which you will probably need).  I honestly think ""restricts your developers terribly"" is not a bug for typical Java projects, since the outsourcing shops contributing lots of our code base would have been even more dangerous if the code didn't restrict what modules thy could break.",1339322146.0

I could implement it over HTTP as a RESTful API or whatever way I see fit and however simple and thin it would be, it is still a way for applications to programmatically interact through an interface, hence, an API.<p>But again, this is not a problem since we can now safely implement interfaces without fear.<p>> <i>Rogue Amoeba's blog post picks apart these inaccuracies like shooting fish in a barrel</i><p>... and (assuming that one thinks they scored) misses the elephant in the room. <i>encrypted AirPlay audio streams</i>. Rogue Amoeba knows about this. Apple knows about this. The only party concealing that fact is Rogue Amoeba, and they're entirely disingenuous about it. Since the very first developments (and really, since their announcement of the feature upon release) people have been wondering about the inclusion of the Apple private key; yet Rogue Amoeba stayed quiet on the subject. What I expected of them was at some point to directly answer the question <i>""did we use the Apple private key?""</i> with <i>""yes""</i> or <i>""no""</i>.<p>Again, whether I put a license or not to use my PGP private key, no one has the right to pick up content encrypted for me. They basically created an eavesdropping piece of code.<p>And this is true for any licensing scheme. If there's no license satisfying my will, I have no right to take it anyway. Rogue Amoeba even goes to admit:<p>> <i>While Apple licenses the ability for hardware manufacturers to play AirPlay audio, there is no such licensing program for software. When we inquired as to the possibility of this type of licensing being available for software manufacturers in the future, we were informed that it was unlikely.</i><p>Then they decided that since there's no license covering that case, they have the rights to build something respecting the AirPlay API (they do) and decrypt data with a stolen private key (they don't). And went on to build it and sell it, get kicked out, complain (rightfully so regarding opacity, laconic answers, and delays), and ignore the most critical part in all subsequent communications. How cool is that?<p>Now the fact that Apple has no explicit licensing scheme for <i>software manufacturers</i> is a blind spot of their part, but who honestly believes that hardware manufacturers implement their AirPlay receiving devices as pure hardware? I bet the licensing terms could apply just as well to pure software endpoints.<p>> <i>Whether or not Apple was right to do this independent of the fact that they were wrong to discredit Rogue Amoeba in an inaccurate way.</i><p>And the same applies to Rogue Amoeba.<p> AirTunes has a HTTP control channel used to negotiate details, AES key exchange via RSA encryption, a remote volume knob, metadata transmission, progress information, and a data channel for audio streaming that can be suspended without closing the stream. <a href=""http://git.zx2c4.com/Airtunes2/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.zx2c4.com/Airtunes2/about/</a>",1339321161.0

Java sits firmly in the stable layer, and so do all of its various web frameworks.<p>As expected for a popular and mature language, Java has a large variety of web frameworks, such as these:<p>Spring MVC, GWT, Struts 2, Wicket, Tapestry, JSF (and other related Faces libraries), Vaadin, Play, Plain old JSP/Servlet<p>Java has no de facto leader in this space, and this partly stems from Java simply not being an ideal language for rapid web development.<p>The former leader of the Struts 2 project, a popular Java-based web framework, had this to say on the subject:<p>""Ive gone over to the dark side :-) and much prefer to develop in Rails -- for the conciseness mentioned above, but also because I dont ever have to do a build or deploy step during my development cycle any more. But you guys and gals need to be reminded that <i>this</i> is the kind of thing you are competing against if you expect to attract Rails developers ... or to avoid even more previously Java web developer defectors like me :-).\nCraig McClanahan, Oct. 23, 2007""(<a href=""http://markmail.org/thread/qfb5sekad33eobh2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://markmail.org/thread/qfb5sekad33eobh2</a>)<p>Java is a compiled language, and as alluded to previously, this means that every time you make a code change to a web application, you have to go through all of these steps:<p>1. Recompile the Java code.\n2. Stop your web server.\n3. Redeploy the changes to your web server.\n4. Start your web server.<p>As you can imagine, this wastes an awful lot of time! Especially when youre making lots of small code changes, such as altering the destinations in a controller or making small changes to the view.<p>If youre a seasoned web developer, youll know that there are some techniques you can use to try and solve this problem. Most of these approaches rely on some sort of ability to apply code changes without stopping and starting the web server, which is also known as hot deployment. Hot deployment can come in the form of replacing all of the resources (such as an entire WAR file) or just a select few (such as a single JSP page). Unfortunately, hot deployment has never been 100 percent reliable, and the web server often still has to perform expensive recompilation of code.<p>If you must use a Java-based web framework, I highly recommend products called JRebel and LiveRebel (<a href=""http://www.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/</a>). JRebel sits in between your IDE and your web server, and when you make source code changes locally, theyre automatically applied to your running web server through some genuinely impressive JVM trickery (LiveRebel is used for production deploys). Its basically hot deployment done right, and these tools are seen as industry standards for solving the hot deployment problem.<p>Generally speaking, Java-based web frameworks dont reliably allow you to have a fast turnaround time for your changes. But that isnt the only concern with Java-based web frameworks. Another factor that slows down rapid web development is the flexibility of the language, and this is where static typing can be a drawback.<p>In the early stages of developing a new product or feature, its often wise to keep an open-ended design (with regards to typing) of the user presentation layer. Its all too easy for a user to demand that a numeric value have decimal precision, or for a list of books to become a list of books and toys instead. Having a statically typed language can be a great hindrance here. If you have to change a list of Book objects into a list of BookOrToy objects, youd have to change your static types throughout your codebase.\nAlthough its true that you can always use the base type as the type of objects in container classes (for example, Javas Object class), this is certainly not seen as a best practicethis is effectively reverting to pregenerics Java.\nAs a result, choosing a web framework thats based on a language in the dynamic layer is certainly a valid option to investigate.",1339321058.0

This thing was planned for a long time, Facebook didn't use it's full advertising capabilities until short before the IPO. 16Billion was just to greedy and too much, even NASDAQ couldn't handle it. Look at the Google IPO, Google knew how good they were and they did everything in the beginning not to sell under price.<p>Edit: I got downvoted for predicting exactly that. Facebook didn't do something obviously illegal, but the lawsuits are coming. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3981888"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3981888</a>",1339320837.0

Dollar bills are a debt of the central bank. Take a look at the Fed balance sheet, you will find that dollar bills are considered a liability from their point of view.<p>This has interesting consequences. If you consolidate the Treasury and the Fed - which is valid from an economics point of view, since they are just different branches of government (no matter what the Fed conspiracy people may tell you) - then both dollar bills and treasury bonds are just different types of debt of the government. It just so happens that dollar bills have zero maturity and zero coupon (interest).<p>Once you understand that, it is only a short step towards asking why the hell everybody is so concerned about the federal government debt. If it was really desired, one could just swap all treasuries for dollar bills - and the only primary effect is that it changes the yield curve for government debt from almost zero everywhere to zero everywhere.<p>I find this fascinating. If you asked a random person (including myself three years ago) what would happen if all the government debt were paid off with paper money, they would tell you - slightly paraphrased - that the world would explode. But when you look into the technical details, you find that it's just this subtle change in the yield curve. So what's going on there?",1339320592.0

For a monetarily sovereign state, government debt is <i>very</i> different from private debt. Private actors can be forced by having debt, monetarily sovereign governments cannot. In my view, it is the responsibility of the government to take on enough debt to make it possible for citizens to be debt-free.<p>It is true that, under current institutional arrangements, the interest paid on government debt is effectively a transfer payment to the owners of that debt (the treasury bonds), which tends to be a transfer from poor to rich, which I view as undesirable.<p>This is easily fixed by changing the institutional arrangements slightly.
