That's pretty true in my experience.<p>Also, there's always that snarky little angle when seeking for something meaningful to do: you're in effect seeking a meaningful life, or just a meaning, for yourself. So there's that selfish aspect there as well. And that sort of implies judgment: you decide it's wrong that other people are wronged; however, the world is often a bit gray and it is gray on that, too. You don't know what these people are going through by living their poor lives and great suffering. And you don't know why. And no matter who it is you can't just go out and decide some people need help: these people need to ask for help themselves, only then they can receive.<p>That's what I think the starting quote means: you can ask for being a helper yourself and then wait how that unfolds in your case. Most likely it's something that comes up in your everyday life, hence the little things with great love. That's where you have the greatest possible leverage to do good because it's your everyday life and you're invested in it yourself as well.",1313315470.0

It's just that nobody's done it yet<p>Really? You should definitely show us how.<p>I've been thinking about the issues of dynamic/static languages for a long time, and haven't yet thought of a unifying design (maybe I'm just stupid).<p>The big difference isn't type inference/dynamic type system, it's the difference between compile-time and run-time. In Go and Haskell, classes are compiled. In Python, classes are created at runtime, so if you wanted type-inference in such a language, it would have to be performed at runtime... Also, proper typing of OO languages is very complicated, see Scala (e.g. sometimes you want the function to return the type of this object, even when it is inherited...).",1313315194.0

The experiment was set up to see how people dealt with a system inherently fueled by some combination of altruism and curiosity.  I personally assume this means that, among other things, it is looking at some measure of morality. Thing of it is, you can't really construct an experiment about morality or something like it without making immorality (or something like it) within the bounds.  (Or, more accurately, you could attempt to but then you'd also be dealing with a measure of how people respond to authority and similar which complicates things.)<p>Secondly, I think I could say just as easily that being an asshole is well within the bounds of US law.  Yet, people tend to respond negatively to people being assholes.  What is allowed and what is ""right"" or ""good"" or whatever are two entirely different topics.",1313315154.0

A commercial company would reply by either cost-cutting, shutting down (parts of) the company, increasing productivity, or finding new revenue streams.<p>The USPS does not have first or second options, and the third on its own only helps if it brings in extra work, which it does not (remember the 'some customers ran away' part?)<p>It all boils down to the fact that the USPS is not operating in a free market. They have huge expenditures that they cannot get rid of. If you have an employee, but no work for him, and cannot fire him, it makes economic sense to take on work that pays less than what the employee costs. Sure, it loses you money, but it loses you less money than not taking on that work.<p>So, that leaves the fourth stream. In e EU, that has seen post offices turned into shops, selling mail-related stuff such as postcards. That may work, but especially in smaller villages, it is easier to outsource the post office tasks to existing shops, rather than trying to compete with them in a market that cannot sustain two shops.",1313315090.0

So you jump to some other project or idea. Exploring various ideas seems very exciting, that's why you feel a bit drained if you spend a lot of time on just one idea.<p>When your ideas are scattered like that, you need to work on polishing them and flushing them out. The best way is either writing about them, or talking to other people about them.

He took advantage of something that was on the honor system and acted dishonorably by violating the conditions under which the card was to be used.

I hope this post doesn't come off as a troll; I am genuinely curious where my beliefs diverge from the majority.<p>I cannot understand why Sam's charity raising has raised such an outrage. Here is why.<p>First, what he did was within the bounds of the experiment. Johnathan provided the Starbucks card to be used in any way people saw fit. Did he take advantage of some flaws within the system? Sure. Did he use it for something that it wasn't expected to be used for? Yes. But that makes him sound closer to a hacker than a thief to me. [1]<p>Second, this outcome is significantly better than what had before been believed when the $100 drops were noticed on the account. Most people (myself included) figured people were just lifting money from the account for their own means. On the moral spectrum, donating money is about as far away as possible from that suspicion.<p>The facebook page also fails to elucidate me.<p>Someone says (paraphrase) ""no one should be able to appoint himself the arbiter of how someone else's money should be spent."" But isn't Jonathan (or perhaps the Starbucks corporation) dictating this by requiring them to put money on a <i>Starbucks Card</i> - not a VISA card, for instance?<p>Another person says (paraphrase) ""Sam is donating other people's money without their consent."" Didn't people give up any control they had over their money by putting it on Jonathan's card in the first place?<p>Or maybe it's just because (paraphrase) ""Sam is flaunting how smart of a hacker he is."" If so, I missed it.<p>To be honest, and unless someone can point out where I am wrong, what Sam has done impresses me more than the initial concept of the card itself. If I had donated $10 to the card and it had instead gone to charity, I would have been fine.<p>[1]: One definition of hacker: ""A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and stretching their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.""
