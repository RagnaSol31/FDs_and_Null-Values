During traditional class, as I recall, your options are roughly these: 1) mess around with something, 2) study or make it look like that.<p>In terms of temporal motivation theory, the utility of messing around is much higher than the utility of boring study. Two ways to fix thiseither lower the utility of messing around, or raise the utility of actual learning.<p>A punishment by teacher (with high enough expectancy) for messing around with classmates or cellphone does the first. Obviously, a book is too boringbut replace it with an iPad and children can now play games while no one notices[0], which makes the utility of messing around go up again.<p>Another, arguably better way would be raising the utility of actual learning relative to messing around with stuff. In other words, make so that children would like to do it themselvesthrough some psychological reward (valuable and close enough temporarily), or by making it an enjoyable process (i.e., immediate reward). It means fixing the system though.<p>[0] Like many of us, in regular day job environments, can (and do) procrastinate with the help of our fancy devices.",1337335159.0

But this isn't going to earn you any favours here.<p>You said in another comment that you're an accountant. Are you a good accountant and do you like accounting? If yes, there's plenty to do on that front. Accounting is something that most people hate and see as being horribly complex. Yet, it's something that all entrepreneur have to do very early on in their business - they just don't have a choice. What about you write about this instead? I'm pretty sure you could end up with something a lot more useful than this ""e-book"".<p>Another tip: don't lie. Don't tell me that I'm going to get a book and then give me a 2.5-page check-list that has less content than an average blog post. Don't tell me that I'm going to ""dominate pitches"" or ""speak their language"" and give me a copied-and-pasted list that anybody interested in raising VC funding would have read a hundred times already.<p>A check-list is a check-list.

Now, before you all start screaming ""Go see a doctor!"", I already did. I've made some changes in my personal life already, but work keeps on being a source of stress.<p>I have problems ""switching off"" after work. I work in a web development company on various projects that all demand my attention. With my boss I have reduced the number of projects I'm working on but it still keeps me occupied after hours.<p>What usually happens is that some sales guy or other non-techie comes to me asking me about future projects or estimates or something that they think is a simple question. They hope for a quick answer not realising that answering their questions would actually involve doing quite a bit of thinking and solving technical puzzles. My geek brain loves puzzles and has a hard time trying not to solve them.<p>When it's only a few things this isn't that much of a problem. I put it in the back of my mind, let it percolate and simmer for a couple of days or weeks and usually after a couple of days I suddenly find a nice solution (for some reason this usually happens in the shower or on the toilet. Don't ask me why). But if I have too many puzzles simmering in the back of my mind I get overloaded leading to some unpleasant physical side effects. Continuing high heart rate and blood pressure, trouble sleeping, anxiety, etcetera. You know the feeling after someone gave you a good scare? Imagine feeling that way all the time. Not fun.<p>I want to learn how to ""switch off"" after work. It's not that I don't enjoy the projects. Generally they are great, involving things I really love to work on, with very interesting technical challenges that I'd love to solve. There's just too many of them. On the doctor's advise I'm currently working half days instead of full days and that sucks. I feel like I'm letting my team mates down.<p>Have you ever been in this situation? How did you get out of it? How do you guys keep from overloading your brains?<p>Thanks in advance for your advise!",1337334007.0

50,3991040,comment,3990972.0,3991007.0,1,0,rjknight,,,"There are two scenarios here.  In the first instance, you're an innocent member of the public who has been arrested for {wearing a hoodie, being the wrong ethnicity, photographing something} and the police take you into custody briefly before letting you go.  In this case, they're probably not hugely interested in the contents of your phone and are just fishing for data.  If they can't get anything from your phone, they'll just let you have it back when they let you go.  Minimal barriers to data extraction should be sufficient here, and the advantage of encryption is that your phone remains usable once you decrypt the data again.  Bear in mind that you're an innocent person who doesn't want to wipe all the data off your computing devices at a moment's notice.<p>In the second scenario, you're a hardened terrorist who has just been caught red-handed selling child pornography in order to fund an international drug deal with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.  In this case, the police will go to great lengths to extract data from your phone, and will force you to hand over encryption keys.  Here you probably want your phone to self-destruct as completely as possible, at the very least wiping all data from it.<p>My point is that the self-destruct option is only a good fit for someone who expects to face a serious attempt at data extraction.

That said, I think that Turkey is in an interesting place right now. Maybe the <i>way</i> they are introducing technology into the classroom is wrong, but at least they are <i>interested</i> in using technology in the classroom. Meanwhile, the US is arguing over the best way to use statistics to decide which teachers to fire.<p>It seems that this same story is playing itself out in a number of areas. Turkey ""gets it"" in terms of science and technology investments, it just doesn't seem to know the best way to go about making those investments. Personally, I prefer this situation to the alternative: knowing exactly how and what to do, but not even bothering to keep a manned spaceflight capability or high-energy particle physics research facility funded.<p>As for what Turkey can do to get on the right track, I think the first thing that needs to happen is the expansion of homegrown technologies. It seems every user group or startup weekend type event I've seen advertised is almost exclusively sponsored and/or run by Microsoft. Turkey would do well to look at a country like Brazil that, while it suffered being behind the times for a while, is now a strong player in the technology sector because it focused on homegrown tech.",1337333180.0
