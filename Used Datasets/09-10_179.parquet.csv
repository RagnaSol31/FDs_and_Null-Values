Problem is that vast majority of population does not live in the SF, NYC, Seattle area so the median of entire US population is not comparable for people who live in these areas. The median metric is especially notorious in eliminating outliers like these areas.<p>Even within these areas, you want to compare your income with median in your closest <i>neighbourhood</i> of about 10,000 people. In most of these neighbourhoods with tech population, $90 would probably place you in bottom 30% bucket. In essence, you will be relatively &quot;poor&quot; and get pushed you out to fat outer areas of community where there are either no good schools, facilities and/or commute is ridiculous.<p>Always look at median of your target neighbour to compare your income, not the national median.",1401011771.0
