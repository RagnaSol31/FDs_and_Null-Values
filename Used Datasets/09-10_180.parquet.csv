So the dynamics are more like that the team that wins is the one that has the most people bet it would win.<p>In general, the problem is not the math but our interpretation of the result. All the result says is that <i>if we change nothing</i>, this is the likely outcome. By interpreting the results to mean merely &quot;this is the likely outcome&quot;, we are depriving people of the opportunity of getting out of local optima. Deciding to coordinate or deciding to have society maintain its Nash equilibria are both <i>political</i> choices -- not mathematical outcomes.",1452416869.0
