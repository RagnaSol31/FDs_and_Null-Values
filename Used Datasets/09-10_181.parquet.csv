Modern memes are telling us  that white rice is almost poisonous, despite the fact that more than half of the world population (almost whole Asia) feed on it.<p>Tibetans, Sherpas and other Himalayan tribes are still rely heavily on cow/nak butter (the main commodity and the source of nutrition) and Tsampa (rusted barley flour) which they consume on a daily basis in the form of so-called Sherpa tea (butter, Tsampa, hot watter, sugar or salt) or in a form of bread-like mass (same ingredients). According to modern memes this is a disastrous diet, but, you see, these people are healthy and happy.<p>I could go on, about various tribes of India or Sri Lanka (mostly rise and veges). The picture will be almost the same. Simple, homemade food and not being a couch potato makes it.<p>There is no problem with traditional foods. The problems are with the food industry and its commercial products which, being aggressively marketed, altered the traditional eating habits.<p>As for myself, I could confirm that especially in high altitudes (in Himalayas) the tribal eating habits, which I follow happily, are the evolved balance for energy storage and intake, according with the harsh conditions, seasons and available food sources. There is no alternative in calories efficiency to the a half-kilo lump of nak butter (just cream, no additions) and a small bag of Tsampa for weeks-long crossing of the ridges in Himalayas.",1429609698.0
