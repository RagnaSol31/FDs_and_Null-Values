I do have some questions as I am working on similar leases with yearly rent increases and lease incentives.<p>The situation is:\nThe 1st six months are free, the 7th to 12th month, there is a partial rent abatement. We also receive moving and tenant improvement allowances.<p>Lease is for 7 years and I straight lined lease expense over the life of the lease. \nMonthly lease expense excluding Amortized lease incentive is $35,640.<p>Minimum lease payment in year 1 is $38,800\nTotal lease incentive approx. $271,000 which is amortized over the life of the lease and equals To $2,988 per month.<p>Since my 1st 6 months are free, what would be my entry in the first 6 months?\nAlso, would my recurring entry be:<p>Dr. Rent expense $35,640\nDr. Deferred asset/lease Incentive $2,988\nDr. Deferred asset.   $672 ( excess payment over expense)\nCr cash.                 $38,800<p>To record the incentive:\nDr. Other receivable. $271k\nDr. ST/ LT deferred liability $271k<p>I need your help to get some perspective on these entries.<p>Tnx",1380877934.0
