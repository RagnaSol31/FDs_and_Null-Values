100,9476402,story,,,10,5,micwallace,Show HN: I just open-sourced my web based POS software â€“ WallacePOS,,"Hi Hacker News,<p>Early last year I decided to build a web based POS solution. A charity I was working with at the time tasked me with finding a affordable POS solution.<p>The system had to support multiple locations at a reasonable price. Unfortunately I was unable to find any software that fit and so after an initial proof of concept, the project was born.<p>I aimed at using the latest technologies used in the browser and had fun working with them (localstorage, websockets, etc), as well as some very tricky but gratifying problem solving.<p>About a year and a half later I feel WallacePOS is ready for source publishing and this week I uploaded it to github under the LGPL.<p>I hope that it may help businesses like my client have a modern and connected POS system for little cost, and also build a community that can extend and improve the system.<p>Checkout the website and demo:<p>https://wallacepos.com/<p>Or fork me on Github!<p>https://github.com/micwallace/wallacepos",1430557499.0

Batteries are important for both data center reliability and as enablers for the efficient application of renewable power. They help bridge the gap between intermittent production, from sources like wind, and the data centerâ€™s constant power demands.
