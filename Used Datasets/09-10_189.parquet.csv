This point in particular has zero to do with mattress quality.<p>This also happened a few years ago in the diamond industry.  Online retailers cut out the expensive jewelry chains with their 1000% markups and sold directly online at cost + 20%.  As diamonds can all be graded and compared accurately we can see how for exactly the same quality you can get something for much less.<p>New models can maintain quality and reduce cost.  It happens all the time.  The main proponents of the price = quality concept are marketers who are really hoping you will pay up.<p>I also find it interesting that one the main critics on this thread happens to be a middle-man who stands to lose his shirt because of T&Ns business model. I feel for you, man.<p>Lastly, I just wanted to congratulate the T&N team on a great success in a crowded space.  Great example of the lean startup. Very impressed also that advertising is $0.
