Yes, Sass is technically superior to Less; it can do a lot of things that Less cannot. That does not mean that you should use Sass over Less.<p>The truth is, for 99% of use cases they are exactly the same. Sass is a bit more mature and it allows more programming, so it is potentially more powerful than Less, but that also allows it to deviate for CSS further, which is not necessarily a good thing if you have to work with people who only know CSS.<p>I personally use Less because it helps me develop faster. Less is implemented in JavaScript, which means it can run in the browser. Less.js' ""watch mode"" is awesome for speeding up development: save your .less stylesheet and the browser immediately shows the new styles. This is something SASS cannot do and.<p>Finally, to correct some factual errors in the article: Less <i>does</i> allow some programming, loops etc. It's just incredibly awkward and barely useful, but you can use JavaScript (I used that to make this: <a href=""https://github.com/micheljansen/dynamicgif.less"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/micheljansen/dynamicgif.less</a>).

Even if you could adequately measure their 'teaching quality', you might miss factors that contribute to the success of the school as a whole.<p>And measuring 'teaching quality' is not a simple as counting ad click-throughs. Education is at least as much about helping people learn about their role in the world, as it is about learning facts, concepts, and tools. Just measuring the increase of students' scores on standardized tests misses a lot of the impact teachers have on their students' minds.<p>Nobody in his right mind would judge a developer solely on the amount of features he has implemented during the previous year, but also on how robust and maintainable the code is. \nI you want to take these factors into account, you have to actually read the code, understand it, and ideally talk to the developer about it.\nUnless you do this, you can not judge the quality of the code.<p>The same holds true for evaluating teachers, imho.

It's strong enough to do a pull-up, fast enough to catch a ball, and every joint incorporates a six-axis force-torque sensor. It's definitely strong enough to do damage. Of course, that just means that Kuka loaded it up with safety systems. The FT sensors let it know exactly how much force it's applying, and if they read too high a value the brakes slam on. I've never worked with those arms before, but I'd bet that there's a similar system completely in hardware. You'll also notice that the operator's left hand and the entire back half of the room are never seen; there are at least two emergency stop buttons there, probably more, and one of them is wired directly the arm's power supply.<p>Really, though, all that engineering is of secondary interest.
