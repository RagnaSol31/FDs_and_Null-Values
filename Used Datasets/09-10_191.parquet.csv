5,3851921,comment,3848583.0,3851776.0,2,0,gavanwoolery,,,"Yes, to answer your question, there are many ways to go about implementing it, but here is how I do it:<p>In reality, you have one knowledge base, which is simply a set of facts/rules about the world.  For example...<p>a) berries are fruit\nb) red fruit is good (+1 score)\nc) green fruit is bad (-1 score)\nd) enemies are dangerous\ne) eating while in danger is bad (-10 score)\nf) eating while full is bad (-2 points)<p>In a finite state machine, you would have to have several combinations of state (are berries present? are enemies present? are you full? etc).  Say (for argument's sake) you have 5 possible states (binary).  In a FSM, this would have 32 possible permutations of the states, which all must have corresponding actions associated with them.  In a motivation based system, it simply evaluates each state individually, and adds up the points.  It chooses to pursue the state that gives the most points. So, here, that would be eating red fruit while enemies are not present.<p>The way prolog-like systems work, the computer does not have to have ANY idea what food or hunger or anything like that is -- it can be completely oblivious to abstract concepts.  All it is doing, in essence, is (searching for and) matching strings.  Those strings are the identifiers used for classes (or instances) of game world objects, NPCs, etc.  So if you gave an NPC a motivator (kill(enemy) = +10 points, Bob = enemy, get_caught_doing(kill) = -100 points), it will find the best way to kill Bob while avoiding negative consequences.  This is (obviously) metacode, and the actual implementation would require better organization and more explicit syntax.<p>Make sense?",1334656681

Your veins get bigger, your brain gets more oxygen, your cells get more food and evacuate waste much much better(read about the lymph system), your sugar is used and not converted into fat, your insulin gets lower level(you feel less anxious)... there are entire books about the details, but long story short, your life improves and you feel better, you work much better.<p>When you work sitting down, your body remains in a passive state, it has to do with blood pressure that change a lot when you stand up(proportional to height from your toes). The body ""reacts"" to standing up as it is a signal to activate for daily activity.<p>We are made for moving a little every day, but no so much.

Respecting and protecting human dignity is the highest commandment of the German Basic Law. People can only live in dignity if their basic needs are met and their social participation is assured. In our monetary economy, this requires an income. If an income can only be achieved through work, we must assure full employment to protect all peoples dignity. This is why full employment has been a major goal of our economic policy in the past. There are two paths by which we try to achieve this goal: Through economic measures which aim to create jobs or through publicly financed jobs with the main goal of securing peoples livelihood. These are both detours which require substantial public funding. If public funds are used, however, this must be done as efficiently as possible. Since the goal is to secure an income and a livelihood for everyone, this income should be guaranteed directly to each individual. Only this way can we protect the dignity of all people without exception. Just as we provide public security, traffic routes and large parts of the educational system without a direct compensation, a secure livelihood must also become a part of our infrastructure. We Pirates are convinced that the overwhelming majority of people will seize the chances provided by a secure livelihood to develop their full economic and social potential. A secure livelihood creates room for self-determined education, research and economic innovation. It enables volunteerism, e.g., taking care of relatives and children, independent journalism, political activity or creation of art and free software. This benefits our entire society. This is why the Pirate Party supports solutions which guarantee unconditionally a secure livelihood and social participation while sustaining and enabling economic freedom. We want to prevent poverty, not prosperity.<p>(from <a href=""http://www.piratenpartei.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/parteiprogramm-englisch.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.piratenpartei.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/parte...</a>)",1334654157
