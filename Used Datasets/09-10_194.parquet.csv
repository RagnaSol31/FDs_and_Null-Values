1,4442838,story,,,1,0,grayprog,Ask HN: Will other social networks follow Twitter's 3rd-party restrictions?,,"Twitter has created a precedent of a previously very developer-friendly service switching to a position where 3rd-party clients are strongly discouraged and limited.<p>I wonder if you think that Facebook, which might also be pressed for higher revenues given its lackluster IPO, will also follow suit and start limiting what 3rd-party apps can do?<p>What about other ""free"" social services? Instagram? Pinterest?<p>I believe that services like Flickr won't impose this limitation since they provide paid accounts to their customers, which is their source of income.<p>The free and popular social network services are the ones that I'm worried about.",1346147962.0

Do what feels right.<p>Opening all of the external links on your recruitment page in a new tab feels right to me. If I want to learn about the company that acquired you, or ""Ali's PhD adviser"", it's probably because I'm really interested in your company and am going to come back to your site after visiting these external sites. Therefore it'd be easier to just close the tab rather than pressing back a bunch of times.<p>On the other hand, in the case that you're trying to drive traffic away from your site, or you don't think they would want to come back for a given use case, I'd say open in the same page.",1346147824.0

9,4442830,comment,4441913.0,4442257.0,7,0,tfb,,,"I've actually been working on exactly this (but considerably more powerful and in-depth than Pipes/IFTTT) for quite some time now (almost 2 years, on and off).  It was originally designed to appeal to non-programmers; and I would have released it months ago but decided to rewrite nearly everything to make the code as modular/flexible/easy-to-learn as possible for developers (both newbie and seasoned).<p>Before I link to it, I'd like to apologize for overly generic descriptions currently on the site.  I whipped together the entire site in a few days not knowing the exact direction I wanted to take the software, so I left everything pretty vague; I really just wanted <i>some</i> content that at least somewhat described my ideas.  I'll put the link at the bottom of this comment so you read all this first.<p>From a technical standpoint, this is currently where I'm at with it:<p>- Users create a myriad of widgets that can ""interact"" with each other; the fullscreen version of Loggur consists of ""layouts"" of widgets, while the mobile version of Loggur lets you access widgets individually in typical mobile app fashion<p>- Databases are incredibly easy to create; just add fields to a widget and specify their relationships to one another<p>- All kinds of special extensions included by default, like automatic importing of various data sources, scraping of websites, cron jobs, PDF report generation, emails, sms notifications, triggers, and graphing<p>- Everything is taggable for reuse, from the apps themselves to widgets to components to elements to lists and to the data associated with all of the above; you can either ""mirror"" or ""clone"" any one of these parts in another app/widget/component by doing a quick search for tags (or if you know the exact path to the part, just enter that); so for example, if you really liked what someone else has made and wanted to reuse parts of it in your own app, you'd do a quick search for it, clone it, and modify it to suit your needs, saving a lot of time<p>- Data associated with apps can be any combination of public/private, singular (your individual profile), and/or group-specific; you can quickly/immediately switch between views of each<p>- Permissions on everything; specify who can view and/or edit apps, widgets, components, elements, lists, and/or data<p>- Appearances are somewhat customizeable and will become much more so at some point; customization currently consists of the basics like colors, backgrounds, and sizes; apps are designed to be scalable to any screen resolution (think large dashboards ;)<p>- Each one of the pieces outlined above (widgets, components, etc.) can be embedded on your own site(s) through small snippets of code<p>- Data associated with apps is easily accessible, currently only available in JSON but if for some reason other formats are requested in high numbers, I might do that<p>- Users can toggle the ability to view app/data updates as they happen in realtime; they can also invite each other (or a Loggur dev if they need help) to take turns using/building an app<p>- Regarding the mention above about rewriting the project to be more modular/flexible for developers, I felt doing this was 100% necessary/worth it because it occurred to me a few months ago that the best approach to make this succeed in the long term is to make this a legitimate platform (buzzword, sorry!) where developers can quickly/easily make and share awesome extensions and be rewarded (paid) for their work<p>Check it out (sign up for it ;) here and remember to ignore the bad, vague descriptions currently on the site: <a href=""http://loggur.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://loggur.com</a>",1346147789.0

23,4442816,comment,4413965.0,4432436.0,1,0,EnderMB,,,"Like many students, I studied at a modest university with what I was told was a good CS programme.<p>It turns out that the reason it's good is because it teaches students how to become the next batch of Java and PHP developers for local businesses. The actual CS content was minimal and bizarrely a lot of classes from the ""CS school"" were out of bounds to my CS degree, because learning XML was more important than Discrete Math.<p>I spent half a year studying at a top 5 university and the difference was overwhelming. The facilities weren't much better, but the lecturers were far more helpful and the content was not watered down. Perhaps it was because it was a Masters programme, but the lecturers were happy to help, even when you were hopelessly stuck. Sadly due to money reasons I couldn't stay, but I'll definitely return to get my Masters when I finish at my current job.<p>It still amazes me that a lot of students don't opt to take internships during the summer. I worked for eight weeks after each academic year and everything I picked up was invaluable. The best part about it was learning what you were good at and what you sucked at. It taught me languages I'd never learn at university and it taught me exactly what is expected of a developer in the real world. Most importantly, I was employable right off the bat. My degree almost didn't matter because the skills I had gained through these groups of eight weeks were what got me my job.<p>I appreciate that you are constrained in what you can do, but I do feel that a practical approach to CS and general trade Computing is less than perfect in an academic setting. If possible, would you be able to highlight the exact problems you faced when trying the typical theoretical route?",1346147350.0

Even the straight Sig's are sold out (there were only 1200 allocated to North America).<p>The regular production model that this is based on is the Model S Performance.  It's identical, except it has different color and interior options (because its not limited edition).  That runs ~$85k after the Federal Rebate, which makes it cheaper than the BMW M5 (a similar competitor in terms of performance, if not practicality).<p>The standard MS85 (the big battery) clocks in at ~$69,900 and is a bit slower than the MSP, but still as fast as a 550i GT, which is basically the same price and a similar car in terms of features.<p>There are cheaper options, but most buyers will be paying $60k and up for the MS60 (few seem to be interested in the MS40) so I can see how that can generate some sticker shock.<p>But hundreds of thousands of cars in this price range get sold in the U.S. every year and the Model S is a bargain in that segment, both in terms of its MSRP and especially in terms of its 5 year total cost of ownership.<p>This is not the Leaf that costs twice as much as its competitors.  Model S easily will save its owners $10k+ over 5 years (and likely much more).

I'm sure there are other examples of people doing stupid stuff with steroids.

Poor countries cannot afford the advanced drug development programs that rich countries can. By banning PEDs they can compete fairly.

You could even add self-preservation routines, and we will call it an amazing robot that knows its own value.<p>I disagree.  Much science fiction (for example Asimov) deals with the social positions of intelligent robots.  I would assume, based on the number of people that find the arguments these works make compelling or at least interesting enough to buy them, that if such robots <i>did</i> exist, they would quickly gain at least a small faction of human political supporters.  Eventually, through normal human social and political processes, our society and culture would hopefully reach some kind of position on what exactly makes something morally equivalent to humans, in a way that assigns some definite and logically consistent moral status to these robots.<p>> Similarly, I believe that emotional response is the reason why humans agree that it is not correct to destroy babies, but that some find it fine to destroy embryos.<p>It's probably true that emotional responses are a big part of the reason for much of the support behind most laws and policies, from the least controversial (murder is illegal) to the most (abortion, Obamacare, death penalty, affirmative action, welfare...).  But that doesn't mean we can't or shouldn't come up with abstract intellectual justifications for them.<p>> Divorcing my emotions from every decision making process would just be disgusting...<p>Emotions are basically heuristics which the human brain has evolved.  They quickly give you guidelines for how you should act in a given situation without wasting valuable time and intellectual effort creating an elaborate argument as a justification of the obvious.<p>Emotions are usually right, but sometimes they lead us astray.  And we're at a complete loss when we have to make a law that goes either one way or the other on something, but different people in our society have different emotional responses that lead them to different positions on the issue.<p>And besides, emotions can lead to things like racism or Nazism if followed blindly.  (Godwin's Law, I know.)<p>That's where debate and argument come into play.<p>In a good debate, your empathy should let you experience the emotions on both sides of the issue, freeing your brain to decide which argument has a good logical structure and is adequately supported by facts.<p>Once you've decided, you should try to partially (but not totally! -- your brain can be wrong too!) suppress your empathy for the losing side and encourage your empathy for the winning side.  You can actually train your emotions -- basically calibrating your heuristics to agree with your intellectual decisions, so in the future you can remember your position on the issue in your gut, without having to remember and fully reconstruct the argument you made.  Yeah, I've found that hacking my own brain is awesome :)<p>By the way, using emotional heuristics as a shortcut is something I relied on in my <i>reductio</i> point against using emotions as your sole means of political decision-making -- your emotions immediately tell you that racism and Nazism are bad things, because you've been trained to think of them that way.  While you can probably come up with a sound argument that racism and Nazism are bad, your emotions tell you those are bad things without you having to consciously construct or remember a justification of why they're bad.  So you can immediately sense that the structure of my argument -- ""relying blindly on emotions without consulting reason is bad because it leads to bad things"" -- is sound, without having to go into an entire sub-argument about whether racism and Nazism are good or bad, and why, and whether the logical structure of the sub-argument is okay, and mentally fact-checking the facts cited by the sub-argument against what you know of the history of Hitler and World War II and slavery and Jim Crow and Martin Luther King...and then <i>more</i> sub-sub-arguments about fundamental moral questions like whether genocide is morally okay, or whether slavery is morally okay, or whether it's morally okay to treat people badly based on a certain set of genetic traits without actually enslaving them...without those emotional shortcuts to help us out, we'd never be able to communicate moral ideas efficiently or make moral decisions fast enough for them to matter in a fast-moving real-life situation.<p>(FYI, I suspect this feedback mechanism is what Terence Tao was talking about when he discussed how mathematicians train themselves to quickly decide whether something is true or false without constructing an airtight proof [1].)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Mathematics/What-is-it-like-to-have-an-understanding-of-very-advanced-mathematics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Mathematics/What-is-it-like-to-have-an-...</a>",1346145051.0

Work 'flow' is maintained as you go from a call to another without distractions like blog reading, meetings, tweeting, facebooking and other stuff.<p>These days I miss all these. When I look back at my call center days I just thank myself to have gone into that industry first before software. None of colleagues I know ever managed to miss their targets back then.<p>Software world is plagued with desires for lesser meetings, distraction and helps to beat procrastination.<p>Back in my call center days I didn't even know the words 'procrastination', 'distractions' etc. My mom was a teacher and Dad a cab driver- Incidentally I've never seen them talk about things either. I hardly remember my mom taking any work back home.",1346144417.0
