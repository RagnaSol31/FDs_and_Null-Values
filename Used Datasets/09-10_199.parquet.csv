This position was open to anyone else on the planet, and Uber chose the talented people at CM. “Uber screwed every robotics researcher who doesn’t work at CM” I’m not sure I follow your logic on that part, mind expanding?. “Uber handed the position to their preferred group rather than using the free market”, the free market is by definition people consensually transacting with each other. Uber’s preferred group is their choice out of all the robotics engineers on the entire planet, and using their best judgement they offered a position to this particular group of people, and they consensually accepted.

With the invention of the cotton gin production increased greatly as one of the major limiting factors had been removed by the invention of the gin. This lead to a land rush for cotton cultivation; the Alabama Fever. Now the limiting factor was farm hands; this lead to a big increase in the slave trade.<p>Obviously there was a slave trade prior to the invention of the cotton gin (1793, well after the Declaration of Independence (US)), but the significant growth of the slave trade in the US occurred after the invention of the cotton gin (which lead to the massive growth of the cotton trade; especially in the US southern states as they had a better climate for cotton growth).",1432633885.0

Instead of using laptops, they wear their computers on their bodies, broken up into separate modules that hang on the waist, on the back, on the headset. They serve as human surveillance devices, recording everything that happens around them. Nothing looks stupider; these getups are the modern-day equivalent of the slide-rule scabbard or the calculator pouch on the belt, marking the user as belonging to a class that is at once above and far below human society. They are a boon to Hiro because they embody the worst stereotype of the CIC stringer. They draw all the attention. The payoff for this self-imposed ostracism is that you can be in the Metaverse all the time, and gather intelligence all the time.</i> (Snow Crash, Chapter 15)",1432630892.0
