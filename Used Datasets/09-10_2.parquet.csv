A sweeping statement like ""[The U.S.] is directly or indirectly responsible for every war in the last 60 years"" doesn't even relate to this particular topic.

But along with it comes a heavy price tag.So do you have any suggestions for having such 'high fidelity'[if I am allowed to use this expression] images through other programming languages?Do you know of any such good graphic libraries? How does Matlab do it, can we get any hints from that?\nHaving such a library and incorporating in standard C,C++ or Perl programs will save the money yet will be a good bargain.<p>Suggestions...<p>Thank You",1223802385

What will being afraid gain you? NOT A DAMN THING! What does <i>not</i> panicking get you? Ask the people who aren't. It gets you lots of money and opportunity. Many people have already made hundreds of thousands of dollars by shorting pretty much any stock possible. Many companies are waiting for their competition to start laying off tons of staff and making deep cuts to spending so they can speed ahead by making smart choices and spending money where it can put them ahead.<p>From: <i>Economy is booming! Credit is free! Leverage everything! Next quarter will be awesome!</i><p>To: <i>Economy is destroyed! Take all your money and put it under your pillow! Sell the house! Expect to be poor!</i><p>Just two different forms of compulsory reactions that have a complete lack of foresight.<p>The act of making good financial decisions has not changed. Minimizing both debt and overspending has always been the <i>right</i> thing to do. I have zero debt and as close to zero excess possessions as is possible without living in a log cabin in the woods. I'm not going to change a damn thing except possibly spend more money because stupid fear-mongering like this will create all sorts of opportunity for people who can see the forest for the trees.<p>Why something like a recession would inspire <i>fear</i> in anyone is a complete mystery to me. There's nothing you can do about it so stop being afraid and stop spreading fear as a viable option. Instead, sit down, take a deep breath, realize that this isn't the ""end of the world as we know it,"" and move on with your life. Jesus, you people sound like a whining, crying broken fucking record. All this recession has caused me to ""feel"" is pissed off constantly.<p>This argument sounds like this, except not hilarious because you're <i>serious</i>: <a href=""http://video.yahoo.com/watch/2184997/6808646"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.yahoo.com/watch/2184997/6808646</a>",1223802242
