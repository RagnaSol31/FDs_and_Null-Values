Your brain timestamps these experiences and you can see a lot of activity in a given period of time. As you get older, you end up doing a lot of routine things and there are relatively fewer new experiences. As you look over a given period of time, you see a lot less activity. This is what I've come to believe is the basis for the universal phenomenon of the perception of accelerated time.<p>The solution is to break your routine. For me, the subjectively slowest passing of time is when I'm doing a lot of new stuff and haven't formed a routine around it. But if you're working a 9 to 5 kind of job you end up doing the same shit every day and every week and every month. Pretty soon you take notice and discover that another year has gone by. So do your best to avoid routine. Or if that's not practical (hey, we all need to make a living) then fill your non-work hours with new experiences and new learnings.

I went to FARS (<a href=""http://www.nhtsa.gov/FARS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhtsa.gov/FARS</a>) and queried accident causes for 2011.  42% of the accident causes start with the word ""motorist"".  Many of the other causes would also simply not exist in a world without motor vehicle traffic, e.g., ""Bicyclist Ride Through - Sign Controlled Intersection"" -- this means running a stop sign, and it isn't something that would kill you in a post-apocalyptic world.  In fact, the only cause I can see which is clearly not related to the presence of motor vehicles are the categories ""head-on: bicyclist"" and ""head-on: unknown"".  When I click on cases with causes listed as ""Bicyclist Ride Out"" or others like that, I see a form that lists a motor vehicle as being involved.<p>I think you're missing the biggest point here, and that is the fact that biking burns less calories per mile than walking does.

So if your question is about what I think about object oriented programming, I sort of changed my mind over that. I wrote a an article, a blog thing, years ago - Why object oriented programming is silly. I mainly wanted to provoke people with it. They had a quite interesting response to that and I managed to annoy a lot of people, which was part of the intention actually. I started wondering about what object oriented programming was and I thought Erlang wasn't object oriented, it was a functional programming language.<p>Then, my thesis supervisor said ""But you're wrong, Erlang is extremely object oriented"". He said object oriented languages aren't object oriented. I might think, though I'm not quite sure if I believe this or not, but Erlang might be the only object oriented language because the 3 tenets of object oriented programming are that it's based on message passing, that you have isolation between objects and have polymorphism.<p>Alan Kay himself wrote this famous thing and said ""The notion of object oriented programming is completely misunderstood. It's not about objects and classes, it's all about messages"". He wrote that and he said that the initial reaction to object oriented programming was to overemphasize the classes and methods and under emphasize the messages and if we talk much more about messages then it would be a lot nicer. The original Smalltalk was always talking about objects and you sent messages to them and they responded by sending messages back.<p>But you don't really do that and you don't really have isolation which is one of the problems. Dan Ingalls said yesterday (I thought it was very nice) about messaging that once you got messaging, you don't have to care where the message came from. You don't really have to care, the runtime system has to organize the delivery of the message, we don't have to care about how it's processed. It sort of decouples the sender and the receiver in this kind of mutual way. That's why I love messaging.<p>The 3 things that object oriented programming has it's messaging, which is possibly the most important thing. The next thing is isolation and that's what I talked about earlier, that my program shouldn't crash your program, if the 2 things are isolated, then any mistakes I make in my program will not crash your program. This is certainly not true with Java. You cannot take 2 Java applications, bung them in the JVM and one of them still halts the machine and the other one will halt as well. You can crash somebody else's application, so they are not isolated.<p>The third thing you want is polymorphism. Polymorphism is especially regarding messaging, that's just there for the programmer's convenience. It's very nice to have for all objects or all processes or whatever you call them, to have a printMe method - ""Go print yourself"" and then they print themselves. That's because the programmers, if they all got different names, the programmer is never going to remember this, so it's a polymorphism. It just means ""OK, all objects have a printMe method. All objects have a what's your size method or introspection method.""<p>Erlang has got all these things. It's got isolation, it's got polymorphism and it's got pure messaging. From that point of view, we might say it's the only object oriented language and perhaps I was a bit premature in saying that object oriented languages are about. You can try it and see it for yourself.""<p>It depends a lot on how one defines OO, but in this regard he has -- or at least he has given some thought for it.",1360662220.0

Just reduced functionality and wasted screen real estate for the sake of looking ``cool'' to people with crappy taste.</i><p>I strongly disagree; where apps are emulating the sounds of  particular pieces of musical hardware (which plugins frequently are) there's a distinct plus in having the same layout as the emulated device.<p>While there's a lot of value in providing more direct controls in this context (eg envelopes, EQ curves, and so forth), many of these are not ideal for performance (as opposed to composition) because they either constrict the performer by requiring use of a mouse, or provide insufficient tactile feedback because of the limitations of glass. Despite the limitations of abstraction, knobs, sliders, and buttons still work incredibly well for physical performance - hence the popularity of generic MIDI controllers which map to virtual controls in the software plugins.<p>Now it's also true that one could use physical controls to manage the sort of manipulations that are hard to abstract in hardware while being relatively easy to do in software, such as additive or granular synthesis; and there have been a few applications that combine excellent sonic potential with excellent UX (such as Borderlands Granular [1] or AudioGL [2] but making the most of these requires a good deal of domain knowledge that makes them inaccessible to other musicians.<p>I eventually (mostly) stopped using software plugins, but not because  of dissatisfaction with the UX paradigm; I just went back to using hardware. I like having ~100 physical controls, plus my deck looks like the Enterprise :-)<p>1. <a href=""http://www.borderlands-granular.com/app/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.borderlands-granular.com/app/</a><p>2. <a href=""https://www.audiogl.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.audiogl.com/en/</a> BTW this seems like an ideal  excuse for an Oculus Rift.<p>PS in general I hate skeumorphism and strongly prefer flat design...but I think there's much more justification for it in domains like this, not least because one is often blending a mix of old and new technology in music production; it's not unusual to combine digital aduio manipulation with analog or acoustic sources and treatments.",1360661809.0

We were VERY lucky from the start and quickly had a baby placed in our home on the ""adoption"" track rather than ""reunification"".

In fact, during this time the state considered us foster parents and we got a small subsidy every month.<p>If you have more time than money, the foster care route is definitely a good option.
