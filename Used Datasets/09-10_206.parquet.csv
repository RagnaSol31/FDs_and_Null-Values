2,3670351,comment,3667049.0,3670109.0,5,0,snprbob86,,,"It's about writing software which is simpler and more flexible.<p>If you write a traditional shared-nothing web app client with a traditional bag-o-sprocs database server, you'll probably be good as long as your workload doesn't change much. Assuming your write volume never exceeds that of a single (as beefy as necessary) server (which seems to be working out so far for Hacker News!) then you're ok.<p>However, products/services evolve and requirements change.  Let's assume, for example, that you want to do some heavy duty number crunching. This number crunching involves some critical business logic calculations. Some of those calculations are in sprocs, but some of them are in your application code's native language. How do you offload that work to another server? You may have to juggle logic across that sproc/app boundary back and forth. It's pretty rigid; change is hard.<p>You can think of Datomic as a way of eliminating your sproc language and moving the query engine, indexes, and data itself into your process. Basically, you get everything you need to write your own database server. Furthermore, you can write specialized database servers for specialized needs... as long as you agree to allow a single Transactor service to coordinate your writes.<p>Back to the big number crunching. You've got the my-awesome-app process chugging along & you don't want to slow it down with your number crunching, so you spin up a my-awesome-cruncher peer & the data gets loaded up over there. Now you have the full power of your database engine in (super fast) memory and you can take your database-client-side business logic with you!<p>Now let's say you're finding that you're spending a lot of CPU time doing HTML templating and other web-appy like things. Well, you can trivially make additional my-awesome-app peers to share the work load.<p>You can do all this from a very simple start: One process on one machine. Everything in memory. Plain-old-java-objects treated the same as datums. No data modeling impedance mismatch. No network latency to think about. You can punt on a lot of very hard problems without sacrificing any escape hatches. You get audit trails and recovery mechanisms virtually for free.<p>Again, all this assumes the write-serialization trade offs are acceptable. Considering the prevalence and success of single-master architectures in the wild, that's not a hugely unacceptable tradeoff. Furthermore, the append-only model may enable even higher write speeds than something like Postgres' more traditional approach.<p>I hope my rant is helpful :-)",1331027955.0

There are plenty of people who see the obvious problems that for instance patents in the health industry cause yet don't want to remove all regulation or government influence in the industry. For my own views of the FDA specifically, I think it's important to have an agency whose word the public can trust that a particular drug or whatever is ""safe"". But such an agency doesn't have to be public, and in any case its power should closer resemble the ESRB's power rather than the FDA's current power (which unless I missed something over the past decade has included the power to arrest anyone at gunpoint who tries to sell an orange on the premise that it prevents a disease like scurvy).<p>Since you did ask it, this rhetorical question does have an interesting answer you're probably not aware of:<p>> What next, should we buy and sell the right to vote?<p>This seems to be working pretty well for corporations.
