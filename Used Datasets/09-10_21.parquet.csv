4,703382,comment,703368.0,703368.0,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Is there a print link so we don't have to register?<p>Random stab at why this might be the case:<p>If a company has really nasty books and more liabilities than assets, someone who can assume all those can get it almost for free. I'll give a baseball analogy for illustrative purposes (the business of sports is a really interesting place to analyze business because it's a closed system - every win comes at the expense of another team, and it's a zero sum game. So it's far more ruthless than other forms of business). Baseball:<p>Currently, baseball teams are hurting in this economy. Many teams signed overpriced player contracts during the boom, and now they're in trouble. One such team with some bad deals who aren't really in contention for the playoffs is the Toronto Blue Jays. They play in the same division as the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, so they've got a very hard time of competing. Their team is just nowhere near good enough.<p>So right now, they're thinking of trading some of their good, expensive, older players for younger, cheaper players who still have to grow and improve to really be good. Since they're not going anywhere right now, they'd save money and be better in the future. A team with more resources who wants to win now could think it gets them over the top.<p>Toronto's got one of the top 5 pitches in baseball: Roy Halladay. He's really amazing. He's due about 8 million dollars this year, 15 million next year, and then he's a free agent - gone from Toronto. Toronto won't contend this year or next year, so if they can save that $23 million and get a few young, good players for him, they'd love to trade him.<p>They've also got some really bad deals. The worst is Vernon Wells, who is due $102 million from 2010 to 2014. They signed his deal after the best year of his career, and he promptly got hit with an injury. He plays bad defense now, and is a mediocre hitter. His deal is arguably the worst in baseball. He's not worth even half of what he's going to be paid over the next five years.<p>For a team to trade for Halladay alone, they'd have to pay a hell of a lot. You'd be looking at trading 4-6 good young prospects, that a team would have for 6 years at short money. You'd expect 2-3 of them to become regular players for very cheap, and maybe one star out of the deal. All for 1.5 years of Halladay. (But he is that good - trading for him greatly increases the chance of a team winning the championship)<p>But if a team was willing to take Vernon Wells' terrible deal with Halladay, they might only have to give up 1 good prospect and another so-so prospect. Toronto might even kick in $20 million into the deal to offset some of Wells' bloated salary.<p>The lesson? You can get good assets (Halladay) at a huge, huge discount if you take toxic liabilities (Wells' contract) with them. Toronto's got a couple other bad deals too - if a team was willing to take two bad deals plus Halladay, they wouldn't have to send very much back at all. If a team or company thinks it can get a bit more valuable out of the liabilities and potential problems, or get more out of the assets than the current owner, you can really get a steal in a deal like this. But it really is a risky proposition.",1247565293

New York's funny for me, because I did all my working, living, and visiting of NYC only in the last five years. I'm old enough to remember hearing of New York as a dirty, dangerous place, but I never experienced any of that outside of movies like Coming to America. I talk with older relatives about spending time in Harlem, in Queens, in the Meatpacking District, and they're like, ""New York?! Be careful!"" And my reaction was, ""...umm, it's one of the safest cities in America."" People don't believe it.<p>IIRC, Freakonomics had a chapter talking about the reduced crime in New York. It's been a few years since I read it, but I think Friedman's conclusion was that the reduction in crime had less to do with the broken windows policy and more to do with the fact that NY tripled their uniformed officers in that timeframe. Uniformed officers walking around an area is one of the largest deterrents of crime anywhere.

21,703363,story,,,2,0,kaens,Ask HN: Setting up an internal development environment for a small company?,,"Firstly, apologies if this is something that is easily googleable - if it is, I\nhave been unable to discover the correct keywords to search for.<p>Here's the situation: I'm currently the only coder for what could be considered\na startup in the UK. We've been developing a web-app for use in a specific\nindustry that makes peoples jobs a lot easier, and although up until now we've\nbeen bootstrapping, money is starting to roll in.<p>As such, we're going to be looking to hire a few more coders in the near\nfuture. In addition, we've got a few more ideas that we'd like to get started on\nin the near future.<p>Since it's just me at the moment, development process is pretty simple. We're\ncurrently a linux shop, and our current product is written in Python. We (I) use\ngit, and we have a trac install as well.<p>This is all well and good, but the way we're doing things right now kinda\ndepends on me knowing the entire stack. If and when we bring more people in, I\ndon't want to end up either putting people in a position where they need to know\nhow everything is set up to get anything done, or in a position where I've\nhacked together a bunch of shell scripts for the purposes of trying to\nstreamline some stuff.<p>So here's what I'd like some advice on, and what I'd ideally like to set up:<p>Firstly, we'll need a network. New developers should be able to start working\nwith tools that they're comfortable with as quickly as possible. I prefer a\nlinux environment for development, but I'd prefer not to mandate it. Ideally,\nI'd like to find a way to set up a network of mixed-os machines that all get\nautomatically backed up over the network. I know that there are multiple ways of\naccomplishing this, but I'm not too familiar with any of them, or their benefits\n/ drawbacks. I don't want to dictate editors, or OSs. I'd prefer not to dictate\nas much as possible as far as programming languages go (but frankly, this would\nprobably be more of a function of the other developers than not).<p>Secondly, if we're going to be having multiple projects going on, possibly in\nparallel, I'd like to find a way to streamline the creation of all the stuff\nthat needs to be done to support those. Creation of a bugtracker instance,\nsource code repository, commit access, etc. Something where we can see progress\nmade on individual projects from a central location, and where we can create a\nnew project in (preferably) a small number of steps - mostly giving it a name,\nand clicking a button. We're not planning on focusing on one ""type"" of project,\neither - our current project is a web-app, but we have some ideas for\ndesktop-apps, phone-apps, and at least one hardware project we'd like to work on.<p>We don't expect to have a very large team in the near future, at the most I'd\nsay 4 or 5 other developers, but I can't rule out the possibility that somewhere\ndown the line we'll expand further than that.<p>I'd <i>prefer</i> to not have to pay a monthly subscription fee, and also to keep\nstuff on an internal network, but if there's something that is really great for\nthis stuff that is either not free, or hosted externally, I'd be willing to look\nat it.<p>I'm willing to roll my own automation-glue stuff, but I need to get a handle on\njust how much I'll need to write. I don't want to reinvent the wheel here, and\nit seems like this is the type of thing that's been solved over and over\nagain. Unfortunately, I've never been part of a team of coders in real life (I\nmoved from doing individual freelancing, which mostly consisted of fixing other\npeoples broken codebases by myself, to doing this job), and I'm finding it\nrather hard to find good information on setting up stuff like this.<p>How do those of you who are working in small (or not so small) development teams\nmanage stuff like this? Anyone here with experience designing internal\ndevelopment networks that would like to share some expertise? Recommended\nreading?<p><i>Edited for formatting</i>",1247563902
