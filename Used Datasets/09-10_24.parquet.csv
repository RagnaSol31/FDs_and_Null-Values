My experience in shipping systems used by tens of millions leads to that line of thinking.<p>> The problem is not that anyone cares about your OS binaries. The problem is that it is theoretically possible that customer data could have wound up in /sbin (maybe a script broke and did something stupid as root). Obviously customer data could routinely end up in /. Unless you can promise that there is no customer data in any unencrypted volume --- not assure that it is extremely unlikely, but promise --- then the assumption is going to be that the data was compromised, and stakeholder disclosure has to happen.<p>I agree 100%. No one cares about OS or app binaries, as long as those binaries can be cryptographically guaranteed to be unmodified. Given that, no one cares about them.<p>So, set that aside. Once that's a given, why can't you entirely isolate all user data into individual per-user containers? I can think of numerous ways that can be implemented. Chrome OS has done one such implementation themselves. Hell, union mount an encrypted per-user volume over the unencrypted OS volume. If you don't like that, find some other way. The bottom line: it's software. Implement some way to <i>promise</i> user data is always isolated and encrypted. It can be done and if you think it can't, you're thinking too small.<p>WDE guarantees one thing – whole disk encryption. That buys you <i>nothing</i> when one single malicious user gains access to that volume. And keep in mind: that malicious user could have been benign and even friendly to begin with.<p>You really do want per-user data encryption.",1298713892.0

Here's what they said:<p>Me: As an independent developer I can afford neither to become incorporated, nor to get a notary signature. Could you explain the reasoning behind this?<p>RIM: We require our vendors to be 18 years of age or older.  This is why we require a notary form.<p>Me: Is there not a way of proving that I'm over 18 other than spending £200 on a lawyer? I could send you a copy of my drivers license?<p>RIM: We do not except photocopies unless they are notarized.  You can try a local bank or family doctor to see if they will notarize your documentation.<p>Me: OK, but what you ask for is a certified notary i.e. someone legally authorised as a notary (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary</a>).

14,2265214,comment,2263892.0,2264314.0,0,0,trotsky,,,"An honest question - to you or anyone who basically feels the same way:<p>What methods do you use to determine if you're running hostile code? How often do you look? Do you check from another OS? Keep hashes of system files?<p>Let me expand on the theory that most malware hosts have absolutely no idea (and not just the dumb ones):<p>Once installed many threats actively evade AV, personal firewalls, and code signing requirements. Are you booting a livecd and checking hashes of the boot block and boot chain against previously saved values? What about the hash of your EPROMS?<p>I understand that sounds very paranoid - but advanced toolkits that attack the BIOS or boot loader are widely available. Are they only for juicy targets? TDL4 - an advanced threat that starts in the boot block and has used private 0-days - is engaged in the super spy thriller business of clickfraud. $10k will buy you a kit from Israel that inserts similar code into the system BIOS and is designed for non-techies to deploy.<p>Expecting to see increased resource usage? CPU, RAM, network speed are all far outstripping most actual application needs and the resources needed for a keylogger, afinity rewriter, ad inserter or similar are vanishingly small.<p>Expecting a signature hit in some security software? Authors check their own code frequently - when signatures get deployed that catch them they simply recompile and tweak until they're undetected again.<p>Expecting pop up ads, AV scareware, spamming activity or fraud alerts on your credit card? Some threats are like that, yes, but shrinking. Just as or more likely are threats that manipulate search results, add affiliate tags to big ticket items,  slip paid SEO links into blogs, steal your banking credentials but decide you're too poor or in an inconvenient county or steal company IP/plans/etc for chinese, russian, french, korean etc. competitors - the impact of which may take years or never be identified.<p>Expecting unknown, suspicious or hidden processes? Hiding in plain sight is a common and effective tactic. Can you tell the difference between a game installed codec, a useful codec with legal clickstream collections installed by a torrent downloader and a codec that was installed by exploit and rewrites your network traffic? Looking at a process list how many are you positive were running last month? Can you tell if skype is loading a dll or so that it wasn't before?<p>Think you're an unlikely target? Odds are that's true. However, automated tools  can be deployed against thousands of targets and if only one or two have something really juicy it was a worthwhile effort.  Proprietary IP of almost ever type has some value to someone be it term sheets, source code, M&A data, business process, sales leads, P&L data etc. Could your SO think you're cheating? Smartphone malware sold for 3000 yaun (~$450) supposedly marketed to houswives was found running on 150,000 chinese phones - it real time tracks your location, records audio, video and pictures regularly or on demand, steals credentials and all email/im/sms traffic. If you're of no interest it's possible your next door neighbor is, or his girlfriend, or someone who gets coffee where you do.<p>20 years ago malware was made by hobbyists. 10 years ago malware was made by small independent businessmen and specialty concerns. 5 years ago malware was made by organized crime, corporate espionage and intelligence agencies. Today malware is made by private organizations with hundreds of employees and traditional office space, teams supporting major M&A lawyers, the FBI to execute wiretapping warrants,  defense contractors, ad networks, energy companies, virtual currency resellers, intelligence services conducting broad surveillance on foreign populations and security services conducting broad surveillance on their own citizenry.<p>One reason you don't hear a lot about it is there are very few practical solutions out there to be implemented. Microsoft, Google, Apple, Oracle and Intel are all making inroads to various degrees but practically it is decidely a losing game so far. For the time being their profit margins depend on people not getting scared away. Law enforcement and Intelligence services that might have warned against such threats in another era are by in large too busy exploiting them.<p>I fully understand that this all sounds very tinfoil hat and extremist. All the examples given are real and happening to very real people every day. The threat model has radically changed - it may just take another 3-5 years for everyone to understand the new rules.",1298712690.0

43,2265181,comment,2264932.0,2264932.0,0,0,Prasannav,,,"I hope graph databases intrigues me sometime in the near future . I have been playing around with freebase api for sometime and i must admit that freebase does a fairly decent job in recognizing some of the entities that they promise to identify . Location is one such entity . They use a mix of NLP and a DB of locations to identify location entity . They ofcourse have a semantic relationship (city -> country -> continent for eg) between these entities that can offer u more insight . However , things like ""context"" of a free flowing text need to mature . They provide something called as the Social Tag for any text that u paste but sometimes it is too generic and sometimes it is far from the right context and many a times there is no social tags . So we had to kind of move away from relying on Freebase and figure our own ways . I agree to Joe's comments that extracting semantic info has to get more smarter , and relying on webmasters to provide this data is certainly not going to be scalable and achievable in the near future . google's acquisition of freebase did come as a surprise to me (considering the current capability of FB) , but their promise of providing a weekly dump meant there was a good news (not for long as we did not continue relying on FB anyways)<p>Looking at Watson could do , made me wonder why is the technology world so lagging behind w.r.t interpreting information .If NLP is a solved problem (looks like in Watson's case) are we only pending creating a linkage between the real world entities???. Freebase has linked 20 million but thats not enough . The approach is non profit , ""good for the world"" kinds . Can there be an incentive for people to provide links between entities . Can we bring up a profit model where people/organizations compete to provide more and better linkages . Or can we extract such links from peoples web activity (search , social networking etc [FB,Twitter]) .. i am getting too many ideas now :D:D ... and ofcourse can we request IBM to donate their NLP technology for the greater good :P :P",1298711105.0
