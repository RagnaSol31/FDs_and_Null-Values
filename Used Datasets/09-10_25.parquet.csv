Surely there's a difference in quality between say helplessness and indifference, even if it isn't captured in the win/loss-for-me/you framework.<p>Many behaviours can be explained by indifference, as it's not obviously right or even rational to think of the Total Humanity Utility as a goal-in-itself.

5,2570585,comment,2570340.0,2570449.0,1,0,stretchwithme,,,"Totally a solved problem.  Even in wealthy countries, the poor are often poor because many governments discourage savings (by lower interest rates into the basement), discourage work (with high income taxes, welfare payments, unemployment insurance, food stamps, Medicaid).  All of this fosters a culture where work is not seen as the vital thing that it is and where giving up is the easiest thing to do.<p>Other policies are made to cater to the monied interests, at the expense of the non-monied, causing many things to be more expensive than they need to be.  Housing, health care, education, transportation all fall into this category.  All of these things should be getting cheaper over time, but once government establishes control, that control is inevitable hired out to the highest bidder and used to benefit them at the expense of the consumer.<p>Of course, where there is no rule of law, the thugs just take everything as soon as you produce it, which is worse, I guess.  But at least people who escape it often still have the work ethic necessary to succeed in a free society.  That is, unless the government ""helps"" them.",1305971875

It ""surveyed 82.5% of the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN)"",<p>""""""Temperature trend estimates vary according to site classification, with poor siting leading to an overestimate of minimum temperature trends and an underestimate of maximum temperature trends, resulting in particular in a substantial difference in estimates of the diurnal temperature range trends. The opposite-signed differences of maximum and minimum temperature trends are similar in magnitude, so that the overall mean temperature trends are nearly identical across site classifications. Homogeneity adjustments tend to reduce trend differences, but statistically significant differences remain for all but average temperature trends.""""""<p>In other words, for purposes of determining average temperature trends - which is what we are talking about - the siting does not play a statistically significant role<p>Note also that the numbers you gave (""Class 5 (CRN5) (error > 5C)"") come from NOAA's Site Information Handbook where it clearly says ""The errors for the different classes are estimated values."" The results of that paper will no doubt help refine those estimates.<p>Finally, I point to the difference in how ""artificial heat source"" is defined for purposes of that classification vs. how it's understood in general reading. Without knowing the technical definition, most people will assume that it's near an active heat source, like ""an air conditioner exhaust"". But ""artificial heat source"" also includes ""parking lot, or concrete surface"" which are passive heat sources. And as the paper shows, the result is that they moderate the temperature but do not significantly affect the overall average.",1305971577
