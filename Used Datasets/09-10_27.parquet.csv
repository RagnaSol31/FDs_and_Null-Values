Noise is like a stream of random symbols from an alphabet - anything is possible; most all of it boring. A grammar carves out a subset of the possible streams, only those with certain relationships between the symbols.<p>Regular expressions are a simple kind of grammar (aka &quot;Regular Grammars&quot;) - you can see generation as choices made for explicit choice operators (&quot;|&quot;), and choices of whether to loop (&quot;∗&quot;) or continue. Although limited, they can be surprisingly expressive. Context Free Grammars allow you to generate things that have the basic structure of xml, json and source code. And you can have Turing Equivalent grammars that, in describing a subset, can compute anything.<p>Of course, grammars aren&",
