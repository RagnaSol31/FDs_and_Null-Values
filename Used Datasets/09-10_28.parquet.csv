Recently a month ago i started learning about vim and i found a lot of plugins to achieve the things i want.I'm finding to achieve the same effect in emacs you have to do a lot(for php/js/css/html editing).<p>Here are the list of things I'm finding hard.\nNote: These things are related when i'm editing php/html/css/js.<p>syntax hightlighting(php/smarty).\n-- the php major mode is too old and it always highlights html/smarty inside the php code incorrectly.<p>-- I love ido-mode but i couldn't find  how to define a project and fuzzy match files inside the predefined directory<p>--- I can setup nerdtree plugin to get a quick overview pane on the left with the files i'm working on with vim. But configuring speedbar and source code browser in emacs is bit difficult.<p>--- Context aware completion\nI really don't know how to do that. I have seen something like that in clojure mode where it shows the definition of a method in the <i>messages</i> area.<p>Tags-generation:\nThe tags generated with excrebant-ctags doesnot always work with php.In vim it is easy i can open a file containing the definition right under the cursor.<p>---Manual lookup\nI want to lookup the manual for a particular word under the cursor without opening the browser.(in the messages area(mini-buffer))<p>-------------------------------------------\nI love ido mode and switching b/w files in tramp,buffers,local files using ido-mode.<p>does anyone point me in the right direction? do you use emacs for same kind of editing i do?

I've found setting up Ruby and Python environments (not whatever system defaults, but development environments, including database drivers etc) much easier on Linux than Macs. As a developer I spend most of the time in the terminal anyway, so polish and glitz are relatively unimportant; I can see the appeal of the Mac to designers though.",1282295405.0

They had the chance to really fix a lot of missteps but they made the (IMO) horrible mistake of using JavaScript as their ""assembly language"".  Regardless of what anyone thinks about JavaScript, not <i>everyone</i> is going to want to program with it.  Many of us will be programming in something else and compile to the base browser language.<p>What <i>should</i> have happened is that they just define a (high level) VM that we can all compile to.  The browsers could have certain languages they compile to this VM language their self (e.g. JavaScribt, VBScript, etc.) and the rest of us compile to a binary file and point to that in our HTML page (e.g. <code type=""vm"" location=""code/main.hvm""/>)",1282295019.0
