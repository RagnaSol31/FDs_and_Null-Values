'Expression Suite' was built on Microsoft's acquisition of Creature House in 2003, and their fabulous Expression vector graphics software (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creature_House_Expression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creature_House_Expression</a>).<p>At the time, Expression was the closest competitor to Adobe Illustrator: it had unique features ('skeletal strokes', based on the co-founders' PhD research), and a superb UI (yes, imagine a streamlined, friendly interface that was <i>different</i> to Adobe's!). The animation version of Expression, LivingCels, offered similarly innovative animation technology, which was seriously being looked upon as a competitor to Flash. More significantly, though, it was on course to disrupt the (cel-based) animation industry. There's an informational site at: <a href=""http://livingcels.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://livingcels.com</a><p><i>That's</i> why Microsoft bought the company.<p>So, the little things: Creature House bought back the rights to Expression after MetaCreations went down. (I <i>wish</i> they'd do so now, once more!) The wonderfully whimsical website with beautiful, funny illustrations (by Patrick Lee) was replaced fairly rapidly by Microsoft's soulless corporate rendition. There was a Mac version of Expression - abandoned. Then the Windows version was re-coded to fit into WPF (dropping lots of essential features along the way). LivingCels has vanished.<p>I still use Expression almost daily. It runs perfectly in WINE (especially important now, since the Mac version isn't Intel-compatible). The user manual is a brilliant example of how manuals <i>should</i> be written, and the sample illustrations demonstrate how painterly effects can be achieved through vector gfx.<p>There's still nothing quite like Creature House Expression, so it's fortunate that Microsoft are still offering these original versions (Windows & Mac) as free downloads (check the links at the end of the Wikipedia article).",1356082983.0

The article is good at making parallels with the software world and explaining how to map previous knowledge, but does not make it clear at the beginning that this is not software. Even at the end, things are muddy, with things like:<p><pre><code>    Hardware - write concurrent code, write serial code where needed.\n</code></pre>\nFor you an I who get the difference, we can read between the lines and get it, but a complete newcomer might just as well end up thinking: <i>""okay I get it, this is very low level software code which is executing concurrently by default""</i>, when really, it is <i>""this is very high level hardware which is described here, and physics makes it 'happen everywhere' at once, but I can understand what happens through a mind trick""</i>.<p>Mind you, I like your article, but I just feel it may make some hardware beginners get some fundamental basics wrong.<p>As an anecdote, I personally noticed the critical importance of this distinction first hand, as in a software program, we went through a hardware course on this very subject and the teacher incessantly restated this fact, with due reason since later down the road each one of us understood that basically every single mistake one made was due to one trying to shoehorn software concepts into hardware, or expecting software behaviour from hardware.",1356081896.0
