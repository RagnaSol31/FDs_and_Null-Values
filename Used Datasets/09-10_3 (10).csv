36,7332230,comment,7330795.0,7331932.0,2,0,einhverfr,,,"I think you have to understand nuclear powered ships in the context of WWII history.<p>The critical loss for the Japanese navy was at Leyte Gulf, which was the largest naval battle in the Pacific during the war (and possibly the largest naval battle in history).  The significance of the battle was that the Americans secured Phillipine Sea against Japanese shipping and this cut the Japanese off from the oil fields in Indonesia in terms of transporting oil back home.  it was only after Leyte Gulf that organized kamikaze attacks began, and the Navy was largely put out of the war by that battle.<p>What that means is that Japan lost WWII when they lost access to oil.  So the issue with naval ships is diesel or nuclear.  About 1/3 of the US navy is nuclear-powered.  The rest runs on diesel.  Thats enough our navy (but not our air force, army etc) can continue to run if oil is not available for a time.  Our military is still very dependent on oil but not like the Japanese were.",1393825505.0
