1,576952,story,,,4,7,drewcrawford,Ask HN: How can we get better internet?,,"I'm a undergrad CS student in the middle of nowhere, East TX.  I'm here for a little-known but awesome CS program.<p>Unfortunately, internet access here is pretty awful.  I live in an old (50 years?) dormitory.  IT bills us about $1.50/GB, and it's filtered like you wouldn't believe (packet inspection,  no \nbittorrent, VPNs, lots of spurious firewalling...).  Unfortunately, moving not an option, and IT is deaf to student concerns.<p>Along with several other angry CS majors, I've been paying Clearwire (pre-Wimax ISP, claims 1.5mbit) about $40/month, but lately they've been getting on our case for ""over-usage"" and are threatening to cut us off.  We're talking about 2-3GB/week of traffic.  They do some light packet shaping as well, so we're looking for something better.<p>I'm only about 600-700ft from the nearest neighborhood, so there's some talk of paying someone to get a fat pipe and figuring out how to microwave it to where I live.  I don't know enough about the equipment I'd need, or what would fit in the budget (Motorola stuff looks expensive!).  Administration takes a very dim view of this sort of thing, so the equipment on my end would have to be indoor.  Any recommendations?<p>AFAIK, the buildings are too old to be wired properly for DSL/Cable (or not worth Ma Bell's effort).  Satellite requires an external mount, which is a no-no.<p>Can any clever hackers out there think of something we missed?",1240545301

If I had a nickel for every browser toolbar on top of toolbar on top of toolbar I had to remove from friends/family/clients computers ...

This is good because it make local based services viable, but bad because it's somewhat intrusive and some people just don't want to be 'found'.",1240545232

By the nature of comment threads, someone may moan about the company or the wording of its listing, or there will be some other random tangent, and it will distract from the desired candidate-finding benefit for the company.<p>Relaying names directly to the listing contact info, or relaying the listing to the candidate, is probably a better approach -- the fact that a specific person is available or being considered is often a matter deserving discretion.",1240545030

I do internal apps to help make their jobs easier.<p>I have 9 scheduled hours a day (1 hour lunch). I'm usually at my desk early and during part of lunch, but I don't work during these times (unless something REALLY needs done). The break helps me focus more. During my regular 8 hours of work, I generally am actually working for at least 7.5 of them. I NEVER goof off at work. I never handle personal business or surf the web while at work (aside from using Google or StackOverflow to find an answer to a programming question). The only thing that distracts me from work is chatting with coworkers from time to time.<p>I don't think it's fair to measure work by any standard other than ""I feel what I'm doing is productive."" I'm not typing code 7.5 hours a day. Sometimes I'm designing or reviewing code or refactoring or reading version control logs or reading up on new technologies.

34,576915,comment,576301.0,576497.0,0,0,chris11,,,"I did a little reading and I think I understand it.<p>1.So basically it seems like board directors are voted in one of two ways, through an election that includes all of the company's stockholders, and through an election that only includes members of a certain class of stock.<p>The agreement guarantees that Class F stockholders (founders) will elect one one board member. This director has two votes on the board, while all other members only have one.<p>For all elections involving other stock holders, the Class F stockholders will have more voting rights. One Class F share has the same voting power as 10 common shares.<p>The agreement also gives Class F stockholders protective provisions. Basically any action that affects the rights of Class F stockholders will have to be approved by a majority of Class F stockholders. This gives them power over things like mergers and board reorganizations.<p>Class F shares cannot be sold or transferred to non-founders. If a founder transfers the stock to anyone who is not a Class F stockholder, the shares are converted to Class A shares. Class F shares can be converted to class A shares, and are automatically converted on death. So basically, these special rights are only for founders. The voting rights can't be transferred.<p>All the talk about vesting just describes what happens if if control of the company changes.. The absence of a cliff means that  you get stock no matter how early you leave. Single trigger means that if there is any change of control or ownership, all of your stock vests. You don't need to get fired or resign for a good reason.<p>The Founders Institute also created a fund for the founders of the companies using this scheme. Company founders own 60% of the fund, and the Founders Institute owns 40%.<p>2. So if a founder is forced off the board, the company has to pay 100k to the fund.<p>3. The fund gets the right to buy 3.5% of the company at Series A valuations.<p>It sounds great for founders, and bad for investors. Basically, founders will need to approve any major company changes, be able cash out immediately on an acquisition, and get stock options at Series A valuations.",1240542754
