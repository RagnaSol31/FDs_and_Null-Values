Obviously it's the number he was given by Satan when he sucked Satans cock and drank blood to gain power in a skull and bones bilderberger convention.  You have a superficial explanation for what is obviously a flag for other black magicians as intent on evil as he is.  94 is the number of children whose blood he had to drink to get power.  That it's related to the year was synchronistic.  The other black magicians called him 94 long before that.",1226893515

I realize for the candidate that getting to the point of being hired is a major event, that happens only once every 3-4 years, and so providing references is a big deal.  On the other side, we're doing reference checks, even in a small company, with around 20-30 references/month.  Keeping everying on an application letter means that we don't have to delay the process and do (even more) back and forth with the candidate to track down their references.",1226893466

That sounds risky, but it is, in fact, exactly what people do in the housing market.",1226893297
9,366549,comment,365331.0,366077.0,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Right.  :-)<p>The _best_ references I can get for a candidate are the dozen or so people that worked with him/her for the last five years.  If I read you correctly, you are suggesting I roll the dice and not contact them.<p>More specifically, you are almost _never_ working for your current employer in Silicon Valley - your contributions and abilities are typically intended to impress your executive team, manager, and colleagues to position you better in the _next_ company - which is where you really see a strong stock and compensation package.<p>No Sr. candidates are hired without a strong combination of listed and back door references.  And, the valley is strong enough that no candidate who has worked in the valley for 8-10 years won't have at least half a dozen colleagues in common with me.",1226893262

I re-read the article after I read your comment, and I came to a different conclusion:  It is very possible we are in one of those gaps in time where if you have put in your 10,000 hours, you can leverage them.  You can be one of those lucky ones.<p>His point is, then, how do you know you aren't coming of age during a lucky time, when the old goes out the window?  It is quite possible this is that ""garage electronics"" time when nobody has any money and some of us figure out unique ways to save and as a result, make millions.<p>You can bet, SOMEONE will.  We are going to hear, in about 4-5 years, of someone down and out who ""did it"" during 2009 after they got laid off and were living in their parents' basement.  Instead of shooting their employer, they proved everyone wrong and succeeded.<p>I am one of the jaded and cynical, however.  This is just a ""glass is half full"" perspective.",1226893044

And, if you claim to be a $130K/year Network Engineer, but are really a $85K a year Network Engineer - you'll not only get caught, but fired for poor performance as well - there is just no upside in lying about making more money.  Their might be some incentive to claim a _lower_ salary, but most people just say ""I made way too much money at my last job X$, I'm willing to work for much less""",1226892869
14,366544,comment,365331.0,365973.0,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Perhaps it is a result of the fairly liquid and rapid moving environment in silicon valley.  People change jobs frequently, and trying to figure out what to pay someone can be challenging when age is not a proxy for ability/experience.  It's not exceptional to see someone on a team with 30 years of experience making $75K/year, whereas another contributor, with perhaps 8-10 years of experience, making $130K.   The interview is so short, you typically only get 5-6 hours of conversation with the individual, and you want to make the right decision.  Salary numbers are only one component of that deciding factor, but a useful one.",1226892696

17,366541,comment,366462.0,366508.0,0,0,netcan,,,"Sure. I don't think it's easy or as good.<p>There'll probably always be an advantage to going to a physical university. But there are online Universities that provide an education, degree, and faculty access at widely ranging cost points.<p>The first two might be possible to offer free. Maybe. \nThe last one would be difficult to provide free. But maybe some sort of guided community support could give a 90/10 solution that could scale.<p>The goal of an MIT level education & certification available to anyone with the intelligence & time regardless of citizenship & economic situation comes with a huge amount of utility. Economic, social & otherwise. I believe it may also be very strategic in terms of world security & stability.<p>But an MIT level is not absolutely necessary. A tier 2 or 3 university level might be sufficient. Maybe as  albertni mentions, they aim to provide a piece of the puzzle which can then be topped up with elements from other institutions. For the above to be goals, the whole thing doesn't need to fall on MIT's back.<p>Coursework can scale pretty much indefinitely. Certification, (i believe) can be made to scale quite well but MIT is probably not the place to go for this. Between those two, you don't seem that far from a free education. At least for the very driven students.<p>I was never a great example (or a great student), but for me these were the centres of gravity. Interactions that were important were mostly with tutors (mostly phd candidates or later year students) & other students. These would be harder to solve but maybe not impossible.<p>The point is that traditional, physical universities have not scaled. A minority of those intellectually capable have access to them.",1226891938

22,366535,comment,365637.0,366364.0,0,0,dgabriel,,,"My team consists of 13 contributors, wich is knd of large for an agile team.  In order for the team to function, we all need to be completely invested in high-bandwidth communication, and we need more meetings than a 3-5 man team.<p>For us, this means at least the stand-up every day.  There are frequent code and technical design reviews, at least 2-3 times a week.  Requirements clarification will typically involve 1-2 meetings a week with the partner, to ensure we're on the right track.  Add on the bi-weekly demo and iteration planning, and you're looking at more than one meeting a day.  Not all of the developers are required to attend all of the meetings, but because I'm the ranking dev/technical lead, I need to go to most of them.<p>Also, almost half our team is offshore, so I spend plenty of time drafting emails.  If communication and human interaction is your bag, this is a pretty good place to be.  That said, I tend to freak out once a month or so, and lock myself in a dark room with the code base for a week.  Somehow, I still manage to be the single largest contributor to the project....",1226891405
