12,354152,comment,352800.0,354016.0,0,0,APLonDrugs,,,"Legal plunder, perhaps would be a better term:-)  And I would stand by that term as being correct.  “Stealing is the unlawful taking of your money” agreed, so why is the constitution not being obeyed?   Most of the programs, etc. are not constitutional along with everywhere the government is not obeying the constitution… there is a lot of this from not declaring war, to gold and silver coins. If the rule of law is not being obeyed, or was changed legally, by your own definition, perhaps it is stealing in many forms first of the power reserved for the people or the states.<p>I didn’t know “The Law That Never Was” was a conspiracy, I thought it was a factual record of what the state’s recorded and what the GSA and government recorded.  Perhaps the term of conspiracy is a better label? or you are using a loaded word, to mark an area of taboo.  After pushing  towards a 100 years of tax/need brainwashing, I don’t know what the affect would be if the 16th was to pass today, I think it would never have passed in 1800, though:-) to say it is moot is like saying because the people would not approve the constitution today, using that document of freedom is moot as well, we should disregard it.  I do not believe that would be wise.  The more I think about how the rule of law is not being obeyed, in all its forms, the more I think stealing might be better than legal plunder….\nI like your case though, thanks for reply",1225856815.0

I would expect that this tends to reduce the number of points where vulnerabilities would be possible, at least as far as points where it might be exploited via causing it to execute with malicious parameters via an HTTP request.  i.e. In Wordpress, every page you load is the result of the execution of some PHP scripts, while in a blog that is rendered to a bunch of static files, it's conceivable that the only thing that unauthenticated users can mess with is the comment system.",1225855392.0

Or, he will revert to the hard-leftist, communist-sympathizer he has been since his youth. If he's smart, he'll do the former.
