1,225909,comment,225254.0,225386.0,0,0,jrockway,,,"FWIW, I don't think top-tier schools care about ""interesting"" people.  When I was in high school, I got mostly As and Bs, studied abroad (and hence spoke two langauges pretty well), and spent most of my time learning math and writing software.  I also had 99%-ile test scores and was pretty good at writing.  However, I also had a run-in with a history teacher, and failed his class.  That pretty much guarantees that you won't get into a good school.  I applied to CMU, CalTech, and MIT and didn't get in.  I did get in to UIUC and UIC, and chose UIC since it was closer.  HUGE MISTAKE.  My classmates didn't speak English, my professors didn't speak Enlgish, and I had no friends.  I dropped out after 2 years.<p>All in all, this is irrelevant.  My goal was to become a professor, but I learned that industry was much more lucrative than acadamia.  If I want to do research, I can do it from my house.  The classes I teach professionally pay more for 2 days than most professors make in a month.<p>So in the end, it all worked out.  It would have been nice to have a ""formal education"", though.  Maybe I will move to Urbana-Champaign and get a degree from there... or maybe not.<p></rant>",1214279939

6,225904,comment,225764.0,225831.0,0,0,apu,,,"I find comprehensions to be especially useful in two situations:<p>1. Transforming a list using some non-standard function, often with some basic input checking:<p><pre><code>    [int(x)*2+1 for x in seq if x]\n</code></pre>\n(Here, we're assuming x is a string which can possibly be empty or only blanks)<p>2. Transforming elements from multiple lists together:<p><pre><code>    ['Iter %d took %0.2f secs' %  (i, t) for i, t in zip(iters, times) if t > 1.5]\n</code></pre>\n(Where we want output strings only if some iteration took a long time)<p>Although I'm not too fluent in lisp, I think the equivalent formulations might be longer (since you'd have to write lambda, map, filter and many parens), and perhaps harder to decipher.",1214279580

21,225888,comment,225774.0,225774.0,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"I think people often structure the investment as a convertible loan specifically to avoid this question. The conversion part is that the loan converts to equity (with a discount) based on the valuation set during your series A. This way you don't have to come up with a make-believe valuation right now.<p>If you don't ever get to series A your company will either have to pay off the loan with interest or go out of business.<p>CRV offers this as part of their quickstart program and is very open about the terms. It's a good place to find out more.<p><a href=""http://www.crv.com/quickstart"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crv.com/quickstart</a><p>""A standard interest bearing loan will be made to a corporation, which we will help you establish if you do not already have one in place. CRV will not seek a personal guarantee and will not hold you personally responsible for repaying the loan.<p>The loan converts into equity only if and when your company closes its next round of funding (typically a Series A round). If the company successfully raises its next round, in exchange for sharing the risk with the entrepreneur, CRV receives a discount on the conversion price when the loan is rolled into that next round. The discount will be a maximum of 25% (determined ratably at five percent per month, depending on how long it takes to close the financing, up to the maximum) off of the per share price.
