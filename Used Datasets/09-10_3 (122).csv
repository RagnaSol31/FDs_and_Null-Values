Sites like K5 and Fark and Slashdot already offer plums-for-money, so if you could make it easier for more sites to do this it would seem to be quite viral.<p>Edit: I think the idea of donating in real time would be most rewarding satisficers. The problem is that early adopters, almost by definition, are rarely satisficers.",1211773799

8,199947,comment,199798.0,199798.0,0,0,dhbradshaw,,,"It would be interesting to see statistics on Tipjoy tips as a function of time.  What does the curve look like?  That may matter more at this point than any absolute amounts.<p>I really like the service and considered putting it up on my blog.  I want to advertise for Tipjoy.  On the other hand, I don't really want to ask for money.  So it's not up.<p>What would partially solve my problem is for Tipjoy to become a default.  It would be pretty neat if Tipjoy could work out a deal with a few of the major blogs such that Tipjoy became a default setting and to not have a button on the page or associated with each post you would have to opt out.  Then you aren't begging, you're just going with the flow.<p>I'm sure Blogger and Wordpress would love any extra little source of revenue if Tipjoy were to share some of that 3%.<p>That would make it a technical default.  It might gradually lead to the point where it is a social default as well.",1211773661

10,199945,comment,199798.0,199896.0,0,0,breck,,,"I was <i>mostly</i> kidding. I very rarely click on AdSense ads anyway, and only do so if I've got at least some interest in the company. But if I stumble upon a site or article that I don't like (linkbait or parked domain pages for example), I will never click on an ad. I don't want to reward crappy websites. However, because the corollary to that is true (if I like a site I am more likely to click on an ad) that does not make my behavior inappropriate, imho.<p>Regardless, a certain percentage of frivolous clicks won't kill ad supported sites. If conversion rates from content ads decrease advertisers <i>should</i> bid less and prices will correct themselves. In other words, if advertisers see their ROI on each click drop by 10%, they should bid 10% less per click. If you see a decrease in ROI and don't decrease your bid amount, that's no one's fault but your own. If you see a decrease in ROI and decrease your bid amount but lose placement to competing bidders, than for some reason you are seeing less ROI than them and it has got nothing to do with frivolous clicks. Unless of course one of your competitors is specifically targeting your ads, but I believe Google is pretty good about catching those things.<p>In general though, content ads are <i>much, much</i> less effective than search ads because when someone clicks a search ad they are in a different frame of mind(looking actively to find/buy something) than when they click on a content ad(mildly interested), so:\nA) I think you are making the right move not advertising on the content network.\nB) What's going to kill 'ad supported' sites is the much higher conversion rates from search ads and the fact that most ad supported sites are no more essential to humanity than most ad supported TV shows.",1211773594

It's such a good feeling to get some excellent content online. I actually love tipping.<p>I'm eager to get that same feeling when I listen to music. It's exactly when you're listening to favorite song of yours that you want to give back. That's downright sexy compared with buying music on itunes.,1211773388

I had the same thing happen to me.<p>Some hacker inserted a single randomly named php and new .htaccess file in every directory on my Movable Type blog - www.geofffox.com. We’re talking thousands of directories.<p>The .htaccess file was amazingly clever. It sprung into action on 404 errors, and only from search engine referrers. I originally thought it was Google’s problem, because I couldn’t make the pages appear by typing them in.<p>By the time I’d begun the cleanup, Google thought I had over 330,000 pages (actually around 16k) on my site. My most cited keywords had to do with porn and game cracks.<p>The hack left all .html files in a single directory. My real pages are all php, making it easier to eliminate the scourge from search engines. It took a long time.<p>Since cleaning up my act in January, my traffic is down by 2/3! MSN Live is referring more traffic my way than Google. I am still a PR4, but with little to show for that. That’s one reason I’ve cited my site on this comment and hope it’s not ‘nofollowed’ out. I’m hoping for some Google love.<p>My biggest complaint is, Google is not answerable to anyone. You can fill out forms, and beg (and I begged), but Google will neither tell you what you did wrong or how to rehabilitate yourself. I had to find those out on my own.<p>They have gone beyond a simple search engine. If you’re not on Google, you don’t exist!",1211772879
20,199935,comment,199909.0,199909.0,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I have a Tipjoy account, but I doubt I'll ever use it unless you add the following functionality: Charge me five bucks a month, and then let me choose however many sites I want for that money to be divided up among. The problem with the micropayment concept is the cognitive load is through the roof. Deciding whether to spend money on something is stressful, and Tipjoy asks me to make that decision every time I go to a webpage.<p>Figuring out if a webpage is worth tipping is like going to the store and trying to figure out which toothpaste is the best. It's stressful as hell because they all look the same and you're afraid if you buy the wrong one you're teeth are going to fall out. Except instead of having to do that every three months, Tipjoy asks me to do it every couple of minutes. Even if you're only tipping a quarter the cognitive load is just as bad as if it's a much larger amount. In many ways it's worse because you know the people you're tipping are only getting a quarter for the mental effort; the end result just doesn't justify the process. So just let me contribute as big a pie as I want, and then make hitting the tip button just cut out an extra slice from the pie. It completely eliminates the stress of having to figure out whether or not to spend money, and the cognitive load goes down a lot as well because you can, for example, favorite Fred Wilson's blog once and then a slice of the pie automatically goes to him each month. And speaking of, Crest solved this problem by just releasing their new Pro Health product, the one that costs an extra couple bucks but just does everything. Which of course is the toothpaste I now buy. Tipjoy has to figure out a way to do the equivalent. Because as is, Tipjoy makes being nice feel like pulling teeth.",1211772878

Fifteen years ago you would have sent an email.<p>Disagree that Tipjoy doesn't add value to Disqus simply because comments are so often a statement of appreciation - local customs aside, that's what a tip is too. Appreciation of the value provisioned, if you prefer.<p>What you get is distribution channel for Tipjoy and a product enhancement and revenue slice for Disqus.<p>Another aside: Tipping of high value comments would be possible.
