Cancer in family is so hard to get over and as someone who has experienced it first hand, I can tell you that it impacts the whole family, not just the person affected by it.

This guy wouldn't trade some extra time with his family for all the startups and VC cash in the world. It just puts things into perspective.",1190260493
3,57231,comment,56618.0,56618.0,0,0,alex_c,,,"For fiction, I'm surprised no one has mentioned:<p>The Dune series by Frank Herbert.  Unlike anything else I've read, and one of the most compelling and detailed fictional universes in literature.<p>The Discworld series by Terry Pratchett.  Don't confuse it for fantasy - it's brilliant satire.  Littered with geeky references and clever wordplay, I actually enjoy it a bit more than the Hitchhiker's Guide books.  If you like Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett is a pretty safe bet.<p>Anything by Stanislaw Lem - clever and funny science fiction.  A good match for my weird sense of humour.<p>All of the above can slightly change the way you see the world.<p>For non-fiction, another vote for the Mythical Man Month.",1190260463

The reason console gaming is growing so much compared to PC gaming is because of ease of use,  which is the main reason web apps are so popular.<p>PC gaming is broken precisely because of the problems with writing software for the millions of PCs out there. Web development, on the other hand, is like building a game for a console, you don't have to worry about all the hardware that's out there, you just write to the environment. While writing web apps is not like having a unified development environment it's a lot closer than trying to write a program that will run on every hardware configuration out in PC land, and Mac, and Linux, and Solaris, etc.<p>Just as console gaming is slowly killing the PC gaming industry web applications will slowly kill classic PC applications. That doesn't mean that the PC is going away, but the future definitely lives on the web.",1190260368

15,57219,comment,57094.0,57181.0,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think there needs to be a better thin client than the current web browser, but I think that client will be an evolution of current web browsers rather than a new app.<p>Here's how I see it playing out:<p>JavaScript libraries will build increasingly more full-featured UI libraries.  That's happening already with JQuery and YUI and Scriptaculous and Dojo.  The increasing complexity will put increasing demands on the client-side processor, so browser makers will respond with faster JS implementations and specializing JIT-compilers (like Psyco or the JVM).  <p>Meanwhile, SVG support will grow - it's already supported natively in Opera and partially in Mozilla/Firefox, with Safari and IE support under development.  Once that's widely available, it'll open up a whole bunch of new app categories - games, grapics apps, maybe even photo manipulation if JavaScript gets high-speed array operations and access to pixel buffers.  When enough people start using SVG, I could easily see browser makers implementing their SVG support to take advantage of 3D hardware acceleration.",1190258829

Not so much...<p>However, this still leaves my original question somewhat unanswered. While the three of us may be a great team, I've known many people who believe that couples should not work/do business together as they feel it will inevitably lead to conflict and result in the breakup of the company, relationship, or both. I'm sure that they have some personal experiences, but how does YC generally look at this type of situation. Will they see it as additional (and unnecessary) risk? Are there any examples of husband/wife teams in successful startups?",1190258216

Their entire raison d'etre is to provide lightweight communication between huge masses of people. As people start demanding more from them, I expect them to start adding desktop offshoots in order to support more sophisticated behaviors and interactions.\n",1190258131
