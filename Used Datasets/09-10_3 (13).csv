Yes, this was for things like new servers, hyper-v, etc.<p>What I find utterly unfathomable is that the state wrote ONLY 43 POs totalling 132 Million fucking dollars.

The way to test a causal hypothesis is always, at bottom, to do a controlled experiment.[1] So we will tease out the effects of diet on different people by finding experimental volunteers and subjecting the volunteers to controlled diets, such as those planned for some of the experiments described in this interesting article.<p>This is very difficult to do, as almost all human beings eat when they feel like eating WHAT they feel like eating. Earlier human experiments on effects of diet in the 1970s actually required the experiment subjects to live in the laboratory long-term, and to have every gram of everything they ate during the experiment measured exactly by experiment team assistants.
