HN readers were enormously helpful and I've implemented a number of your suggestions.<p>The initial site broke too many conventions in an attempt to differentiate. I'm now focusing on adhering to convention in areas where clarity is key. The site has a shorter name (""chchchat""), chat rooms are no longer called conversations, and users are able to give rooms custom titles in addition to tags. The ""intelligent"" features of the site are now dormant, and even when active will remain transparent to users.<p>I've removed redundant content and minimized certain features so that the interface is focused on the chat rooms themselves. I've also redesigned the chat room listings to look more like the layouts of popular media sites like YouTube. Also it's now easier to invite friends to chat rooms, as each one has a static URL which is displayed prominently for copy/pasting.<p>Thanks for taking another look, and thanks again for all of the feedback you shared last week!",1218771384.0

My thoughts were probably along the lines of the Techcrunch comments.<p>After thinking about it for a bit, I decided that I don't have anything against CO2Stats itself.  What's more, it seems like a pretty obvious idea (more power to them if they're the first to implement it), and I think it's pretty likely to succeed.<p>What really bugs me is the kind of faulty thinking which is what will make it a success.  It's the same kind of thinking which leads to huge unnecessary cardboard or plastic packaging with a recycling sign on it.  It has the currently fashionable environment-friendly sign on it, therefore it's OK to consume more!<p>I guess I'm just not comfortable with the idea of offsetting actually making a difference.  You're still putting that CO2 out there, you just have a shiny certificate to show that... you're... not?  It's basically the same objection as coffeemug's, just from a different perspective.<p>Edit: the video on the CO2Stats website actually sums it up nicely.  It's about making your visitors ""feel good"".  It's not very clear to me that it's about making an actual difference.",1218770105.0

Some people are picky about tools, and it <i>encourages them to make their own</i>. It's highly unlikely that it will unify in any real sense as long as its core design attracts people who bristle at the thought of being stuck using anything besides KDE, or GNOME, or Fluxbox, or ratpoison, or dwm, ...<p>I think it's a really good thing that different distributions tend to focus on particular goals, e.g. security as a design principle in OpenBSD, portability in NetBSD, being available as a free OS (in various senses) with Debian and Ubuntu, etc. (I really don't want this to turn into an argument about different distros; I know I'm trailing off there, I had a harder time summarizing Debian). Anyway, different foci lead to different discoveries, bugfixes, etc., but <i>due to the pervasive Unix culture</i> they are shared.<p>Still, that avalanche of necessary choices will probably keep it thriving in different niches from a system designed to have a consistent face for everyone.
