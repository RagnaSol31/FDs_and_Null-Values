It would destroy liquidity, and do little to alleviate risk, since bankers would not be assured of making sufficient income to offset the cost of bad debt. Furthermore, profits from banking would be so low as to fall below the level of transfer earnings, that is to say banks and bankers might well be able to make more money doing something else and would have no incentive to operate, and the economy would go the way of North Korea (unless this system were implemented and enforced globally).<p>Since people always want money to do stuff, the demand for credit would likely be filled by illegal lenders charging usurious rates (although there's a reason I cut up all my credit cards...), and profiteering would ensue. Such illegal lenders would probably not bank their gains starving the system further of liquidity - a case of bad credit driving out good, so to speak. I imagine the likely result would be that the government would become the biggest guarantor of loans and cronyism and other kinds of corruption would become endemic. Doubtless you don't intend for this outcome, but I can't help feeling your proposal would rapidly result in a soviet-style economy, which I can attest from first-hand experience does not work very well.<p>Incidentally, not only is it illegal for an individual to lend money that does not exist, it is illegal for them to lend more than a certain sum of their <i>own</i> money at interest, I believe under the same laws that require investor accreditation.",1268968844.0

I now do the ""creating new stuff"" for myself at my startup.<p><i>If the talent is trying to make itself irreplaceable - like say, only one person knows how something works and they do not like documenting it or training others. It shows insecurity of the person who does not want to lose the job, which is bad for the organization as well as for the person.<p>Bad for the organization because, if the person either wants to quit or cannot turn up for work, a crucial piece of work cannot be completed.<p>Bad for the person because, though the person might think he/she is crucial for something work and cannot be fired, they are making themselves tied up to the work and hence cannot be promoted to better opportunities.<p>A talent should learn and grow. And then to teach others and make them grow. And keep repeating the process. If there is not much you can learn to grow, then quit and join some place where you can.</i><p>This is from my first link to HN (545 days ago)..\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=309262"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=309262</a>",1268968196.0
