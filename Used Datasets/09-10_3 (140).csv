I'm just saying it's going to win out in the end because of the history of its implementation.  There is a serious benefit to having one language everywhere, and JS is the only viable candidate because of the investment in client-side sandboxing and performance -- two features which turn out to matter almost as much on the server as well.)",1329019179.0

Either you can attempt to maintain the inefficiency (in this case, redundant car salesmen) in order to keep those workers in a job or you can attack the root of the problem and put those workers to work doing something that adds value to the economy.<p>I'm not saying that there aren't moral and ethical arguments in trying to keep a job for those workers, because there, especially from a societal standpoint. But from an economic standpoint, maintaining those inefficiencies typically leads to systemized exploitation of artificial inefficiencies (case in point: smuggling to bypass protectionist tariffs) and that wastes additional effort that could be adding value to the economy.",1329018602.0

However, family might be a strong asset to an entrepreneur. When a founder enters a depressive period (no traction, few users), family becomes his most important escape.<p>Family can provide founders with several advantages: time compression can serve as an incentive to be more efficient, a wife/husband can provide financial/emotional support in hard times and family members can serve the venture in many additional ways (early product adoption, business connections, product evangelism, etc).<p>An unhealthy work-life balance is unsustainable in the long term. Workaholism is not the cause of success, is merely correlated to it because frequently significant others are not educated about start-up life.<p>All and all, I think that if we integrate family into our start-up life, we'll become more robust entrepreneurs.

74,3580982,comment,3580273.0,3580273.0,6,0,kalleboo,,,"I think it's pretty well known that for most use cases, cloud hosting is more expensive than dedicated hardware.<p>That said, we're currently moving from a dedicated server to AWS, after we had a bit of nasty downtime. We have dedicated servers with 1and1, and the RAID in our server died and striped bad data all over one of the disks, slashing half the files with junk. 1and1 tech support refused to acknowledge the problem (and claimed we had software RAID setup) and it took us a few days to get back online from our weekly backups.<p>What I'm hoping from Amazon as a cloud provider is handling failure better: With 1and1, a failed machine means a few days getting a new one, or paying double for a hot spare. With Amazon, even if dead instances happen more often, killing it and spinning up a new one is trivial, and can even be automated. Backups can be made much more often non-intrusively by using snapshots.<p>For reliability's sake I also like the idea of having a few small instances behind Elastic Load Balancer instead of one beefy machine. I haven't seen anything like ELB with a dedicated hosting provider (aside from using an actual load balancer, which is a very expensive proposition).<p>Of course, not having to plan your capacity so far in advance and being able to start small and scale out at the drop of a hat if something on your server goes viral is a really exciting proposition as well.",1329016089.0

It is really a breath of fresh air considering the typical interface often seen around the start up crowd. Its feels very light, and intentional with bold accents calling for attention. In a word, I might call it crisp. However, I do think you could rework some of the user generated elements such as the clusters and the inserted images. They feel oddly out of place considering the rest of the UI.<p>With that all said however, the page offering explanation leaves much to be desired. I think there should be more doing and less talking so to speak. Even the text though feels unstructured and out of place, its placement seems rather haphazard, and the rag is especially rough. While I do realize this blog post isn't the product, the typography is seriously lacking there.",1329015615.0
