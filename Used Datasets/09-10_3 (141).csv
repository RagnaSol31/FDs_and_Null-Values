The lead singer of Tool and A Perfect Circle is the same fellow, and it's a song with a similar theme. I don't listen to much Tool any more, but I did check out the new album a couple years ago as I was a fan when I was younger. Not as good as Lateralus or Aenima in my opinion, but the track Wings part 2 was really really good.<p><a href=""http://www.metrolyrics.com/10000-days-wings-part-2-lyrics-tool.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metrolyrics.com/10000-days-wings-part-2-lyrics-to...</a><p>To listen (it's a long song, so in two parts):<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg5LeuJA8UE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg5LeuJA8UE</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGFy_CwA5hk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGFy_CwA5hk</a>",1267761539.0

The Monad pattern appears everywhere in every language whether you know it or not, Haskell merely exposes to the user something that is already there. ""<p>Yes I agree (haskeller myself). The ""disappearance"" I meant was addressing the original point of view that the repetition of the pattern was a weakness in the language, something like Visitor pattern disppearing in Common LIsp. (an intriguing idea to play with and a valid  <i>point of view</i>). Your interpretation of disappearance goes the other way - something like continuations being hidden in fortran and explcit in Scheme.<p>""Accusing Haskell of being ""less advanced"" because it actually exposes Monads to you and permits you to use them is very much like accusing C++ of lacking power vs. C because it permits you to overload the square brackets. If you put aside the question of whether it's a good thing to have the power (a separate debate in both cases), it's not a very sensible accusation to level against Haskell.""<p>A  better analogy would be an argument about exposing call/cc in scheme. Is  call/cc good language design? There are arguments on both sides. Haskell does continuations differently than Scheme. Which is ""better""?<p>And come on, no one is really ""accusing"" Haskell of anything. I for one, like the language a lot.<p>If you will, think of this as a <i>speculation</i> about a successor language. 15 years from now (say) there <i>will</i> be a better language than Haskell in the statically typed lazy functional languages space, which absorbs the key positives of Haskell, has a few new ideas, and possibly treats Monads differently (or does away with them altogether). Clean (the language) deals with IO with uniqueness types with nary a monad in sight. Is that design ""better""?  Worth thinking about.",1267761251.0

For 6 months almost every meeting was at a bar until we closed, and just last month we finally put together a financial model and deck.<p>We hope to launch this month after working on it for 3, and now starting to look for a bigger round. I fully agree with finding investors that fit and not just taking on money to take it. On top of seeding us, our investor turned over a trademark and preliminary patent to the company. I think it's crucial to find a good match if you want to continue loving your company while working with shareholders.<p>Good luck Backupify!",1267758794.0

It's the dominant platform on mobile devices.<p>Unfortunately, the ARM's dominance can have a negative effect in the diversity of the segment, thus slowing down evolution on mobile platforms. Still, until app availability weights the market down, mobile is more resistant to fragmentation and friendlier to hardware diversity.<p>I would be delighted to see an ARM-based full-featured notebook, running an open and portable userland, but I fear Apple is not a company that will favour diversity.
