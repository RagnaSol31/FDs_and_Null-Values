For every story of ""working out"" helping someone, I suspect you will find a couple stories of it injuring someone. Sadly, normal computer use general involves considerable insult to the proper use of your body. Putting further strain on your arms and legs through weights and other devices has <i>often</i> resulted in a further problems for people.<p>Certainly there are some bodies that are helped by this - <i>one must always keep in mind how much variation in bodies there is in we biological humans and not assume one person's solution will automatically work for another person, meaning you</i>.<p>That said, what I'd strong suggest is that you need is to become aware of the proper use of your <i>own</i> body. One good resource for this: ""The Alexander Technique"". Another: qigong in general and <a href=""http://www.qidao.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.qidao.org</a> in particular.

When there was mention of the international community, the UN helmet went up on the roof. When there was something about fuel prices, a bottle of (what was meant to look like) fuel was up there.<p>The cleverness, I think, lies in how dead-simple symbols that people already associate were used. Doesn't matter if you've just come to Monrovia and don't know what the Daily Talk is - if you saw a UN helmet on the building, you'd think that there was something associated with the UN going on there. If that interested you, you'd walk over and see what it was (in this case, the news) - if not, you'd continue on your way. It almost reminds me of the home-screen notifications on BlackBerrys/iPhones - a simple sentinel indicating the presence of more related information - but much better executed, since the vocabulary used isn't platform-specific (i.e. the Daily Talk didn't make up its own signals to use, they used ones that people already associated).",1255923126.0

People who are good at abstract problem solving tend to be less adapt at social interaction.<p>Theory 3)  Developers are actually normal.  It's the business people who are weird.  They are forced to create an unnatural facade in order to present themselves to external clients and partners.  Eventually, that facade becomes them.  Developers do not need to interact outside the company, and are judged based on what they get done.

FB platform has gone from launch to supporting companies that could IPO (and made a whole load of single developers v rich). social gaming has gone from scrabulous to now posing a credible threat to the entire console gaming industry. the wii destroyed the xbox and ps3 within its first year of launch and now sells more than both of them combined.<p>i'd argue that it's the faster moving trends that impact startups and startup opportunities more than the slower moving macro trends.",1255921649.0

When you're doing a startup you feel like every day is precious and the tide of change is racing along impossibly fast.  It's healthy to remember that the world doesn't reinvent itself every month.  The problem you're working on now will probably still be relevant in 1-2 years.,1255921484.0

I try to drink water 1:1 with the amount of coffee I drink if not more.  And some cheap vitamin supplements for the B vitamins work well.<p>I have similar wrist pain that comes and goes, and when it gets bad I just take it easy and make sure to drink a lot of water and that tends to ease the pain.<p>Also taking over the counter anti-inflammatories can help in the interim period until you gain some wrist strength.  I don't take any drugs regularly, and I notice that 2 ibuprofen in the morning usually takes care of it for 24 hours.  Obviously you're not going to want to take them every day for a long time :)<p>Lastly try to pay attention to what you do with your hands when you sleep.

Several of my computer science peers (I'm 23) -- inexperienced as professionals, but very smart -- will try the same problem in four or five languages, just to learn the language, and have no fears about jumping into a new language to start a new project. On the other hand, I know some excellent older programmers (late 40s) who know C++ super well, are willing to apply jaw-droppingly complex template metaprogramming, but who only reluctantly use Python and won't touch Ruby or Scala.
