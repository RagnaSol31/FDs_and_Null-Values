At first, I was building/managing the technical aspect of the business( website, integration, inventory systems, fulfillment systems, etc )remotely on an average basis of 20 hours per week.  I say average because some weeks I did nothing, and other weeks I worked more than my ""day job"".<p>Growth was so strong that I ultimately made the decision to jump ship from my prior company and make my current company a fulltime endeavor.  It was one of the most difficult decisions I've made in my life, as the cofounder of my prior company was very close.<p>During this time, we've grown from < $100k/y revenues to > $5mm ( making an effort to be vague here ), and still enjoying good growth.  We are profitable and never took a dime of VC.<p>Hopefully this anecdote answers your question sufficiently.",1318132682.0

'ssh -A' is much worse.<p>The alternative? With 'ssh -A', a single compromised system will allow every user's key to be used. Not just potentially exposing all of the organization's servers, but all of the servers which all of the users may independently have access to! Those systems may also have users connecting with 'ssh -A', exposing even more systems, etc.<p>This might not be so bad if you only access your employee's servers and you have a few machines. It is really serious if you are a contractor, or have contractors.<p>If, say, you are a freelancer and you use 'ssh -A' to a client and the client's server is compromised, all of your other client's servers may easily become compromised.<p>A hack as described here, preferably using a sockets-only approach, can allow your organization to essentially pre-authorize users.

Ideally, it would be implemented entirely with Unix sockets and it could be implemented this way, but I had trouble getting socat to do this. More work with socat or writing some Python would be a reasonable long-term solution.<p>This does the <i>opposite</i> of 'ssh -A'. With 'ssh -A', a local agent is forwarded to an untrusted remote host. The agent lives on the client and the remote server can use your local keys for authorization.<p>This script allows you to connect your local SSH clients to a remote agent. The remote agent may be managed by another user. The use case is when you intentionally <i>want</i> to do this, allowing other users to authorize themselves with your key, without directly revealing the secret.<p>This is quite simply, a way to have a (somewhat) secure shared-secret with SSH. It is not a way to use your own secret, private key with an ssh client living on a remote host.<p>The only way that 'ssh -A' can replicate this functionality is if another user on the remote system connected to your (forwarded) socket and did an ssh-add. That is a reasonable alternative, but it would be difficult to automate that process in a secure way.<p>The README has been updated to note the danger of using TCP here.",1318130075.0
