About a million years ago, homo erectus walked fully upright and discovered fire to cook meals. Two hundred thousand years ago, homo sapiens inherited knowledge of only tools and fire. From those humble origins, we eventually managed to master agriculture, establish civilization, and spark science. Over the last few centuries, homo universalis has been naturally emerging by deducing the laws of Nature with methods of science and exploring the Cosmos with applied science. While still in early days of development, homo universalis will eventually lead humanity to the stars and beyond. Homo universalis is deep within all of us waiting to surface. If you stop and think for a few seconds, it would not be difficult to see the logical progression of apes from fiery creators to starry dreamers. LivGiv exists to aid a global shift towards universal consciousness through a paradigm shift in human technology.

It's _really_ distracting and makes reading long content pretty unsatisfying.<p>Here's how it works: when you put your finger down on the screen it could be either a tap or the start of a scroll. The phone doesn't know at that instant which. It has to wait to make the call until there's been some amount of motion, about 1 or 2 cm, and until that time, the screen can't move (you don't want the screen bouncing around when you tap on things). So, when you start a scroll, when the phone actually knows it's a scroll, your finger has moved a couple cm but the screen hasn't. Android, for some damn reason, takes that instant to ""catch up"" to your finger, so that every time you scroll, the screen jerks up a line or two. No animation or anything. One frame it's down there, and the next it's up here. Try keeping your place when that happens, it's really annoying.<p>There is another way to do it too. The iPhone just doesn't bother to catch up.

It is quite a long document and the language appears to be a bit vague and political in nature. Or is your point that this is kind of document is actually part of the problem.<p>Either way I think that the NEIS program is a bit smaller that what these guys are talking about. If you do a NEIS program you are just as likely to be applying alongside people who are wanting to sell homemade candles at markets. It is really an employment program rather than ITC.,1281323627.0

Then E[Y/X] = 1.25. That's what I wanted you to explain. You just keep saying that E[X] = E[Y], which I know.<p>Note that this paradox would not arise if X and Y were independent, since then E[Y/X] = E[Y] / E[X] = 1.",1281323587.0

A bunch of what seems to be older legacy code is running around, their help and tutorials are complex and sometimes difficult to follow. They also  seems to have slightly slower page loads, and deliver more javascript and objects. However, with the complexity comes more power and more options. They do require some payment, but this also gives you better sign-on options, ability to remove their branding etc.<p>Disqus feels cleaner and the because there are fewer choices it is simpler to use. Overall it feels lighter weight (in a mostly good way). However, the reduction in options means that if it doesn't do exactly what you want out of the gate, it may not be possible to do what you want at all. Single sign-on and white label requires you to contact them -- pricing is not public on their site.<p>I have had difficulties with both with regard to Facebook login (post OAuth 2.0) but I expect both to resolve these shortly. Tech support has been responsive for both (both unpaid Disqus and paid Echo).<p>Integration for both into wordpress was mostly ok, though there were a few bugs with migrating comments inside of Echo it wasn't anything too difficult to address.<p>In short, I would say I would use Disqus where you prefer a free, simpler, easier to manage solution, where you do not need to white label (remove disqus branding), don't require or don't mind multiple logins (logging in to your site and also to disqus).<p>Use Echo if you want more options, greater ability to customize, the ability to white label and to do single sign on.<p>In both cases you will need to do extra work to get SEO credit for blog comments and deal with occasional network slowdowns. You also have to live with their time lines for rolling out updates and features. If commenting is core to your site you may well want to bring it in house, otherwise either of these products work well.",1281323581.0

I also have some experience with web development (LAMP). I'd like to get into mobile development (apps) for iOS, Android, etc. but quite frankly have no idea where to start.<p>If I choose a platform now (iOS or Android), am I essentially ""stuck"" in the platform or can I jump between the two? What do I need in terms of knowledge, skills, funds(?), to begin this learning process? The objective is to know enough to put together a team of devs, designers, to execute on B2B mobile apps.",1281323144.0
