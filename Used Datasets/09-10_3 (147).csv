Just like there is no ""Existential architecure"" and no ""Marxist architecture"".</i><p>I do not think this is true. Artistic and aesthetic judgments, in Objectivism, have philosophical meaning. Rand applied Objectivism to her novels in the same way Rand's characters would (explicitly or implicitly) apply Objectivism to their music or architecture or work.<p>To give an example (one Rand herself would likely be displeased with, but she is more than capable of being wrong about the consequences of her own philosophy), prog rock has a better philosophical foundation than punk rock. While punk rock is nihilistic and denies talent and beauty, prog rock exaults human talent. Punk rock is predicated on the idea that any idiot can thrash on a poorly-tuned guitar and make ""music"", and hence worships mediocrity; prog rock is predicated on taking rock seriously as a means of artistic expression and in pushing both form and effect to all conceivable limits, using the fullest of the musician's ability and creativity to do so. (If this reasoning is unconvincing to you, you're probably not much of an Objectivist. Or a prog rock snob, for that matter.)",1277524495

More unfortunately, the sound of describing the underpinnings of .NET as being ""30 years of carefully-optimized Windows C/C++ code"" is almost exactly not quite entirely unlike the sound produced in the Ferhfxian language of the insult, ""Your mother is very nice.

20,1463042,comment,1462802.0,1462802.0,0,0,NathanKP,,,"Windows 95 is still used extensively in embedded programming due to the unparalleled direct hardware access that it provides. When you are developing code for devices that use 8086, or even older FPGA's, you don't need the latest OS.  In fact, the newer versions of Windows have more security and device layers which block the operation of the older programs used for uploading code to those older microprocessors.<p>As a result, some of the old chipsets can only be programmed using old software which only works on 95.  For a business that does embedded programming it isn't feasible to switch to a new chipset that would require a complete code rewrite just so that they can use a newer OS.<p>Interestingly embedded programming is also an extremely high paying job because there aren't that many people who can do it.",1277523990

Among many Rubyists this means that if it isn't useful for Rails it doesn't exist, or doesn't matter.  That people are spiting themselves with this myopia doesn't seem to make a difference.  (My perhaps skewed impression is that many Rubyists are more likely to know about and appreciate ideas from non-Ruby projects, especially if the existing Ruby code is seen as a competitor to some favored app.)<p>I suppose, though, that if your particular community keeps repeating that it's the only community (e.g. Rails == Ruby), it just perpetuates.<p>Two, this diversity is  equally true of many other communities.

There are many intriguing things happening in the worlds of Haskell, Clojure, and JavaScript[0], and a good part of this  looks to be an openness to ideas and an appreciation of the diversity within their own ranks.

I thought only nations like ""Communist"" China did that. And here we all thought our civil liberties were worse off under Bush...<p>Remember the WL leaked secret DoD document containing the Pentagon's own plan to counter WL? Their plan was to cause a big enough PR incident to scare any future whistle-blowers into silence by creating the public perception that no matter who you are, if you leak extra-ordinary, critical national security information, then it's 100% guaranteed that you will be publically outed as a whistle-blower.<p>Isn't it remarkably convenient that the Pentagon's plan is <i>exactly</i> what is now occurring with Lamo's bizarrely out of place participation in this whole fiasco? There sure are a lot of false and scary headlines attacking the credibility of WL! I realize the other logical possibility is that the Pentagon plan to attack WL is itself a fake, and Lamo is doing all of this on purpose to stage an ""attack on WL"",\nso that WL can turn around and say ""see! the Pentagon is attacking us!"" You can't get better PR than that if it really blew up.<p>But when your lead source is also your lead witness, you have a serious credibility issue and have to assume the entire story is fiction. We may never know the truth.<p>And much like when you owe Don Corleone a ""favor"", after you get arrested for the kinds of crimes they did, and then the Feds hook you up with a sweetheart deal with the prosecution, it's pretty obvious who is the master and who is the puppet. Also consider the history of Lamo and Poulsen, and especially go back to Poulsen's self-promoting NYTimes hit pieces on Mitnick in the 90's. Then ask ""who is the most probable liar, these guys or WL?""<p>It's only a bonus that they can also create a media smokescreen around themselves to muddle an already subjective matter. From reading their writings and interviews over the past few years, they both come off as self-promoting fame whore types focused on selling an image of ""hackers."" Like drunken Hollywood starlets stumbling around a crowd of TMZ paps, their inserting of themselves into whatever issue they are ""reporting"" makes it impossible to take them seriously as journalists. (Only Hunter S. Thompson can be allowed to get away with that.)<p>I bet this makes them even <i>more</i> valuable as Federal snitches, since everyone will assume the reason Lamo and Poulsen even have anything to do with this incident is because they're promoting themselves.

Ironically, there's an undocumented seventh method that RIM will tell you about for $1,200. The details on how to access this without paying the RIM tax are readily available if you simply google ""blackberry undocumented mds-public"". The only rationale behind why they'd make this so difficult is that they didn't foresee the advent of 3rd party apps being written for the device, or alternatively, they just don't give a crap and think taxing people who develop for the platform is good business.<p>Forunately, as of 5.x, they finally provide a closed source class to get your device online; however, 90% or more of the phones on the market don't run 5.x, so you're still stuck figuring out how to do this yourself. This is discussed endlessly on the forums with each programmer posting his or her personal example of how to get their customers online and reading these posts has become pretty comical after a year of working on the platform.<p>Unfortunately, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Additional pains of working with Blackberries include the following.<p>* Five minute reboots between tests for any sizeable app<p>* HTTP requests must be constrained to a max of 100k<p>* Code signing requires a 3rd party server that's down frequently<p>* The simulator is constrained to 10k/sec downloads<p>* The Java API and UI toolkit are unbearably ancient<p>All this considered, I think RIM will continue for a good while in the same way Microsoft will. They're heavily entrenched and a lot of suits could give a crap about aesthetics. That being said, if you're thinking about exploring the Blackberry platform, there are better ways to spend your time.",1277522176

My key complaints are the complete lack of clarity as to what kind of thing split is, as well as what exactly is going on with select.
