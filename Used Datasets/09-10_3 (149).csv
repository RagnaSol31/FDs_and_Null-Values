If education can really make a difference, teachers would be able to raise money from VCs in order to educate inner city kids for no upfront fee and a large cut of their future pay. If they didn't behave that way, you might have to suspect that since spending billions of dollars on improving those schools and improving those students hasn't had any significant effect on their ability to learn, the problem is not with how hard we're trying, but with what we think we can accomplish.""<p>There's so many things wrong with this it was hard to know where to begin; to actually address this one just on the facts is like trying to refute the assertion ""colorless dreams sleep furiously"", but I'll do what I can.<p>Part 1: the ""teachers raising money from VCs"" scenario.<p>First, let's understand what I think he's saying. I think he's saying this:<p>- step 1: ""assume good education can raise someone's lifetime earning potential""<p>Hidden Assumptions in Step 1: none relevant.<p>- step 2: ""assuming good education raises someone's lifetime earning potential, a good teacher or teachers could get raise funds from investors and then educate people free-of-charge NOW in exchange for a sizable cut of the students' future lifetime earnings.""<p>Hidden Assumptions in Step 2: when he says ""would be able to raise money from VCs"" I assume he means ""it'd be a net-profitable endeavor to educate people NOW in exchange for a large cut of their future earnings, and thus investors would be willing to fund it."" I edited ""VCs"" to ""investors"" to be generous, and I'm assuming the investors want to see a profit (investors could do this out of charity -- let's call that a ""scholarship"" -- but for sake of argument let's stick to profit-seeking investors).<p>- step 3: ""if they didn't behave that way, then..."". By this, I'm going to assume he is saying ""clearly, people aren't investing in people's education in exchange for a percentage of their future earnings"".<p>I assume he is saying these kinds of investments aren't happening for the following reason: the rest of his ""argument"" depends on it not being the case that people are currently investing in schemes like the one we're sketching here.<p>Where does this get us? About how I summarized the ""rhetorical point"" last time:<p>""If education substantially improved people's future earning potential, it'd be a profitable investment to fund people's education NOW in exchange for a percentage of their future income, but you don't see that happening, which I choose to take as evidence in favor of my world view (which appears to be that there are many people who can't be educated).""<p>There's more ways than I have time for to make a mockery of that, but let's pick three of the easier one.<p>Firstly: there's an enormous industry dedicated to loaning people money to get an education. You can characterize this behavior as: ""paying for someone's education NOW in exchange for a portion of their future income"". It's not 100% isomorphic to his proposal, but it's quite close, don't you think? Most of the larger loans -- like for medical school or law school -- only make economic sense under the assumption the education received in law school or medical school leads to substantially increased earning ability once the education is finished.<p>Sure, student loans are debt and not equity, but they're quite cheap as a % of lifetime earnings (you'll find census figures for average lifetime earnings of college grads in the $2.1 million range versus average net indebtedness at graduation from a 4-year program in the $20k range if you search around; even assuming punitive interest leading to paying back a total of $40k you're talking < 2% of your lifetime earnings to pay for an undergraduate education; you'll find, if you crunch ",

For better or worse, telling Americans that they're not going to be able to eat meat at every meal is, for the time being, a non-starter.<p>The article is really interesting. I guess if the question is ""would it be cheaper to raise the food in the sun and drive it into town or use that energy to raise it in a building"" it's possible the answer would be the latter, particularly if we're talking specifically about ensuring caloric and nutritional production, not specific foods. Furthermore, there are other points on the continuum that may also work well, such as the large grocery store that has a huge garden inside for fresh ingredients.<p>I guess the proof is in the pudding. There must be a reason why foods are processed in rural areas and only transported into towns in high calorie form (HFCS, beef, concentrated juices). I suspect subsidies contribute, of course.

The second part is I try to review all the things I have captured on a daily, and weekly basis. If I am not currently working on a project, then I try to be open to inspiration, total cheese I know, but I find that if I ""force"" it, like for the next hour I am going to work on having a good idea, I fail. My best idea/projects have all come in a bit and pieces and then they all of a sudden form into a solid idea. When I have an idea, I then try and build a prototype as fast as possible. At that point I am usually in a position to decided if I should continue, shelve, or give up. In the end whatever you decided to do, make sure you try and work with the intention of getting better at something. If you do that, in the long run it doesn't matter if you fail at a project because you still learned something along the way.",1233630043.0

In some cases, I wouldn't know what to do without them, and I enjoy the fact that Python makes it seem very natural to be passing them around.",1233630017.0
