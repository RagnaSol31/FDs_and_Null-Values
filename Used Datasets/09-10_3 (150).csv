After all, friendships are really just a regular series of communications with people we tend to agree with.  We can even be changed / motivated by people we've never actually met, such as politicians, actors, preachers, whomever.  So clearly you don't even need a two-way communication for this to work.  It's also possible to be affected by an 'enemy' if you spend enough time with them.  So clearly you don't even have to see the person as a friend to accept influence, although it's likely that the less you respected the source, the less influence they woudl have.  And it's also clear that, unless this process takes place over time, it's unlikely to be 'life changing'.<p>I can see how a book of repetitive phrases would tap into the same process that causes us to be influenced by friends and other people we respect.  The book is really just a way of a message being communicated back to us.  You could probably think of it as a hack to get positive ideas burnt into your subconcious on a large scale.  And also, it's obviously important that you respect the book (and by extension, the author).  Friendships work when you let the friends have influence over your life because you value their opinion.<p>I read a lot of these types of books, and I've been questioned why.  I figure I'm just going to spend the time either reading fiction books or watching TV, anyway, so why not?",1290654667.0

I would trust that a dog would be able to detect a bomb on a person much more readily than a person who's eyes are glazed over after looking at the nth person's scan or pat-down. And they gladly work for just love and kibble. Of course the TSA claims they are able to detect weapons such as guns and knives too, but I believe metal detectors are probably just as effective along with secure cockpits, air marshals on-board, and a public ready to fight back if necessary.

For one, latency is a killer (we're talking people's home/work computer being used here) which means it'll only really work on embarrasingly-parallel problems, and secondly the inherent unreliability of the nodes themselves: a MapRejiuce computation will be terminated as soon as the user closes their browser window/tab.
