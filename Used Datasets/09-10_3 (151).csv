Show it to industry contacts.  Have them tell you ""this is interesting, but it's not really what we need right now.  However, if you could solve this problem for us, we'd pay you money for it.""  Get them to pay up-front to fund development.  Build the product with their money.  Sell product to other customers.  Reinvest the profits.  (my day job, also Sun Microsystems and Franz Inc.)<p>Find a group of passionate enthusiasts.  Write software for them, and charge money for it.  Partner with a business that benefits from what you're doing.  Always look for underserved markets, and then opportunistically go after them with cheap products.  Iterate quickly.  Take over the world.  (Microsoft)<p>Build website.  Convince friends to join.  Serendipitously discover that friends tell all their friends about it.  Overload servers.  Charge money for premium features to keep servers running.  Make modest profit off of it.  (LiveJournal, Flickr).<p>Same as above, but provide ways for people to make money off your product (selling services to each other, for example).  Take a cut of their revenues.  (EBay, PayPal, Second Life, Microsoft).<p>Get people laid.  Profit.  (HotOrNot, PlentyOfFish)",1189392588

Brands likes to mention how perfect Credentica is, but it isn't deployed anywhere. OpenID may turn out to be the worst identity protocol, except for all the others that have been tried.",1189392566

While everybody who's built a business (I'm on my second) has at least a few things to teach others in the same boat...I didn't want to clutter up the post with a bunch of random rants.

But we were moving full steam ahead whether YC was involved or not.  As others mentioned, we were launched, we were selling products, and we were developing the connections we needed to get to where we wanted to be.  YC just accelerated that, gave me the impetus I needed to get moved to the valley, and gave us a chance to hone our message and our product under the discriminating eye of a lot of smart people.  Well worth the time, effort, and equity.<p>But there would still be a Virtualmin, Inc. without YC, and it would still be building products that people like.",1189391494

Finding 30 investors that will sit through your demo is something most developers don't know anything about.  GGP is conspicuously silent on how to pull off <i>that</i> trick without YC.<p>> There's a difference between ""Getting into YC would help my business"" and ""I need to get into YC to start my business"".<p>Astounding!

I believe that we are in a world that favors Kerry's style of decision making over Bush's.  But, that's a claim about the world, not a value judgment about Kerry, per se.",1189390226
