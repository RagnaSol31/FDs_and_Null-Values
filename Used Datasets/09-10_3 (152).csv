Here are the cliff notes.<p>- Constantly review<p>- People and how they function are more important than ideas; ideas come as a result<p>- Do not let success mask problems, do deep assessments<p>- Organizations fall over by default, slowly enough that you don't notice it<p>- Everything you do has to be original, you can't repeat yourself, dig deeper, you're always missing something important<p>What strikes me is how they've internalized successive originality in each project.

I've only done fairly straightforward web programming, with Spring, Struts 2, and Hibernate.  It was a hassle to get it all set up, but I blame Spring for that, not Maven.  The conventions seem to work very well, since you can just follow a standard directory structure.<p>I've found it particularly easy to use mvn war:war to create a war file, which is why I wish the author had elaborated a bit on why he needed to ""reconfigure the conventions"".<p>I have no argument with the author's preference for rake (and rails, for that matter), which is a far more pleasant environment than maven, spring, struts 2 (or something else), and hibernate, but of all this, Maven (I'm talking about Maven 2 here) was by far the most pleasant part of the stack for me.<p>One last thing - I promise I'm not being glib, feigning misunderstanding where I actually disagree.

Most modern games are extremely complex and have a graduated system in which you master one aspect before moving on to the next.

33,1026634,comment,1026435.0,1026435.0,0,0,jsdalton,,,"I had a similar idea to this a while back. But instead of mapping URLs to transactions, you would map URLs to a fixed denomination of currency.<p>So, for example, the URL <a href=""http://eepay.com/usd/10/agh38hj3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eepay.com/usd/10/agh38hj3</a> would represent a $10 USD note, payable by the entity that issued it.<p>Ownership of a particular currency ""note"" would be handled via a private key. In other words, the individual in possession of a private key for a given URL would be considered the ""owner"" of that note. With that private key, one could either redeem the currency in question or transfer ownership to someone else. Transfer of ownership would be handled via a secure handshake, in which the new owner of the note is given a new private key, which can then be verified.<p>Obviously this is all very low level, so actual transactions would abstract away most of this.<p>The advantage of this type of currency would be that it is anonymous and doesn't require a whole lot of verification information for every little purchase. This would make it ideal for microtransactions, or for transactions where you wouldn't want to reveal your identity.<p>The disadvantage is that it would be a challenge to keep private keys secure. Another obvious disadvantage is that such currency would only be successful if it was backed by a highly trusted institution. There are other challenges and disadvantages to be sure.",1262399401.0

Why not? It's got a subject -- it -- and it's got a verb -- is.<p>Further, English has subject-verb agreement not subject-object agreement or verb-object agreement, hence ""it is pancakes"" is completely fine. Sure there maybe be some semantic anomalies, what with the singularity of the subject, the plurality of the object, and the copula which provides some sense of equivalence between them, but that's entirely a semantic issue and not a grammatical one.<p>Further further, setting off non-sentences by periods is common practice. You may not like it, but everyone else accepts it. You're just an idiot.<p>Further further further, ""it's"" is completely acceptable English, and isn't an official contraction only because there ARE no official contractions -- unlike French, with its (wholly impotent) French Academy, there is no authority on English, and thus no such thing as official English. The best we can do (as if we should care) is to reference the great authors of English literature (whoever they may be) and if you go by them, then you're most certainly wrong.<p>Further further further further, it's not your language, it's everyones, and I think the headline is fine; and they're not abusing it, they're using it in a completely standard fashion.<p></actual linguist>",1262398033.0

The question as you formulate it will probably lead to more of the same books popping up over and over again, but that's probably okay.<p>I actually wrote about the topic here: <a href=""http://jseliger.com/2009/12/27/the-years-best-in-reading-not-in-publishing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com/2009/12/27/the-years-best-in-reading-not...</a> . Of the books on the list, I'd say that Daniel Gilbert's _Stumbling on Happiness_ and Lev Grossman's _The Magicians_ were my favorite. Both might not qualify as ""great,"" but they both moved me and made me think, which few books accomplish.",1262397872.0

With OSX's file sharing you have to manually drag your file into the shared folder (assuming you've enabled it) - and unless you want anyone to be able to access it willy-nilly, you're going to have to password it (possibly resulting in creating a new account on your machine). Sound fun yet?<p>At least it beats Windows - Windows file sharing is equally convoluted, and on top of it will fail to connect in almost every single networking environment I've ever tried it in. So on top of being hard to use, it just doesn't WORK.<p>The solution is so convoluted, and fits the standard use case so poorly, that it may as well not exist at all. IMHO the bar to beat is the memory stick - if I can share a file with someone in the room for less effort than copying it onto a USB stick, we've won.",1262397678.0
