There is the one famous example of the filter circuit where even the designers of the software couldn't figure out how the damn thing worked, but work it did. Parts connected in the weirdest ways and if you took them out the circuit stopped to function. Apparently the genetic algorithm had in its feeback loop discovered some none-trivial parasitic effects of some components. No sane designer would have done it that way, but that's beside the point because the filter had less parts than any designed by humans directly.<p>I'm very strongly a believer in the material consciousness,<p>The emperors new mind was an interesting read but I found it to be a tremendous buildup to an almost magical reliance on quantum mechanics to provide us with our consciousness.<p>I don't have much with magic so I'll stick with regular physics and chemistry until it has been proven otherwise.<p>There are too many brain-computer analogies to avoid the strong suggestion that the brain computes. It doesn't do it in a way that we can hook up a debugger to just yet but it does seem to have a lot in common. It's more of an architecture/interface problem.<p>But strong AI probably won't come from being able to interface with the brain or from a sudden leap of insight in how it all works. I think strong AI will follow from a seed AI which in turn will follow from some relatively simple breakthrough or insight that we still haven't gotten around to.<p>The simulation of the cortex of simple mammals is another such step in between, do you have a reference for that ?",1249354736.0

I remember going into the office with him when he had to work on a weekend; he showed me how he was using something like $100k worth of parallel processing hardware to make a little gray-scale Mandelbrot set.<p>His first response to any new system is still to write a Mandelbrot generator. When he semi-retired from his position doing system-level C stuff a few years ago, he decided to give Java a try. He occasionally emails me video explorations of the Mandelbrot sets he has generated. I have a photographic print he made hanging up on my wall right now.<p>First time he tried to get them to print out one of his images, the person at the one-hour photo at Wal-Mart told him the picture was unprintable, despite multiple tries.

Because of this, I estimate English is already the language in which I've done most of my reading and a fair share of my writing.<p>I can relate to what you say, because for quite a time when trying to express myself formally I used to end up resorting to a lot of transliterated Castillian constructs and phraseology. Other times, ideas would come in English and I'd try and find a Galician equivalent. I only got past that after a conscious decision to immerse myself in Galician and Portuguese literature. Sometimes I still feel like learning my native language as a second language.<p>And I'd be at a loss if I had to talk about programming related concepts in anything but English.

Things like tabs. Why is it  that in Emacs you can't just define a soft tabstop of 4 spaces? Why do I have to define a list of column numbers? Don't get me wrong, the idea that I could manually define a bunch of column numbers so that the tabstops were uneven for a particular application would is cool... by why can't I just say ""every 4th column is a tabstop"" and have Emacs apply that until infinity columns? And there is the lack of things like Vim's "":set list"" mode to quickly visualize if a bunch of spacing consists of tabs, spaces or a mixture (and to quickly figure out where trailing whitespaces are).<p>These are all things that I can get on default Vim without any configuration.
