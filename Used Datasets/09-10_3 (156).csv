Can I use it in my own home, business, or vehicle?<p>> No. Jamming devices may not be used regardless of whether the device is operated on public or private property. If you own a jammer, do not continue to operate it. You risk substantial fines (of up to $16,000 for each violation or each day of a continuing violation, or up to $112,000 for a single act); seizure of the device by the government; and criminal imprisonment.
