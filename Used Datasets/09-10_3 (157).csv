1,455696,comment,455637.0,455637.0,0,0,steveplace,,,"I went to a very large public university. The engineering program was so-so, and they valued ABET over actual learning.<p>Senior Design was known as the ""gauntlet,"" not necessarily due to the actual building of something, but for the 100-page research paper that they required. They assumed that if each member of the team writes about 25 pages, then they <i>must</i> understand the underlying concepts.<p>This didn't affect me as much as it did my team. As you can tell, my long-windedness knows no bounds when behind a keyboard. My team however had the collective grammatical know-how of [insert punchline here].<p>It was my job to proofread the paper. It was straight copy and paste. Utter bullshit.<p>And I understand that it was my ethical obligation to correct this, if not report it. But it was clearly stated at the beginning of the class: ""if one fails, you all fail."" I was not prepared to deal with that. So I compromised my standards and just finished the assignment.<p>I knew that there wouldn't be repercussions; all they do is count the number of pages, make sure there isn't too much whitespace, and that there's no more than 50% of space devoted to pictures.<p>What can be done? With this particular example there was a large discrepancy with the overall goals that <i>should have</i> been, the goals that were, and the metrics that they measured it.",1233197955.0

One of the chapters tells the story of Steven Brill a man who, after hearing New York Cab Drivers were all dishonest, decided to look into it.  He decided to get in a bunch of cabs, pretend to be an out-of-towner and asks to be driven somewhere really close to see if the cab driver would rip him off.  This was the result (from the book)...<p>“One driver out of thirty-seven cheated him.  The rest took him directly to his destination and charged him correctly.  Several refused to take him when his destination was only a block or two away, even getting out of their cabs to show him how close he already was.  The greatest irony is that several drivers warned him that New York City was full of crooks and to be careful.<p>You will continue to read stories of crookedness and corruption-of policemen who lie and steal, doctors who reap where they do not sew, politicians on the take.

My main user is always myself.<p>Startups fascinate me because so little has been done. Each movement innovates very slightly. One person will add one neat feature to a site and then everybody else steals that and creates a lot of repetitive iterations on that theme.<p>When I work on startups, I kind of reflect that belief. I've had a few ideas - none of them launched until this current one - and with each one I tried to start from nothing and create stuff specifically to meet the content type. I'd call it ""working with art"" but that sounds really snotty. What it means is that I try to make every page I design something special. I want people to click a link and fall in love with the next page that loads. Splash page, deletion page, everything. I like having a site where each page is specially crafted.<p>So that's that. I view money as a similar artistic goal of sorts. I think that creating profit should be as unique as a web site. I guess it's a part of my goal, too - I <i>do</i> want to be filthy rich - but more than that, it's part of the process. I'll know I've made something meaningful when it makes me rich.<p>Glamor? From designing web sites?<p>I like learning new things as I design. Absolutely. But I get experience for everything. I learned graphic design to make a book cover, and in making a book I learned some things that I used for designing a blog theme, and I learned from that to make the first draft of my site's design.<p>Freedom's found everywhere. Maybe I'm young or an asshole, but I've never been in a situation where I feel caged. I would go work at the movie theater with ten sheets of paper and write. When I'm in class I take notes on one page and draft layouts on another. And I've always felt free to refuse to do things. One day in my senior year, I walked out of class, quit my job, and rode my bike to the library, because I felt too restricted doing what I'd been doing for a while. I always feel that freedom that comes from my knowing I'm doing what I want to do.<p>Wow.
