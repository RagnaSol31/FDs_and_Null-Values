With this system, every minor lag blip for more than one frame, which I will be generous and assume will be 30fps and thus 33ms (rather than 60fps) will manifest as total game freeze, because every minor lag blip is logically equivalent to walking up to your real-life XBox and just disconnecting the video cable, assuming a TV that would then hold the previous frame instead of dropping the picture.<p>There's no way in hell this thing is going to play FPSs.

Refund and move on does not.<p>2)  This causes customer friction.  The annoyance of the prospect of having to justify yourself to an uncaring CS grunt in India destroys the value of having the guarantee in the first place, which is to make purchasing from you look like a risk-free endeavor.<p>3)  Any customer can get a refund any time they want by calling up their credit card company and humming a few bars about ""Internet merchant did not live up to their claims"".  This is called a chargeback and it means the merchant just lost $15 to $25 plus the refunded amount.<p>4)  Product quality is much more effective than hoops in decreasing the number of refunds.  (""Good relations with the customer"" is more important than either.  You know how bedside manner is a better predictor of malpractice claims than clinical outcomes?  Same story.)<p>[Edit to add: incidentally, the reason Apple has refunds is to zealously protect their ""All interactions with Apple should be mindblowingly awesome for our customers"" reputation.  This is the same reason that they make it essentially impossible for developers to be anything other than an anonymous cog behind a shiny new icon -- anything else and you're a risk to the True Apple Brand Experience.

We are currently in a momentary I/O bobble that will resolve itself in a year or two with solid state drives (which, by their fast pace of development, seem eager to catch up to all the other components of the computer), leaving only multicore to deal with, which putting this sort of thing in the cloud can hardly ignore either.<p>By the time this thing comes out, the box + one year of service will almost certainly cost more than an XBox 360, and will probably be going head-to-head with the ""Playstation 4"" or the ""XBox 720"" with what is now the current gen readily available for $50. The PS4/XBox360 will probably be bragging about pushing 120Hz of 1080P with surround sound.<p>My minor complaint is that this just won't work on a consumer grade network, full stop.

53,532832,comment,532665.0,532665.0,0,0,chime,,,"<i>sigh</i><p>I just got home from my evening MBA class after a full day of work. I'm the Director of IT at a pharmaceutical manufacturer in Florida and graduated with 4.0 in CS and Econ with Math minor as my undergrad. After my MBA, I'm hoping to pursue a CS/Math PhD degree and I consider myself a lifelong student with no desire to make millions. I mentioned all of this because I want to make it clear that my reasons to defend the pursuit of an MBA program is solely academic in nature and not based on the potential earnings or promotions. I could make a lot more by switching companies, networking, or working overtime. I don't have to get an MBA just to make more money.<p>An MBA from a good university is HARD and enlightening work. Yes, the barrier to entry is pretty low and I've had the mis-experience of being in groups where 35 year old finance majors with 8 years of field experience didn't know how to use the Excel SUM() function. Nevertheless, the professors are extremely experienced, industry stalwarts from all sorts of background. Tonight an ex-IBM'er with 20+ years of Sales & Marketing experience across various IT sectors taught me about building customer value.<p>Here on HN we see blog posts by know-it-all nobodies dispense wisdom on ""10 ways to blah blah"" and all of us discuss the merits and demerits of the post for hours and days. An MBA is a superset of that, formalized and organized. Yes, you can learn business skills anywhere, especially by running your own company. However, that does not mean you cannot benefit from decades of knowledge, wisdom, and research in every field from finance to management to marketing. The goal of a well-designed MBA program is to equip you with the knowledge and skill to make better decisions in addition to letting you employ your gut instincts and intelligence in your ventures.<p>The problem with MBA programs is that too many people treat them as ""bigger paycheck"" tickets and smaller universities lower their standards to welcome anyone who can pay them $20K/year. This has the negative side-effect of making even the hard-working MBA graduates appear to be useless greedy monsters like this article portrays.<p>> The reality is that business school is now chiefly a community of intention. It brings together people who share certain career aspirations—for the most part, to make big bucks—and occupies their time teaching them a few technical things that they don't need to know, along with a code of conduct that says, in essence, whatever is legal is ethical; and if it makes money, it's a positive duty. It's now clear that we would have all been much better off if, instead of cloistering these people on fancy campuses with world-class golf courses, we'd have sent them off to do two years of national service.<p>This entire paragraph is a complete load of crap. Over and over our professors, books, seminars, and presentations mention that doing the right, socially-beneficial thing is the only way to go. We read cases about bad businesses, identify the good ones, and isolate the bad ones pretending to be good. Not once has any of my professors even so much as sugar-coated what Enron, Worldcom, Lehman, AIG, or any of the tons of other companies have done as being acceptable. Yes, profit and shareholder value maximization is the legal requirement for any public corporation but not at the cost of long-term corporate and social goals.<p>Sorry about the rant but I'm pretty sick of the dumb-greedy-MBA stereotype. Everything I learn in school at night, I get to immediately apply it at my job the next morning. My advice to anyone reading this is if you have a technical background and have often lacked in management and leadership skills, an MBA from a good university will genuinely help you be a well-rounded entrepreneur. Don't have unrealistic expectations about suddenly being transformed into Steve Jobs but do realize that leadership skills can be learned and 360-degree knowledge of business operations (from tech to finance to sales) will make you a very valuable asset to any organization, including the one that you start.",1238033025

Indeed, depending on additional labels (class or continuous value) which can be used (or available) on none of the patterns, on a subset of the patterns or on all of them, unsupervised or supervised learning can be sequentially performed. When there is no prior knowledge on the problem to be solved, knowledge extraction may use an unsupervised neural network as a front-end for forecasting applications or extracting rules. Because of its synthesis capabilities, an unsupervised neural network can be used both for limiting the computation complexity and for extracting the most significant knowledge. Moreover, knowledge extraction is facilitated as soon as multi-viewpoint unsupervised neural network model is used. This kind of methods also allows using in a second step additional information when it is available for optimizing a forecasting problem. However, for a forecasting problem where all patterns are labelled, classical networks using supervised learning can be successfully improved by finding the minimal architecture using pruning algorithms. The pruning methods consist in removing, during learning, the connections or neurons, or both, that have the least influence on the system's performance. Reducing the complexity of the networks prevents overtraining and allows easier implementation and knowledge extraction (variable selection, rule extraction). In any case, combining several models into a committee helps to improve the quality of the knowledge extracted or the forecasting and the proposed methods must be efficient for typical real-world in our domain, dealing with large amount of noisy and temporal data. Both topics are recently developed in the project.<p>I actually think that, in OpenCog, for example, reasoning or other systems could take advantage of a SNN to provide rule selection or knowledge extraction, etc.<p>So the point is that even though they might be completely ignoring most higher-level necessary aspects of human cognition, a more comprehensive system can still benefit from incorporating SNNs.",1238032828
