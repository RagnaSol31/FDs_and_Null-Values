I didn't mean to downplay the importance of QA (the world would suck without it, for sure) nor the importance of QA positions.  It just isn't development, which was what I was looking to do.  I agree very much with Joel Spolsky's thoughts on the subject. <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000067.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000067.html</a><p>As to my story, I was placed into QA in the ""choice"" program because they misrepresented the role (it was an internship).  The skills required listed C programmer, but on the first day, I was told there would be no programming.<p>The first few weeks I configured test beds.  This was a lot of installation of server stuff (mostly following check lists) and configuration of networks.  This was very IT'ish, and though important (and it sparked my interest in how exactly networks work, which I followed up on my own time), it wasn't what I was hoping for.<p>I got into automated testing shortly thereafter because they needed someone to do it and I had a lot of programming experience.  I coded in Java using an IBM testing thing and a company framework provided by another QA person.  This framework was buggy and _completely_ undocumented.  In one place, there were 14 nested If/For's.  There were obvious design flaws.  Not only that, the person who wrote it was wholly unavailable (constantly busy).  She did find time to do reviews when I only had an hour left in the internship to respond to them.  Ironically, one complaint was that I recreated her functionality in some parts (if only I'd KNOWN about it!)<p>So, in short, my experience dictates that QA in large organizations means people that don't give a crap and do the bare minimum.  I don't know if this is a QA problem or a large corporation problem, but no thanks to either.",1249854902.0

5,751358,comment,750916.0,751284.0,0,0,caffeine,,,"It's important to distinguish weight loss from fat loss.  We want the latter - the former in itself is not particularly desirable (except perhaps for ice fishing).<p>- When I exercise, I tend to build muscle (and sore legs).<p>- When I eat less, I tend to lose some weight.<p>- When I exercise but eat more, weight goes up - because I'm gaining <i>muscle.</i><p>So far, so good.  But the above is completely meaningless.  What really matters is:<p>- If I'm exercising a lot and eating reasonably, my weight goes up, BUT my %BF (percent body fat) goes down, because I'm gaining more muscle than fat.<p>- If I'm doing low-intensity exercise and eating sparingly, my weight goes down, but my %BF remains stable.<p>- If I exercise like crazy and eat very little, my weight goes down and my % BF goes down.  This happens rarely because it requires inhuman willpower.<p>The point of this (admittedly anecdotal) chart is that <i>weight</i> change and %BF change are NOT correlated.  In particular, the way one achieves a low body fat is:<p>1. Increase muscle, lowering %BF.<p>2. Lower overall weight, causing net fat loss AND muscle loss, probably increasing %BF slightly.<p>3. GOTO 1.<p>If you lose more %BF on step 1 than you gained on step 2, you win. This zig-zag is what body builders do, because it's nearly the only method that works.  And step 2 is very diet-sensitive, and rather finicky.<p>And that is why the article sounded stupid to me.  The study, in particular, of women who exercised intensively compared to those who didn't.  I hope they measured % body fat in that study, because it's the <i>only</i> thing that matters when talking about obesity.<p>When the article says something like ""Everybody lost a bit of weight, but some of the exercisers gained weight!  So exercise doesn't make you thin.""  That's crap. ""Lean"" is a measure of % body fat, not total body mass.  The exercisers probably decreased %BF if their weight remained stable. In other words, they probably look better now than they did.",1249854780.0

Of course not...it's a web app, and it needs to talk to a web server as an intermediary to a jabber server somewhere.  I can log in using a desktop GUI jabber client to an actual XMPP listener if I want to, and that is what is important.  I don't care one whit about the protocol that GMail Chat uses to talk to its back end.  That's a private matter between Google and Google.<p>It's not the browser-server protocol that needs to be specified, but rather some other client-server protocol, without any assumption that the client is a browser.<p>It seems to me that the relationship between ""the web"" and Wave is entirely incidental, stemming from the fact that their reference client runs in a browser.  One might well write a client in Cocoa or GTK, in which case an open specification for how Google's Wave client, written in GWT, communicates with its back end does us no good at all.<p>However, I'm willing to give it time.
