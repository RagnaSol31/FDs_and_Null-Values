I'm certainly not saying it doesn't play a part, but it's still a hotly debated question among experts as to what is ultimately responsible for the crime drop.

Either in person or via a conference feedback mechanism. It <i>really</i> helps to know what's working and what needs further improvement. And it's a good first point of contact for networking.<p>2) Apply to become a speaker! Start from somewhere small (or not) and go from there. It's too easy to convince yourself you've got nothing people want to hear. A few years I started with speaking at a local evening event in a town in New Zealand--this year I'll be speaking and running an extremely well received workshop at OSCON for the third year in a row.<p>* Blatant plug:<p>If you <i>are</i> going to be at OSCON (the O'Reilly Open Source Convention in Portland, Oregon) in July and want to learn how to get started with the Arduino consider attending my ""Get Started with the Arduino - A Hands-On Introductory Workshop"" <a href=""http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012/public/schedule/detail/23941"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012/public/schedule/detail/23941</a>. In the previous two years we've introduced about sixty people to the awesome & fun world of Arduino. It's also been one of the highest rated tutorials at the conference for both years which makes me think I must be doing something right. :)<p>Also, if you're interested in creating Android accessories with the Arduino you should also check out my ""Arduino & Handbag: Create Android Accessories Without Android Code"" presentation: <a href=""http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012/public/schedule/detail/23946"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012/public/schedule/detail/23946</a><p>And apparently if you use this promotion code you'll get 20% of registration for the conference: OS12FOS<p>/end blatant plug :)",1336185819.0
