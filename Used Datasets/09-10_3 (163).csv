You can get an early lead like that but eventually open systems and open markets win out.<p>It is all in the numbers.  Sure there is MUCH more mediocrity when you open it up, and you can control and only allow the best in a closed market.  But in the end the percentage of better systems at the upper threshold of the open system will always beat the best hand picked companies that can participate.  One big reason is competition, the other is greed and laziness that comes with that.",1213415629

But yep welcome to America where if you say anything that is too passionate about something or if you have an artistic, natural take on things people quickly identify you and say you are smoking the funny stuff.  Keep that mindset and never create something new or a new take on things.<p>Tell me why you like explosions and fireworks? I personally think that if we come from stars or the cosmos it has greater meaning than just bright lights, big color, sensory overload.  It could mean life or the start of this whole system.<p>Or we could all just not think too far out of the box because it is safe and we wont' be marked for smoking the reefs because it is not the normal way to look at things.<p>Now go back to your pharma meds that are acceptable because they shut down passionate thinking or pondering.",1213415454

I am sad for california if what you say is true (although that was not my experience <i>at all</i> when I spent time there).<p>Even when I visit NYC I don't feel that people are so hurried, pushy, and selfish as boston. When you penetrate the shell, and aren't in traffic, a line, or on the T, Boston folks can be friendly. Sadly, my very pregnant wife frequently is left standing on the T in boston--often no one offers her, or the 80 year old who happens to be on board, a seat.",1213415379

As I look at the shelf of books I choose to place within arm reach of where I code,  probably half came from SoftPro and a goodly armful from Victor Hugo.<p>If the internet didn't offer a way to buy used editions from anywhere in the nation, I'd have to make a yearly pilgrimage back to Cambridge with a buying list.
