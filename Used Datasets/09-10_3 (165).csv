1,247322,comment,246298.0,247315.0,0,0,rms,,,"Questionable, sure, but there's an easy answer. Right now on the Techcrunch homepage there are two stories about small startups. One is a blog and one has $1MM worth of funding.<p>Techcrunch doesn't really cover prefunded startups anymore. They do more mainstream news about Facebook and Yahoo and Apple. As far as pre or microfunded startups go, YC is as good as it gets, so Techcrunch covers YC startups. Certainly they are much better than the average unfunded or microfunded startup.",1216180709.0

What's even more amazing is that these people are able to hold a job, earn a living, and have a family.<p>People who have higher thinking skills live in an entirely different world from the mainstream of humanity.

Each customer can set their own price bonus for running their lot.  High price, faster velocity, product available sooner.  It is an open market where you are competing against all the other lots in the fab.  the indivduals running the lots can then decide if it's more worth their time to wait for the 1 really valuable lot or run 10 cheaper lots.",1216180078.0

We know that Web users have little patience for forms with too many fields, pages that take a second too long to load, text that runs more than a couple sentences, and so on.

There are plenty of cases of children who grow up in virtually identical environments, yet go on to have widely varying interests.

I kinda get a feel for what you're trying to do and there's definitely a good idea lurking in here somewhere. I am reasonably convinced your present implementation is not /quite/ right, but as long as you're agile on your feet and respond to what feels the right thing to do, you might end up with a hit.<p>Turning these sorts of ideas into hits is a bit like landing a helicopter onto an invisible boat. There's no target, you're just flapping around in the breeze, but if you delicately push it the right way, you might end up with something (or nothing).",1216177229.0
