0,244863,story,,,3,4,shergill,Ask YC: How to turn my website into iphone app?,,Hi guys. I run a social networking site. I am thinking about writing a iphone app that lets people log in to send/receive messages to their friends. So basically all this capability is available from the website. I would like to write a iphone application to do the same. I know I can use the iPhone SDK to create an application but what I am not sure about is how to let that application connect to my site. Do I just write some php pages that return xmlrpc data that my application then just parses to display? So meaning that the iPhone app will call a 'web url' .. make a request.. get back some xml data and then display that? Is that the general idea??<p>Thanks!,1215921494

Find out the average revenue per visitor from AdWords and set your CPC below this. Instant profits(after some trial and error). The great thing about AdWords is you can get visitors and feedback within hours. You can launch a site in a day and get a sample of how well it will work.<p>2. Organic Link Building. This is the creme de le creme. \n2a. Getting a blogger to write about you. New blog posts get picked up in search engines pretty quick, which will improve your SER. Also initial visits from a well read blog can be substantial.\n2b. Social news sites(Digg, Reddit, Twitter, etc.). I haven't mastered these yet, but are pretty effective even when you're just starting out. Not only do they drive some traffic, some of them help with SER.\n2c. Commenting on blogs. This seems to also drive some initial traffic and improve SER.<p>3. Yahoo Search Marketing and Microsoft AdCenter. Same as AdWords except less traffic. However, often the visitors from these sites will earn you more/sign up more often.<p>4. Viral strategies. Email campaigns, referrals, making silly YouTube clips.<p>5. Main stream media. Gives you a short burst and then improved SER.",1215920919

7,244856,comment,244464.0,244464.0,0,0,SingAlong,,,"Yeah! The author is damn right about Google. Until I read this post I was a diehard G fan. Anything G was cool to me. It just took me a few seconds to realize the situation. Most who hate Microsoft's expensive products say that they like Google since its more open. Many ditch MS products and go for Google's. Even I ditched MS office and use Google Docs. But only now realize that I am becoming increasingly dependant on Google. I accept that they build really cool and simple products. But every cool G prod seems to come with an visibly invisible string. Example: they introduced appengine. And they have a Users API which makes a devs job easy but it only works with G accounts. So if u want to have your own accounts system, you have to build it yourself. If Google was really open, they would have had a 'more' general Users API, or atleast the current one with the option of OpenID.<p>They make their buck when you read a mail in the inbox. And most feel that the strip on top of the inbox is to show news. Well how many times do u see news? I often see 'sponsored link'.<p>Their vision of ""making everything web-based"" means what it reads to us. But to G it means having a Google Accounts login for everything and then making money from the ads or using the userdata as stats to build more prods with the G login.<p>Why talk about open-Bigtable or open-Google Docs? They haven't even made the WYSIWYG editor that's used in Gmail as Opensource. They build most of their apps by modding some other opensource software. Google Mashup Editor uses Codepress. Google Video Player was built on VLC media player.<p>We fail to understand that Google is like any other company(infact a worse demon). The only difference is that they try to slit your throat politely instead of rudely slaughtering you with ads. I am shifting to OpenOffice.  :)<p>Atleast MS and Apple are being honest and gutsy by 'selling' their software/hardware without much visibly 'invisible' strings like  having you to login to Windows with your LiveID or having to use sync an iPhone with Mac OS only or even worse... restricting calls by allowing only iphone-to-iphone calls.<p>Now its a serious 'Hero Wanted!!!' situation. We need someone who can stop G's monopoly game, a MS-Y! combo will not do much damage to G! And the hero to crush G will have to do it for everyone's good and not to start his monopoly.<p>One simple and collective method of doing it is mass adoption of OpenID. We have OpenID sites. But they have alternative login. Getting OpenID into mainstream as the 'only' login system for most sites. My pledge: my next site will use OpenID.",1215920621

A giraffe is unable to eat food that is not in trees.</i><p>We are in agreement, and I give you credit for explaining the point better than I did.<p>I also probably should have been more specific when I said it's dangerous to believe that ""women [are] wired for different work than men"".  I'm not arguing that women and men are the same in every way.  Clearly there are differences.  I'm saying it's unfortunate to take a problem like the low number of women founders and to use Darwinian theory to say ""women just aren't wired for this type of <i>intellectual</i> work.""  This makes it all too easy to overlook other causes of the problem and, as you point out, can lead to discrimination in various forms.<p>Indeed, someone just posted this timely article on HN today about a study showing that ""boys are not innately better at maths than girls, and any difference in test scores is due to nurture rather than nature.""\n<a href=""http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,,2283083,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,,2283083,00....</a>",1215920413

I think this a strong indication that gender roles are becoming less important in culture.  Additionally you can see this in the current political strife on similar topics.<p>So to put all of those things aside, lets just look at the numbers.  Marquette the school I went to had an engineering degree program with 40-60% female.  It was the highest in the country while I was attending, and the topic of choice .....<p>Biology.<p>So, I had the chance to ask many of them why they chose that field and the response was ALWAYS, that they wanted to help people.<p>I think ability is not the root here, but it is the drive, and I think the women out there that have the personality and the drive to be entrepreneurs do not have an economic model that matches their interests.<p>I am willing to bet that as greentech becomes a viable industry to start a company you will see more women entering the entrepreneurship game.  So, if it is still some sort of preference to help people and the world, why is that so?  I don't know but thank God someone wants to do something more.<p>I think that if you are going to support a climate for female entrepreneur's you are going to have to find a way to create a community (YC seems to be a good start) and a way for the process to feel personable rather than abstract.<p>Jessica, maybe you can organize a few geek dinners to get female entrepreneurs together talking about what they would of like to have had when they were starting a company?  I am sure you will find it much different than what the guys needed.",1215918805
