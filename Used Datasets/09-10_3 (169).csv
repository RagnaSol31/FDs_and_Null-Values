A site can't put up a TOS that says you can't access through a proxy and then wait for it happen to sue. The web would be chocked full of liabilities if shit like that were allowed to happen. Searching Google would be too dangerous, what if one of the sites in a SERP had a TOS against coming from a referrer?",1230954843.0

I have also paid plenty of Danish taxes myself to put other peoples children through school.<p>While I have great love for my country, I am not indebted nor indentured to it.<p>We already went through a period in Danish history <a href=""http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavnsbånd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavnsbånd</a> (in Danish) where men between 18 and 36 were forced to stay and work for the local land owner.<p>I do not think there is a need through law, guilt or propaganda to enforce a new version of this indentureship.<p>There are many reasons to stay in Denmark, but there are also plenty of good reasons for entrepreneurs and other over achievers to leave:<p><a href=""http://stakeventures.com/articles/2007/07/01/silicon-vikings-talk-on-danish-entrepreneurship"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stakeventures.com/articles/2007/07/01/silicon-vikings...</a>",1230954809.0

17,418072,comment,416432.0,417715.0,0,0,custardpie,,,"I guarantee you have never met a TCS-raised child. A TCS child wouldn't throw such a tantrum. When you throw a tantrum you are already in a state of coercion, of being hurt or frustrated. A TCS child trusts their parent to help them out before it gets to that stage, and a TCS parent helps their child out before it gets to that stage. Both parent and child are interested in, and have always been interested in, problem-solving. Not fighting or revenge or huring each other, but finding mutual preferences and both being happy with the outcome.<p>I don't think I'd want to be friends with a person who had hurt and coerced me all my life. As for socializing, 'no man can use his brain to think for another man'. A parent can't socialize their child. The child must socialize themselves. The parent can only either persuade their child, trying to help them, or else coerce them, that is, harm them.<p>One of these is the attitude of a human, the other of a monstrous tyrant. It is always alarming to hear a person say that for the individual, tyranny is the only way to a successful outcome, when time and time again it has wrecked whole societies who together were unable to withstand its corrosive effects.",1230952652.0
18,418071,comment,417917.0,417917.0,0,0,bd,,,"<i>""The conventional view of the task of the philosopher is to solve seemingly intractable problems of philosophy using logical analysis (for example, the problem of free will, the relationship between mind and matter, what the good or the beautiful or the true consist of, and so on). However, Wittgenstein argues that these problems are, in fact, ""bewitchments"" that arise from philosophers' misuse of language.<p>In Wittgenstein's view, language is inextricably woven into the fabric of life, and as part of that fabric it works relatively unproblematically. Philosophical problems arise when language is forced from its proper home and into a metaphysical environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are absent - removed, perhaps, for what appear to be sound philosophical reasons, but which lead, for Wittgenstein, to the source of the problem. Wittgenstein describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language (the language of the Tractatus), where all philosophical problems can be solved without the confusing and muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, just because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no actual work at all. There is much talk in the Investigations, then, of ""idle wheels"" and language being ""on holiday"" or a mere ""ornament"", all of which are used to express the idea of what is lacking in philosophical contexts. To resolve the problems encountered there, Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the ""rough ground"" of ordinary language in use; that is, philosophers must ""bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use.""</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittgenstein",
