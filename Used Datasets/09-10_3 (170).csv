6,201751,comment,201556.0,201556.0,0,0,metachor,,,"The new design feels cumbersome on mobile devices, to the point of being unreadable.  This is entirely due to the right-hand sidebar (with the Customize your reddit, Submit a link and Create your own reddit call-out boxes), which appears above the actual page content in mobile layouts.  These three boxes are a lot longer than they used to be (especially Customize your reddit), so it takes a lot of scrolling to actually get to the links.<p>It's great that you can compress the link display, however, without the ability to dispose of the Customize your reddit and other sidebar call-out boxes, reddit is now a pain to read on a mobile device.<p>For what its worth, that used to be my main means of browsing reddit.<p>Edit: This is not a threat or anything, but I stopped reading Digg back when their site redesign made it impossible to read on a mobile device.  Please don't ignore the mobile device users, though we are a minority to consider when deciding on a layout.",1211945861

Although to make the point better, you can just use the shorthand: -moz-border-radius: 0.4em; -webkit-border-radius: 0.4em;<p>Seven lines of CSS and fifteen of HTML <i>per box</i> is bullshit when you can do the same thing in a standard and semantically better way in the space of a Twitter message.

But I loved the city so much, I deferred my admission one year.<p>""You should live better.""  Hmm, I have to think about that.  Indeed, my time in SF has been the best living I have ever done.

It's been live for five months or and has received very positive responses from its two core customer bases and from industry press.  We've got a growing user base and a team member who is an exceedingly savvy marketer.<p>But we're seeking a keen, creative, Wusthof-sharp mind to re-build our user interface and be our lead programmer/designer.  (And before you go off thinking I'm smarter than you because I know who Wusthof is, don't bother.  He's a knifemaker).<p>If you're up late, like me, you might have that restless edge that pushes people.  Young, ambitious people.  PSD's (http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/04/10/bear-stearns-and-psd-spirit).  People who want to work with other bright people, driven people, working late hours on something they want to see become wonderful.<p>People who live in NYC and want to meet up for a drink some night.  Those kind of people.  Shoot me an email and we'll chat about the project: twelvedigits [at] gmail [dot] com<p>If you're not in NYC and still interested, send me a note please and we'll have a chat.",1211945501

13,201744,comment,201599.0,201599.0,0,0,precipice,,,"Hey,<p>I'm one of the speakers at startup camp and I think I'm going to help on judging the submissions.<p>I think your pitch needs a lot of work and I wouldn't vote for  it in its current form.  I read your blog post and your PDF slides (I didn't watch the video) and didn't get a clear sense for what your product does, why it's different than other similar products, or why you think it will turn into a larger business.  Many of your slides talk about the right topics -- for instance, customer pain -- without saying what you specifically know about that topic in your business -- for instance, exactly what customer pain you're trying to address.<p>The outline on Sequoia's site is great for what your pitch should address:<p><a href=""http://www.sequoiacap.com/ideas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sequoiacap.com/ideas/</a><p>I once had the humiliating experience of sending a Sequoia partner a 30-slide pitch, having him say ""12 slides exactly,"" sending him a 20-slide pitch, having him say ""12 slides exactly,"" sending him a 15-slide pitch, having him say ""12 slides exactly,"" and then finally getting it right.  Learn from my mistakes!  12 slides, no more than six bullets per slide, no more than one line per bullet.  Writing to form makes it easier for people to evaluate you.  Make it very easy on your evaluators.<p>On each of those slides, say why you're different from everyone else.  Exactly what makes you better.  ""We take the sales lead process from 30 minutes to five minutes.""  Say it succinctly and don't be at all ambiguous.  ""We allow co-workers to share contact information for their sales leads without data entry by scanning business cards with 99.9% accuracy"" or whatever.<p>Hope this helps and good luck.",1211945218

The number of chairs was taken as indicator of the founders' certainty in the venture and this led to a larger round of investment. Antics like this led to the Aeron chair ratio for failed startups. Apparently, some failed startups had more 10 Aeron chairs for every employee.",1211944807

Self-publishing is gaining momentum in the book arena, the same can happen in music, movie and tv - the only thing is someone has to make self-publishing and internet distribution eco-system simple and affordable (wow! here is the business idea).<p>The other platform that can be explored is creative commons. Licensing under creative commons and sharing content freely with the support of some kind of revenue generation is one of the best option (i think).",1211944662
