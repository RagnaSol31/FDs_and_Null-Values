At least on K5 that's what happened, all the smart contributors left because every time they'd submit an article the response would always be ""-1, faggery"" or whatever. So I guess my theory is that trolls are toxic not (only) because they pollute the signal to noise ratio, but because they cause thoughtful contributors to feel less valued.",1227412606.0

9,373469,comment,373356.0,373403.0,0,0,tdavis,,,"I saw the translation first-hand over a number of years. There used to be a forum community I was a part of (it was regarded by some as a spin-off of the Something Awful forums, but that's another story). Many moons ago (roughly 4-5 years or so) it was a great community full of intelligent, witty, fun people.  There was almost never a thread that wasn't worth reading in any number of forums there and the moderators took their jobs quite seriously. Basically, good people and good content were everywhere.<p>Then, as time went on, things started going down hill. It's impossible to attribute this to a single event, but a series of circumstances changed that caused the site to lose its quality, both in members and content. There was some serious alienation of Moderators caused by the site owner, the board started becoming more popular via Google and drew many, for lack of a better term, ""Publics,"" etc. Due to these and other events, the best moderators jumped ship or just stopped caring (likely influenced by the owner's lack of involvement, too). The members who contributed the most worthwhile content started leaving as they noticed the boards being overrun with worthless posts.<p>And so it went, until a few months ago when the original owner sold off the site to somebody new who promptly shut the whole place down (after saying he had no plans to change things, or so I heard). It started as a place to make friends, share ideas, create witty banter, etc. Hell, it even lead to a few in-person meet-ups (if you've never attended a party held in another state by some random person you've never met in real life, I highly recommend it). It eventually degraded into ""just another forum community"" where the few people who still worked to make it a place worth coming to were drowned out by the masses of peasants clamoring ""LOL!""<p>There's a 5-year experiment for you ;)",1227411932.0

35,373442,comment,373360.0,373392.0,0,0,briansmith,,,"Why do so many people rent movies from Blockbuster instead of checking them out from the library?<p>One advantage of Blockbuster is that they usually have many copies of new releases in stock, as soon as they are released. A lot of libraries do not get movies until several days or weeks after the DVD has been released (if ever). And, they tend to have very few copies. The library lets you check out new releases for longer than Blockbuster allows you to rent them. Plus, Blockbuster's rental fee discourages many people from renting, whereas the library's cost-free nature encourages gluttonous movie consumption. All of this means that it is unlikely that you will get the movie you want when you show up at the library, but you will probably get it at Blockbuster.<p>Are book rentals analogous to movie rentals? I think nobody can say for sure, until we've seen what happens with these book-rental outfits.<p>For a long time, I've wanted to try to set up premium library services. Imagine that somebody pays a membership fee to a library, say $25.00 a month. In return for that fee, they get to keep books three times as long as non-premium members. In addition, they get online checkout with delivery services (by mail or in person).<p>Plus, they can direct 25% or so of their membership fees towards the purchase of specific books. For example, if I was a member for a year, I would have 12x$25*(25%)=$75 of purchasing power. I could order $75 of books through the library's website. The library could purchase the books and have them delivered directly to me, but I would have to return them to the library at the end of the (extended) check-out period.<p>Or, if I don't want to return a book (one that I forced the library to order, or one they already have), I could buy the copy I already have checked-out from the library. The library could use this money to purchase a new copy of the book, or it could use the money to purchase a different book instead.",1227409990.0
