Everyone else just maintains what the corp has, drives it slightly forward, or drives it backwards.  The leaps come from the Nucalc guys.<p>One of the beautiful things about the Silicon Valley startup industry is that they've restructured the way things work so that those people also reap the fruit of their devotion, and continue to drive it in that direction (ref PG's recent essay on the future of VC).",1281239450.0

Sure you can just pick some random albums from your collection and throw them on, but if you have a nontrivial number of albums, or a large collection of individual songs, then you quickly end up managing multiple playlists, skipping tracks you don't want to hear not because you don't like them but because you're just not in the mood, etc.<p>Alternatively, I can just turn on Pandora and it plays music I like.  It's literally a one click solution.<p>It makes better playlists than I could if I spent 2 hours a day perfecting my own.  It also goes out and finds new music that I haven't even heard yet, but because Pandora knows more about the music I like than I do, there's a pretty damn good chance it will be right.<p>In the time since I've started using Pandora I've discovered more new music that I like than I ever did when I was buying individual albums or songs off of iTunes or whatever.  Not only that, but I actually buy more CDs because I've heard all the songs on Pandora and I can buy the CDs with confidence, rather than wonder whether I'm going to waste another $15 on crappy music.  Although, I was mostly buying CDs to play in my car, but soon I'll be getting a Droid, and then I can just play Pandora directly in my car so CDs might get obsoleted.",1281239311.0

Imagine what his first day was like? I'm not sure it was a good fit. So there may be a lot more to this than the obvious knee jerk reaction of trying to connect it to the last notable event in our minds. With all the different people involved in launching the iPhone including Jobs himself it just seems unlikely to me they'd pick this guy to walk the plank for it. If he wasn't meshing with the culture before all this it could have been enough to push him over the edge.,1281239278.0

Subsequent courses had about the same number of people and used the top textbooks at the time. Cormen for algorithms, stevens for networking, foley and van damme for graphics, the dragon book for compilers, etc. The small class size put me in close contact with my professors, who cherry picked me to lead some NSF funded grant projects in computational geometry and atmospheric science research.

23,1584811,comment,1583494.0,1584564.0,0,0,haberman,,,"It's true that lock-free algorithms don't block, but they generally degrade under contention too, just in a different way.  Whereas a contended mutex blocks, a contended lock-free data structure can cause the compare-and-swap step to fail a potentially arbitrary number of times (unless the algorithm is wait-free, which few are AFAIK).<p>Also, a surprisingly hard problem with lock free data structures is knowing when you can free/unmap any of their memory.  Since there is no mutual exclusion, there is no way of knowing that another thread didn't just read the address of the thing you want to delete.  He could read that address and then get swapped out for 100 years, and you can't unmap that memory until he gets rescheduled and finishes his load.    Maged Michael published a technique for dealing with this problem he calls ""Safe Memory Reclamation"" or SMR.<p>Don't get me wrong, I like lock-free data structures.  I just think it's important to understand that they have their issues too, and it's not as though everyone should replace all their mutexes with lock-free structures.<p>I also think it's important to realize that atomic operations and memory barriers are <i>not</i> application-level constructs as mutexes are.  People should leave the atomic operations and memory barriers to the experts, and only use higher-level abstractions in applications, like lock-free stack, queue, etc.  You wouldn't dream of implementing a mutex yourself in real code; the same should be true of using atomic operations or memory barriers, unless you're really an expert.  One possible exception is atomic increment and decrement for simple reference counting.",1281238240.0

Even if returns suddenly skyrocketed after the PR damage control event people would have already bought something else along with a 2 year contract that prevents them from buying an iPhone 5 in the next 12-18 months for anything less than $400-$500. There would be no good reason to move up the date for the iPhone 5. At worst maybe a Rev B model could appear but that would be an industrial design project.
