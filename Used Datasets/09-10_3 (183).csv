However you want!<p>The first few chapters of Paul Graham's `On Lisp' does a great job covering closures, which can provide elegant encapsulation. But even in Java or C++, objects aren't the only modular or reusable components - consider packages or name spaces, for example. Data types such as streams, arrays, and trees don't have to be classes, either - take a look at Haskell's data types.",1226980743.0

I do agree that <i>if</i> the government is going to serve that purpose, then they'll pretty much have to take away the rewards for good choices, as both a disincentive to take large risks and equally importantly, because it's going to be damned expensive to prop up everyone who chose poorly, someone's got to pay for it, and only those who chose well can afford it.<p>We're pretty far afield of hacker news at this point, and I suspect we understand each other views at a gross level and simply disagree on where the optimal point for a society's government to strive for is located.
