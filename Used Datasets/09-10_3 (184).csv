Something simple like two player tic-tac-toe with an AI, just displaying a new board after every move, would get you a long way. Python and Ruby are good languages for things like this... as is Scheme or Javascript.",1256443199

It wouldn't have to be the one with the most features, mainly simple and good at storing typical users' files.  Currently, it seems FAT32 is the only thing out there that is able to be implemented without having to worry too much about patents, licenses etc (with some exceptions).  The only issue is, FAT32 sucks!  I have a Canon Rebel camera that can record videos, but they can only be up to 4GB because of crappy FAT32.  It doesn't matter if I have a 32GB flash/CF card in there, they can still only be 4GB.",1256443025

14,901220,comment,901072.0,901093.0,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"My dad is an avid sailor, with a lake-sailing boat in the backyard (Flying Scot) who invites me to multi-day trips on the North Carolina coast on a cruiser he rents. This means I get to sail without ever really having to take care / pay for the boat.<p>There are three experiences on a sea-going sailboat that I particularly like:<p>a) Not quite being in control. You can set your sails to carry you any which way, but the wind and seas will only allow so much. You have to cooperate, but you do have quite a bit more control than a layperson might think.<p>b) Being ""alone"". Sailing on the open seas (or even within a particularly big bay or sound) means all you can see around you is water. Even if you're sailing with a crew, the disconnect from the outer world feels even more intense than going camping or some other disconnection from civilization.<p>c) Having to stick through foul weather. The first time you find yourself 5 hours from shore when it's raining and the seas are rough (not rough enough for small craft advisory, though) you realize there is no possible way to bypass those 5 hours; you just have to sail through it. The things that normally bother you just do not matter when you are completely drenched and trying to keep the waves from bashing you off course enough to lose the wind and get forced into an unplanned tack/jibe.",1256441679

17,901217,comment,900571.0,901172.0,0,0,Mz,,,"I kind of agree with both of the above thoughts.  I've made very drastic lifestyle and dietary changes to get myself well.  I am not particularly prone to depression.  If I am ""depressed"" for more than three days, it is usually bad anemia.  I had no idea how bad my anemia was until it got better and my body just worked differently.  Being anemic was my norm and I just didn't know one's body could feel different and work different.<p>On the one hand, I think that if one goes far enough with dietary and lifestyle changes, more can be done to address the underlying physiological problems than most people realize.  On the other hand, I am aware that depression can be a response to feeling helpless about your life.  Drugs won't fix that.  Making different choices does more for that kind of depression.<p>Again:  I'm not very prone to depression.  I am prone to getting angry in the face of stuff like that.  But the same principle applies:  Stewing about things isn't healthy and doesn't make one feel better.  I have found that the best antidote to my tendency get angry about stuff is to DO something, no matter how small.  Since I tend to be the ""bounce off the walls"" type, I tend to make good friends with folks who are prone to depression. (Two bounce off the walls types can be a very destructive combination whereas depressed folks find I liven things up and I find they help ground me.) So I have assisted a couple of people with both the behavioral and dietary stuff the promotes their depression.<p>For me, getting healthier has been a fascinating study in using negative outcomes of life as feedback for what I need to correct in my own thought processes and behavior.  I don't even know how to adequately put it into words.  I think the best I can do is the explanation I once gave my son when he was younger:  That life is like a video game and you either learn from your mistakes or Game Over, only we don't have a reset button.  So life-threatening events are a big wake-up call that ""hey, stupid, you can't keep doing that"".  The trick is to figure out what things you can't keep doing.<p>I think I have dug my grave deep enough and should probably just clam up now. :-D",1256441567

I read his Long Tail book, so I knew he wasn't just any journalist, but I couldn't help thinking ""what does Wired know about startups""? By the end I was enthralled, and rather sad he couldn't speak for longer.<p>Best repeat performance: Paul Buchheit<p>I was fortunate enough to see him last year, so I kind of knew what to expect. One of the most honest and amusing talks of the day. It seems like he'd be fun to work with/for.<p>Amusing scheduling decision: Jason Fried after Greg McAdoo<p>For second year in a row, someone from 37signals comes on directly after Greg McAdoo from Sequoia. The contrast is kind of stark. The 37signals guys like to poo-poo on what they see as the pompous funding scene, and advocate bootstrapping, so hope Greg doesn't take it personally. ;) I thought Greg had some great points regarding how a 'bad economy' (for whatever value of 'bad' you choose) makes you focus on the important stuff. Jason's angle was that charging money forces you to make something people are willing to pay for (ie - something useful). I think in the end they were both kind of saying the same thing... focus on making something people want... just through their own lenses of experience.<p>Best stories: Mark Pincus<p>I had no idea what to expect from this guy, and he was a lot of fun. Before he started I was kind of ready to get out of there (because the room was becoming a sauna) but by the end of his talk, I was actually sad we ran out of time. Jessica was right: he made an excellent closer.<p>Other random amusements/thoughts:<p>PG: ""You have to have a liquidity event before you can have a liquidity event.""<p>A lot of the talks this year seemed to be about company culture. I wonder if that was a coincidence, or if it had to do with 'the economy' and some soul searching on the part of founders that is going around. Last year the common topic seemed to be 'raising money'. I wasn't at the 2007 one, so I'd be curious if there was also a theme that year.<p>Berkeley was a far superior venue as far as lunch and other travel logistics were concerned, although their mic system seemed haphazard.<p>Also, it was a blast to meet up with some of my fellow HN'ers... both those I was meeting for the first time and those I knew from last year.

This is no different.  Under certain assumptions, insider trading would lead to a more efficient market, and under others, a far less efficient market.<p>Quick question: which of these scenarios do you think captures the mentality of an inside trader?<p>A:  I NEVER hold shares in companies that I do not fully believe in, and I ALWAYS take a long position.  If I get inside information that a company is in trouble, I will immediately liquidate my position-- it may not blow up on me today, or tomorrow, or even this year, but I trust that sooner or later the stock price will take a dive, and I want to be long gone when that happens.<p>B:  I have inside information that a company is in trouble.  I don't know when it will blow up, but I do know that I have an edge on everybody else who doesn't know what I know.  So, I should ride the stock all the way up, as long as it keeps going up, and short it on the first sign of trouble on the technical indicators.  This way, I can make my money on both ends-- the up and the down.<p>One of these strategies will act to reduce volatility, and the other will enhance it.",1256440499
