There is no empirical basis for it, and it is a fundamentally pessimistic view of physics (that we don't know certain things because we simply can't know them.)  I don't think the superpositions in the quantum mechanical formalism reflect any objective reality, their just a standard statistical reflection of our ignorance of the system's total state.  But the notion of quantum computation crucially depends on these superpositions.  To me the vast efficiency gains claimed for quantum computation are actually a <i>reductio ad adsurdum</i> for the Copenhagen interpretation accordiing objective reality to these superpositions.<p>That people are apparently attempting serious implementations of quantum computation is very exciting to me, because it means these ideas are going to be severely tested soon.",1260331192

For my company e-mail ""Google is down"" or ""I can't get online"" is just not a good enough excuse when such an easy solution exists. Even if you primarily use webmail I would highly suggest mirroring a local copy via IMAP if you're dealing with important stuff.<p>2) I like being able to segregate my mail into its own space. I maximize my mail client full screen and have other windows on my second display such as individual messages or notes, address book, calendar, etc. I find this to be more appealing than opening half a dozen browser windows and clicking through different sections of GMail.<p>3) Nothing beats the performance of a local store. My IMAP server keeps a full backup so any one client losing its local copy isn't a problem. Searches are instant in Apple Mail, I can bounce between different folders/messages with no penalty waiting for another GMail page to load.<p>4) No distractions. When I have to sit down and pound through lots of e-mail being in a browser makes me less productive.",1260330957
