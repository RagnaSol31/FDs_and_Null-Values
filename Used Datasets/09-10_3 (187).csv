Industry does not need dragon-and-drop.  They need people who will take an intensely boring specification document about business rules for an insurance company, and translate that specification document into functional Java code and XML files.

As far as I can tell most of the hype about Twitter is driven by the fact that the people most in control of the popular tech media (slowly expanding to media generally) are also the ones who benefit most from Twitter's success.  So every single publicity whore tech blogger is out there evangelizing twitter precisely because they see it as a way to drive people to their blogs where they can make money through ads.<p>We still have almost no evidence as far as I can tell that Twitter is being adopted as a widespread general communication tool.  That's not to say that it won't, just that what we see now is still 90% hype driven and it's anybody's guess whether the thing will collapse or not when the hype dies down.  For communication among my friends I still vastly prefer instant messaging which has so many features that twitter and SMS don't that using twitter feels like returning to the stone age.",1246247639.0

More kids graduating high school really doesn't imply that they'll find better jobs or rather even be better off because of it. I would argue it's even the same metaphor for college. Most people go to get better jobs, but in reality, the risk is just as high to not find one, especially in this economy. Honestly I think we're still at the point where people are too prideful to get work just for work. I know plenty of college grads who are ""above"" working at Starbucks or restaurants of the like. The problem is that there's a definite devaluing of infrastructure type jobs that keep the country running.
