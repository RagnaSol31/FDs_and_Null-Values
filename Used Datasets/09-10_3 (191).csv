(The only honest way to think of our cell phones is that they are tiny, low-power microwave ovens, without walls, that we hold against the sides of our heads.) Frey tested microwave radiation on frogs and other lab animals, targeting the eyes, the heart, and the brain, and in each case he found troubling results. In one study, he triggered heart arrhythmias. Then, using the right modulations of the frequency, he even stopped frog hearts with microwaves—stopped the hearts dead.<p>also how modulated microwaves assit in breaching the blood - brain barrier<p>In a study published in 1975 in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, Frey reported that microwaves pulsed at certain modulations could induce ""leakage"" in the barrier between the circulatory system and the brain. Breaching the blood-brain barrier is a serious matter: It means the brain's environment, which needs to be extremely stable for nerve cells to function properly, can be perturbed in all kinds of dangerous ways. Frey's method was rather simple: He injected a fluorescent dye into the circulatory system of white rats, then swept the ­microwave frequencies across their bodies. In a matter of minutes, the dye had leached into the confines of the rats' brains.",1265427348.0

For this to survive beyond the next rebuild, the compiler also has to detect when it's compiling itself and insert the same logic.  This 'Trojan horse' can survive as long as people keep compiling your compiler in itself, but is never detectable from looking at any later version of the source code.<p>So you need to trust each version of the compiler (assembler, linker, microcode) you are using <i>all the way back in history</i>.

Every streaming music service, video service and flash games and applications would make Appstore irrelevant.<p>That, in my opinion, is the single biggest reason why we will _never_ see flash support in iphone of ipad no matter how fast and secure flash becomes in the near future.<p>Not that I care about flash in mobile device. But, using performance as the main reason for not supporting flash is silly. It can be one of the several reasons, but definitely not the main reason.",1265425294.0

Each type of token is matched by its own function, and then in the end the longest match is chosen. This is exactly what lex does - with two differences: (a) my scanner is slower, and (b) you have the full recognition power of C instead of just regular expressions. These days (b) outweighs (a) so much that it's just not funny.<p>I'd agree that flex/lex are just not worth it anymore.",1265425204.0
