However, deducing anything about the reasons which lead them to this situation seems a bit risky.<p>One doesn't need to look back far in the past to find examples of situations where Apple, after refusing to acknowledge the existence of a problem for an extended period of time suddenly came up with a solution that not only fixed it but also extended the playing ground significantly. The iTunes Store, the App Store, the iPhone copy and paste mechanism, etc. John Gruber could probably list quite a few.<p>Apple, or rather, Jobs' main problem is not one of efficiency but one of communication. His combined obsession for secrecy and control of the end user experience his mostly likely what produces this insanely inadapted public stance in face of the App Store obvious problems.<p>I seriously can't exclude that Jobs' obsessions won over the best of him and that he's actually fighting the tide instead of surfing it, but I wouldn't be surprised if a solution was already being tested inside the walls of the castle.<p>If Apple critics and users must learn anything about the company, it's that its public posture doesn't give away any information about what is actually brewing inside the company labs. If Apple must learn anything if it doesn't want to alleviate its most valuable partners (by which I mean developers), it's that posturing is not an acceptable communication practice and should be left people like Steve Balmer who have not much else to propose.",1258775055

On the one hand, although state revenues are down, state spending priorities are all messed up (e.g., we spend way too much jailing people for non-violent drug offenses for stuff like pot, constantly increasing state spending on the prison system - while cutting support for education).   On the other hand, the UC system's spending priorities are also screwed up with may more than is rationale going to capital investment.   It is true that the Regents lack authority to correct these problems and, to the extent the protest moves only the Regents, it is indeed a waste of time.  However, if the protests are regarded more as simply putting a foot down against the log-jam of a larger political situation - it's quite sane.<p>Also, ""presenting solutions"" is really not the protesters' obligation in a situation like this.  Forcing a crisis that elevates as far as possible and draws attention are reasonable ends in and of themselves.   These kinds of action are how, historically, political debates shift focus.  Solutions are not hard to come by.  There is no shortage of them.   The state needs escape from prop 13, from ballot initiative spending mandates, from its high incarceration rate, and so forth.   Implementing those solutions requires action by voters, the legislature, the regents, and so forth.<p>You have to start somewhere and that's what your peers did today.<p>Incidentally, the violence score appears to be roughly:  Protesters - shoving some crowd control barriers;  Cops - clubbing with batons, indiscriminate use of pepper spray, and allegedly at least one rubber bullet fired.",1258772856
