35,742778,comment,741411.0,741411.0,0,0,JimmyL,,,"Practice. Do some learning, and then practice again.<p>You're already at a disadvantage since you're not seven years old (five to seven is the best age to learn a language, according to linguists), so you're gonna need to make up some ground. Aside from picking a learning program to pick up vocabulary, you need to practice, and do it in as many ways as you can.<p>Some suggestions I/friends have used:<p><i>Mass Media</i>. Start buying a Spanish-language newspaper and reading articles (specifically, articles that you don't know what they're about) with a dictionary in hand. The first few you do will take an hour each for a two-line article. But as you do this for longer times, you'll start to pick up words - and (mainstream, well-regarded) newspapers are great because they've generally got very clear writing. When you get confident, start trying to read the letters or editorials. You should also dedicate an hour of the day to watching news or a soap opera on Univision (doesn't matter if you don't understand it at first - pay attention and you'll pick it up), and pick up a Spanish radio station to start listening to.<p><i>Computers</i>. Set your OS's language to Spanish, and set Spanish as the preferred language of your browser (so it will request es pages before en ones). When you don't understand a web page, get out the dictionary and work through it. Try and limit yourself to Spanish sites as much as possible, and (most importantly) read all your online news in Spanish.<p><i>People</i>. If you can find some people to speak to in Spanish on a daily basis, do this. To complement this, find a local cafe/restaurant that has acceptable food and Spanish-speaking staff, and become a regular there. Practice at home, and then go there an order in Spanish. Do this a lot (hence the OK food). After you're feeling OK about this, go to this place at off-hours, order something (in Spanish, of course) and try to make some small talk. These people should be familiar with you by this point, and be amenable to talking to a customer (since they don't have anything else to do). At first, they'll likely respond to your broken Spanish in English - either respond back only Spanish, or ask them to speak Spanish to you directly. They see this as being nice and helpful; they're not trying to insult your skills, and will likely accommodate you if you ask (and they recognize you).",1249442525.0

In standard CPA, shaving is ""not paying for services which you have already received"".<p>Its sort of a leaky abstraction for an advertiser.  Conversion Optimizer is described as CPA bidding because that is the easiest way to tell an experienced advertiser what it is.  It does, indeed, feel like CPA bidding when everything is going right.

It's quite a stretch to classify it as a ""web development tool"" or significantly related to ""Web Apps.""<p><i>""I made almost immediate comparison between the two""</i><p>It's not even close, though. The Ruby analogue to WSGI and Paste is Rack, not Mongrel. RubyInline and Psyco are very different things. HPricot is one of multiple options for HTML parsing in Ruby (nokogiri, scrapi, scrubyt). There are multiple JSON options for Ruby (including yajl bindings), and half the paragraph is about simplejson vs python-cjson, which has nothing to do with Ruby. There are also multiple Ruby templating systems available (erb, erubis, haml, markaby, liquid), but you only mention python templating enigines.<p>And all of these are just a small subset of libraries that you can have in a typical web app, such a small subset that they aren't really representative of anything.<p><i>""You never curious about hot-and-shiny key value databases for work?""</i><p>There are a whole slew of libraries for ""hot-and-shiny"" data stores (there are at least 5 Ruby libraries for couchdb alone) and it's not uncommon for people to roll their own.

The only thing that will convince them to move is if critical business infrastructure they depend on starts breaking and that isn't very likely to happen soon.<p>I think one of key things that will make businesses move will be when Microsoft itself phases out mainstream support.  Sadly, their policy is that IE lifecycles follow that of the OS they were released with, so if I read it right, we are looking at IE6 being supported right through to 2014 before security updates disappear.   That means we'll probably be stuck with some reasonable percentage of IE6 users for a few years yet.  With luck Win7 will be good enough to entice a lot of companies that held back through vista to upgrade and that will kill off a goodly number over the next year or two.",1249441244.0
