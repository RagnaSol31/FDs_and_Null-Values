I share his valuing of things that make sense, and the dream that all things can be understood - and his humble acceptance that we have to break down problems to fit inside his, mine and your human  brains.<p>But you can see where Alan Kay's ""nano-Dijkstras"" joke comes from, e.g. ""the horrendous mess produced by a group of incompetent, unorganized programmers"", referring to your complex project.<p>Industry - and you - and me - have accepted that things don't always work perfectly. Industry pays people to fix things, rather than make them perfect in the first place. Partly it's an acceptance of human error; though it's also an acceptance that you'll need to change it even if it's perfect, because the world keeps changing. ""Iterative development"" elevates this to a dogma.<p>Here's a thought experiment: imagine you need a library (e.g. for network protocols; or a fancy GUI; or to parse a EDI transactions). You have a choice of two libraries. Both have been used extensively by others, and both work well when you try them out. One is proven (in Dijsktra's sense) and one is not.<p>1.

I think talking to ""normal"" people is a waste of time. I didn't go to college because I thought it was for normal tool-idiots that accept this spoon-fed idea of universal ""success"".<p>Yes, I had a lot of angst in those days! Now on to the point.<p>High school is not about learning academics. It's about growing up in a social environment. Enjoy senior activities. Enjoy hanging out with your friends, enjoy your prom. Yes, all of those things are over-rated. But its just a part of growing up and you can never go back.<p>It's funny, we all like to think we can learn from other peoples experiences, and we can, but certain things, you just have to go through. It can't be explained in a way that anyone can <i>truly</i> understand.<p>Growing up is one of those things. No matter what I or anyone else tells you, you will not truly understand until you just go through it.<p>But I'll tell you anyway. High school is fun because its high school. You get to be a dumb kid and complain all day about how you want to be free. But that's cool because you get to do it with a bunch of peers that are dumb and want to be free too. You get to love a girl, and then get your heartbroken all in the same week. And as much and as hard as you believe that you <i>are not</i> a dumb kid, well, you are. No offense intended, but you will agree with me when you are older.<p>College is pretty much the same. Though you actually do get your pseudo-freedom. Above all ""college is what you make of it"". So even though it can be exactly the same as hs, it does not have to be. But right around your 3rd/4th year of college you'll realize just how much of a kid you still are.\nNeither good nor bad, just ...much more growing up to be done.<p>Then when you get out of college, you realize everything you've done means nothing, adult life sucks and then you crash and then hopefully you reach a level of humility.<p>With humility comes patience and understanding.<p>It is after this point that you realize as much as you thought high school sucked ass, it didn't, it was fun. You realize as much as you hated (or liked college) it really didn't matter, because it was necessary to help you get to where you are now:<p>humble<p>patient<p>appreciative<p>understanding.<p>So slow down. That's the best advice I would give my teenage self. And hell, I probably would never listen either. But there is such happiness and beauty in slowing down. I am going to cry now.<p>Appreciate things as they come, be happy, \nand enjoy your life.<p>Oh yeah, and as for girls, they are the key to happiness.

35,808506,comment,806397.0,808395.0,0,0,frig,,,"And I'll lead by example.<p>My underlying moral intuitions as relevant to the specific situation at hand are as follows:<p>- generally speaking I don't expect real-world moral dilemmas to have parties unambiguously in the right and in the wrong. It is <i>convenient</i> when things work out that way but not to be expected; what is to be expected is that a real-world moral dilemma will have convincing arguments on all sides. Consequently making a moral judgment is <i>not</i> playing ""spot the villain!"" but, instead, deciding which position has the <i>most</i> merit; that a particular position has the <i>most</i> merit says nothing about the merits (or lack thereof) of the other positions other than that what merit the other positions have is less than the position with the most merit. tl;dr: moral dilemmas involve hard choices.<p>- generally speaking mortal peril -- the threat of losing one's life -- is a significant circumstance that effects how I judge someone's actions. For example: I think murder is wrong, but killing in self-defense is not wrong; most justice systems of the world recognize this principle, and I think they do so correctly.<p>- there's nothing magical about contracts that exempts them from the previous point: when one party to a contract can only fulfill that contract at cost of that party's own life, the situation demands heavy scrutiny; expecting someone to place adherence to past agreements above self-preservation fails most common-sense morality tests (and is for example <i>why</i> killing in self-defense is considered differently from murder, and why bank employees aren't usually charged with theft when a bank robber sticks a gun in their face). Just having your life at risk isn't carte-blanche to do anything you want; it's simply a relevant fact that colors how I judge a person's decision to renege on past agreements<p>- in the specific case of an individual suffering from a terminal illness with a single, patented cure who has tried-and-failed in good faith to negotiate a hardship discount from the patent holder I see nothing <i>morally</i> wrong in the individual using their own materials and knowledge to produce the patented substance thereby saving their own life (risking what consequences may come). This analysis is equal parts general moral principles -- not expecting people to go to their own graves for the general benefit of society -- and the specifics of the situation at hand (ignoring patents: fine; stealing stuff: not so fine)<p>- (unsurprisingly) I also think that in the case of third-world nations facing national epidemics that a similar moral conclusion obtains: if after a good-faith effort to negotiate a price the nation can afford (where ""afford"" means ""purchase in enough quantities to halt the epidemic / mass suffering / etc"") then the nation cannot be faulted for ignoring the patents and self-manufacturing the substances in question (regardless of whether production is nationalized or farmed out to private-sector actors); I don't expect the patent holders to <i>like</i> this -- and I don't think they're wrong to <i>dislike</i> it -- but I also don't see anything wrong with the state's actions in that case. The morality-of-the-state does not <i>immediately</i> follow from the individual situation but I think that it <i>does</i> follow insofar as you view the state as obligated to advance its citizens' aggregate interests. I can understand <i>why</i> one might believe the state would better advance its citizens' aggregate interests by respecting the patent-holder's rights, and have already explained in great detail why I don't take that position.<p>These are relevant moral intuitions; can you state yours?",1252293196
