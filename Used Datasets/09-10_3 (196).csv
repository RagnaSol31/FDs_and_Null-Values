All the utility I am advocating does it make the oneliners a bit easier to get to and have context(i.e. changing the working directory to what you are actually working on) readily available. I would say that a programmer without a decent list of aliases saved up is not the best programmer.,1267415898

2,1158011,comment,1157421.0,1157646.0,0,0,william42,,,"The difference between the standard systematic devaluation of modern governments and serious devaluation is that most governments tend to inflate at a rate of about 2-4% per year.  This rate of inflation is considered by most economists to be benign and even helpful to a degree, because people tend to react better to inflation-triggered pay raises than deflation-triggered pay cuts, and businesses often choose to just fire bad workers instead of doing the latter, which can lead to massive spikes in unemployment.<p>In the 70s, we had about 10-20% inflation per year.  This is where we start to see people getting unhappy.<p>Hyperinflation is defined by economists as being 50% per month, which adds up to something on the order of magnitude of a factor of 64 per year, however, when you have hyperinflation, you usually end up talking about having to add a digit to your prices at least once a month--more generally, hyperinflation is when there's so much inflation your currency is no longer considered to have any permanent value.  Look at Zimbabwe and their use of scientific notation.",1267415842

Yu can choose not to watch tv<p>I'll grant that being forced to pay for public television only when watching TV is less bad than being forced to pay for public television regardless of whether or not you can even watch TV would be. On the other hand, even half a spoonful of poop ruins a whole pan of brownies. (Less-bad != Good). Why should I have to pay a tax to watch a private broadcast? Why not tax the internet and create a State-run intranet, on that basis?<p>>>It might not work elsewhere admittedly. But it's worth a shot.<p>No. Do not want. This is how problems start. Someone gets (or is given, and runs with) the easy idea: ""Let taxes pay for it! If it doesn't work out the way we want, they'll just stop doing it!"" But governments don't just stop doing things simply on account of them not working. You're already paying them to do it. Why go through the trouble of admitting mistakes and debating about repealing stuff and, in many cases, taking away peoples' (inefficiently allocated, needlessly created) jobs? Sure sounds like a hassle.<p>Next thing you know, you've got...what we've all already got. Too much fucking government. Please stop asking for more of it on other peoples' account. Even if you think the BBC airs a few good shows, it's the principle. It's not your money, so quit asking them to spend it. No new taxes. No new programs. No new agencies. We can't get rid of or fix all the crap we _already_ have.<p>Apologies for the zeal, but this is the appropriate reaction when people start clamoring to take your money and use it for something you will have for all practical purposes absolutely zero say in.

The internet is beautiful because it's non-centralizing, simply put you have virtually no legal jurisdiction to take action against anyone or any website, usually because most are hosted outside of your country.

Basically put, you might own a few rivers but you don't own the ocean, do what you want with your rivers but you won't get rid of the ocean.<p>Legislating against content or quality of service online will serve no purpose. Someone phishing card numbers will simply move their operation overseas to a country with no legal interest in the matter (in reality most phishing operations are hosted from countries most people doubt even have the internet). Once you start hitting websites of small businesses who can't meet certain standards (access for the legally blind, etc) or securities or whatever requirements are arbitrarily assigned, they'll simply host themselves in a foreign country.<p>Introducing regulation into the internet will backfire dramatically, likely forcing major closures of many server hosts in the US. Once even a small percentage of users switch from US servers to foreign servers, then the US server prices will begin to spike, once the prices are uncompetitive then the US servers are closed.

Remember that caffeine is a DRUG.<p>Second, switching from a diluted caffeine intake (such as coffee or soda) to a pure intake (pills) could lead to you worsening your dependency on caffeine.  Think about it: you drink 5+ cups of coffee, but you probably can't drink 10 everyday.... but you CAN pop another handful of caffeine pills quite easily.<p>If you look to the past, you'll probably see that your caffeine intake has been increasing, but the effects have not been intensifying.  That's because your body builds a tolerance to caffeine over time.  I used to be super jittery after 3 shots of espresso, but now (after 2 years of heavy consumption of coffee) there's not much effect.<p>My advice: don't switch to caffeine pills to fix your problems.  They'll only make it worse because it will allow you to consume more caffeine in purer form at a faster rate than drinking coffee.  As you consume more on a regular basis, your body will build a higher tolerance.  You'll find yourself taking more and more caffeine pills to avoid the headaches.<p>So don't take pills on a regular basis, and start decreasing your coffee intake.
