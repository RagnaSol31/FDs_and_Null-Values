My guess is its more than rhetorical flourish too since he's not known for that.<p>Your making the argument that corporate taxes reduce his personal income, and therefore should count as his taxes. Ok. But if corporations did not have to pay taxes, they would pay their employees more, including secretaries. It's impossible to say for sure that a 35% corporate tax rate reduces secretary salaries by 35%, but it is something highly significant.<p>In a roundabout way the secretary is paying that corporate tax too. Its effect is not as directly measurable on her as it is on Buffet, and might not be 1 for 1, but it's undeniably there and equally applicable to her tax rate.<p>Also Social Security reduces her pay by 12.4% (half of which is paid by her employer but again would likely go to her if not). Since its capped at $100k income, it rounds to 0% of Buffet's yearly earnings.<p>*I should point out that I am aware I've grossly oversimplified the effect of the corporate tax on the secretary, I trust but you get the point.",1257998148

Rich people are paid for accessing their own money.<p>Here's a practical example for you: a one month train pass from my home town to Nagoya costs about $200.  A six month pass costs $1,000.<p>Given these facts, some people (through either lack of means or lack of savvy) will in a six month period buy six one-month passes, each time incurring a $1 ATM fee, for a total cost of $1,206.  More savvy people will buy the six month pass on a credit card and pay it off before the grace period runs out, which costs about $990 ($1,000 less the $10 your bank will give you to say ""Thanks for your business!  Please charge more stuff!"").<p>If you know you're going to be working in Nagoya for six months, buying the six month ticket is equivalent to buying six month CDs at an APR in excess of 40%.  The actual rate offered on a Japanese CD is typically .5%.  Somewhat surprisingly, there are many people at my day job who buy both one month tickets and own $5,000 or more in CDs.",1257997850
