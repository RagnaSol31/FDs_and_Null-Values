1,2455521,comment,2453988.0,2455426.0,3,0,nerfhammer,,,"Deflation is almost invariably a sign of economic distress. This can easily be observed historically.<p>By the way the term I think you mean is ""quantity demanded"" with respect to price, ""demand"" is invariant to price.<p>Under deflation average income decreases. It's not like everyone is suddenly richer. Your employer gets less money, and so has to pay you less, or lay off a portion of their workforce. The price of labor is a price like any other.<p>Assuming a fixed money supply, hoarding currency will cause  deflation. Hoarding currency takes money out of the money supply. Saving by making investments is different; the money is still participating in the economy. Deflation discourages investment in useful activity. If you can earn a 5% rate of return just for already having money, why bother with a investment could return 5% or less?",1303012667.0

There are so many things that can and <i>should</i> be improved upon. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for iOS 5.<p>> They won't put the effort into fixing developer pain points if the only practical outcome will be more mediocre apps.<p>I think you're being a little too cynical. I prefer to give Apple the benefit of the doubt. After the whole Xcode 4 mess, I get the feeling that there's some disconnect between how Apple uses the tools and how the community at large does - a gap I hope Apple works to eliminate.<p>> At the same time, the marketing dept. is milking their leading app count for all it's worth, so they won't be doing a purge.<p>Yeah - totally agree. They'll never do a <i>direct</i> purge (ie ""Hey, your app isn't selling, so we killed it""), but I'm holding out hope of my other suggestion of their using a price schedule to ""encourage"" developers of low-sellings apps to pull them themselves.<p>> Rather, I think they will work on more ways for the cream to float to the top, like the ""genius"" feature of the app store<p>It's a hard problem to fix, and I imagine we'll see some good breakthroughs in this area in the next year or so. I'm genuinely curious, though, about how your experience with the ""genius"" feature has been. To me it seems to just recommend random apps from similar categories; most of the time, I walk away thinking, ""No, I already bought an app to deal with [x/y/z] - I don't <i>need</i> a second."" Given the amount of info Apple has on me (app, music, and movie/TV show purchase histories, age bracket, metro area, etc, etc), I'm surprised that their recommendations are not better.<p>> and on raising the quality bar with their own apps like Garage Band and iMovie.<p>I think they've definitely succeeded with this one. After seeing apps like that, it really makes you want to push the boundaries and really up the quality of your apps.",1303012217.0

He's talking with the snide condescension of one of the world's top researchers in the field. Or, rather, he's not putting effort into communicating to people who don't have some background in PL theory and some familiarity with many of these arguments.<p>Professor Harper typically spends two lectures in his undergraduate PL class developing the idea of dynamic typing, and then demolishing it.

Furthermore, Chris Dixon's quote wasn't (as far as I can tell) talking about recruiting interns, but recruiting employees and that's an entirely different ballgame in my opinion. These companies don't have money to offer employees or interns, but they will offer equity  to employees. What's the chance a company will offer any form of equity to interns? So you're suggesting that rather than ""immediate compensation"", their compensation is that they have a couple months experience at a successful company?

This can be done by sending a command to the official BitCoin daemon, or by calling a method on the BitCoinJ Java library.<p>3. The web application asks the user to send a sum of money to the recently generated address. If the user is using the official Bitcoin client, they'd do this by clicking ""Send Coins"", then copy-pasting the address and the correct amount of money into the dialog box.<p>4. The web application then either polls the Bitcoin daemon to see if the transaction has come through yet, or sets up an event handler if the web app is using BitcoinJ. The transaction must obviously be sent to the right address with the right amount of bitcoins.<p>5. When the transaction has come through, you can now deliver the product to the user. If there's no particular hurry, or if the product is high-value, you may want to wait until a certain number of Bitcoin nodes have confirmed the transaction.<p>As far as I'm aware, there aren't yet any drop-in plugins for common web frameworks, but it wouldn't be hard to make one.",1303009512.0
