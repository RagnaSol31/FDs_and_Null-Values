Thamus replied: O most ingenious Theuth, the parent or inventor of an art is not always the best judge of the utility or inutility of his own inventions to the users of them. And in this instance, you who are the father of letters, from a paternal love of your own children have been led to attribute to them a quality which they cannot have; for this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learnersâ€™ souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves. The specific which you have discovered is an aid not to memory, but to reminiscence, and you give your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many things and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without the reality.""<p><a href=""http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174:text=Phaedrus:section=274e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:tex...</a>",1240890316.0

For example, assuming that adjectives modify the words they immediately precede.<p>I bet most people assume  ""antique""  is modifying ""racing cars"", and no one wonders what an antique Italian would drive.<p>BTW, why couldn't one say ""21 green large tables"" and not be understood?  It suggests that the defining quality is the color, not the size (i.e., not the red large tables, but the <i>green</i> large tables).",1240887675.0

PG, can we have an update, please?<p>Also, I was at the first Startup School at Harvard in 2005 (?).  One of the speakers (PG?) noted the very high proportion of Macs in the room.  Looking around I guessed about 80%.  That is consistent with something PG said in that Mac essay - ""If you want to know what ordinary people will be doing with computers in ten years, just walk around the CS department at a good university. Whatever they're doing, you'll be doing.""  I'm seeing more of my friends and coworkers using Mac, even DBAs who use MS SQL Server a lot.",1240887648.0
