Being at the top connotates that one is the best; their abilities are superior to others.  A leader can simply be him who recognizes a vacuum in power and seizes it.  Being a leader in no way implies that one is at the top of their field.<p>The best programmers/hackers I've met were quite content to hone their skills without the public attention that only the ""leadership types"" seem to require.",1241755159.0
1,599149,comment,599013.0,599081.0,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>'yeah, that'll work'</i><p>""That won't work"", on the other hand, is easy.  Here's why ""realistic"" fights with lethal weapons don't work for, e.g., a Star Wars game: George Lucas can fiat that Obi Wan never eats a lightsaber until it is dramatically appropriate, but in the game, for there to be challenge there has to be the illusion of risk, and if you're risking insta-death lightsaber cuts then a lot of kids and casual gamers (bread and butter for Star Wars) are going to get cut into pieces by mooks.  That is going to be deeply unsatisfying to them.  Nethack has a subculture who loves it dearly (""Hah, drunk the potion on level one without first testing to see whether it is a cursed potion?  Man, you must be new at this.  <i>rolls</i>  Oh, you're stoned.  Time to restart!""), but the ""physics"" for Star Wars are very, very different.<p>The reason D&D doesn't have the fighter die after a hit with a giant club isn't because we're capable of suspending disbelief as long as we don't see it happen.  Its because, given that D&D is based around having most shots by competent opponents connect (there is another problem with the other way), having one-shot instasquish makes the heroes seem markedly less heroic, and would result in e.g. the defining D&D encounter with a dragon get skipped totally by rational players.  (At least until they could find a suitably non-dramatic low-risk way to dispose of the dragon without ever being perceived by him, such as having the wizard Wish him out of existence.)<p>[On reflection, the ""game fiats you do not die when you as the player fail to dodge an insta-kill attack"" gets around this objection, although one wonders if you're sacrificing player agency for ""making sense"", since a player who literally abandons his controller will see the animation system play his character <i>flawlessly</i> for a minute until his stamina runs out.  ""Wait, what was I adding to this performance?"" is not something I'd want to cause a player to think.]",1241755093.0

I don't have rigorous data in front in me, but as a society we've become wealthier over, say, the last 60 years.

18,599130,comment,598973.0,598973.0,0,0,moonpolysoft,,,"When you talk about that amount of data, you'll have to make some decisions about handling disk failures.  At that scale they will happen as a matter of course.  There are a number of different distributed databases out there and some of them have very different ways of handling consistency and availability.<p>I work on a database called dynomite which currently only supports a strict key/value interface to the data.  It follows a dynamo model of eventual consistency.  It trades the consistency the data stored in the case of failure and race conditions for greater availability.  What that means is you might get more than one version of the data back for any particular query.  Dynomite is primarily designed around serving live data to power a site.  You can see it in use at powerset.com for the images in the republished articles.<p>From the sound of your requirements the strict key/value lookup might not work so well.  If you'll need to occasionally crunch over the numbers something like HBase might be a better fit.  HBase is optimized for scanning over the entire table for things like hadoop jobs.  It's built overtop of the Hadoop File System (HDFS) which is a distributed file system built after Google's GFS paper.  One of the drawbacks of HBase, however, is that it is not built for high availability.<p>Something to think about is perhaps a hybrid approach.  It sounds like you need acquisition of data, do some amount of calculation over it, and then serve it to users.  One way to do this, that search engines are very successful at, is to acquire data into a map-reduce ready storage system like HBase.  Crunch over it using Hadoop.  Then batch the data into a highly available datastore like Dynomite for live serving.<p>If you try to satisfy all of your requirements with one system, it will likely solve all of your problems poorly, if at all.",1241754132.0

If the 20k item is an opaque block like a photograph, for example, you probably aren't going to do much analysis of the block often -- you might pull the header or citation data and other related information down into 1k or less of useful data per item. On the other hand, if either the 20k or 100k are long form plain text, you might be able to distill it down to keywords to focus the data for efficiency.<p>When you say you want to do ""multiple views on data, mostly in aggregate form"", do you mean like OLAP cubes and other common reporting/analysis metrics, or more like searchy stuff where you might be interested in a needle in a haystack?<p>How do your users expect to interact with the data? If you were to sequential scan the entire uncompressed data set using Storagereview's current fastest disk, the Seagate 15k.5 300G, it would take over 21 disk DAYS ((min+max)/2 transfer rate), and this is contrived, and unlikely to be attainable in a real world scenario. It would take about 700 disks to hold it all, which would wall-time down to about 45 minutes. So naive walking the data for search purposes is out. It would have to be indexed.<p>Indexing is a tricky problem. In small databases they're usually so small and help so much that nobody pays any attention to the resources required to maintain them. With this dataset that's unlikely to be the case: you may effectively need several times the size of the data in indexing alone, which is going to have drastic implications on the computing resources required and the data storage format needed.<p>700 of those Seagate disks at roughly $200 street price is $140k. That's before simple redundancy, systems, cases, racks, power, logical redundancy for performance or extra space for derived data. Making a system to manipulate this much data is easily $500k, and paying a commercial vendor to provide you systems, hardware, and possibly software to do the job could be an order of magnitude more. For that kind of money I'd spend a few thousand hiring some people you trust to give you a reasonable assessment of the task at hand. It sounds like fun, though. Good luck. :)",1241752452.0

As you note, the difference is much more dramatic in dynamic languages (Ruby, Python, PHP, and Perl applications simply <i>explode</i> in size when run on 64 bit systems...like 50%-75% larger).",1241751719.0
