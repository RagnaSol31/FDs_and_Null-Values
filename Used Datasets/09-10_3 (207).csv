Remember, being bold when you recognize a valid opportunity is not the same thing as taking on risk.  Risk comes from the unknown.  As such, you aren't really rewarded in proportion to the risk you take (the amount of unknown territory you dive into)--you're rewarded in proportion to the market opportunity you nail.

I find the worst auto-generated documentation to be class hierarchies, which are problematic from the standpoint of trying to learn how to use a library (often because they lack working example code), and also problematic as a reference because the method lists are cluttered up with private and protected methods that you most likely shouldn't be aware of if you're using the public interface to a library, which is the reason you're reading the documentation to begin with.  The lack of example code means you don't have a canonical idiom to use for reference and to build on, especially with things<p>As the author says, the django documentation is pretty strong.  I've always thought PHP.net was an awesome documentation site/reference also, it's easy to browse and find stuff, even if the example code is sometimes messy and there's a bunch of wrong information in the 5+ year old comments.  On the other hand, PHP decided to take the class hierarchy approach when documenting SPL.

Once you have a large enough vocabulary you do pick up on the on-yomi patterns a lot better.  Of course knowing this earlier did help - I studied radicals and their meanings before entering university and we hardly touched them there - it was more about brute force rote memorisation.<p>So I can read Japanese (and write it to an extent), but still need more work in speaking it.",1257908430.0
