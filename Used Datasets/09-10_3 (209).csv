Just because the ad is hosted elsewhere doesn't mean the ads will be any better.<p>If thy host them themselves then the website has to develop trusted analytics on the who saw the ad. Who clicked on the ad. Who bought something using the ad.<p>All of these analytics are what make internet advertising worth it. Without it most companies wouldn't bother. And that just increases the cost for the content producer. Now instead of just being a content producer he has to be an advertising analytics expert. What you suggest is not a solution it's a step backward.<p>People seem to want to have their cake and eat it too whenever this comes up. The fact is your favorite site has to make money in 99% of the cases. It has only 2 potentially viable ways to do this. And of the 2 only 1 has been shown to be consistently viable in almost every place it's tried. That 1 is advertising. Subscriptions and micropayments have only worked in few outlier cases.<p>So if you like your favorite site and want to use it then suck it up and live with the fact that they <i>have</i> to advertise in order to be there.,1267932556.0

An impression spent on me has absolutely <i>zero</i> chance of ever generating any revenue or any other kind of value. This is a safe assumption that has held true in my decade or so of browsing the web. The impressions that I block are spent on someone else, where they have at least the potential to lead to conversions. Thus, I am helping the advertiser make more money.<p>The ones who lose out in this situation are the middle men: the agencies, networks and content providers. Though their impressions become more valuable, they have less of them to sell and this apparently works out to a loss. However, appealing to my sympathy about this is nonsensical. <i>They are simply asking me to help them sell worthless impressions to some third party</i>. I would never feel inclined to do that, no matter how indebted I felt to the content provider.<p>Ad supported sites who complain about blocking fail to see the big picture. Their entitled thinking goes no further than ""when you do this, I get money, so you should/must do this"".<p>If internet advertising is not sustainable in the face of ad blocking, then it is not sustainable at all.<p>Incidentally, asking me to actively avoid sites who's ads I don't plan to view is also absurd. The web simply does not, never has, and never could work that way. Nobody can be expected to add that layer of deliberation to the act of clicking on a link.

Rather than serving ads to your community, you vet actual products and services <i>that your community would actually use</i> and genuinely endorse the product openly.

I've seen it in a few places, and it seems so simple -- someone has to have information on how it worked out in practice.<p>I would expect that having an easy, obvious rating meter on each ad would work in two ways. First it could improve targeting by having the user reject ads on a case-by-case basis. Second, ads that get rejected by a wide range of user types can be determined to be bad in general (ugly, offensive, annoying) and thus removed from circulation, automatically.<p>Does anyone know why this isn't in place more?

Youtube had some nice ads (one for Wario game) that were disguised as regular videos, but ended up taking over the whole page. And CollegeHumor has done some similar things.<p>I think new media sites are getting better at this.
