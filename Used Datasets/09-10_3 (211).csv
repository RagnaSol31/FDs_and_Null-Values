Also it's unclear how large is their user base. Everyone kind of assumes serious implications, though.<p>IMO if this whole thing is true, it indicates that the company probably doesn't have good QA and development process in place.

Hackers do not turn websites into corporations. Imagine if all ISP's were turned into ""AOL's"".<p>Please define what a hacker is. Seriously you make it look as though a hacker as just somebody who keeps doing tech work for free or a throw away price. What is wrong with hackers running companies? And making money?<p>By the way he wrote a good enough part of the early website himself, hired people and sold it to investors. He built stuff which people wanted to use purely on his technical and selling skills.<p>If this isn't good hacking I don't know what is.<p>>>Facebook did not connect billions of people. They were already connected. All they needed to do was share their contact details. And the facility for that already existed in thousands of other websites.<p>You could say the same about the telegraph, telephone, postal services, mobile phones or anything on the earth that connects people. Basically a way of 'contact' is what is needed for connecting people.<p>>>People chose one website, Facebook. That's a good thing. And the credit should go to people for encouraging each other to all sign up at one website.<p>Why did those people choose only Facebook? Why did people choose only iPhone, Why did people choose only Twitter? Why did people choose only <insert any useful thing>?<p>>>But alas it is the website of a sociopath who took people's contact details (calling them ""dumb fucks"" for giving him their info), the way a spammer collects email addresses, or a cybercriminal collects credit card numbers, and then sold the information for financial gain (your info is worth maybe .85 to a few bucks at most in this market). He's creating the next generation of mailbox stuffed full of junk direct marketing.<p>When you information even secret at the first place?<p>>>If Mark Zuckerberg is your hero you need think more carefully about what he has done and re-examine your principles.<p>Well he will always be a hero to many people. Because a college kid with computer in his dorm, built a product, a team full of hard working people which bought several millions to use their product. He continues to execute strong and ship great things.<p>He also knows how to sell his work, the man just made the world $18 billion for his work! Do you think that is joke?<p>Everyone around here knows how difficult it is to raise money to do <anything>. And we might talking of just hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Here the man made the world pay in tens of billions.",1337399551.0

But it seems like there's really little reason to do this for sophisticated searchers.<p>Maybe there is and I am just not seeing the competitive advantage or value addition.<p>At the same time, I feel like we may have different search engines all using the same licensed cache source and trying to differentiate themselves on multiple implementations of idiosyncratic ways to access the same cache API, instead of focusing on more basic factors, like speed and privacy.<p>Maybe searchers just want to access that licensed cache which is too expensive for them to subscribe to.  Maybe it's not so important all the fancy things one can do with CGI.  Maybe the fancy things are important.  Maybe they just crave ""features"".  I don't know.<p>But my guess is the BOSS cache is probably not that hard to work with and that most searchers could get their searches done easily enough, in simple fashion, if they had their own BOSS subscriptions, without the need for lots of customisations (which equate to the exotic features of these search engines).<p>Just my thoughts.",1337398477.0

People want to be hands-on, social, and specific, so ""I am poor and need money to survive"" is a extremely truthful, realistic story that markets poorly. The story they like is the one where it has a dialogue with more specific, concrete elements: ""I liked this site so much, I gave money to help keep it running..."" They also adore having a foe to fight against or a person who becomes some kind of representative of a cause.<p>All the techniques of fiction could be employed to make the work you already have(which clearly has some value) feel like something people should contribute further to - nothing actually fake or untruthful is necessary, it just means finding a certain way in which to tell the story. At the end of it, people become inclined to give a donation, fund the writing of a book, etc. The product itself often isn't at the core of motivation to buy, so much as ""I want to finish the story being told.""",1337396968.0
