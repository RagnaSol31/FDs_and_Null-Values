GD sent over three PDFs, one of all the products, one of the website, and one of the website specs.  The website specs did not contain sizing information for the images or the pages, it contained font/spacing/coloring/page flow information.<p>I asked the GD for the sizing of the web page and was provided an answer. There was some functionality in the site design which I discussed with the client and removed (GD was inaccessible) based on an agreement.<p>I finished the site and client reviewed making a few changes.  Did a second review and then sent the link to the GD for their review.  GD commented on the proportions being off and the distortion of some images.  I agreed that the dimensions were off, but that's what I was told to go with and if the measurements I have are not right, I need to know what they should be.<p>I reached out to the GD via phone and e-mail. Did not hear back until I received an e-mail from the client to both of us.<p>Basically the e-mail's tone was that of threatening if I couldn't finish the project client would find someone who could and that if the GD can't get me the information than the Client doens't know what I'll need.

Let people make their videos with blue screened objects or backgrounds and then have technology that lets advertisers insert real time advertising into the videos (meaning the advertising is not permanent but changes each time).

I get this especially while going through my school work (particularly physics). Once I have my toolbox of equations and laws to work with, getting buzzed just makes it feel 'easier' to see the solution, and how to put those pieces together.<p>Somewhat different from the learning a new language example (they are clearly still putting together their toolboxes), but it's also a question of tolerance.

While very good at answering specific queries, it's no good at incidental or exploratory knowledge discovery - it's kind of out of the way, a little on the slow side, but most importantly it doesn't link externally (or even internally). I get the vibe that the W|A crew have an excellent idea and are doing an excellent job, but don't really ""get it"" when it comes to everyday usability. As they admit in their subtitle, they've built an engine, not a whole machine.<p>On the other hand, usability is DDG's killer app as far as I'm concerned. The focus on ease of interpretation as well as interaction is really valuable.<p>Simply having W|A's answer on the same page as a bunch of direct links to alternative sources is valuable enough.<p>But if I get a bit excited, if the power of the vast knowledge & computational ability of W|A finds its human voice through DDG, it could start to bridge the gap between ""search"" and actual knowledge retrieval. It's one (good) thing to remove 1 click by showing a number relating to a simple query - it's another thing to remove 50 clicks and 45 minutes of research and assessment to establish the answer to a one-step-above-simple query.<p>What I'd love to see as a start is for W|A to provide facts & figures against results returned through DDG.

Then again, it's Deleuze, so it's almost impenetrable anyway. The 1960s in California were full of AI and comp. sci. people doing brain enhancement/augmentation experiments with LSD and other drugs. I see no reason why alcohol can't perform a similar function.",1303182447.0

You're not buying an item like a laptop with specs, you're buying admission to participate.<p>The challenge is that many people bring exactly this consumerist attitude to tuition, which then ruins the signalling capacity of the price.  ""If it's expensive, it must be good.""  That pushes up demand for enrollment and increases the selectivity and reputation of the university in US News, etc.  The university therefore has an incentive to keep tuition high.  Unfortunately, then students and parents think, ""I'm paying so much for this degree, I should (get A's/not flunk out/...)"" [1]  Professors who grade rigorously are evaluated harshly; since most instructors aren't tenured, there's no incentive for them to make classes challenging.  Then many employers use the earned degree as a crude signal of diligence, since what was actually learned is likely irrelevant to the job at hand.<p>Finally, most families send only a handful of children to college, and there's a significant lag between when graduates and the evaluation of the ""success"" of the degree.  There's no way tuition can accurately price the variation in outcomes with all these inefficiencies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://rateyourstudents.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rateyourstudents.blogspot.com/</a>",1303182359.0

That's not to say that all tests are bad, or that tests never make sense. It's to say that having tests adds a cost, and so sometimes the upside of having them does not justify the downside.",1303182283.0
