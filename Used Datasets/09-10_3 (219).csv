Any platform that has acceptable power consumption for the ultra-portable market is going to have to use dedicated decoding hardware. Once you take HD decoding off the list of things the CPU has to be fast enough for, you have the option to use a small, low-power CPU like the Atom. I don't see any room for improvement by using a different arrangement. Software writers will just have to get used to using the OS provided decoders so that any accelerators present can be used.",1265774151.0

It uses ~250mb out of my 4GB RAM and I can just suspend it whenever I'm not coding.<p>Benefits: I can use apt-get and have all the other conveniences of a true *nix environment. I can update and try out new software easily (I had XHP running in about 5 minutes). Also, I can create snapshots of my OS so that when my environment is just the way I like it, I can always revert right back to it.<p>I interact with certain paths on my virtual linux filesystem just as though they were local (like my ~/Sites dir) and have various dev domains in my /etc/hosts file pointing to the VM (which has it's own internal ip).<p>Cons: It's a standalone VM so it consumes a consistent 250mb of memory.

There's also the limitation that now CPU and GPU are sharing the same heatsink.<p>You could use it to offer a low-end system with good integrated graphics, because there's no longer a penalty for the GPU sharing the CPU's RAM. However, this approach pretty much requires a new socket, which probably eliminates any potential cost savings from not having to buy a discrete GPU. This approach also sacrifices some in flexibility, as adding a discrete graphics card later on makes the on-die GPU worthless unless you have a good asymmetric SLI/Crossfire system, and even then you're limited to the features supported by the on-die GPU.<p>The approach taken so far by Intel and AMD is to use it to make a better low-power platform. Intel's obviously been way ahead here. Ever since the Pentium M, AMD's had trouble keeping up in the mobile market. ATI's GPUs haven't been that great for the mobile market, either. It was obvious in 2006 that this was going to be the hardest approach for AMD to pull of, but it also seems to be the only one that might pay off.",1265773689.0

The dev team is responsible for how long it will take.  Often we will invest too much time in something that's not that valuable, since management is not aware of just how long it will take.  Or we will under invest in something very valuable because management doesn't realize how easy it is to knock off.  If management can just put a price on the stuff it wants done,  then I think developers will be able to pick off the stuff that gives the most bang for the buck, which is what we want.<p>2)  Paying for performance makes a big difference in developer productivity.  That why startups get so much done - they live or die based on how hard and more importantly, how effectively they work.  As we've grown from a couple developers to over twenty developers, I think our pace has slowed.  I'd like to see it more like the early days.<p>3)  The best sales people can make 2X what a developer makes.  As a developer, it would be nice to be able to make that much money.  But the company cannot do that right now, because it cannot accurately measure my performance.",1265771204.0

I have never been in this specific situation before, so I was curious how others might interpret the language or how they might approach it. Its not iron-clad. Businesses owners are not heartless beasts. I think if approached correctly, many would be willing to sign a waiver. Also, I don't think it is cut and dry. There is room for interpretation (I didn't post every word of the agreement, so how would you know for sure?). That's what the court system is for, if it comes down to it.<p>There are other alternatives as well, such as working somewhere else (if you think that is the right move), or just couching the idea for awhile.<p>I think hope is good anyway. Nobody here really wants to be a mindless drone for some company for the rest of their lives. We're all learning here.",1265770856.0
