Scala comes with style (functional, lack of boilerplate, sugar like xml(?)), anecdotal rapid development, and some pretty good concurrency.<p>Personally I think the syntax in scala is even uglier than Java's, if such a feat were possible, and looking at scala code makes me want to stab my eyes out with forks. Thankfully I don't think I'll have to touch the JVM any time soon.",1361519977.0

Blame points my way  dont do it again  move along nothing more to see.<p>I have never found this to be a constructive 'culture'. Instead of placing blame on others or feeling guilt myself, I try to see if there's a way of improving the process itself instead of relying on people not fucking up. Because that's going to happen to everyone. Bugs are still going to happen, but if the process (be it deployment, testing/QA, dev, w/e) eliminates potential points of failure, they will be less frequent and hopefully less severe.",1361519925.0

5,5263231,comment,5259365.0,5259712.0,2,0,steevdave,,,"I have two Chromebooks. One with 3G, that runs the stable ChromeOS, and the other wifi only, runs ChromiumOS, latest ToT, mostly because I'm working on getting ChromiumOS to run on our hardware, so it's a bit easy to compare and contrast when things are working and when they aren't. It's dead simple to boot off an sdcard or USB stick. The Chrome/Chromium did a REALLY good job at making the information available.<p>I'll probably buy the Pixel as well. The more I use ChromeOS, the more I realize how much time I waste on other crap that doesn't really help me get done what I want to do. And using ChromiumOS, there is the ""dev_install"" command which will set up a Gentoo chroot in /usr/local, that points to the machine that you built it on, and if you're running the devserver, you can run emerge pkgname, it will shoot it off to the server to build it, and once it's done compiling, installs in the chroot.  There is also gmerge which will install ChromiumOS packages for you (e.g. A new version of the browser or maybe a newer kernel, without rebuilding everything) OR you can build a new image, hit up the Help page in settings and it will generate a diff on the server and update the entire install to the latest image. It's really an interesting setup, and I really like it.<p>Everything goes through gerrit, so you can even help out with version bumps and or patches fairly easily. The documentation is really good, and if you happen to hang out on IRC, the ChromiumOS developers are extremely helpful when something isn't clear, and even update the documentation for clarity.",1361519866.0

There are many forms of this public-private merging of government.  To take just one aspect, consider the revolving door whereby bank executives go between their banks and government jobs and back again: to just pick one example virtually at random, obamas chief of staff is a ""former"" citi group executive.  I wonder, if a bank executive goes to washington for a little while, do they even notice that they changed jobs?<p>This article explains that the big banks wouldn't even be profitable without massive tax payer support, here is a choice quote from the article which really drives home how intense the stranglehold banks have over government policy:<p>""Neither bank executives nor shareholders have much incentive to change the situation. On the contrary, the financial industry spends hundreds of millions of dollars every election cycle on campaign donations and lobbying, much of which is aimed at maintaining the subsidy. The result is a bloated financial sector and recurring credit gluts.""<p>Some people wonder what could be done about such a situation.  The sad truth is that there are already an overwhelming number of ideas that are floating around that have already been demonstrated to work (see iceland).  The problem is not coming up with a good idea, the problem is how to implement one of the many good ideas which have already been proven to work.<p>The crux of the matter is that only the power of a strong federal government can take on the even more powerful too big too fail banks.  The only way political change happens is when people get organized, and the american political system gives us a lot of freedoms.
