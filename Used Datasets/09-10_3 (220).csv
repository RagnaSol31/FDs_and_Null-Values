I'd love it to be about being brutally honest with your product, but if that's how it was then there would be no need for marketing. Instead, marketing is about conveying what you want to convey quickly and without crap. Apple's point is, ""Here are our new things. They're really cool."" Anything outside of that you've got to implicitly understand is there just for spectacle, and in Apple's case I forgive them entirely, because they're so good at making commercials and ads.<p>Know what kind of marketing I <i>hate</i>? The sort where you put smiling faces all over and add peripheral features and say ""We're a community of happy people,"" or ""We give you an experience"", or that use things like ridiculous swooshes and gradients to look nice. Know who does that? Opera Opera Opera. They show smiling users, and their site's all about swooshes and gradients.<p>And it pisses me off more that Opera is so arrogant about being the first, because <i>guess who they're blatantly stealing from?</i> Apple! Their front page's Latest News aesthetic is ripped directly from Apple's front page. Their layout for browser features on their browser page? That's new: it used to be columns until Apple started their ""3-column new features"" method of advertising. Their ""three snappy words for a product"" is taken from Apple. Their font is Myriad Pro, for fuck's sake. Only they don't rip <i>right</i> from Apple, because Apple's schtick is ""We show you our product and make that product beautiful enough to market itself"", and Opera can't do that. (Maybe now that Hicks is on Opera's team, they can start - I'd love that, since I prefer Opera and their marketing to the browser and marketing of Mozilla - remember that ""promotes openness"" checkbox on the Firefox vs. Safari page? I do.)<p>As I said in another comment, at least Apple is honest about their marketing. Their marketing is very blatantly so, and they keep it a point to maintain some integrity: all they talk about are their features. Opera doesn't do that. Most companies don't. As a result, Apple's ads come across every time as refreshing and new, and they don't try to convince you with features that aren't really there. I'm fine with that.",1235619072.0

I've found myself getting thrilled about features Apple adds that I've had on other systems for a while, because they very often get them <i>just right</i> in ways that other operating systems and companies don't.<p>Dashboard and Spaces, for instance, both excited me a lot when I first got to use them, and in Space's case when they first got announced. I'd been using Ubuntu at the time, and I had both widgets and multiple desktops, but it was different. With the Apple system, it feels right visually and in effect. The way widgets spin around when you use them, the small thing like the clock turning into a calendar when you click it, in Dashboard. With Spaces, the way your windows visually flew around, and the way you could zoom out and see the little cubbies.<p>I'll get flack for saying it, but it just happened with Safari 4 and tabs. For the first time, they <i>make sense</i> where they are. I run Safari with minimal chrome, and now the tabs ARE the window bar.

Safari 4 has problems with the specifics of how the tabs go, but for the first time it makes sense where they appear visually.<p>That's why I love Apple's marketing: because it's so excitingly arrogant.

Since Etherpad saves every keystroke, I convinced the founders to add a way to play them back.  ""Startups in 13 Sentences"" was the first essay I wrote on Etherpad.  Now I'm going to write all of them on it.<p>Playback is just one little feature of Etherpad, but think of the implications of this alone.  Among other things it will make cheating impossible in classes where students write papers, because now you can finally ""show your work"" in writing the way you do in math.",1235617764.0

It often seems like Opera's marketing strategy is to scream ""me too!"" every time one of the more popular browsers does something.<p>Bottom line: Even though they're right about Apple being a little misleading the sour grapes/call to arms strategy makes me less inclined to try Opera not more.<p>If they really felt the need to do something they should have taken it with good humor and then turned it into a marketing pitch by extolling their products virtues.",1235617414.0
