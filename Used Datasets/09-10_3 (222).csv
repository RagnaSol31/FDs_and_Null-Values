On FB, a good chunk of links to ""outside world"" stuff pass around. Websites do fbconnect 'cos FB&twitter drive traffic to them. Google places contextual ads on these sites and in youtube videos <i>without</i> anybody needing to search for anything. Even youtube has ""share on FB"" button.<p>I don't think FB can keep their soc graph to themselves for much longer .. if as ES says people will just give the data to google ... just as they probably do for FB now. (You can tell FB to crawl your gmail contacts and link up.)<p>So by that argument I can buy ES's ""FB is not our prime competitor"" statement. Apple is somewhat obviously not a competitor since google can also push ads to iOS devices and pull data like location.<p>That leaves Bing .. which makes me scratch my head. The only reason I can think of for google considering Bing to be their main competitor is to avoid antitrust suits by not looking like a search monopoly.<p>Side note: FB's ads are pretty funny actually.

People tend to do those things when interest rates go down. Investors didn't want to buy a bond that paid low rates of return when interest rates were high (as most bonds do) and then might get repaid in full with no penalty when the rates lowered.<p>The answer, of course, was to roll a bunch of mortgages together into a special purpose vehicle (SPV) then sell bonds to fund it, then divide those bonds into tranches such that the lower tiers got repaid in full when the refinancings started. Kind of hard to believe now that investors used to be worried about people paying their mortgages off too soon.",1285386730.0

Personally, I find the gym feels like work, but running or biking outdoors doesn't.<p>Set a break timer for like 10 minutes.  You don't have to break your train of thought, but at least stand up, stretch, and sit back down.<p>Have a toy side project that you put a few hours into.<p>And get out of town regularly, like kingofspain says.  Especially if your startup is at home, the days seamlessly blend into months.<p>Quit work at a reasonable hour.  If you're behind, you'll get a full day of work in there, believe me.  There will be sprints, of course, but keep the work surgical and focused.  Who are you doing a favor to if you burn out and your productivity falls below nominal levels?<p>Of course, these are all suggestions only.  What works for one doesn't necessarily work for another.",1285384176.0

It seems much cleaner to be able to gracefully abort whatever operation you were doing. Presumably there is already error handling for fs/network errors. Usually you can hop onto those handlers with memory errors and be just fine.<p>Though if it's linux it'll just kill you anyway :-). (Yeah, I know you can turn the OOM killer off).",1285383968.0

Then even a year later I was able to trim that 140-150 down to about 80. I also deleted all the random people I had lost touch with from high school who were no longer relevant to me, as since they were added we hadn't bothered to communicate.<p>I realized a lot of people on Facebook are there to collect friends like it's a status symbol. I really didn't like having college friends, coworkers, professors, high school buddies, employers, random celebrities/bands all lumped into one list together, there needs to be a way too separate these groups.",1285383937.0

That's nice, but I think you care more than anyone else you're telling.<p>I say this tongue in cheek of course because I'm always telling everyone that I don't use Facebook. It's kind of difficult at times, but really, the people who I want to talk to will still find ways to talk to me. Better, I find that not using Facebook frees up a lot of time that I wasn't really aware that I was using.",1285383804.0

In some ways, you do pick a recipient whenever you send an email, so it's not like you're not used to having to pick a recipient when posting something on the web. Facebook makes it pretty easy every time you post a status to choose the list of people, or a black list, or white list or even pick the people one by one that will be able to read your post, same as with emails.",1285383716.0

The traditional Unix way of organizing files makes sense in a command line world, and I'd expect that sed, awk, grep and friends will continue to live in directories like /usr/bin.  But for GUI desktop apps, there's really no <i>good</i> reason each app can't live in it's own directory.",1285383649.0

I do think that FB can be traded around $50 billion and may be $500 billion (Who cares? Most of investors-speculators don't care about its paper worth on the market.) if another dot-com bubble forms. However, what would be its sustainable value? How will it generate its profit to justify its valuation? Until it's on its verified earnings statement, it's just another bomb-passing game. Who really care whether it's $5 billion, or $500 billion, if one believes he can pass his bomb to the enthusiastic guy beside him?",1285383610.0
