Worse still is unless you are familiar with excellence you will be very poor at judging it. Perhaps this is because of differing measures of excellence people use or the result of ignorance.<p>I think a system that accepts fuzziness in measurement would be better than one that tries to be exact.,1271390169

I doubt they want to compete head-to-head with AdMob selling low value ads to diet pill web sites and punch the monkey scams. More likely they'll have a short list of exclusive deals for mobile advertising mostly with Fortune 500 companies. Apple could have had AdMob if they wanted them. I get the feeling they were never fully committed to the idea of becoming a dumb ad aggregator and that's ultimately why they passed on AdMob. If we want to get really cynical maybe Apple never had <i>any</i> interest in AdMob. They simply wanted to provoke Google into making what looks like an anti-competitive acquisition. They know Google, like Microsoft, has the war chest to buy first and think later. Did Google really need AdMob? It seems to me Google could have murdered AdMob in-house with the leverage they already have with AdSense/AdWords. Maybe Apple's plan from the start was to go the premium route and just wanted to distract Google with what appeared to be a more direct threat.",1271389208

72,1269634,comment,1268753.0,1269408.0,0,0,chris11,,,"The eff wrote an essay on how to deal with music piracy.<p>They basically said that although artists need to be fairly compensated that piracy is not going to disappear. They also think that government interference should be minimized and that fans will always be better at distribution.<p>Their suggestion is voluntary collective licensing. Basically artists join licensing organizations and fans pay money to the organization to get the right to legally download music. Artists don't have to join, but non-member artists would be faced with the tough task of collecting money from infringing fans.<p>They also suggest compulsory licensing for property that owners refuse to license at any cost. They note that the government has done this in other cases. Compulsory licensing was enforced with radio, internet radio, cable/satellite tv, and player pianos.<p>Links:<p><a href=""http://www.eff.org/wp/better-way-forward-voluntary-collective-licensing-music-file-sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eff.org/wp/better-way-forward-voluntary-collectiv...</a><p><a href=""http://www.eff.org/pages/making-p2p-legal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eff.org/pages/making-p2p-legal</a><p>Overall the suggestions seem reasonable from my point of view.",1271387464

If your app uses a well-understood (by you), proven (by others) software stack and you've been testing well enough, your worries may be for naught.<p>Some folks around here recommend tools like pingdom.

I'm looking forward to an enlightening discussion about this.<p>I was disappointed by the end, however, because it suggested that downvoting was a way of managing trolls.  I think downvoting means different things to different people:  some downvote to merely show disagreement, for example.  So a downvoted comment on Hacker News does not necessarily mean that it is likely a troll comment.  Therefore, downvotes can't achieve the necessary shared awareness.<p>(I will disagree with myself and note that comments that have been voted all the way down to -4 tend to be trollish, so maybe it works to an extent.)",1271387004
