If homes aren't tying up the wealth of Joe Workingclass they'll be tying up the wealth of John Richbastard instead.<p>How much of the low rate of home ownership in Europe can be attributed to property title? If the only housing units available are blocks of apartments on a single deed then you'd expect a low rate of ownership, whereas if the entire country was split into individual-title houses then you'd expect a much higher rate.<p>EDIT: Wait, I forgot to mention the screwiest thing about the long-term prospects of Germany: it has a birth rate of 1.4 per couple, way below replacement rate.

I also use VS at work and its very refreshing to use simple but extensible tools. VS takes forever to load and none of the tools work half as good as the cmd ones.<p>VIM is just an editor with advanced editor tools. If you are looking for more of a IDE emacs really follows that path. Its highly extensible and has many more IDE type features.<p>Again using an IDE is fine and dandy if you ship things. :),1271562718.0
