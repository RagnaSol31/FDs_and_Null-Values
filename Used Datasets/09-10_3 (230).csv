I would much rather own 100% of my company, hire a programmer to do that work, and use my time to make my own contacts.<p>If you think you have to move to the Valley to make these contacts there's nothing wrong with moving.  People always brag about it being a common everyday occurrence to meet and chat with VC's there anyways. I don't know how true this is, but that's only because I've never been there to experience the environment firsthand.<p>And I'm not belittling the value of YC in any way, I'm just reminding you that there are other ways of doing things than the ways you've conceived.  Whether or not they work for you is up to you to decide.<p>I have a very independent outlook on life and business, so even if this might work well for me it doesn't mean it would work for you or others.  I would actually love to partner with the right people in a new venture, but I won't take the time to seek them out because of two reasons:<p>1- I know I can be successful on my own without them, and if I take time out I will have to sacrifice the progress I'm already making in order to find them, and ...<p>2- Given the unreliable nature of the task of finding a reliable 'partner' I feel it makes more sense for me to just stick to what I've already started, and just keep working on it myself.<p>If the right partner comes along for me that's great, but I won't lose any sleep over it if I have to do everything myself.  I get a lot of support from my wife anyways, and it's probably better support than I might get from another kind of 'partner'.  This may be another reason why I do not agree with some online claims that having a co-founder is so important to the success of a new business.<p>On the other hand, I was launching new ventures years before I met my wife, and going back to ""doing it all myself"" simply doesn't phase me in the least.  I am not one of those folks who need someone else around to keep my energy and focus, that's all.  For better or worse that's just the way I am.",1237780659.0

National Bureau of Economic Research (Cambridge, MA), 2003 showed that Krueger and Dale aggregated their data in a way that tended to underrepresent the advantage of going to the better college for ALL students, not just low-income students. So if you carefully read the Krueger and Dale study, you can tease out an advantage to the better colleges that they admit is especially strong for low-income students. But they might have found an even stronger effect size if they had analyzed their data differently.<p>Anyway, yes, for low-income students who manage to get admitted the lesson from all studies is clear: go to the best college that admitted you, and take advantage of your opportunity for an elite education.",1237780285.0

They are important, of course, but I wonder if, in some cases, the critical issues are those related to filtering a large number of inputs.<p>Consider: I'm 43 (and at least on the edge of what some of you would call ""the old generation""). I find large portions of the web to be unusable without flashblock. I'm sure I have a well developed case of banner blindness (of which I'm very glad), but some pages are still rough.<p>Now take a 70-year-old who grew up in a media-poor environment and has little computer experience, and stick a typical web page in front of them. If it's something to read, sure, they can read it. But navigation, search, etc., all require finding the right thing to click on, and ignoring all the distractions. Can they do that easily, even if they know how?<p>I just went to the Amazon home page, certainly one of the calmer commercial pages on the web, and counted the number of clickable regions on my screen. Result: 143. I can easily imagine someone who knows what they want to do and how to do it, still having trouble getting it done, when confronted with that many choices.<p>Now take that person to an animation-heavy page. They see 100+ choices, of which 30 of the wrong ones are insistently clamoring for attention. Is this going to work, even if they know what to do?<p>The real question here is whether the kind of unconscious filtering we all do is something the old can (easily) learn. And if it is, how to best ensure that someone learns it. I'm afraid I don't know the answer to either of those questions.",1237777956.0

I found that to be enormously true, myself.  I am from a working-class background -- did my undergraduate degree at a state school, and found it boring and, really, a waste of time -- much like high school.  But I also think now that a lot of this was my own fault -- I had no idea how to approach college, and how to really make it work for me.<p>Later, I then did a graduate program at an Ivy League school -- and the scales fell away from my eyes.  The most important thing I learned there, I think, was how successful people work in the world -- how to resourcefully make the most out of every opportunity, how to seize the initiative, how to make connections.  I have the feeling that if I hadn't been brought up in the class I was, I would have inhaled these things at my parents' knee -- as it was, it took me much, much longer than it should have; but it was an enormous lesson, and <i>almost</i> worth the ridiculous student loans I now owe.  ;-)<p>(I am also by no means saying that an Ivy League school is the only place for lower-class kids to learn how to work the world -- far from it!  I was just not talented enough to figure it out myself, and the experience made all the difference in the world for me.)",1237777283.0

All the bluster and outrage about the employee bonuses is merely because it's been successfully framed as a moral issue and not a financial issue.<p>All crises need a scapegoat and the management of AIG have been rightly or wrongly handed the role.  If each household in the US had been handed an invoice for $5000 to raise the hundreds aof billions to bail out AIG, then the bailout would never have happened.
