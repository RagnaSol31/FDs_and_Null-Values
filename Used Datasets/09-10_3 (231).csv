I feel like given some contrived option to identify themselves with the heritage of their birth culture or nationality, or by their careers, or by where they would fit into traditional subcultures, very many Redditors would identify as Redditors, by interests and attitudes in common with a sufficient critical mass, even with dissent.  The Colbert/Stewart rally, more than the individual acts of kindness, has fed a zeitgeist within Reddit that they are a community awakening to their own political power.  Momentum is currently building to a campaign in protest against the TSA (which will probably fizzle, with much disillusionment for all).  But I think 4chan has showed online subcultures with some chaotic convergence of will can increasingly effect the world outside their own community.  And I can't conceive of any way a community, online or off, could come to be sufficiently large to find political feet, and turn out any better than Reddit has.<p>Regarding HN:<p>HN still has a higher signal-noise ratio, but as HN gets more popular (with many coming from Reddit, I presume -- and going the other way, as I did), I find that the difference between HN and applicable sub-reddits is dissolving.

It's when things heat up that the problems begin. Being arrested in the UK as a citizen of the UK is not a big deal IMHO, a night in a cell is a bummer, but not the end of the world. In the US, on a visa, I have no idea what is and isn't being recorded about me, and a reasonable amount of paranoia is required.<p>As the OP said, the other aspect is that you are flying because you <i>need</i> to be somewhere and flight is the only option. This more heavily biases international travelers towards compliance, because they have a lot more to lose in time/money if they don't board their flight.",1289704469.0

Setting aside the ambiguity of a term like ""serious cryptographers,"" the best I can do is point you to this overview of the field: <a href=""http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bwyseur/research/wbc.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bwyseur/research/wbc.php</a><p>For a more approachable introduction, see <a href=""http://rdist.root.org/2007/03/23/protecting-the-protection-code/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rdist.root.org/2007/03/23/protecting-the-protection-c...</a>  Nate Lawson (the author of that post) designed the protection scheme for Blu-Ray DVD's.  One of the key features of Blu-Ray's DRM scheme is that it is renewable -- breaking one DVD's protection does not lead to breaking all protections.<p>A closely related field that will be very interesting to see develop is homomorphic encryption: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption</a>.  I believe homomorphic encryption is taken seriously by  cryptographers, and it will help in certain situations where Eve is Bob.<p>There are published algorithms for white-boxing DES and AES, with corresponding papers discussing how to break those implementations.  The general idea behind the publicly disclosed algorithm is to compose portions of the operation into a series of table lookups.  If you're familiar with AES, think of it as the s-box transformation and the AddRoundKey transformation happening simultaneously in one lookup table.  Add to that lookup tables that perform random, bijective mappings throughout the decryption operation. That gives you a feel for how one implementation works.  It ends up with the same output as stock AES, just implemented in a completely different way.<p>The canonical attack involves fault injection.  Basically, the attackers inject bad data into the state matrix during the operation.  By mapping the error propagation throughout the decryption process, they are able to recover the key through some pretty heavy analysis.  If you really want the details, take a look at the paper.<p>If you add tons of obfuscation, anti-debugging, code checksumming, and self modifying code to that library, it becomes a nightmare to figure out what is going on.  DRM libraries, like malware samples, actively fight back against being examined.  Now, add on top of that the fact that you are trying to launch a statistical analysis attack of the data being produced and it becomes a very hard problem.  All that explanation is simply to say that using DRM in this scenario is about more than keeping honest people honest.  It really is about preventing that one Eve from creating something for every Bob to consume.",1289703655.0
