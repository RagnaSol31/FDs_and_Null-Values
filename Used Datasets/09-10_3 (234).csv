I lost my job because of this (I was a trader at a hedge fund). I had about 30 attacks in the first 3 months.<p>It was obvious from the 3rd or 4th day on Lexapro that the drug was doing <i>something</i>: I had some mildly annoying but harmless side effects in the first week or two-- sweating, ""the yawns"", tiredness, and weird visuals when going to sleep.<p>After about a week on the SSRI, I began to have a panic attack while in the park and something weird happened-- the attack just ended after 5 seconds, and I felt no worse than if I'd been startled by a loud sound. The attacks became milder and more manageable. Now I have about one per month-- unpleasant, but not something that'd make me unemployable-- but none at any level of severity approaching what I had before I started taking the drug.<p>Some of this improvement is due to lifestyle changes and increasing skill at handling the problem, but a large fraction of the improvement is directly attributable to Lexapro.",1272771978

Similarly, the clients of Goldman were free to buy or sell whatever securities they want - Goldman's job is specifically not to make a claim as to whether something is ""good"" or ""bad"" especially when it's not very clear cut.

I have had real panic attacks, and they're pretty awful.<p>The worst part was the month during which I thought it was a physical medical condition, and the absolutely rotten quality of treatment I got in many cases. One example was (during the worst attack I ever had) a 7-hour ER wait, including 6 hours locked up in the psych ER, without being told why this was happening. Once I was able to see a doctor (1 doctor on staff for the whole psych ER) he was able to explain what was happening and why, but even then, all he could prescribe was Buspar, which doesn't do anything for panic.<p>My experience is that the attacks don't go away entirely, but they become rarer and much more manageable. The depersonalizing attacks that feel like bad drug trips don't happen anymore for me (and stopped happening once I got appropriate medicine) because once I get to a 4 or 5 (heart racing, painful muscle tension, inability to concentrate) on the panic scale I can get it under control, taking a benzo if necessary.",1272771432

Unless I'm mistaken, only a small percentage of the market use their services.<p>The same editors in Techcrunch who believe that H.264 won because of the results from one web encoding company, probably also believe Apple dominate the market after walking into an Applecentre, and that Techcrunch dominates the news market.<p>This is perhaps the most deceptive article I have ever seen. I am so sick of Apple users standing up for Steve Jobs with clearly misleading evidence. Doing so may help keep their stocks afloat, but its terrible journalism. No, H.264 hasn't won, and cannot in fact win because standards keep changing.<p>Also, Apple certainly doesn't dominate the market! Their sales figures are absolutely dwarfed by the rest of the market and whilst the flash-disabled iPad/iphone may be selling well, their sales figures are insignificant compared to the number of flash-compatible internet devices out there (and with Android getting flash, this will likely hold true).<p>If anything, due to the way that Steve Job's is treating developers, it's possible people will see what jerk's Apple are, and return the trend to flash again.<p>Anyway, I think it's too early to say though. Sooner or later browsers will decide on a common format, and it's unlikely to be H.264 (because of the patents, and the fact even companies don't like paying licensing fees). Furthermore, just because Steve Job's says ""all video formats have patents"", people interpret it wrongly to mean Xiph will get sued. It could be possible that Steve Job's is just being an idiot too (Steve Job's also is happy to give off the impression that OSX cannot get viruses).<p>Thing's will change soon, but it is difficult to say which format will win still.",1272770008

So, for example, when you check your transactions and see one that you can't recognize then you call your bank and object that trx. In that moment the bank ask for the physical documents and may check your signature, but it depends on the rules of your card operator (Visa, MasterCard, Amex).",1272769955
