The language's bloat (exceesive boiler-plate required for everything), lack of high-level functionality and general approach to boxing in the programmer mean that new programmers don't want to use it (most will learn it though).<p>The slow initialisation time (JVM problem) and lack of native interfaces (despite the work done here) mean that companies don't want to use it for customer products.<p>For internal apps, I'd wager that the company just wants something that most people know and that is quick to develop in, and while Java has some ground here I think other languages will be making strong headway too, especially when you have some control on the deployment platforms.<p>Java just strikes me as dissapointing now.  It is probably single-handedly responsible for us getting over the fear of automatic memory management and GC.  Similarly it's had massive influences on virtual machines and easy cross-platform deployment.  Just about every CS student in the world knows Java.  But right now it has failed to innovate with the resurgent popularity for language functionality, address the issue of bloat or develop on the issues that discourage people actually using it for cross-platform deployment.<p>In the mobile sector it's pretty strong, but Objective-C/iPhone will probably hurt that, and it's only strong because of the JVM's portability.  On the web it had the potential to take out flash, but the incredible load time and associated lag of the JVM initialising has killed that chance.<p>Overall, Java is only afloat because it is too big to sink.",1253159325

In this hypothetical they might also have a freemium deal where they have a ridiculously cheap pro version like Google Apps for business - $50/user/year.<p>Currently, it's safe to assume with their current model they are steadily growing market share and are making several $million in annual revenue. I wonder, however, where they'd be today if they had a purely free, ad supported system in place of their current monthly fee plans. This also assumes they had other means of funding themselves whether raising more money through angels/VCs or they depended more heavily on their consulting business.<p>Anyway, I pose this question to HN. I'm not really sure how to answer it. My only doubts about a free model for them would be that possibly businesses expect to pay for services much more than individuals do so perhaps they wouldn't be perceived as high quality as they are now.. but then again if they had millions more users than they do now with a targeted ad system in place perhaps they'd be that much better off.<p>?",1253158560

It was almost designed for people who want to spend their day ""living"" inside of email and calendar appointments.  Ever click on the Journal by accident and get a wizard to set it up?  New emails greet you with a ""click me"" pop-up notification including preview text, a sound, and a little ""new mail"" icon by your clock.  It's like the most important thing you should do right now is stop whatever you're working on and read the new message; mental death for anyone attempting to concentrate on something.<p>I know you can shut this all off and make Outlook quieter, but sometimes coworkers and bosses don't like this.

Then Outlook can be really helpful so long as you know how to ""tame the beast"" with email rules.<p>Exchange is a nice piece of tech (albeit a bit of a pain to setup and configure from an IT's perspective - I've done several builds myself).  It ""tightly"" integrates with Outlook in a properly-configured Active Directory environment.

Search is MILLIONS of times better than Outlook.<p>I think it comes down to a matter of taste and work habits.  Some people live and die by Outlook.

You'd model different relationships and the likelihood of in person interaction.</i><p>A <i>REALISTIC</i> simulation like this on a global scale would be ridiculously useful in multiple fields. And while several groups have been trying to do something similar, there just isn't enough data for it to work properly at the individual agent level.<p>(At higher levels you have for example <a href=""http://www.gleamviz.org/2009/09/us-winter-projections-mitigation-effect-of-antiviral-treatment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gleamviz.org/2009/09/us-winter-projections-mitiga...</a> )",1253156438

Nor is it because he's using NLP. It's because he's used his background as an entheogen enthusiast, an experience junky, and an appreciator of world cultures to create his own private set of rituals. This works basically the same way that organized religion works, but instead of ""community magic"" it's Steve's ""reality distortion field."" (Because no one has access to the power these rituals confer.)<p>The number one thing we're missing in the startup field right now is a good set of rituals that dictate how new businesses are launched. We never evolved this in the West because 250 years ago everyone lived in the same town their entire life, so all their potential customers already knew them. And 100 years ago everyone went to work for these enormous companies.<p>But today launching your first business, or any new business, is a major part of a person's life, just as big as a wedding or a bar mitzvah. But as a society we haven't yet caught up.<p>If you look at all the big companies, like Facebook or whatever, a huge number have gotten their start by spamming people, or astroturfing, or doing some other really unethical stuff.<p>What we need is an open source set of rituals that govern how new entrepreneurs introduce their products and services to the world, and also govern what is an appropriate response from the people being pitched to. The point of the rituals wouldn't be to say what people can and can't do per se, but rather to induce people into a state of mind conducive to acting ethically and transparently.<p>Anyway that is my take at least.",1253156419
