Sorry, but knowing about it doesn't make you special.<p>""Volatile"" is the wrong fix, by the way.  That's just depending on yet another non-required behavior.  There is in fact no further reference to ""str"" between the function call and the reassignment at the start of the next iteration, so there's nothing for ""volatile"" to chew on.  This particular version of this particular compiler just happens to add an extra pair of stack operations in this case, but it's not truly required to.  A real fix would not only mark the variable as volatile but also add a reference after the function call.  The same ""(void)str;"" type of statement that's often used to suppress ""unused argument/variable"" warnings should count as a reference to force correct behavior here.",1309923624.0

I'm trying to take a data-driven look at the major structural problems with America, but there are just way too many of them.
