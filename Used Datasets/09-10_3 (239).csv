It had sat on the shelf for a couple of years as the Lucent Orinoco WiFi chipset didn't support WPA, had 256mb of RAM and the hard drive kept crapping out.<p>I recently put a 30gb hard drive in, an atheros USB wifi stick and installed Arch Linux on there and it's fantastic. It's not as quick as a modern laptop but is more than capable of basic browsing and xterm-based fun. Aside from the two years that I haven't used it, the overall cost works out at roughly £250 per year. It has a 10.4"" screen and aside from the memory is roughly comparable to an EEE PC 701 in terms of performance.<p>I'm more than happy with it and it still holds a charge, 9 years later.",1263181943.0

10,1044277,story,,,8,4,bertm,Ask HN: The Widget Economy Discussion,,"I was persuaded to write this article because I am building a struggling new widget (defined loosely as a single feature product, i.e. iPhone App, web 2.0 startup).  However this is ask HN is not about my widget, but about the enormous quantity of widget makers and widgets being made. I would like to start a HN discussion about the widget economy and how we entrepreneurs can “get the best of it”.<p>First, I would like to discuss why these widgets are important. A widget seems to be a low cost way to solve a particular pain point. In order for a widget to be viable (Such that the widget maker profits from making and maintaining said widget), there must be a minimum number of users. The definition of profits may vary depending on the maker/maker-organization such as financial or social gain.<p>Second and most important, how many widgets can people actively use? (i.e. Online  tools, iphone apps, etc.) A better way to state this is: How many widgets will one actively pay for? I would speculate a guess that there is limit after which people become saturated. It follows that there would then be a consolidation of widgets into features of a “suite” (defined loosely as a collection of related widgets). At this consolidation point, an entrepreneur would like to be a suite maker rather than a widget maker.<p>Would anyone be willing to speculate answers to the following questions?-- Preferably quantitative\n1.How many users must a widget (again, a single feature product) have to be a viable business? \n2.How many widgets will a person actively use and pay for? \n3.At what widget count do you tend to see a consolidation into ""suites""?\n4.When (in what markets, with what user base, etc.) is it advantageous to build a single feature product vs. a product “suite”?",1263181755.0

Sometimes code is created for a reasons other than functionality, or is functional while making commentary on the world or the way things should be.<p>Also, languages themselves ooze philosophy. We talk about not 'writing Java in any language,' or how Rails is 'opinionated software,' or how Python is 'batteries included.' Every language expresses its authors viewpoints about the world.<p>> It also requires far too much prior knowledge to be appreciated by most people.<p>I didn't think that accessibility was a requirement for art. In fact, it would seem that among certain crowds, work that's too accessible isn't seen as art. My art history is admittedly really poor, but wasn't pop art looked down upon for a while? Besides, you can't possibly tell me that, say, modern art is accessible, yet it's still art.<p>> The article also assumes a false contradiction between art and science that makes me suspect the author understands neither.<p>I'm not saying that they're contradictory.

51,1044231,comment,1043532.0,1043927.0,0,0,steveklabnik,,,"It seems that 'art' vs 'craft' shares the same relationship that 'computer science' and 'programming' do. Not they're equivalent, but that they both share the same kind of higher vs lower distinction. Mildly off-topic, but I think it relates well to your 'pollution' sentiment. Universities have certainly been using the name 'Computer Science' while teaching 'programming.' And not teaching it well. But that's another discussion.<p>> In an environment such as programming, this doesn't seem possible, but I'd love to be proven wrong.<p>Not that anything can be proven, but I do think that code can say profound things. It might just be that it's because I'm only (almost) 24, but I feel that code helps me to understand myself, and has managed to change my opinions on seemingly unrelated topics. I'd agree that art has a higher calling than 'pretty pictures,' and that it ""say[s] something profound."" I didn't say much about this in my post, though.<p>To fully relate how I think about this would require a whole essay. So I'll be a little short, and sum it up with a small example.<p>I've been programming computers since I was 7. That's 17 years of coding. Yes, it's not like I was writing anything amazing at that young of an age, but those silly little games that I wrote certainly affected me personally. In a very stereotypical way, I was drawn to libertariansim, even though my parents are pretty staunch Republicans. I discussed a lot of political philosophy with a friend of mine who has very different views than I, and she remarked how much she saw a similarity between my thought process and the workings of a computer, and it really made me think about my views on the world. I realize that I tend to view the world as a system of equations, or a function with inputs and outputs, that I have pretty simple heuristic functions by which I make decisions, and that most people _are not like this at all_. Which came first? Do I think this way because I've been programming my entire life, or do computers work that way because they're a human creation?<p>This realization causes me to compare and contrast code and life on a fairly regular basis. When I go to write an API, I try to think in terms of communication. Connecting two applications is like connecting two people, and you have to bridge the gap between the two. When I'm naming functions or writing documentation, I think about how I'd explain my understanding of a problem to another person, and how the pieces of the puzzle fit together. When I see language wars, I think of how they're similar to real wars; no matter who 'wins', _everyone_ loses. Also that sometimes, quantity (of users) is it's own kind of quality (of design decisions.) When I think about Open Source, I try to resolve the cognitive dissonance that makes me say ""socialism can't work"" with the fact that I participate in something that's socialist in nature on a regular basis.<p>At this point, I'm rambling. Sorry. But I hope that I've at least started to make you think about the topic a little. The medium may be a bit strange, but it's not like modern art ""say[s] something profound"" to John Q Public, either.",1263179656.0

And they generally have to support themselves. Why should they have to provide hard data to people who don't actually live within their boundaries (presumably you don't)? Especially when the primary usage of that data is going to be to support some ideology that none of their residents would agree with.,1263179491.0

When the prices spike, oil companies are willing to spend more resources to extract oil as quickly as possible in order to sell off their reserves at the highest possible price.  This inevitably leads to significantly more supply than demand, and falling prices.  At which point capacity is taken offline to prevent oversupply, and the cycle repeats.<p>If prices are high enough, the market will find a way to extract their reserves fast enough.  There could be temporary short falls, but they'll be just that.  Should the price remain high, it will give new entrants an opportunity to compete.",1263179049.0
