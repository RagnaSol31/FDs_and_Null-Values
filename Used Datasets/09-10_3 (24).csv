Germany and France beat the other juvenile countries into fiscal submission.\n3. The new ""germanized"" europe lifts itself out of ash.<p>Whatever people think, the whole point of eurozone is ""germanization"" of Europe. It's not as some people state that Germany is trying to occupy the Europe. The fact is that Europe wants to occupy Germany.

A pound of muscle burns about 6 calories at rest, you have to add a ton to impact on metabolic rate (see also the next issue I discuss, low metabolic rate isnt a problem).  And that takes a lot of time, time better spent focusing on active fat loss.""<p><a href=""http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/training-the-obese-beginner-part-2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/training-the-obese...</a><p><a href=""http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/research-review/dissecting-the-energy-needs-of-the-body-research-review.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/research-review/dissecting-...</a>",1321171414.0

Yelling about some missing feature, only to be told that it's in the obvious preference pane, is just daft.)",1321171305.0

Anything would be better than that.<p>(Did I misread you? What you write seems rather xenophobic besides being somewhat economically illiterate. From a strict economic point of view, there is no surplus of jobs. The price of labour should rise until the demand for labour abates; and the German workers would be better off. To the degree that that isn't happening (though Germany's population overall is decreasing, not increasing), it is because Germany has an open economy with free movement of labour. If you're attacking that, you're attacking the whole foundation of the EU, and I don't want much more to do with you.)",1321171217.0
