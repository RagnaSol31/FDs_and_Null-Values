15,1272573,story,,,2,0,rick_2047,Ask HN: Please rate my idea Localized cheap Hobby Kits business,,"Hi,I have been really impressed by the startup culture that is portrayed here. Before discovering this site I wanted to get a PhD and live my life as an academician. But after looking at lives and works of fabulous startup people I am greatly inspired to do something like this on my own.(Not like the PhD idea is totally abandoned but something is pushing me towards the startup culture).<p>I have cooked up an idea, not a very original one, not exactly complying to the web apps mostly discussed here and not something nobody else has ever done.<p>Ok enough of a preface, now the idea. And the idea is... DRUM ROLL ... a online hobby electronics kits shop. Ok Ok don't abandon me now. I know its very very oooooooollllllllllddddd concept but there is a twist here.<p>Let me tell you something about the scenario where I will apply this idea. Indian colleges are freaks for robotics and electronics. Everybody (who is not even in the electrical engineering branch) wants to be an electronics engineer. But there is a catch. They can learn everything from the Internet in theory. But in practice they can't. There is a language barrier. It is a culture, at least in my state, that there education till high school is done in Gujarati(our states language).<p>So the idea is to make the material provided with my kits localized. I would translate these materials in Gujarati and advertise this fact and to make the kits cheap.There is one startup doing the same thing in my own city robokits[1]. But there are two problems in there model in my view. 1) Their kits are really expensive 2) Their kits are focused only on robotics.Mine would be focused on getting them up and running on basic concepts of electronics.<p>It would be a totally online shop (mostly because I don't have money to rent an shop or time to maintain one as I am in first year college). The kits will have to be cheap as hell, nothing above 500Rs (10USD). I have friends in most of the engineering college in the city and other cities of the state, so those can help me with shipping. Payment can be in cash handed to me or my operative (read friends) or by demand draft.<p>The other aspect is marketing. I am planning to advertise 1)by word-of-mouth 2) byt spamming orkut and facebook groups 3) by setting up desks at techfests at different colleges.<p>All this I have planned till now (working on and off on the idea and site and cheap kits design for about a month).So I ask people of HN to rate my amateurish idea(specially anyone from india).",1271476054

20,1272568,comment,1271888.0,1271888.0,0,0,Auzy83,,,"We just made a selection of version control system at <a href=""http://getnightingale.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getnightingale.org</a>, and Git isn't that great either (it's over-hyped). CVS does suck (and SVN does too for our purposes). But Git requires that users either use cygwin or install half a linux environment in Windows.  Just because Git is coded by Linus, doesn't instantly make it a good product. In the case of Git, I REFUSE to force newbie windows developers who want to mess around with our project to be forced to install 2 linuxy environments, or have to integrate it into mozilla build (every other system is just a simple file you can add to path).<p>We settled with Mercurial, because hgweb isn't that memory intensive and our 512MB RAM prgmr VPS can handle it (although, we hope to upgrade the VPS, to allow more checkout's simultaneously). SVN/CVS also consume little ram on the server too though.<p>People who wish to make a selection should try them all out, and ask around. Because whilst Git users are very passionate about Git, I couldn't find a single one on IRC who had recently tried mercurial or Bazaar. Furthermore very few (if any) actively used Git in Windows<p>But that's just what I found. I didn't run proper benchmarks and things would be different if we had a better server (Loggerhead for bazaar wanted 2gb when running).",1271475518

Third-party apps add value to the iPhone, but they don't supersede the core OS applications. If apps became more like proper desktop applications and users came to value them more than the core OS, it would be easier for Apple's customers to follow ports of those apps to another platform.

It's a lot closer to starting a company yourself than working for Google. Salary is not the deciding factor, engineers considering such a decision are very specific in what they're looking for. From the company's point of view, first non-founding engineer is an employee that can make or break a company and set the engineering culture. It's a mistake to take someone who's only there because he had nowhere else to go: the sort of people you want for that position are confident that they could get hired elsewhere, even in a recession.<p>On the other hand, funded early-on start-ups (i.e., post series A, but pre-revenue/follow-on funding) can afford to pay market salaries, unless they're hiring ""warm bodies"" which is again a mistake.

What I don't see is how universities can use this same logic to justify using their sports teams to fund their academic operations.<p>This pattern sounds familiar, where else have I seen it, oh yeah: the rich should pay for the poor, because they are lucky enough to have more. (I actually believe this, and I'm just using parallel logic). A few student athletes will win the lottery moving into the pro's, so colleges ""tax"" athletes by not paying them, and substitute the incentive of ""you might be the next Lebron."" (Do s/Lebron/Google/ and doesn't it sounds eerily similar to VC startup logic?!) Then the rest of the student body benefits because the football team just paid the salary of the Poetry professor.<p>It might work this way, but I doubt it, although I'd love to see a study confirming how much money trickles back into colleges from their sports teams. We can just look at the larger macroscopic view for how efficient trickle down economics really is: of all the hundreds of billions given to the rich elites, how much of it trickles down to the poor?

Cake Forum, CodeIgniter Forum since we are using PHP framework). After receiving a bunch of applications/resumes, we filtered out to the ones we think are good, then we phoned them and had a chat. With the Internet, you could use video conferencing programs like samratjp suggested. In our case, we were lucky since I was on a trip to where the programmer was so we actually met up before hiring.<p>Anyhow, good luck with the hiring!",1271473453

I know exactly what a spinner is: it's named for a spinning number control (like a mechanical odometer with a knob), unless they're using ""spinner"" to describe something completely different from what a spinner is in desktop UI parlance.<p>My point is that the API decisions are probably based on experience with a different developer culture, in which those words make perfect sense and ""picker"" and ""chooser"" are completely vague.  Different groups have different terminology.",1271473386

There's a reason the govt. didn't let that happen, and it's not that they wanted to bail out their buddies.<p>I'm for criminal charges for those that committed fraud, investigations, more regulation, and so forth, but this ""We should have let them crash and burn, damn the consequences"" idea was not likely the best course of action, though it seems to be a pretty common attitude for some reason.",1271473355

It cannot impose interface changes that break old code and cannot force developers that develop for both platforms to use the newest interfaces that are not supported on the other side. They have to continuously bloat the platform in order to keep it a moving target.<p>Apple is playing an impossible hand.<p>Android doesn't need to defend ground to win. Making Apple lose ground suffices for them - Google thrives on fragmentation. Besides that, Android could be made as language-agnostic as Google wants it to be. I see no reason to prevent keeping the core logic in Obj-C and Android-specific elements in Java. The semantics are very similar.<p>I would love to see not only this, but also a Wine-like compatibility layer for OSX developers to deploy their apps on other environments. Some parts of it are production-ready in the form of GNUStep.",1271473282

Don't do anything the woman did in this article. Not even what she settled for at the end. She kept looking to quacks for quick-fixes where she didn't have to do any work when in reality all she needed was some physical therapy (which is hard work and a longer process and actually fixes your dysfunction).<p>If you don't want to get into this situation in the first place there are even preventative physical therapy programs like egoscue and specific types of yoga.
