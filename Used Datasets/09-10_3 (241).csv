That's what the guy who said to based their whole new system on Gopher said in 1992.<p>It's a stupid argument.  I mean really a STUPID argument to say ""don't use the best tools, use the tools that some random guy on HN says to use"".  If you can't trust your own judgment I'd quit software development right now.  You really just have no business writing code.  Because if you can't pick the best tools based on info, how can you pick the right architecture, or pattern, or prioritize which bugs to fix, or which scenarios to support, or which person to marry or when to have kids or when to buy a house.<p>I hate to be so blunt, but this reminds me of religious zealots who say, ""ignore your best evidence... just trust us"".

It has to do with the non-uniform -- or at least non-linearly uniform mapping of numbers, represented with a significand/mantissa and an exponent, onto the set of real numbers + the fact that the exponent used is in base 2, in the hardware, so the floating point numbers are spread about in a particular way. The difference between real numbers, as you tick up the odometer with each bit, varies depending on where you are in the number line (with big numbers, it's actually much more, with smaller numbers it's  pretty minimal, but not unnoticeable as seen with this example. Does that make sense? Maybe I'm off about this... Anyway, still obviously recommend the lectures. And now, I'm going to read up more on ALUs and MUXs..)",1288410875.0

For instance, I could argue:<p>1. A free market economy tends to surprisingly precisely match production to demand; producing extra costs you more than your competition is spending and tends to drive you out of business.<p>2. Food is subject to unpredictable random failures on a large scale.<p>3. It is better to have too much food than too little.<p>4. The economic effect of a subsidy is to cause overproduction. (As opposed to price fixing, which is to cause shortage. Rather a lot of verbiage is expended on the internet trying to explain away these two facts, yet the facts remain.)<p>Therefore, it may actually be desirable strategically for a country and even for the <i>species</i> to subsidize food production, in the hopes that the excess will offset the unpredictable disasters that a free market would tend to produce very little slack for. This will cost the society as a whole more than a ""precise match"" produced by the free market, but it only takes one bad harvest for this insurance to pay off bigtime. This could lead an economist to vote ""disagree"" on principle, even if they probably would agree the current subsidy is not an efficient way of accomplishing this goal. As others have pointed out, slamming this to a ""true/false"" question does erase many of the finer distinctions.<p>But other than those directly monetarily benefiting and those who don't understand the economics well enough to understand how bad these things are, you're not going to find much thoughtful support of these subsidies as they currently exist.",1288410068.0

When a major terrorist plot succeeds using a car, cell phone, or computer, a different group will suffer.<p>The question at hand is, ""What is acceptable in the name of defending ourselves against terrorism?""

Still, for anyone managing their own compute clusters and wanting to do MR in python, I'd suggest checking out Disco.<p>Disco (<a href=""http://discoproject.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discoproject.org</a>) is a really elegant MR framework implemented in erlang and python, with additional support for jobs in C and Java. I've used it for a little over a year and am convinced it is the superior MR platform (Hadoop's terasort victories notwithstanding).
