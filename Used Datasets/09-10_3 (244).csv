More like ""the consolidation of gadgets I don't actually use that often"".<p>The Swiss Army Knife analogy is telling: how much have sales of Swiss Army Knives affected sales of woodworking tools, kitchen cutlery, garden shears, fancy bottle-openers, etc?<p>I can certainly see smartphones supplanting special-purpose devices that have similar form-factors and UIs, such as hand-held GPSs.  But devices that have different physical forms or interfaces will still retain their popularity for serious uses.  For example, how many smartphones can be tripod-mounted?  Anyone who spends hours typing large amounts of text on a laptop every day is unlikely to want to replace it with a smartphone (unless the benefits of increased portability so outweigh the inconvenient interface).<p>Don't get me wrong, smartphones are great, and increased versatility is cool, and having lots of gadgets in my pocket all at once is wonderful (I've carried the same Swiss Army Knife in my pocket since 1979), but there are times when I want buttons I can press without looking (like a stopwatch), or a device I can glance at unobtrusively without having to pick anything up or pull anything out of a pocket (like a wristwatch), or a compass I feel comfortable carrying in my hand while running through the woods.",1281844066.0

Everything the researcher himself says is of course either completely noncommittal (“If you want to get more cited, the answer could be to cite more people”) or else a platitude (“Scientists are subject to social forces as much as anyone in any other profession” .... really now??!).<p>To discover a causal link here would require artificially and intentionally (but without telling anyone) adjusting the number of citations in some random set of papers to be published (probably by including or leaving out minor or tangential citations), and then seeing how one group compares to the other in the future.<p>My speculation about reasons (other than learned altruism) the amount of correlation between references and citations might have changed over time: (1) newer papers are in general treading in more developed fields, in which the top researchers must be familiar with a broader set of previous papers, (2) dissemination of papers is easier than it ever was before and so for example when reading a paper it is trivial to track down all of the papers it references and then cite those directly, (3) expectations about the proper number of citations in a paper have changed over time and modern journal reviewers especially in respected journals are stricter about suggesting that authors cite every previously known idea, (4) relatedly, academia has become increasingly bureaucratically output-driven and so individual researchers are writing more (presumably smaller-individual-impact) papers, (5) if number of citations is increasing over time, and in general most works are cited most often in the few years after their publication, the whole structure operates somewhat like a ponzi scheme, where each generation of papers provides more citations to the immediately previous one than that generation provided to the one before it.",1281843895.0

20,1604541,comment,1604445.0,1604474.0,0,0,Detrus,,,"Ah that does sound like a dud business wise. It would be nice to see more extensive stats for each site I use, like digg, forums, HN, etc.. but most sites and users could do without it. The user won't be paying for these stats, so the site owner needs to benefit a lot for the hassle. These stats are being collected one way or another but there is a lot of variation from one site to the next. Could it turn into a big hassle for some sites?<p>A site owner might put extensive stats to use to design a better community site. You could make some summary visualization of the user into their profile icon, so others know who they're dealing with. Sites like digg, quora, HN already have a lot of stats on individual users and it wouldn't be a big deal for them to create a visualization for a user. More recent companies like Etsy probably have some sales stats users can see. It's a small feature on many sites, most users don't need super detailed analytics.<p>Too many stats are confusing, many users who use 3rd party sites like ebay, etsy, don't want the hassle of what site owners go through, like looking at referrers. Some simplified online popularity graph might get adopted by site owners, but many users won't even understand that.<p>With that said, developing the idea itself further wouldn't hurt. I'm sure there are more market fits for analytics. An analytics social network where people compare their stats to their friends seems like a pre-requisite for this idea. Otherwise 'normal people' won't understand what the stats mean, there won't be a competitive or psychological incentive.",1281843594.0

Sure, Sencha Touch is trying to do something similar but I don't think it's really in any state at this point to have the effect you describe.<p>As for jQTouch, if it fits the requirements, I don't see people stalling projects for jQuery Mobile. If it doesn't, you're either hacking it to do what you want or rolling your own. Both will probably take considerable time.<p>As for me, since nothing else out there really does what I want, I decided to roll my own highly customized framework.

As for bouncing around looking for cheaper rent, you typically get locked in to a rental agreement for at least 6 months, if not a year.  You can't just move every month to save a few bucks.<p>B) Moving costs money (and time) in and of itself.<p>C) Selling costs.  At least in the US, most housing sales are going to eat up 5-6% of the house price in commissions.  On a $150k house sale, it's going to cost you $9k (plus, again, the time and expense of moving).<p>Unless moving is going to save you <i>significant</i> expenses vs renting, it's probably not that wise to blindly sell and move.  Assuming, that is, you even <i>could</i> sell to someone in this market.  It's not great in many areas for sellers right now.<p>If I could rent someplace $800-$1000 less than where I'm at now, I'd consider it, because the cost/expense would be recouped in probably a year, but I wouldn't go through all that hassle/cost/expense to save a couple hundred per month.<p>YMMV.",1281842494.0

Shipping is often free, as EMS and Hong Kong Post have normally very low rates. On DealExtreme and many eBay stores you can order a 99¢ item with free airmail from HK and get it a few days later.<p>On Alibaba, you have to talk with the seller for anything to happen. Though some of them work directly for a factory, many of the sellers are total freelance agents, and even the ones that work for a factory will act as agents to resell items from other factories. You can usually suss out how direct a seller's relationship with the ultimate supplier is, and they'll often tell you outright, though none of them seem to be willing to talk about each other. All of the ones I've interacted with have been ~30yo women that seem to be working solo as agents with other people doing the fulfillment.<p>The other thing is that they very rarely put up enough information to find out what the product actually is. Often the product can easily be made-to-order with finishing options up to you (though the factory does all the product development). You end up looking at a bunch of agents and looking at pictures, weights, and options to discern who's reselling what. Occasionally the OEMs will have product data on their websites and you can backtrack from there. It's kind of maddening but none of them really give a shit.<p>Even if you think you know what you're getting, you still want to get spec sheets from them for confirmation, and spreadsheet catalogs of similar stuff so you know you aren't missing anything (they don't keep their listings up to date). Even after that you still have to go back and forth on quantities, prices, shipping, lead times, options, potential setup fees for customizations, etc. They do like MSN and pasting stuff into excel documents to send via direct file transfer. It works ok once you get that far, but it feels really sketchy.",1281841997.0

Set a goal for how much money that is and save as rigorously as you can. During this time of earning money, you can at least do some customer development around your ideas. And my advice is that unless your consulting and your product are really tightly tied together, you are better off keeping them entirely separate from a legal perspective. If one or both start growing, keeping them together can get really messy. Obviously there are are exceptions to that.",1281841703.0
