There's only so much litigation you can do before you realize that the world has changed. The RIAA suing customers is like manufacturers of horse drawn carts suing early car manufacturers back in the early 1900s. The new economy just happens whether you like it or not. Music file sharing makes perfect sense in a world where the cost of making a copy of a digital file is zero. Arguing against that is like arguing against gravity. It is what it is. The labels were all aware of the changes going on way back, but they chose not to take advantage of change because they thought they were that powerful. They deserve their cruel fate.",1262750388.0

11,1034125,comment,1032382.0,1034083.0,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"It's a bit confusing. Essentially, ""the method above"" (using multiple OS threads running on the same Lua VM) extends Lua, <i>adding</i> a GIL along the way.<p>Lua <i>itself</i> does not use pre-emptive threads (the kind where you need to worry about locks, race conditions, ""thread safe"" libraries, etc.). It has co-routines, <i>co-operative</i> threads, in which independent light processes run and yield to each other. Only one is running in the interpreter at a time, so locking and race conditions are much less an issue. If something needs to happen atomically, you just don't yield and resume in the middle of it. (Coroutines are as versatile as one-shot continuations, incidentally - each can be implemented in terms of the other.)<p>BUT, since Lua is designed for use in other projects, it may be running as a scripting engine <i>inside of</i> (say) a multi-threaded C++ game. In this case, Lua can have multiple threads running in the VM at once. There are no-op functions (lua_lock and lua_unlock) defined in the code around operations which need to be atomic. Such a project could recompile Lua with them calling appropriate locking operations. You can run Lua multithreaded, if you want, but then you have to worry about thread safety. (I have to admit some ignorance here, though - I think running multiple independent VMs is much simpler than having to deal with debugging multi-threaded code.)<p>FWIW, the source for Lua 5.1.4 is ~626 KB. Adding a customized version of it to a project's source tree is nowhere near a big deal as including, say, all of Python (which is, what, 40+ MB?). In the Lua source, luaconf.h collects some items that are likely to be tweaked in project-specific ways.<p>Anyway, Lua does not have any threading implementation of its own because it would make it far more difficult to run inside of other projects. The Lua VM itself is pretty light (a few hundred KB), and since all VM state is specific to each instance, you can run several without running into the sort of problems that people have with Python's GIL.<p>There are several extensions for multitasking in Lua, beyond using coroutines. Here is a listing on the wiki (<a href=""http://lua-users.org/wiki/MultiTasking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lua-users.org/wiki/MultiTasking</a>) and a comparison by the author of Lanes (<a href=""http://kotisivu.dnainternet.net/askok/bin/lanes/comparison.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kotisivu.dnainternet.net/askok/bin/lanes/comparison.h...</a>).<p>This is one of the cases where keeping Lua small, portable, and easy to embed means that functionality people expect ends up in an extension rather than as part of the ""official"" standard library. I'm happy with it as a trade-off - it makes Lua as expressive as Python but keeps the core language as small and clean as SQLite.",1262750091.0

The iPhone didn't take its swathe of market share because it had better specs (God knows it didn't), it won by user experience, something no spec sheet will ever reveal.<p>IMHO this sort of comparison is pointless - it appears on the surface to be relevant, but in our experience we have seen that consumers will base buying decisions on far more subjective parameters. It's really out of touch with what the general buying public looks for when buying such a device.<p>Take the battery life data for example: hand a phone shopper two smartphones and let them play with it.

You make a decent point about the likelihood of erlang repl users and chrome os users not overlapping too much.

Pretty much everyone now knows how to use a web-browser. That's all I need to know to use runroot. I don't need to understand screen.
