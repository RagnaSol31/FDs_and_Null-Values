They're biased by their own experience as well, plus they're biased by the latest medical fads (don't think they don't exist), and they're biased by the ads they see in JAMA.  They're not selected for being clear thinkers - they're selected for being good at rote memorization and kissing authority ass, Gregory House notwithstanding.<p>Some doctors are fantastic.  A lot are <i>not</i> - and a non-fantastic doctor plus a well-educated patient is a sure recipe for disaster, take it from me.  Add an uncommon disease into the mix (and as our nephrologist says, there are categories of disease, like kidney disease, where every case is a new book) and the inescapable conclusion is that if you've got a chronic illness you are <i>on your own</i>.  If you're lucky you'll find doctors that can give you good advice.  But it's not likely to be the first guy down the road, either.<p>Your larger point, that Yahoo Answers is filled with garbage, is very accurate.  Most forums on <i>any</i> topic are filled with garbage, but health garbage has centuries of history and its promulgators are untiring.

I see value in structured, methodical, analytical thinking for many classes of business problems (not all, many crucial business decisions involve creative guesswork!), but an MBA is way overkill, and whatever it is supposed to teach can be learned on the job. If a person cannot learn that on those skills on the job, I seriously would question his/her ability to be an effective manager.<p>Here is my real world evidence: German and Japanese large companies are as good or as bad as American ones (depending on your point of view). The MBA is relatively rare in Germany and Japan. Japanese large companies, in particular, tend to recruit fresh undergrads without much attention paid to their major, train them internally, and promote from within. The fact that their companies hold their own in global competition, indicates that the MBA doesn't add any superior competitiveness to American companies. In fact, I would argue the MBA actually subtracts from American competitiveness, but that argument would be more subtle, and would require industry-by-industry analysis of competitiveness. I will note in passing that software and internet industry is probably where the MBA influence is the weakest in America (primarily because of the extraordinary rate of start-up creation), and that sector is the one where America is the most globally competitive.",1275620812.0
