The reason they had to go to court is because no one would give them a license for free publication so they played the 'orphan' card and got the other party to the table for a settlement.<p>Please don't argue the naive copyright shouldn't exist because my-head-is-stuck-so-far-in-the-sand-I-hit-rock-and-forgot-common-sense angle. With hollywood virtually cloning every successful movie that has ever existed, do we really want to give them a free pass to actually clone every successful movie that has ever existed? As for every successful book/movie/TV franchise to ever exist, well they'd be gone out the window with masses of meaningless fan-wank shot out by every publisher known to man trying to make a dollar. Copyright has an important clause in it of preventing derivative works by unauthorised people, this means that Harry Potter remains being written by Rowling and actually ends in a way fans are likely to actually enjoy rather than see a Harry Potter: Failed To Graduate Again - New Mystery Edition!<p>By removing copyright you negatively effect the common person more than you positively affect them. For all I know you could be a fantastic photographer, I myself have worked as a reviewer and have sold my work, you as a photographer have all the rights to sell your photographs no matter where you've posted them. Do you really want to give any company permission to take your photographs from your Flickr account and use them in a national campaign without your permission? Or would you prefer to get the $20,000 check that those license purchases usually come with?<p>The RIAA and MPAA are the problem, not copyright. The better way to resolve this problem is to reform copyright to limit actions taken on the copyright holders behalf without the copyright holders permission. Legally speaking the copyright holder has to be the person to file the claim, however due to the licensing agreements musicians sign with their label they're actually giving license authority to the MPAA too, which they actually don't agree too.",1270267135

When iPhone SDK came out I was not only considering, I did want to do it. Even more so with iPad.</i><p>This tells us that it is a really good platform, and that you enjoy it. It doesn't tell us anything about openness. I agree that iPhone and iPad are awesome devices. Apple makes beautiful computers that mostly work very well. I'm not arguing in any way about the quality, or enjoyability, of Apple products.<p>At risk of once again distracting from the important point I'm trying to make (which seems to be really easy for folks to do; since nearly every criticism of my comments takes off in a different direction, unrelated to the very real problems with Apples decision to be a gatekeeper for their devices), I will note that developing for iPhone is a little bit old-fashioned. Objective C is a good language for its age, and I happen to like C...but compared to more modern languages (even modern Java found on Android devices), there's a bit more fiddly bits than I like. The end results can be wonderful, but technically, there's some definite trade offs in using a language like Objective C, even with a really well thought out API.<p><i>Remember, what phone had useable web browser before iPhone? Right… What's the most popular engine for mobile devices? Correct, WebKit.</i><p>Which was an Open Source library that had been in development for <i>years</i> before Apple got involved and forked it and renamed it WebKit. Yes, Apple did wonderful things with WebKit, but you're just parroting the company line if you believe that the ability to make web apps that work on iPhone is the same as an open device.<p><i>Like including free X-Code with every single copy of OS X.</i><p>Except those copies of OS X that come on the iPhone and iPad.<p><i>People, I understand that some of you may not like Apple for one reason or other, but please, stop talking nonsense.</i><p>My ""one reason or other"" is not mysterious. I have not minced words about my problems with Apple. I don't believe you've actually answered the point of my complaints, you've merely parroted the company line. If you agree with Apple, and love their products so much that you're willing to live with those limitations, that's fine.<p>My only point is that you shouldn't call out a bunch of other stuff Apple does, that may be positive or neutral, as evidence that the closed nature of the iPhone/iPad ecosystem is bad for tinkerers and hackers and kids that might become hackers. And, you really shouldn't make this into a false dichotomy, as Gruber tries to do; you <i>can</i> have an awesome device that is also open. Apple has merely opted not to do so.<p>The good news is that the latest round of Android devices are as good as the iPhone, and the sales rate of Android phones indicates that iPhone will lose the war in a couple of years, or less, assuming things continue as they have been. It's almost...poetic. I believe openness tends to win, in the end, because its benefits are just too great to ignore. Thus, I'll humbly make a prediction: Apple has shot themselves in the foot, once again, by being a closed platform. If they don't open up, they will gradually lose ground to Android.<p>Call it nonsense all you want, but I think cultural decisions of important companies can shape the world...and I believe Apple has been making cultural decisions that are a net negative with regard to the iPhone and iPad.",1270265275

You don't even have to download it: it is there on the DVD.<p>Microsoft, since at least Windows XP (and perhaps before, I'm too lazy to look), hasn't shipped a programming language with their operating system. Apple ships what, 6 or 7? Python, Ruby, Perl, C, AppleScript, and probably a few others. Those don't require the $99 developer license at all. Apple is the only hacker-friendly PC and OS manufacturer remaining.",1270264478

You can also include a lot more greens than you'd ever eat in one salad, and thanks to the blender, not spend time chewing, nor get sated with the (sometimes bitter) taste of greens.

Otherwise it will tastes like spinach, and that's not the goal here.<p>After trying to report my discovery to the world, it seems I'm the only person who thinks spinach smoothies are a good idea.

54,1238089,comment,1237939.0,1237939.0,0,0,mprovost,,,The ultimate food hack is the pressure cooker. You can cook things much quicker than usual by changing the rules (ie raising the boiling point of water). They're really good for making basics like rice and quinoa very quickly and you can turn something like boiling potatoes from a 20 minute exercise into about 7 minutes.<p>Another good one is using an electric kettle/jug to boil water. It's the fastest way (obviously immersing the heating element directly in the water is going to be more efficient than going through a pan). Lots of people use them for tea etc but I use mine to boil water for pasta.,1270264063
