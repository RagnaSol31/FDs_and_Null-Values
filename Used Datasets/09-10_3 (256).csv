Namely:<p>- create barriers to entry (the best way to do this on elance et al is to serve your good customers well, they'll become attached).<p>- differentiate (prove you're better and worth extra money).<p>- focus on a niche (prove you're the best choice for a specific kind of product or service).",1226458796.0

Containing and isolating the error, as soon as possible, then passing information about the error higher up like an exception might propagate, until a level high enough to know the goal of the operation and what to do in case of errors, then passing a response back down, and being able to continue in a useful manner or tidy up gracefully.<p>A great big codesplosion spraying you with a several hundred lines of stack trace and a ""Your program has encountered an error an needs to close"" is not ""sensible behaviour"".",1226458528.0

I could even have reddit-like comments discussing the merits of replying to a message.<p>When @TechCrunch looks at the message, he can click on the link to see how well it ranks in his inbox. He can also see who voted up/down.<p>At this point, @TechCrunch may be convinced to reply to the message or some other one ranked higher in his inbox.<p>If @TechCrunch agrees a lot with your votes about what is worth replying to, he may start following you on twitter.
