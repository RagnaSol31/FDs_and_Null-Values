Furthermore, if you've divided it well, you can more easily reuse logic. Having a single monolithic function is like having a single monolithic program: usually a bad idea.<p>Granted, I don't like spreading related logic over several files, but that is Java's fault.",1269745195.0

They'd come in, kill the local armies and resistance, then they'd start building roads, hospitals, and schools and generally managing their territories fairly well.<p>If they are coming for good, why do they kill the resistance and the local armies? If you are going to offer free services that benefit us, why do you need armed soldiers? You Don't! If you want to make use of our resources for our benefit, so that won't really be a matter for 99% of the population, they'll be happy.\nPoint two: Resistance didn't exist before colonialism, it appeared after and it was a result of colonialism.<p>Question: British contributed in the Iraq War.

I'll just say that the British were probably better than the other colonizing powers.

It's just waiting for a solution that brings it all together. I'm highly looking forward to the upcoming opscode-managed Chef server.
