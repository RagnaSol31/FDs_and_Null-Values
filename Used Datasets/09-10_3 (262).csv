Yes, there is no limit to wealth creation, but even so, it is easy to upper-bound wealth creation over, say, the next 5 years. We can say with confidence there won't be more than, say, $10 billion worth of web start-up acquisitions over the next 5 years (in total, not per year) - that was about the total in the last 5 I would estimate and I think I am being fairly optimistic here. Even that $10 billion would be parceled out in the 80-20 rule - a couple of YouTube home runs, a few singles and doubles, and the remaining mass of start-ups have to fight over a fairly small pot of gold.<p>My objection is consistent with economic theory: over-supply leads to serious price crashes, even when you make the favorable assumption (which is not exactly true in the start-up case) that in the long run, the over-supply can be absorbed.",1228445148

Two leading economists, Thomas Sargent and Fran√ßois Velde, examine the evolution of Western European economies through the lens of one of the classic problems of monetary history--the recurring scarcity and depreciation of small change. Through penetrating and clearly worded analysis, they tell the story of how monetary technologies, doctrines, and practices evolved from 1300 to 1850; of how the ""standard formula"" was devised to address an age-old dilemma without causing inflation.</i><p><i>One big problem had long plagued commodity money (that is, money literally worth its weight in gold): governments were hard-pressed to provide a steady supply of small change because of its high costs of production. The ensuing shortages hampered trade and, paradoxically, resulted in inflation and depreciation of small change. After centuries of technological progress that limited counterfeiting, in the nineteenth century governments replaced the small change in use until then with fiat money (money not literally equal to the value claimed for it)--ensuring a secure flow of small change. But this was not all. By solving this problem, suggest Sargent and Velde, modern European states laid the intellectual and practical basis for the diverse forms of money that make the world go round today.</i><p>Alas, I couldn't follow their math. (Maybe I should try again, taking more time.) But their historical examples were quite extensive.",1228444308

25,386510,comment,386493.0,386493.0,0,0,numair,,,"Completely, totally agree.  I was just discussing this today with my business partner; I think that many people won't even know what to do with extra money if it is given to them.  That's never happened before - there's always been the ""well, we could use more servers"" or ""well, we could always hire more engineers"" argument.  Today, I think a lot of people are beginning to realize that 1) if you engineer your applications properly, and on the right platforms, you can scale your server demands along with your userbase/revenues; 2) more engineering/other assorted human capital won't necessary translate into better, more usable product.<p>I personally believe this is the beginning of a massive shift, and one that isn't even tied to the economy - but, of course, will be dramatically accelerated as a result of it.  On the point of what happens to the startup community, however - I think it will be a lot harder to start a me-too company and get any traction; as a result, even with the lower cost of business, there will be fewer people able to enjoy the benefits.  It's sort of like the rest of the economy - if you are the absolute best at what you do, it's a great time to be in business; for everyone else, the situation is precarious.  Running on $3000 a month is great, but not if that means you're losing $3000 a month with no foreseeable way of recouping your investment.<p>Perhaps that's where the VCs will step in - sweep those flailing enterprises under their wings, pump greater capital/human resources into them, and try to brute-force them into successful enterprises.  In effect, they would become the startup version of their private-equity peers; not a bad place to be, but again - the best will survive, the rest will die.",1228443710
