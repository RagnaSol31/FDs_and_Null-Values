0,374390,story,,,42,61,cconstantine,Ask HN: Which revision control system?,,"For the past few years we've been using Perforce at the company I work for.  For a number of reasons, we've been given the OK from management to switch to a free SCM system.  This is supposed to be a big opportunity to improve our process and save us money, but we're having problems finding a good replacement.<p>Our must-have features include; ability to import our perforce history, easy/trivial branching and merging (preferably the ability to use an external merge tool), large file support, ability to pass changes from one workstation to another without affecting everyone, and ability to work with multiple gigs of binary files (most are roughly 500k, some are 100+megs).  The binary files are mostly build artifacts, but for a large number of very good reasons we can't expect developers to generate them.  Each developer having their own branch would be nice, but isn't critical.<p>Our products only run and compile on Windows, so decent windows support would be nice.  We aren't exactly an MS house; our product works with the artifacts of programs that only run on Windows so it runs on Windows.  Our products are very-much closed source, so things like Github are of no use to us.<p>Distributed systems like Git are compelling for the workstation to workstation support.  Unfortunately Git chokes on our binary files (I get an out of memory error), and I'm afraid that the other DSCM projects will stagnate in favor of Git.  Centralized systems like Subversions are in line with the way we've always done business, but they lack the ability to view/review/pull changes on another workstation and branching/merging isn't as easy.<p>I'm a big fan of Git, but if it can't work with large file it won't work for us.  Subversion seems like a step backwards, but I could be wrong.  Whatever we choose, we'll be with it for a long time and use it every day.<p>So, HN; what revision control system would you suggest?",1227495589.0

Or a good sense of what makes for a good layout in the first place, frankly.<p>The genius of LaTeX is you can crib someone else's style, and your output will look like it was created by a typesetting genius.  Personally, I don't think I could ever fiddle around with Word long enough to get output that looks as good.<p>Another big win with LaTeX is it lets you use an editor that's not awful.  Editing your actual text in Word is pretty painful if you're used to Emacs (or other program actually designed for editing text productively).",1227495353.0

7,374383,comment,373762.0,374182.0,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"The claims made aren't all that falsifiable (like anything else in psychology, it isn't ever possible to know to what extent a person is lying to themselves), and the specificity of the claims is something of a red herring; when 90% of a list of specific claims appear to describe a subject to at least some extent, if they want to believe that the system works, they're going to ignore the other 10%.  The medium-sized fraction of the audience who fit at least that closely into the categorization system trumpet it around as a success, making those who fit somewhat less well more inclined to accept the errors and inaccuracies of their classification.  These effects, plus the handful of results related in a very obvious way to the original categorization (emotional coping resources are often defined in such a way that the INTP/ENTP result you mention is entirely obvious, for example), make it appear that the MBTI means much more than it actually does.<p>Much like an IQ test, used professionally, as part of a deeper analysis of a subject, the MBTI can help a psychologist or psychiatrist better understand a subject/patient.  Used recreationally, such things lead to faulty generalizations unless treated as they are--glorified horoscopes geared toward looking at particular aspects of ourselves.",1227494735.0
