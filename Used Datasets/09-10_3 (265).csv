Even though new financial regulation will likely be introduced to prevent a crisis like this from happening again, over time institutions will develop ever more complex instruments and trading rooms to find a way around them - as they have done so historically - and make turkeys out of all of us, once again.

The mean IQ was 100. In order to adjust for the 11-year interval between the two standardizations, this needs to be reduced to 98. In relation to a British IQ of 100, this needs to be reduced by one further point to 97.<p>Around 1989, data for the Standard Progressive Matrices for 1,740 9- to 15-year-olds were collected by Kaniel and Fisherman (1991). In relation to the British 1979 standardization sample, their IQ was 92. To adjust for the 10-year interval between the two years of data collection, this needs to be reduced to 90. The average of the results gives an IQ of 94 for Israel.</i><p><pre><code>  .\n</code></pre>\nDaniFong wrote:<p><i>although for some reason the authors of the Bell Curve were very willing to color in those lines.</i><p>There is no mention of Israel in The Bell Curve (other than a single instance indirectly in a summation of a competing theory from John Ogbu who notes that, in Israel, Sephardic jews have lower attainment than Ashkenazic jews). What do you mean by ""color in those lines""?<p>Here is Rushton summarizing Lynn's 2006 explanation of the Israel anomaly:<p><a href=""http://www.vdare.com/rushton/060322_iq.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vdare.com/rushton/060322_iq.htm</a><p><i>Another anomaly: the average IQ of Israel is only about 95—substantially higher than the median IQ of 85 found elsewhere in the region, but much lower than the average IQ of Jews outside of Israel, estimated at between 108 and 115.<p>Lynn breaks the Israeli IQ into three components: 40 percent Ashkenazim (European Jewish) with a mean IQ of 103; 40 percent Sephardim (Oriental Jewish) with a mean IQ of 91; and 20 percent Arab with a mean IQ of 86, which is virtually the same as that of Arabs elsewhere. Lynn suggests these differences could have arisen from selective migration (more intelligent Jews emigrated to Britain and the USA), intermarriage with different IQ populations (those in Europe versus those in North Africa), selective survival through persecution (European Jews were the most persecuted), and the inclusion of ethnic non-Jews among the Ashkenazim in Israel as a result of the immigration of people from the former Soviet Bloc countries who posed as Jews.</i>",1221617690
