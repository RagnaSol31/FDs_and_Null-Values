I am an American working as an overseas developer to people in Europe and it works great.  They are not outsourcing things to me though because I am a part of their team.  We all work together.<p>If you are talking about outsourcing to save money then this likely will not live up to your expectations.  Outsourcing can be to save money or it can be to farm out work to people who have skills you cannot find elsewhere.  A good pro will charge what he/she is worth (probably not much different than what an American/European counterpart will charge) and will likely give you a better experience because an experienced pro is more likely to smell disaster before it strikes.<p>A ""warm body"" who is filling a chair for you at much cheaper rates than you can get anywhere else will be a mixed bag.  Outsourcing is not fire and forget.  If you simply shove your work to someone and expect great results then you will likely be wasting your time and money.  Outsourced help needs to be managed just as well as the rest of the team.  Certain things (data entry) might work well, but dev projects not so much.<p>Or you might get lucky.  Again, mixed bag.  YMMV.",1213670855

Windows ships with a lousy shell and not many decent commands to build with.  If most developers follow that example and don't try to learn anything else, they'll be ""comfortable"" even in inefficient programming environments.<p>The Mac's an anomaly...the current OS has great command support, and while the older Mac OS didn't, its <i>developers</i> had access to the excellent MPW Shell.  MPW Shell had features that Unix-like systems still can't match, such as the ability to assign significance to many more characters.  (When the system makes it easy to enter ""weird"" symbols, the idea of turning them into shell metacharacters is pretty cool!)<p>A good book on the way developers think (on Unix-like systems), is ESR's ""The Art of UNIX Programming"".  It has great examples of how many of us would approach system and application design, that don't seem prevalent on other systems.",1213670634

Setting a term, a reasonable interest rate, and specifying that you will get a single balloon payment at the end of the term is an easy way to go. Put this into the minutes of a board meeting and get a signed document from all board members (if only yourself).  You should only put money in that you need for operations, any early salary to yourself is better paid directly out of savings (value is recognized in the ""sweat equity"" you have from the startup and avoids taxes on roundtrip into and out of the Sub-S as wages/dividends).

Resume's have a lot of info on them, and are often short on details.  You should explain to them what you've done that makes you ideal for that specific role.  Don't talk about your life dreams, just keep it simple and direct.<p>On what to wear: Dress smart.  If it seems like a fun place, dress a bit fun.  In NYC, a nice pair of jeans, with a sharp shirt and jacket would probably be a really appropriate attire.

25,219331,story,,,1,1,aspenbordr,Ask HN: Hiring an overseas freelance programmer?,,"Two cofounders and I are about 2/3 of the way through a version 1.0 of a web application. All three of us have full time jobs, so we have been coding the site in our spare time.<p>Right now, the site is entirely in Flash 9 because our main programmer was most familiar with it (compared to Ajax) and we were looking to get a working demo up as quickly as possible. Flash allowed us to build in a lot of features pretty easily, but obviously has drawbacks.<p>At this stage, we are looking to port the site to a wider audience by rebuilding it in AJAX-ified HTML. The lead programmer does not know his way around Ajax and javascript nearly s well as Flash.<p>The question is: in your experience, would it be better to hire someone overseas to recreate the site from the Flash template, or would it save hassle to just have our main programmer figure out  the necessary code himself? At this point, we would prefer to have someone else do the porting, since we all have limited time and there is more important coding to do. However, we do have some experience with outsourcing portions of the code, and know that it sometimes just leads to more headaches since the quality of the programmer and the reusability of the code can be suspect.<p>What are your experiences?",1213669686

For example, in graphics programming you typically need to sort transparent objects back-to-front. If things are out of order, there may be anywhere from no to huge artifacts. If things are mostly sorted and your objects are reasonably small, you can expect closer to no artifacts. You could run a few passes of bubble sort each frame, save the effort of doing a full sort, and then even if you get major artifacts they won't last more than a 1/30th of a second or so.",1213668132

So our process words stink. So it's much easier for us when we think of an object–I have apologized profusely over the last 20 years for making up the term ""object-oriented"", because as soon as it started to be misapplied, I realized that I should've used a much more process-oriented term for it. Now, the Japanese have an interesting word, which is called ""ma"", which spelled in English is M-A, ""ma"". And ""ma"" is the stuff in between what we call objects. It's the stuff we don't see, because we're focused on the noun-ness of things, rather than the process-ness of things, whereas Japanese has a more process/feel-oriented way of looking at how things relate to each other. You can always tell that by looking at the size of a word it takes to express something that is important. So ""ma"" is very short. We have to use words like ""interstitial"", or worse, to approximate what the Japanese are talking about.""",1213668037
