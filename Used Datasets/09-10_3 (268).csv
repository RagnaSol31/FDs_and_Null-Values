If you need to think hard to find even a sector to found a startup in, you're probably doing it wrong.  Not that you can't be successful, and I wish the best of luck to anyone, but it seems like the giants we all know come from founders who started coding to solve some problem, and let the company grow from there on its own, instead of the other way around.",1232247512

Both those articles started off assuming that PHP 'won' something, and then tried to explain why by pointing out good things about PHP and its community. Neither of them started by laying down the contest rules, examining all the contenders, and picking a winner... They started with a winner and worked backwards somehow into the aether.<p>On the other hand, if you just realize headlines are <i>by definition</i> linkbait, you can make the mental substitution of the phrase ""became more popular than any other toy language"" for the word ""won"".

The biggest barrier I have found to starting a company ( or perhaps its another form of procrastination) is finding a field or industry that is sufficiently interesting to me, comparative to alternatives. I am curious as to how you (as an employee or entrepreneur etc) sat down and decided that from today on I am a online retailer, a web consultant, a MD of a Logistics company etc. Did you just choose the field with the most interest to you, did you solve a problem that is personal to yourself, did you follow a methodology of finding a problem like Steve blank suggests?? cheers, cameron",1232247168

However, one must consider that many NFL players never even graduated from the colleges for which they played and have limited non-sports earning opportunities.  One ex-Browns player in Cleveland is now a Realtor (sadly, a proper noun?) -- he's able to use his celebrity status to woo clients. Most aren't so lucky.  Is it that being a Rhodes scholar results in high lifetime earnings, or is it that the skills/aptitude/drive required to earn this scholarship are the cause?",1232246323
