Cellular protocols are not secure at all so any attack you can think of is plausible (intercept, tracking, man in the middle, etc).

Well, no shit.  But let me trot out my own scarecrow:<p>Every time you add a program your repertoire you're replacing productive time with administrative time.  Of course a great program is worth the extra time you spend alt-tabbing to it, filling it with data, and then exporting and munging it to work with the other 100 programs you have.<p>You know what?  After 20 years of being a hard-core computer geek, I've ultimately found that huge percentage of electronic tools end up being less useful than simple pen and paper.  A personal wiki bridges that gap and allow me to keep todo lists, code snippets, quotes, ideas, and whatever else I need to be easily accessible in a single easy-to-browse window.  I can put any one-off content in there I want, and re-organize and hyperlink at will.  Alex's suggestion that a directory structure and a bunch of text files is more useful is laughable at best.
