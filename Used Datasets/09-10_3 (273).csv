""<p>As to opposed to what? There are many opportunities for interaction and working in society. How to interact with older people, work a job, honor contracts, and be well mannered to people and stuff like that?<p>How can you learn that in a school filled with kids your age and the only adult is a teacher?<p>Don't get me about democracy. Most of society isn't a democracy. We don't usually vote unless it is about asking government to do an half-assery job of something. There is certainly no voting in honoring contract, or choosing who to marry, sell, buy, what club to join, or who to associate with.<p>We aren't governed by some crazy democracy that decide what to do for each facet of our lives. No, we live by trust, respect, and compromise. We choose to co-exist with each other, voluntarly.",1243392908.0

I'd love to see the entire python standard library moved into a root-level ""python"" namespace; I'm guessing that would be about as popular as curly braces with the general python crowd...<p>Heck, even the ability to root your imports, like import .email would bring in the root-level email library, would be pretty nice.

I think we could meet the 10% bar. A lot of the klunkiness of that is the transcription, I think; modern extemporaneous speech is transcribed differently.<p>""So far, I have been considering the understanding of the question manifested by the framers of the original Constitution. In and by the original instrument, a mode was provided for amending it. As I have already stated, the present frame of ""the Government under which we live"" consists of that original, and twelve amendatory articles framed and adopted since. Those who now insist that federal control of slavery in federal territories violates the Constitution point us to the provisions which they suppose it thus violates. As I understand, all fix upon provisions in these amendatory articles, and not in the original instrument. The Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott case, plant themselves upon the fifth amendment, which provides that no person shall be deprived of ""life, liberty or property without due process of law"", while Senator Douglas and his peculiar adherents plant themselves upon the tenth amendment, providing that ""the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution"" ""are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.""""<p>Transcribe the same speech with modern sensibilities, dropping intermediate ""ands"" and other such information-free interjections when appropriate and lay off the semicolon and it cleans up fairly well. Even the ""hard words"" and phrases I think are more common speech of the time, and only sound erudite because we inherently think of old-timey things as sounding educated since only educated people bother to learn them. My great-grandchildren will probably think ""old-timey"" sounds fancy.",1243392679.0

One site plants the seed of the idea, then another waters it a little, and another some more, until finally the user feels a gush of appreciation and/or need for one of the tiny upgrades. Then every site gets a proportional cut, from that point on.<p>Even if none of them alone can make the $6/month sale, in toto they can. And they earn microslices of the subscription fee even for first-time visitors who already signed on elsewhere.<p>In fact, unless your site is already charging some sort of subscription fee, <i>there's no reason not to sign up</i>. Just by adding the tracking code, you start receiving a tiny slice of any Contenture visitors' payments. You don't have to convert users yourself or run banners or lock content up (as far as I can tell; I haven't parsed all their fine print).<p>Sure, there's a risk of gaming and free-riding in this regard -- but that helps bootstrap the publisher network, and they can tighten things based on user feedback over time.

There are likely many thousands of people in this country today, and there likely were back in Taft's day and Lincoln's, who, had the cards fallen differently, would have been excellent or competent presidents. Every time has it's own peculiarities, and Taft and Lincoln were men of their time, as John F. Kennedy was a man of his time (TV), and Obama is a man of today (grassroots online organizing).
