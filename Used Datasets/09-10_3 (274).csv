Many of these drugs are overwhelmingly beneficial -- e.g. Human Growth Hormone.  Prohibiting it makes about as much sense as prohibiting surgery; it's used to promote healing of injuries.  If they cared about <i>damage to players</i>, its use would be encouraged.  Reducing recovery time means they are playing and making money for the sport rather than laid up for months and just cashing checks.  I would argue you have a moral duty to yourself to use any and all means to get better, and anyone who argues you should remain injured longer has no moral basis to stand on.<p>Baseball's rules are simply about image in this ""drug war"" climate.  It's extremely hypocritical; Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds likely made a fortune for the league with all the excitement about breaking home run records.<p>It's also uncomfortably Übermensch-ish.  If you disallow this type of enhancement, you're leaving it up to whoever was born with favorable genetics.  It's not even about who trains the hardest -- someone with better genetics can do less work and get better results than someone else who works his tail off.<p>Additionally, there is a wide range of performance-enhancing substances, some of which are well-studied and can be safely taken under medical supervision.  However, the well-known ones are typically the ones they test for and prohibit, which drives the practice underground and spurs development of experimental new substances of dubious safety.<p>And realistically, in order to compete in many sports today, you need both the genetics <i>and</i> the pharmaceutical enhancement.  Thus the biggest threat to athletes' physical health is the prohibition of well-understood substances and the legal pressure on doctors which makes it difficult for an athlete to get the proper medical supervision.  The system simply does not reward people who either lack superior genetics or the willingness to use these substances.",1208141895

The signal to noise ratio is so low already without hundreds of thousands of automatically generated books flooding the market.<p>If you find a book that's in a niche you're researching you'll probably snap it up even if it is unreviewed, which means that for each book multiple people are probably going to be duped. Basically, there's nothing intrinsically immoral about writing a bad book, but I think there is something immoral about generating hundreds of thousands of books that you know probably aren't going to add much value in the hope that people are tricked into buying them.<p>>>>\n""While nothing announces that Mr. Parker’s books are computer generated, one reader, David Pascoe, seemed close to figuring it out himself, based on his comments to Amazon in 2004. Reviewing a guide to rosacea, a skin disorder, Mr. Pascoe, who is from Perth, Australia, complained: “The book is more of a template for ‘generic health researching’ than anything specific to rosacea. The information is of such a generic level that a sourcebook on the next medical topic is just a search and replace away.”<p>When told via e-mail that his suspicion was correct, Mr. Pascoe wrote back, “I guess it makes sense now as to why the book was so awful and frustrating.”Mr. Parker was willing to concede much of what Mr. Pascoe argued. “If you are good at the Internet, this book is useless,” he said, adding that Mr. Pascoe simply should not have bought it. But, Mr. Parker said, there are people who aren’t Internet savvy who have found these guides useful.""\n<<<<<p>Now, computers generating customised content for individuals may well be the future of knowledge transfer.
