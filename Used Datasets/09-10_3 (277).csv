However, the act of arguing this point, if seriously engaged in by enough people, would, in fact, make the question (and the answer) notable, and thus the answer to the question would deserve inclusion in Wikipedia.<p>Inductively, you can use this argument to show every subject is notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia.

I'm not sure kids are primed to learn strict definitions of things but maybe we could find a way... it would be difficult though because their parents generally won't know abstract algebra.  Counting is easier to teach because it comes up at home and at school, but the kids would be learning different things at different places.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, lots of kids learn English at school and a different language at home.<p>Edit: The kids difficulty with strict definitions could be a good thing.  Having a feel for whats going on without being restricted to the definitions could lead to new discoveries.<p>Should we do this?<p>I'm not sure this is a good thing though.  I love abstract algebra and think its great fun and is, as far as I know, very useful in parts of science (I believe material science uses group theory).
