If you ask ""Is the candidate outstanding?  What specifically makes you think so?"", you will hear ""I can confirm that $CANDIDATE worked from $START_DATE to $END_DATE and his final position was $TITLE.""<p>That said, like many brilliant engineering ideas for evading legal requirements by simple logical tricks that a profession filled with people who are paid $300 an hour to think of loopholes <i>totally can't see coming</i>, I strongly doubt this idea will work.  You're not selecting for outstanding candidates, you're selecting for managers who are not risk-adverse.<p>A risk-adverse manager will ignore your little logic trap, call you, and say ""I am returning your phone call with regards to $CANDIDATE.  I can confirm that $CANDIDATE worked from $START_DATE to $END_DATE and his final position was $TITLE.  Have a nice day.""  He will then document that he was asked for a reference for $CANDIDATE and followed company procedure to the letter.  You have learned no useful information from this, aside from ""Ahh, $PREVIOUS_COMPANY has a corporate policy to not provide useful references""",1245639538

If a doctor wants to spend time with their patients having electronic medical records shouldn't stop them from doing so. I don't think I even agree with the premise that people want their doctors to be their buddies holding their hands. I think most sick people want to be cured. The days of having one family doctor are gone. You'll get bounced around to various specialists if you have any serious problems anyway. As we've seen in other areas technology has an incredible ability to get results if used correctly. I have faith most medical professionals are smart enough to use a computer or electronic testing equipment.<p>Either way the status quo is unsustainable. If something isn't done about it now we'll have a medical crisis in a few years/decades that is every bit as bad as the credit crisis was.

37,668102,comment,667504.0,667891.0,0,0,s3graham,,,"Tabs have always seemed like a horrible misfeature to me. The OS already provides a taskbar, so now you've created N*M places to look. Not only that but you can't see all the tabs at the same time once there's multiple windows, so you have to pick a window, check all of its tabs, move to the next and repeat. The ""it's like MDI/documents/text editors"" argument is bogus because the window that contains gmail has nothing to do with the window that contains HN, or reader.google, or whatever. It's like all the programs written in C++ get their own taskbar, separate from the ones written in VB, separate from the ones written in JS. Except we only separate the JS ones for some reason.<p>For Chrome specifically:<p>1) it lacks the option ""New pages should open in [X] a new window [ ] a new tab"" compared to Firefox, which makes tabs ignorable.<p>2) On Windows, I'd much rather they follow the OS conventions for MDI rather than make up their own ""cool""/""clever"" one (see media/audio players, for some random reason).
