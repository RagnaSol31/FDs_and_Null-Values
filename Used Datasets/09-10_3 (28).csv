His reasoning was that the easier it is to learn, the better for the general population.<p>I can't say what Vietnam looked like before the change, but certainly today there's writing blazed over everything in the cities - and there's very little in the way of images or pictographs to indicate what a shop might sell to an illiterate (I may have been unaware of other indicators). They do make prodigious use of diacritics to adapt Roman script to Vietnamese, though.<p>It was while puzzling over these diacritics that I finally realised that English uses (needs?) these as well, we just don't write them down - wind (moving air) and wind (make a coil) are pronounced differently, but without diacritics, someone has to tell you how to do so.",1314006706.0

This means that instead of spending on infrastructure, you will spend on sales.<p>I mean, depending on how good you are at sales, you might still come out ahead, or you might not.   All I'm saying is that the top end of every market I've seen is just as competitive as the bottom end, and you are constantly defending yourself from newcomers.<p>Now, in my experience, this manifests itself on the top end as being very difficult to break in to the market.   PG has some quote about how you might be able to out-engineer Oracle, but you will never be able to out-sales Oracle.     Of course, if you do break in to the top end, it's usually a plum place to be;  even after paying exorbitant sales commissions, you are usually sitting on a large margin.   But damn, it's hard to break in.<p>On the bottom end of the market?  My experience has been that it's much easier to break in.  I mean, yeah, margins are much lower, but marketing and sales become almost trivialities if you are dramatically cheaper than the other guys.<p>A traditional strategy, especially in the infrastructure world, is to break in to the market on the low end;  build credibility and a customer base, and slowly float in to higher-end markets.   This is especially easy with infrastructure because your costs are always falling.   Simply double the capacity you provide per dollar less often than once every two and a half years, and you are raising your prices.<p>Really, I think it's a fairly good strategy.",1314005706.0

Not only does this produce a lot of clunky code that often still doesn't come out quite right, it butchers the document you are pasting into. It causes problems that are impossible to solve for users who don't know how to edit HTML source.<p>For example, if I copy a title header and some body text from a website into a CMS editor window, chances are I want them to appear as a title and text element that is in sync with my site's CSS. Instead, the browser tries to preserve the original style (a task at which is usually fails too). This forces users to paste that text into a plain text editor first in order to strip all formatting, and then they painfully transfer the plaintext back into the HTML editor and reformat it.<p>This workflow is broken and it's so easy to fix: just throw away all the ""integration"" code that gets triggered on paste. Everything would just magically work after that. So throwing out the Apple wrapper is definitely a step in the right direction.",1314005487.0

Some may not yet be ready to turn to technology while others may have failed to discover their problem even in a high-tech arena.<p>It is for this group that many physicians are now looking to the everyday factors that might make a difference.\nThe process of increasing fertility is not a complicated one, however, it can be a moderately difficult one as it requires sometimes drastic lifestyle changes.<p>Lifestyle modification to tackle obesity, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, have been proposed as crucial in influencing the outcome of both natural and assisted conceptions. A recent statement released by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) further substantiates this association.<p>Some of the key Lifestyle Modifications to Improve infertility and Increase your chances of getting pregnant are as follows:<p>Alcohol consumption: There is limited data substantiating an association between female alcohol use prior to the IVF cycle and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and male consumption and higher rate of miscarriages and reduced live births. Also, these associations were reported to be dose-dependent and considerably higher when the time of intake was close to the treatment cycles.<p>The study linked prenatal alcohol consumption with enhanced risk for the following adverse effects:\n Reduced chances of conception, low pregnancy rates, and increased miscarriages\n Physical anomalies to behavioral and cognitive deficits in offspring, which can be included under the broad term, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD)\n Fetal death, fetal growth restriction, and preterm birth<p>Obesity: The reduced ovulation frequency and chances of conception observed in obese women could be attributed to the negative influence of obesity on hormonal and metabolic mechanisms. Such patients undergoing IVF possessed reduced chances of pregnancy (around 30%) as they required increased doses of gonadotropins for ovarian stimulation compared to women with recommended body mass index (BMI). The literature study reported enhanced risks for the following during both natural and assisted conceptions in obese patients:<p>In pregnant women:\n Increased miscarriage rate of around 30%\n Pre-eclampsia\n Gestational diabetes, with the risk ranging from 2-fold in overweight patients to 8-fold in those suffering from morbid obesity (BMI =40)<p>In offspring:\n Birth complications and perinatal death\n Congenital abnormalities, including 80% increase in neural tube defects and 30% rise in cardiovascular anomalies<p>Considering the negative impact of these lifestyle factors, fertility specialist has put forth five key recommendations for the physicians practicing in the ART field.<p> Fertility treatment should not be provided to women whose alcohol consumption is more than moderate levels, and to those unwilling or unable to reduce their consumption.<p> Special justification is needed to treat women who are severe or morbidly obese. Weight loss is reported to exert a positive effect on the reproductive potential. However, further data are mandatory to make the IVF treatment conditional to prior lifestyle modifications in obese and smoking women.<p> If the ART treatment is made conditional upon lifestyle changes, the physicians should assist the patients in achieving the required results.<p> Before initiating the treatment, physician counseling should be directed towards insisting patients to take serious efforts to reduce weight and stop smoking. However, this is not recommended in the case of women approaching the end of their reproductive years, due to implied time delay in attaining these results.<p> Further evidence and increased contribution from fertility specialists involved in scientific research are mandatory to substantiate the reproductive effects of alcohol consumption, obesity, smoking, and other lifestyle-related factors.<p>Control of Obesity, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption to imporve the fertility will be great,which can further be enhanced by important tips below.<p>Coffee, energy drinks, soda, and chocolate all contain caffeine. However, caffeine has been shown to affect the DNA of sperm and decreasing their motility if it is consumed on a regular basis. If you consume any caffeine on a regular basis, stop doing so now.<p>Consuming many drugs, legal and otherwise, can have a negative effect on male fertility.<p>Some occupations have been directly related to lower male fertility, including those that work with pesticides, cleaning chemicals, and other toxins. If you work at a job that involves working with chemicals, evaluate your options and what alternatives you may have concerning exposure to them.<p>Exercise has been shown to boost male fertility, however, activities such as biking and cycling have done the opposite. Due to the bicycle seat impacting the testicles in a negative way, sperm quality and quantity are lowered. Avoid activities where physical trauma can occur to the testicles to ensure higher fertility.<p>For much of the same reason listed above, sitting or driving for long periods has also shown to decrease male fertility. Avoid sitting for long periods, and if necessary, get up or out of the car and walk around for a few minutes to avoid damage to the sperm.<p>Diet is important to male fertility, but something to avoid when trying for a successful pregnancy is MSG. MSG has been shown to lower the success rates of impregnation in test subjects by 50% when it was consumed prior to testing. MSG is present in many potato chips, soups, and seasonings. Be sure and check the labels of any processed foods before buying or consuming them.<p>Avoid hot tubs, hot showers and baths, and saunas when trying to boost male fertility. Exposure to high temperatures causes severe damage to the sperm that must maintain a very regulated temperature to survive and be healthy.<p>The final tip here isn't something to avoid like the others above, but just the opposite. New recent studies have shown that having sex more often leads to higher quality sperm. This is likely due to the sperm not being subjected to environmental and physical harm in the testicles. This can lead to higher quality sperm in males in only a few days.<p>Lifestyle modification should be the preferred to initial treatment of infertility.The IVF is a treatment where fertilization of the egg is done outside the womb in a Petri-dish. The mans sperm and womans egg are fertilized in a vitro (glass) dish and after fertilization the resulting embryo is transferred into the uterus of the woman.<p>For further information on any question relating to IVF treatment,infertility issues,test tube baby clinic, surrogacy treatment,surrogate mother,surrogacy in India or infertility specialist you may contact<p>Rotunda- Centre for human reproduction\nPhone:+91 22 2640 5000\nCall us from uk on:44-2080997519\nCall us from USA on:1-714-2740122\nhttp://www.rotundaivf.com\nhttp://ivftreatmentindia.wordpress.com/fertility-tips\nhttp://iwannagetpregnant.com/component/content/article/44.html\nemail: rotunda.tchr@gmail.com",1314004717.0

84,2911876,comment,2911334.0,2911600.0,6,0,angryasian,,,"just picked up one this weekend, some reasons are:<p>1.  WebOS international support is terrible. This is a huge reason to get Android on it.  They've completely ignored it.<p>2.  The browser while good, the card system is slow when trying to use it as a tabbed browser.  Opening a new link in a new card is quite slow.  I don't care for app support because their browser is good, but if you are going to rely on the browser at least have a decent tabbed browser.  Look at Dolphin browser on Android to see how a mobile browser should be done.  Also another limitation seems to be I can't download files from the browser ex dropbox.<p>3.  Overall the system feels sluggish. Android has multitasking right, WebOS doesn't.  After the Android team optimizes and overclocks this hardware, I imagine its going to be pretty good.<p>4. Lack of Customization, I can't even make a picture fullscreen wallpaper on the background.  And since you can't place anything on the desktop/wall area.. a nice big picture would look good.<p>Overall its solid and feels polished, but WebOS is overall really lacking and compared to Honeycomb I don't see it as better.  The best thing is flash support works great, and I can watch all the media I want from streaming flash sites.
