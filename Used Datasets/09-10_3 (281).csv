30,385205,comment,384746.0,385119.0,0,0,Retric,,,"You could be right, but I don't think you can completely separate your CPU, Motherboard, and RAM. If they are each 50$ and one fails then replacing a 50$ component will rescue two 50$ components which is a net gain if it cost's less than 100$ in manpower to do the swap.  Without temperature control the failure rate will increase some.  I guess they could work on a 3 month cycle and move the container to a nearby repair location.  Thinking about it there is probably some interesting trade offs depending on the local labor supply etc.  But giving up the ability to  repair PC's is a significant cost.<p>In the US 400,000 square feet of warehouse is around $19/square foot and you could avoid weatherproof all those containers and electric cables.  You could also use larger more efficient fan's to move all that hot air.  And you could use the space for other reasons if you don't want to use that land just for a data center.  Unlike this custom building which is going to be hard to use for other things.<p><i>Why would you get increased failure rate without the roof?</i> Bugs, animals, and weather, combined with a defective container.  Then again if they only need to last 3 years the failure rate is probably going to be low.<p>PS: I think of a rack as 100k+ worth of equipment that lasts for 3 years that has a vary small footprint and uses a lot of energy.  But, when you start building data centers like MS or Google I guess the buildings start becoming expensive on their own.",1228357916
