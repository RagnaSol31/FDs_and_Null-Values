Multi-paradigm languages are often more confusing, because when you're new to programming learning the paradigm is as important as learning the language.<p>Thus I'd say that languages like Pascal, Java, Lisp, Smalltalk, etc. are relatively good beginners languages, while languages like Perl, C++, Ruby, Python, PHP, etc. are not.",1223261903

3,324559,comment,324485,324485,0,0,grag,,,"I think halo's critique is pretty much correct. You've done a good job with the site, but I just can't see it gaining any traction against ebay, craigslist, etc.. in it's current form. You've got a lot of nice features, but consider stripping the site down a bit and focusing on a specific niche or interesting concept that is easy to convey. For instance, what if the site was entirely focused on submitting things you want and submitting things you have and it automatically matched up buyers and sellers. Not saying that's a great idea, but it's one example of how you could take one of your concepts and focus on it entirely to begin with. Then as people start to use it you can expand your site and start adding in the other pieces. Anyway, that's what I would consider doing if I were in your shoes. Also, like matt1 said, usability testing and focus groups would be a good idea.",1223261749

8,324554,comment,323656,324235,0,0,DabAsteroid,,,"I don't disagree with the statement that Henry Ford gave the public the automobile (instead of merely a better horse). I agree with your analogy (as long as ""faster"" can be replaced with ""better"" -- since horse-based transport had other problems besides merely being slow). My understanding is that all other efforts, around that time, toward automobile production fucused on charging as much as possible per unit, and limiting production toward that end. Even Ford's early investors felt that that was the only profitable way forward, and he had to fight to get them to agree to do the opposite -- <i>minimize</i> price and <i>maximize</i> production.<p>Henry Ford, more than any other individual, replaced America's, and the world's, horses with the automobile. (I use Ford's 1922 book <i>My Life and Work</i> as reference for these statements. <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=ford+my+life+and+work"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=ford+my+life+and+work</a>)<p>.<p>And while we are on the subject of analogies, we might mention Sony which, in 1983, instead of giving the world a better analog phonograph player, gave the world the Compact Disc player.",1223260976

12,324550,comment,324503,324503,0,0,dnewcome,,,"Ativiti looks cool, but in this article they say that the user shouldn't have to do anything differently, yet they call themselves a `platform'.  I haven't actually tried the app, so maybe it isn't fair to say, but if I see `platform' I usually think of complex all-encompassing products that require some integration.<p>I think one of the reasons that there are so many apps that could be considered task management apps is that everyone has different ideas on what task management is.  Also, there is some value in having local task items that are available in the tools that you already have at your disposal, ie Outlook.  For us (shameless plug: <a href=""http://www.ubernote.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubernote.com</a>), we wanted to have task lists inline in notes where we already had data, so we added the feature.  Add one more app to the list....<p>Good luck with Ativiti",1223260792
13,324549,comment,324485,324485,0,0,halo,,,"This post is a bit overly critical, but I'm being honest and hopefully you'll understand what I mean.<p>Your site design feels very dated, unprofessional and cluttered. Simple things like rollovers are wonky and nothing lines up - it's hideous. The fact that everything is done in tables stands out like a sore thumb and adds to the ""this was made in 1998"" effect. I'd dismiss your site straight away based on its design.<p>Your site is too complex and has no single ""hook"" as to why someone should use your site over the more popular alternatives.  You need a core idea that can be summed up in a few words - the fact you needed 7 points to summarise the site is a bad omen and smells of too many half-implemented ideas. Tou need to figure out what the core problem is and what your solution is. Note most successful sites can be summed up in 2 or 3 words to potential users - ""Internet Auctions"", ""Web E-Mail"", ""Search Engine"", etc.<p>It also badly fails the ""Do I have a reason to use it?"" test. Basically, a good test is whether /at this moment in time/, irrespective of /any future/ growth, it's useful to people. In this case, the answer is a resounding ""no"" - for neither buyers or sellers who are all already on eBay and their ilk. It's a /serious/ uphill struggle for a site to take off from that point and is a major problem you need to solve before you can expect anyone to use the site - and, believe me, 'word of mouth' is not the solution.<p>Another problem is that the site is too big - you don't need so many categories and sub-categories when you have so few items on it so they become a real challenge for anyone using the site. Remove them until they become necessary, and link to your listings on the front page. \nHaving an initially small site fosters community and makes it easier to use, and it's comparatively trivial to split a site into smaller parts if and when it's required.<p>Honestly? Today it's honestly not something I would even consider using and I can't imagine anyone wanting to use the site. If I were you I'd seriously consider shutting the site down for now, figuring out a simple hook, how you're going to make your site initially popular, and how to take on eBay (these are  the huge social problems, not technical problems), and then redesigning with that in mind. Let's not forget you're trying to succeed where bigger names like Yahoo! Auctions have failed.",1223260778

15,324547,comment,324502,324502,0,0,jwilliams,,,"I disagree with a lot of this article - firstly, I wouldn't call Microsoft <i>extremely diversified</i>. Sure - they have a lot of products - but the cornerstones are Windows and Office.<p>Microsoft is fixated on their platform - Windows, Office. Almost every other play Microsoft has is really a funnel for revenue into these (and their closely associates). Microsoft's play is all about ""seamless, easy integration"". That is, you get SQL Server, it runs on Windows, it integrates nicely into VS.NET - which is integrated into your IE browser.<p>To innovate, Microsoft needs to move beyond this. They may have the best engineers in the world, but it's hard to break away if the mentality around these products persist.... Everything needs to work with Outlook, or Live Messenger, or search, or whatever. Microsoft is all about pre-canned and all the advantages and disadvantages that brings.<p>On the other hand, these are hugely profitable products for Microsoft. It's hard (and perhaps reckless) to let go of this as a strategy.<p>In my view, Microsoft needs to break itself up a little in order to create niches and to innovate. This means - don't integrate everything - open things up - attack markets that aren't already Microsoft mainstays.<p>The microformats and social network integration as an idea is fine - very semantic web - but Microsoft simply couldn't execute it at the moment. It would get tangled up in this machinery.",1223260730

It's a pain to catch up on your studies, you have to wait for the start/end of the semester, and a degree is always nice to have, especially if you've already invested significant amounts of time into it.<p>On the other hand, starting a comany is something you can do at almost any time, including after you graduate. If you don't have a burning passion for a specific idea, don't drop out of school for it now.<p>It sounds like you don't know for sure what you want to work on if you drop out, and you just want to start a business. I suggest you stick it out with school and <i>then</i> go for your idea. If you know exactly what you want to do with a startup, then it's a tougher choice.

20,324542,comment,324485,324485,0,0,matt1,,,"You're presumably trying to compete with eBay, which is certainly an ambitious goal. I like that about your team: you're aiming high. The problem is that it might be too high right now. I think you need to find a niche and then expand as your customers want it.<p>For the average internet user, onista is probably a bit overwhelming. Hell, its even overwhelming for me and I read HackerNews! I get to the site and think eBay. Then I see social networking and think Facebook. Then I see automatic negotiations. It's not clear from your homepage how all of these are woven together to create something that benefits users. I think a lot of people will see this and say ""I don't get it"" and move on.<p>My 2c:<p>- Do usability testing with some normal people. Figure out what they don't get and where they get lost and make changes\n- Maybe simplify the homepage and make it clearer how the site benefits the users<p>- Who is your target audience? Consider finding a niche.<p>- The color scheme... while very web 2.0, you might do better with something more distinctive. I don't know who came up with the colors for HackerNews, but it's different and I've come to associate that combination of colors with this site. It has an identity. Go to the nearest bookstore and spend some time flipping through the magazines finding color schemes you like. Test a few out on onista and see what works.<p>Your site has a lot of potential, but you've got to get passed this initial stage for it to matter.<p>I keep thinking of WebVan for some reason.

22,324540,comment,324485,324485,0,0,lanej0,,,"My first impression of the home page was that it's way too busy.  The ""Use Onista To"" type information should be front and center followed by search for products.  The social networking stuff is cute, but not the major function (or at least shouldn't be -- I'm not looking to make friends, I just want to buy/sell something).<p>Agreed with the comments on you need to hit critical mass fast.  I may return one more time, but if there's still a bunch of zeros next to all of the categories, I'm not coming back again.  Same's true for sellers.  I won't bother posting my item for sale here if nobody else is because chances are there's no buyer traffic.<p>Another idea might be to ""lower the bar"" for getting started.  Yes, you need people to register to buy/sell, but you should take sellers through posting their item before you slap the registration/login form in front of them.<p>As a minor thing, some of the graphics are poorly executed (the Join Now graphic has a white border around it), and the HTML/coding is a little sloppy (but it was done in Dreamweaver, so that's to be expected).

The biggest danger here is that: any auction site has to get pretty big to make decent money and once you get big with a potential patent infringement, it can sink your entire ship if caught by surprise.<p>We discussed some licensing possibilities on some of these patents, and those groups didn't want to talk to someone who wasn't able to pay some very high initial licensing fees.
