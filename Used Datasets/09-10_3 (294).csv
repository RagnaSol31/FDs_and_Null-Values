But from what I've witnessed, you can't compare it to the scene in the bay.<p>Your average startup founder in Seattle is in his mid-to-late 30's, and has just come off of an N-year (N >= 10) successful career at Microsoft or Amazon.  He's financially comfortable, and the decision to jump into a startup was probably driven as much by boredom (with the 9-to-5) as ambition.  Moreover, without outside help, young founders rarely get the time of day from local investors (after all, everyone knows that you need to work at Microsoft for a while to gain experience before you can start a company!)<p>All of this could be viewed as good or bad, but in my opinion, it's not as vibrant, energetic or varied as the scene in the bay area.

I used to work in clean energy and it is becoming somewhat of a crowded field, especially for residential solar. You'd be setting yourself up for some strong future business, but right now the costs of solar installation for homeowners is quite high, especially considering the federal tax credit for solar systems is about to expire. There might be some more incentives that will drive increased use under the next president, but there likely won't be much within the next half-year.<p>Not sure how things are where you live, but the geographic market I was working in saw mostly retrofits and very little integration with new construction. As the cost of producing solar panels continues to decrease, you'll be strengthening your position, but until that happens you likely won't be making very much money.<p>Another thing to consider is the proliferation of larger solar companies that operate on a franchise model and include service and maintenance into the cost of the system.<p>If you're very passionate about clean energy and have the time to dedicate over the next 5-10 years, I say go for it, otherwise you won't see very strong returns.
