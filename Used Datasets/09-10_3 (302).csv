For example, purchases for me are consummated off-site and there is no guarantee that the customer will return to my Thank You page to get tagged by GA's conversion code.  However, since the off-site system does ping a script on my server, I can use Mixpanel's API to complete the last step in that customer's funnel.  (Finally, my number of conversions reported actually bears strong resemblance to the number of sales I made in the same period.)<p>3)  Google Analytics really, really is suboptimal for funnel segmentation along any axis which isn't available to the browser.  For example, a logged in user to my site might be a guest, a trial user, or a paying customer.  I want to know completion rates for a particular interaction broken down by that role.  This is, literally, one line of code added to my internal Mixpanel API.  If I were using Google Analytics, I'd have to start tagging many pages with arcane Javascript to cookie up the visitor with utm_some_garbage_here_argh, then configure custom segments in Google Analytics, then finally be able to sort by that.",1251860003.0

But that's a different question.<p>Whether by dogma or community forces, something about the FSF and the GPL transformed open source from a licensing scheme to a movement that produced the mass of software that we have today.
