One of the reasons some things are hard in Cappuccino is because they are unreliable in many browsers. We've focused more on cross platform ways of doing things. Of course there are some things we just haven't done yet too.<p>Anything that's possible with HTML/CSS is possible in Cappuccino. There's either a different way of doing it, or you can drop down to native code if you must. The latter is just generally not a great idea.<p>JavaScript is an OK language, but it's syntax is far from superior to Objective-C's. More importantly, syntax is irrelevant. What it lacks are features. Features like code importing, and dynamic message passing, and native classical inheritance. Those features (and more) are available at the language level in Objective-J.<p>Not sure what you mean by ""native browser rendering"".<p>The docs aren't great, for sure. But one of the advantages of using a proven set of APIs like Cocoa, rather than implement your own untested APIs, is that there's an incredible amount of quality resources out there that are almost completely applicable to Cappuccino. The APIs aren't ""inspired by"" Cocoa, they are the same, and so many of the books and tutorials are the same.",1269053482
