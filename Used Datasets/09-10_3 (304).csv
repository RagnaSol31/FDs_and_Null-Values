But I don't think anyvite necessarily needs to get people to switch (though maybe declaring war is probably good for PR).<p>There is potential in the many people who have never used evite. I think anyvite has more of a chance for after work drinks or meals (maybe you need to reserve a table) an other casual & short notice stuff like that. It's probably good timing for a second wave of this kind of thing as mobile internet is getting a critical mass.,1218077500

Even so, most were utterly incompetent, thanks to an education system that has taught them to avoid effort.  I think that, if some of these kids had had their asses kicked, and gotten some real challenges, that they would have done some incredible work.<p>I actually feel sorry for my teachers; I could see that they wanted to push the students harder, but that they knew that it just wouldn't work, and that they had no power, because it was such a small department at the University.  So, if they ticked off too many people, they'd be out of a job.  The head teacher, who is a really sweet woman, has had a couple of nervous breakdowns over the past year, partially due to the stress of dealing with her classes.<p>She's actually one of the motivations for my study tools project, because it should help her out quite a bit.",1218077035

How do you know your lawyer doesn't hack on Arc on weekends? :)<p>Seriously, though: of course the person asking the question should retain a lawyer for definitive guidance. However, asking around to get a feel for the opinions of intelligent people makes sense, too.

The other missing bit from the metaphor is that the 10th guy is actually buying most of his beer (and overwhelmingly <i>more</i> beer) at the ""long term"" rate, which is the same rate that the other guys would pay.  So while his bar tab looks high, he drinks at home for almost free.  Needless to say, he doesn't spend much time in the bar.<p>Also, while it's stepping outside the clever metaphor: the 10th guy is literally tens of thousands of times wealthier than the 1st guy.
