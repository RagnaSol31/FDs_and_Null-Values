You did not make a strong case for any of your assertions. You merely asserted.<p>This is different if your audience is, I dunno, designers, or people wanting to get their feet wet. That is certainly not the case in this forum.<p>Also, a foreign language takes a lot of time and effort to even just become functional in it. If you are thinking in terms of managing a foreign dev team with your foreign language skills, you're thinking in terms of several years.

Numpy/Scipy are quite nice, and make creating any tools that need a bit of real programming (i.e. not just matrix math) much much nicer than trying to work with MATLAB.  If someone else already built the tools using MATLAB and you don’t need to write any code whatsoever yourself, that’s obviously nicest of all.
