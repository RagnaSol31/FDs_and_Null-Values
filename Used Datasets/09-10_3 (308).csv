1,886554,comment,886489.0,886489.0,0,0,TheElder,,,"As a white male, I felt pretty good in graduate school (for computer science).  I was often the only white in my graduate classes.  While there were plenty of Chinese, Koreans, and Indians, there weren't any whites.  This made me realize what a great opportunity I had.  The whites were mainly in liberal arts, business, marketing, accounting, and English.  What does that mean for me?  It means that my peers, mainly other whites who I'll be competing against, will probably not have CS graduate degrees.  Good for me, but probably bad for the overall state of the country.<p>I worked the entire time during my school career, and that experience is what employers really care about, but I believe it helps that I have a graduate degree when interviewing and getting through the HR door.",1255748368.0

You differentiate by doing something totally different.

Good choice!<p>Now, many other people wisely do the same. The more people have degrees, the more pressure is applied on those who don't to go get one. Awkward, that.<p>So, now we have a huge demand for degrees, plus a lot of degree-seekers who (to be honest) aren't really cut out for college. But that's no big deal! The market hears and obeys, as enrollment goes up, standards go down, and bottom-tier schools admit anyone with a pulse. Hooray, everyone's getting educations, isn't this great?
