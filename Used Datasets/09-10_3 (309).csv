Why not?  Because they would be competing against the government for their definition of soundness.<p>Sure it could happen theoretically, but it would be a tremendous competitive disadvantage.<p>The way it is today, any bank that is legally allowed to operate is considered equally sound by borrowers and investors, and banks have no incentive to try to prove to customers that they are actually more sound than their competitors.<p>In a highly regulated environment, that works for all banks because they know that if there is a major economic downturn everyone will get bailed out.<p>Notice that all banks were required to accept TARP loans whether they needed them or not.  Why?  To avoid SIGNALING which banks were hurting and which were not.  Why?  To avoid capital flowing to the banks that were actually sound!<p>Why?  Well, partly because government wants to avoid a crash, and partly to keep the status quo going strong.  Also, consider what all of the major industry players in banking want... what does any firm want?  No competition.  They were all happy to share a big market and to have as few as possible attributes on which to have to compete for business.<p>Simple, smart, behaviorally sensible regulations make sense, but the SEC has been notoriously behind the curve for years.  The missing piece has been to regulate appropriately while allowing there to be an incentive for banks to actually compete on the basis of soundness.  The decision not to let the concept of bank soundness enter the brains of mere citizens must be a knee-jerk reaction to the great depression.<p>Instead, in exchange for various political concessions, banks were given every incentive to be extremely leveraged.  Consider the impact of the GSEs on housing prices, MBS prices, etc?  The implicit guarantee of Fannie and Freddie alone probably led to banks thinking (rightly, it turns out) that any housing related crash's impact on banks would be bailed out.<p>Side note:  Are the banks going to be better off after the bailout?  Of course they will be.  The desired ""sweet spot"" for most firms is to be in a heavily regulated, heavily protected industry, as it means that there are huge barriers to entry and the profits (though sometimes essentially set by regulators) roll in year after year.  See the military industrial complex for an example of the idealized sort of model.<p>Market forces have been very far from banking for a long time.  Why else would financial services be the biggest donors to both parties.  Libertarians are not opposed to regulations, just not ones that create perverse incentives and lead to massive bailouts!  Any time a firm would rather spend its money on lobbyists and campaign contributions rather than innovation, there is a big problem.",1231728184.0

Once I had all of those people testing tarsnap and still wanted more testers, I posted again to my blog and submitted that post here and to reddit, which brought me many more testers.

UI that values datasets over data points, or some sort of functionality that defines a dataset. Since most tasks deal with sets as a whole (and not individual points) this would result in a much cleaner, quicker interface. Also, you could start treating a dataset like a black box instead of a TON of cells with meaningless value, and thereby gain access to a lot of shortcuts not possible currently. This should allow easy data entry, dataset searching, and will keep all your scripting in your view. Best of all, there's no need to manipulate cells at all with a dataset approach.",1231725893.0
