Stealing means you've lost something i.e. no longer have it.  This is clearly not the case with copying.<p>Third, the comparison to slavery was only to disprove your assertion ""Doing something wrong to someone else who did something wrong is still wrong."" It was in no attempting to compare the two, the injustice found in slavery is far more egregious than that of any IP case.<p>Do you think it's ok for a teacher to photocopy portions of a book or article to pass out to their students?  This is allowed under the current system.  Shouldn't each student be forced to buy the book or article?  Are they stealing from the author?  What about showing a clip from a movie?  How does fair use apply to software? Why does fair use apply to other forms of creation but not software? Why don't mathematicians or physicist get to copyright their discoveries - i can't reuse the plot of a movie (hell, I can't even summarize it: <a href=""http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/996/996.F2d.1366.92-7985.92-7933.919.1392.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/996/996.F2d.1366.92...</a>), but I can reuse someone else's discoveries? This is not an easy issue.  Do you think wikileaks should be shutdown since it posts material it shouldn't have?  Why is it ok in some cases and not ok in others?  How are the lines drawn?<p>Do I think that people should be compensated for their work? Of course I do; however, I do not think that copyright is the correct mechanism. Injustice is injustice and should not be left in place just because it's convenient.  I think a better way would be to have those purchasing your software sign an agreement that if they distribute it without your permission they must pay X amount of dollars, for they are the only ones you have any legal claim on.  I'm not trying to encourage piracy, but I am taking the position that copyright is not legitimate.<p>I think your stuck in a mindset in which people can be compensated only by through copyright, and I don't think that's the case.  I can't predict what the business model that would eventually arise is going to look like.  But I am certain one would emerge.  Additionally, I think that majority of software developers are actually employed on applications that are not sold to the public commercially so perhaps large portions of the software industry would not even be effected (banking, aerospace, hr, etc).<p>As for the personal references, yes i create things and understand the effort and all that jazz.  But once again, I think that the current system in unethical and will eventually be replaced, perhaps by thinking through it now we can hope to improve the situation and not re-architect the internet and destroy many civil liberties to try and keep an outdated business model going.",1277255941
