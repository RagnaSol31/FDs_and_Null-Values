The house I'm renting has two bathrooms with a total of three sinks.  I think each sink had a different faucet pattern, until I changed them.<p>For some reason hotels like to experiment with new ways to control water.  Each time I use a different shower it sees to have some new variation on how to control as many functions with as few knobs as possible, and I don't understand why.<p>Was there some key design failure in having two obvious knobs to independently control the flow of hot and cold water?   Now I feel like I'm taking an IQ test whenever I want to get clean.",1261796375.0

However consider its meaning for the broad absorption <i>band</i> of CO2, whose graph is the shape of a wide lump with low shoulders. For parts of the band above some threshold, exponential absorption will have eliminated almost all the radiation, and further increase in concentration will not change this: you cannot go below zero. Parts of the band below that threshold will absorb very little radiation, and increasing the concentration will change this very little: double almost zero is still almost zero.  Concentration change only makes a practical difference at the edges of the band, and the CO2 band's shoulders are so steep that even drastic concentration changes only make for small growth in the width of the total absorption band.<p>P.S. MODTRAN assumes a nonmoving atmosphere, so its temperature predictions are not to be believed. The actual atmosphere experiences stronger vertical convection as ground temperature rises, which in turn produces secondary effects on vegetation, evaporation, and clouds that affects temperature. Predicting the net effect on temperature requires an accurate biological/meteorological simulation. And those are mighty thin on the ground.<p>P.P.S. Convection effects are why greenhouses <i>actually</i> get hot: the glass obstructs natural convection from cooling the ground. Calling radiation effects the ""greenhouse effect"" is scientific fraud.",1261796310.0

The bank bailout bills included 0% loans to banks, funded by taxpayers...my understanding was that these 0% loans were intended to encourage consumer and small business lending.  But, in my recent experience, banks are simply not lending, even to people (me, in this case) with really good credit.<p>To put it into perspective, five years ago, I was able to get a similar-sized auto loan, and with really good rates, and my credit back then was <i>awful</i> and there was much less of it, and I was self-employed back then, too (technically, I'm not self-employed now, but because my employer has only existed for three years, they're considering me self-employed).  So, by all measures, I'm a much better risk today than I was back then, but my ability to get a loan is nil.<p>So, not joking, just ranting because I'm grouchy about not getting a loan, since I didn't expect to have any trouble with the loan process and it's thrown my schedule off a bit, since I was shopping for an RV that I could put 25-35% down on, and get a loan to cover the rest.  Now I have to go through the process again, except shopping for only RVs I can pay cash for.",1261795738.0

We have a 24 year old investor, FWIW.<p>But I think there is this (largely incorrect) notion that your investors are going to be working for you.  For the most part, they aren't.  Oh, they'll keep their eyes peeled for opportunities for you.  And if you are on fire, they might smell the win and start pouring on some effort.  But for the most part, they are filthy rich, have tons of investments, and tons of interests.  They are stretched SUPER thin and their time is way more scarce than their money.<p>My favorite quote from a YC dinner (names redacted):<p>Q: ""How to you make sure you get investors who bring more than money to the table?""<p>A: Famous Internet Entrepreneur: ""What?
