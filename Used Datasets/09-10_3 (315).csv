1,371425,comment,371034.0,371377.0,0,0,Goronmon,,,"From my understanding, you are wrong about the use of the scanning. Google didn't want to scan books so that users could then read them, it was scanning them to index them for a book search. So someone could search for books that contained certain text instead of just searching by title, author, etc.<p>I'm not sure why you think indexing books for searches is equivalent to ""digitize copyrighted works and display them for free"".<p>Unless I am mistaken about this?",1227236224.0

While dated, one could update the ""Videodrome"" movie concept for the internet age. Obviously, Justin.tv did nothing wrong, in terms of the fact one cannot edit live video.

The search network, on the other hand, is best for advertising those products and services people know about (e.g. pittsburgh pizza, online productivity software).<p>Of course Google will say (and I agree) the optimized campaign will include components of both content <i>and</i> search, but it might be useful to consider the different types of traffic you'll get from each, and where you should place the bulk of your effort. I've preferred the content network which gets me more traffic with only a slight compromise in conversions (measured by form sign-ups).<p>Also, bear in mind that you should create separate, manageable ad campaigns for both networks because Google uses different targeting information for placement in each.<p>Aside: I'm working on my online advertising chops and should have my Google Advertising Professional certification in a few weeks. If you want to talk to me drop me a line (brian [at] firstblogmedia.com). I'm happy to chat with you guys if it means I'll get some early experience dealing with client questions.",1227232817.0
