I'm not saying it can't be done, but (good) defense in basketball is extremely team-oriented. Positioning, rotations, double teams (and the rotations that accompany them), etc., not to mention zone defense.<p>To give a more concrete example, a team with a great defensive center gives the guards flexibility to play tighter man to man, because they can more readily afford to let the guy they're guarding get by them (thanks to their ""backup"", the center). This has the additional consequence of implying that they give up less room on jump shots.<p>Another thing to consider is steals. A steal is really big because it obviously prevents the opponent from scoring, and frequently leads to fast break opportunities. However, it's misleading to simply look at the number of steals a player gets. Some players get steals within the ""flow of the game"", whereas others get them through gambling (I don't have a quantitative source for this, but anyone who's watched Larry Hughes play knows what I'm talking about) for steals, meaning that whenever they fail to get the steal, they also end up way out of position, often leading to an easy score for the opponent.<p>The list of variables goes on and on....",1234666635

5,481682,comment,481392.0,481647.0,0,0,patio11,,,"Michael Lewis is a non-fiction author.  Most relevant to this thread, his name is instantly recognizable among people who are interested in the intersection of baseball and statistics, because he wrote Moneyball.  The basic idea is that historically the market for talent in baseball has severely mispriced talent because it overpays for attributes that do not win ballgames.  Thus, if one knew what actually won ballgames, one could thwomp the competition while spending much less money.  And, sure enough, someone did just that.<p>For the rest of the story, I recommend the book.  I have no interest in sports whatsoever but one of my stats geek friends does, and he accords it a place of honor in his bookshelf.",1234666227

There's no lack of motivation or willingness to continue working hard, but there is a serious lack of knowing how to set-up a business.  I need to know how to compensate early employees, freelancers, cofounders, when there's no funding (something I'm dealing with right now), what I should be journaling during this process, and any other caveats of the web start-up industry.<p>Ideally this book will be written by someone in the internet industry who has plenty of experience.  Basically, a concise, well-written book by a CEO turned VC would be ideal...<p>My main issue right now is that I've done all the development of this thing (took several months) and am going to be getting a couple of cofounders / early stage people to help me out.. which is not hard at all once they see the demo of it.  But before I seal the deal with any of them, I want to be sure that there's something set up that's fair to all parties.<p>Somehow this request for a book has morphed into the true problem I'm having... but a book recommendation would still be great!",1234665986

To do this they need to collect a frighting amount of currency every year or the Yuan is going to increase in value.<p>If they hold that cash without lending it then the US government would need to create money to avoid deflation and the Chinese would lose out on the interest they would get by loaning the money.  Effectively this is loaning the US money at zero interest while the the USD they hold is deflating.<p>They can use some of this money to buy raw materials or intangible assets, but if buy finished products then the cost of raw materials would increase and they can just pirate most movies / software without cost.<p>PS: US debt is one of the few places you can safely hide a frighting amount of money.
