It was fun and interesting, and the fact that they had money behind it (and could hire helicopters and actors and stuff) made it stand out.<p>That said, I think you can do a good job without much money if you shoot for the niche.  I live in a small, boring town with a lot of bored college students, and I've thrown around the idea to make a local low-budget ARG more than once and it's been met with a lot of interest.",1221447429

I've finally set it up to only ever take 1 line only, but even then it is a huge departure from the norm. The key incompatibility is a huge issue. The fact that all my muscle memory (17 years) is dead using it.<p>I have this peculiar belief that C-x C-f RET should _always_ open the parent dir of the current buffer's file. ido threw that out the window. Now that will load the alphabetically first file in the dir. Lame.<p>There are others, but I don't remember them currently.",1221446514

It certainly applies to my usage pattern. I detest aggregations of comments from multiple sources. It's like trying to watch six television channels at once, three of which are inevitably tuned to the home shopping network.<p>You can't have a meaningful conversation with a thousand participants. It's much easier to have a hundred conversations with ten people each, conversations in which all parties are acquainted or at least share a set of common assumptions. Our languages, our social habits, perhaps even our brains themselves are designed for that use case.",1221446442

12,304246,comment,303723.0,304074.0,0,0,phomer,,,"Oddly, good communication is nearly the complete opposite from good code. Your code should be boring, consistent and obvious. It makes it easier to fix that way. Writing should vary, be inconsistent, approach things from different angles, and often be redundant. It needs to be messy enough to keep the human mind interested; although too many little irritants like spelling and grammar can be disruptive. Some structure is good, but too much spoils the flow. It's a balance.",1221446035

I submitted the scripting.com link because I wondered how it applied to facebook. fb and app store are the two biggest new platform type things.

What ended up selling me on posterous is the fact that my Mom has a posterous. To say she's not a computer person is an understatement. My Mom is the person that very recently used to go to yahoo.com, type google, click on the google.com search result <i>and then</i> search for X.<p>At first I thought it was because I emailed it to her and she was just trying to appease me. But then I went through my emails of other stuff I sent her: Firefox, Ad-aware, Delicious, Google Toolbar, etc. Each of these was sent to her after she complained to me about a problem (IE is crashing, computer is slow [spyware/adware], accessing bookmarks on other computers, easy access to Google [surprise!]).<p>Despite this, she has to yet to adapt and use any of the above applications (ignoring her son's helpful advice :-D). However, when she wanted a way to easily post pictures and I suggested posterous, she started using it. I'm not going to pretend I know why, but something clicked.",1221444911
23,304233,comment,304000.0,304099.0,0,0,anewaccountname,,,Historically basic research in corporations has been done by monopolies (Bell Labs for instance)--therefore there is no tragedy of the commons problem: they are the commons.  Microsoft research is just another example of this.  (edit: I'm dying for someone to bring up pharmaceuticals as a great counterexample to this--if I could <i>be</i> so lucky),1221444832
24,304232,comment,303605.0,303691.0,0,0,jrockway,,,"I like Mefi, but only for the Ask section.  The lack of threaded comments makes it hard to have a discussion, so all the negatives associated with point-by-point debate (trolling, fanboi-ism) go away.  On the other hand, the discussion is never really that interesting, except when someone writes an interesting story.<p>The rest of Mefi doesn't really interest me.  I occasionally look at the front page, but it seems like it's a site for English majors that want to argue about typefaces.  For technology-related stuff, news.yc meets my needs.<p>For random internet humor, I read the comments section in programming.reddit.  There is some hilarious stuff there.

If Lehman does not find a buyer over the weekend and the counterparties of Lehman withdraw their credit lines on Monday (as they all will in the absence of a deal) you will have not only a collapse of Lehman but also the beginning of a run on the other independent broker dealers (Merrill Lynch first but also in sequence Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and possibly even those broker dealers that are part of a larger commercial bank, I.e. JP Morgan and Citigroup). Then this run would lead to a massive systemic meltdown of the financial system. That is the reason why the Fed has convened in emergency meetings the heads of all major Wall Street firms on Friday and again today to convince them not to pull the plug on Lehman and maintain their exposure to this distressed broker dealer.",1221444433
