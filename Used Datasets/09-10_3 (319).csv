I disagree that its finiteness makes it valuable, however. Life isn't a market commodity where scarcity increases value, it's a personal one-off once-in-a-lifetime offer.",1229136770.0

7,396417,comment,396179.0,396230.0,0,0,jrockway,,,"Yes, Mozilla's default Firefox has a pretty lame EULA that you ""have"" to agree to.  (I know Ubuntu got strong-armed to displaying this.  I am glad I don't use Ubuntu or Firefox.)<p>Fortunately, Debian's version of Firefox (Iceweasel) only uses the GPLd (actually tri-licensed) code, which places no restrictions on using the app.  So it is really silly that MoFo even tries to force an EULA down your throat, when you can just build the software yourself and not have any restrictions apply.<p>Chromium is similar -- if you build it yourself from the BSD-licensed code, there are no restrictions on use, and no legal agreements to enter into.<p>Finally, EULAs are probably not valid, so this is all academic.  I would really like to see Google take you to court for using Chrome and not keeping your contact information up to date.  WTF.",1229136406.0

Their improvisations and crowd-pleasers won't all be as good as the best works of Mozart, or Monk, or even Billy Joel, but chances are that the crowd will be at least moderately pleased. Cover bands do not routinely run 300% over budget and six months late, and if they do you can be confident that the fault was entirely theirs -- it's not that the gig, which seemed simple on the surface, turned out to be completely intractable.<p>A skilled carpenter or vacuum-cleaner engineer might not produce a masterpiece every time. But the result will probably be a house that doesn't fall down, or a thing that picks up <i>some</i> dust for at least a <i>little</i> while. Vacuum cleaners are a well-understood technology, and while carpentry projects do occasionally go nonlinear (if you change the specs mid-project, or a freak windstorm blows up, or they discover a natural spring while digging your basement, or... well, just go read <i>Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House</i>, one of the greatest engineering books of all time ;) they are nonetheless relatively predictable, and the more experienced the carpenter the fewer surprises you can expect.<p>Now go read <i>Dreaming in Code</i>, which shows that even if you are <i>Mitch ""I Built Lotus"" Kapor</i> and you hire <i>Andy ""Mac OS 1.0"" Hertzfeld</i> your software project may fly straight into a wall: You may blow the schedule by a factor of five, and the budget by a factor of ten, and <i>still</i> not ship anything. [1] It has happened. People who write books about corporate IT throw around numbers like <i>fifty percent</i> when discussing the odds that a given software project will succeed. And the reason why programmers don't stop talking about this is that it is vitally important that our clients understand the risk <i>in advance</i>! Which they often don't. Nothing in their everyday experience with plumbers, dentists, and caterers has prepared them for it.<p>---<p>[1] Note: These numbers are not the ones from <i>Dreaming in Code</i>.

I can tell you that my dad is almost 70 and has never enjoyed his work more.  I'm 35 and I'm still always itching to learn new things.
