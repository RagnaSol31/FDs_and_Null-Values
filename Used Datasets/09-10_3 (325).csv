If a company came up with a new kickass battery that was way better than what exists, they should just start a car company, or at least every car company on earth would buy their batteries as fast as they could get their hands on them.",1226112318

Or it might force the best faculty to all work for for-profit colleges, which makes a for-profit degree nearly required, which makes college <i>less</i> affordable.  Beware unintended consequences.<p>IMHO, if the government was serious about college more affordable, they teach basic financial literacy in high school, and then give graduating high school students accurate, detailed information about the <i>real</i> degree requirements of different jobs and the salaries attached to them.",1226111939

11,357391,comment,357075.0,357075.0,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"This is exactly why I buy AAPL puts. The cult of Steve weighs far more heavily on their share price than their actual results.<p>Apple's success is clearly due to a lot of people. Nobody does that well due to the brilliance of a single man, and Steve Jobs isn't as bright as people give him credit for. The man tried to cure his own pancreatic cancer by eating carrots for Christ's sake.<p>Yet every time he sneezes their shares drop $10. So I buy puts knowing that one day, probably soon given the way he's looking lately, he'll announce his retirement (either voluntarily or due to illness) and their share price will plummet, at which point I'll sell my options and then go long AAPL, because really, they don't need him.",1226111597

18,357384,comment,356864.0,356864.0,0,0,hugh,,,"Like most ""happiness research"", this seems to rely on dodgy methodology and be aimed at some sort of political agenda. Ooh, and here it is:<p><i>So what are the policy implications for this new research. The researchers said single-shot events such as a tax cut will probably have little impact on people's happiness. By contrast, ""policies that lead to small but repeated gains are likely to succeed.""</i><p>Well, for starters, who says that a tax cut is a ""single shot event""? A tax cut would give me more money every single month, which I could then use to buy more of those ""lots of little events"".",1226111042
19,357383,comment,356771.0,357137.0,0,0,nradov,,,"Indeed. It's funny how the central bankers believe we need free markets for everything except setting interest rates and adjusting the money supply. For those apparently we need a Communist-style central planning bureaucracy.<p>And now in retrospect it's clear that most every major decision made by the Fed for the past decade or more has been wrong, and has made macroeconomic problems worse instead of better. Perhaps Andrew Jackson had the right idea after all (at least on that one issue).",1226111042

21,357381,comment,356809.0,357123.0,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"If you want an example, read an article of his that's freely available called Big and Bad, and then look at NTSB safety stats. His article poses that SUVs are less safe because they are less maneuverable, and therefore more prone to accidents. His ""proof"" is that a Chevy TrailBlazer didn't handle nearly as well as a Porsche that costs 2x as much on a test track.<p>Fortunately for SUV owners, actual data does show that they're safer. They don't really handle much worse than sedans in their price class, and they do have lower instances of fatalities in accidents.<p>They make up nearly a half of the top 20 safest cars, while they are nowhere near half of the total models sold. Gladwell actually even shows the safety stats of a few hand picked sedans and SUVs, but doesn't bother showing the entirety of the data available, which proves the exact opposite of his thesis.",1226111007

Since the vast majority of us can't possibly afford to pay a $100,000 fine for not doing our ""community service"", this would in effect be a government-run slavery system.<p>At $4000 (forty bucks an hour for college students who otherwise be lucky to earn 25% of that) it's pretty borderline.<p>This policy was always one of my strongest reasons for opposing an Obama presidency. It's facepalm-worthy to find out that many of his supporters are only just finding out about this policy now.",1226109989

The net result of the tens of billions in existing aid is that tuition rates have risen higher than inflation for the past four decades.<p>If the government was serious about making college more affordable, they could simply mandate that in return for the non-profit tax status a college must keep tuition hikes lower than inflation.  This wouldn't cost taxpayers a dime.  It would simply force colleges to cut a lot of the bloat they've added over the years.",1226109836
