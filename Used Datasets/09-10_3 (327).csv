And it remains open to you to try both now and compare how they make you feel.<p>The article seems to be claiming that all lifestyles without meditation lead to suffering. This is a pretty strong claim, don't you think? It goes beyond benefit and utility. At root, all of us are trying to <i>feel</i> better. Even physicists are motivated by perceptions of beauty.<p>People seem to think that being motivated by feelings  isn't rational. But <i>irrationality ultimately feels bad</i>.",1242528601

5,612860,comment,612323.0,612550.0,0,0,grandalf,,,interesting...<p>I have always wondered about the correlation between intellect and the decision to make huge life decisions based on one's own beliefs.<p>Simply having a consistent set of beliefs (or seeing the inconsistency in mainstream beliefs) will make someone  seem more like a hard core libertarian or socialist.<p>But what does it take for such a person to hit the street and start trying to make change happen?  Are such people ever revolutionaries?  Or are they content to have a logically consistent worldview but sit on the sidelines?,1242528492

You can't say ""The international free software movement has decisively placed themselves in opposition to laws which restrict information freedom by prioritizing intellectual property and the ownership of information by corporations over the civil right to information and software."" while supporting licenses like the GPL which depend solely on copyright law to restrict the way software is distributed.",1242528425

This prevents one from seeing anything from more than just the ""oh neat that's a big tower"" perspective.<p>- When you meet the locals in a new place, you are absorbing their culture and perspectives - something that is nearly impossible to do when you're secluded in a luxury resort all the time, or stuck on a tour bus with people from your home country/city.<p>This perspective IMHO enriches oneself and allows us to understand what makes other people tick - and I firmly believe that if people took more time to figure out how other people think, the world would have a lot fewer problems.",1242528349

If services that are better than Google for some narrow kind of search continue to proliferate, collectively they could become a competitive threat to Google at some point.  Or at least threaten some potential Google growth opportunities.<p>I though Dare made this point rather well, and I think it is worth further discussion.",1242527132

There is 30+ years of SMTP lore and myth stored in the code of mail servers such as Postfix and Exim that would take years to replicate and make efficient.
