The reason it takes such a long time to get the layout just right is because there is some browser out there (typically IE6) that does not behave the way you want it to.<p>We would not even be having this ""war"" if all the browsers were standards compliant, so my gripe as a developer is - why are we not fighting the correct war? As a developer, I must be able to write code, whether using div tags or table tags, and expect that it works just as it is supposed to, and not have to waste hours trying to hack it to work with non-compliant browsers!!",1233719937.0

9,465226,comment,463746.0,464065.0,0,0,patio11,,,"Its interesting to me on an intellectual level to compare your way of describing the peeler to his way of describing the peeler.  You describe breakage as an intrinsic feature of peelers, much like 1970s Ford might describe defects as an intrinsic feature of cars.<p>He describes his peelers as being remarkable accomplishments of Swiss engineering that do not break, period, and repeatedly contrasts it with the peelers you can buy in most supermarkets in Europe and Asia.  I can just about quote it from memory: ""This isn't a cheap peeler.  If you want a cheap peeler you can buy one at any dollar store.  This peeler was made in Switzerland and nothing from Switzerland was ever cheap.  You don't buy this peeler because it is cheap and you can replace it when it wears out, you buy it because it will be the last peeler you ever buy.""<p>Now it might be the case that you and he are still talking about the same peeler.  I think that this demonstrates one little technique which makes him a really good salesman for the peeler.  I think that this technique is a useful one to stick in the quiver -- it works with positioning software, too.  He is so consummately good at selling that I think we could learn a lot from him, including this one little technique, which is why I consider him noteworthy to HN.<p>On being the Last X You Will Every Buy: I use a variation of the same to position my software.  Most software in my vertical is licensed in such a way that it requires repurchase every year.  There are a bunch of reasons for this -- suffice it to say that most IP in my vertical is treated that way, software is largely produced by the existing IP makers, and they ported their license terms from their existing businesses without much regard to how software changes the game.  I think my customers hate that business model with a burning passion, largely because my customers tell me they hate that business model with a burning passion.  I licensed my software perpetually and position it, very explicitly, as The Last X You Will Ever Buy.  I think this is one reason why I can get away with charging more than almost any of my competitors, announce a price increase, and have customers send me mail telling me how cheap I am.",1233719414.0

I believe it will keep away many idea only ""startups"" that don't have any real substance behind them.
