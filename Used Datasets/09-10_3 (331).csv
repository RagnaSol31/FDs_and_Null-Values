The selling point of Linux, as a desktop OS, would be its stability, reliability, flexibility, etc. I don't think using these weird exotic colors in such inconsistent ways sells those points very well. It looks very amateurish. Of course the point is made you can change the colors/theme easily but let's face it -- lots of people are going to look at the screenshots and make huge irrational assumptions based on them. Something cleaner and more professional looking would capture the essence of desktop Linux better in my opinion. I've always liked the default CentOS theme:<p><a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Centos41-desktop-en.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Centos41-...</a>",1271991441

After finding out on the evening news that the device sold out here, I visited the store in person to complain. The store owner(?) was very apologetic to me, explaining that Apple gave them a very strict script they had to follow when fielding questions before the release. They couldn't even tell me that they were getting any at all on launch day, or that even putting down my name was pointless. (In retrospect, some of their choices of wording to me over the prior month should have tipped me off to wait before the store opened.  Afterwards, the store guy confessed that they weren't even allowed to <i>recommend</i> that!)<p>Things finally did work out in the end...<p>-- \nSent from my iPad ;-)",1271991350
