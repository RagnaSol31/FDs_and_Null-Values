How about we interview people based on their ability to actually perform a task, and then set, oh, I don't know, a 5-10 day limit to the number of allowable personal days in a year? We don't even have to give the women more of those days, despite their children and special times of the month. Hell, if we're worried that they're going to exploit their personal days to take care of sick children, we can just reduce the number of days.<p>Then we never have to talk about this issue in interviews or, god willing, on Hacker News again.

Luckily it's a rarely used feature in OSX which is how a bug like this can exist without much fanfare. I'm more concerned about the Finder file-copy-no-merge issue which is dangerous design by choice; not a bug.

While I'm not necessarily in favor of this practice for angel investors, I'm not going to condemn it either.  If I was going to ""pay-to-pitch"" I would make sure 1) the concept is marketable (investigate competitors, keep my ear to street, etc) 2) that I had a damn good pitch.  Unfortunately, some startups don't take the time to due these things or even think about the investors time.  The fact is they do feel entitled. By charging a fee you eliminate the half-hearted and at least ensure that the start-ups pitching understand the importance of the situation. The companies named apparently provide a service that these entrepreneurs can not provide for themselves.  They bring in the money. Therefore, they should get paid.   Does anyone know if the angel investors get any of this money?  Look if it's a scam it should be stopped, but if it's bad business it will stop itself.",1255401798

Perhaps, instead of a free-net, what's needed is a for-a-nominal-charge-net?<p>The problem with the current net, is that much of the stuff that has economic utility, like advertisements, works best against the <i>least savvy</i> segment of the population.  It's the too-dim-to-block-banner-ads, too-clueless-to-avoid-phishing, stupid-enough-to-fall-for-spam segment driving so much of the business of the internet.  I hope we find a way to counteract this tendency.",1255400038

That's what I meant by evolutionary suicide, and my argument (well, it's not really mine) relies on all six assumptions, more or less.<p>Although:<p>Colonizing space and colonizing space to the point where you don't need to worry about earth's carrying capacity are two quite different things.  Energy and minerals might be obtainable from space somewhat soon.  But we can't eat rocks or sunlight.<p>I don't claim population growth will be sustained into the indefinite future. I claim that it will be sustained until it stops, and that how it will stop is a question of serious concern.<p>As I see it there are several possibilities:\n1.Population growth continues apace and, due to reproductive time lag, there are suddenly far too many people on the earth.  This has a quite catastrophic domino effect and an appalling number of people, maybe 100%, die.\n2.Population slows and then stops, but people's lifestyles get more and more decadent and far too many resources are transformed into far too much waste.  Something, or many things, run out and disaster ensues.\n3.Both population growth and resource consumption naturally find some sustainable level.  Maybe that would be somewhere below where it is now. Maybe someone would invent something fabulous, say a glass elevator like in Charlie and the Great Glass elevator, and there is room for lots more consumption and lots more people.<p>Obviously, I prefer the third option. Maybe it will be that. I'm just sufficiently unsure to be worried about it.",1255399406
