Both of those would put a chill on sales.<p>Also, is iCloud secure enough for sensitive military charts? Maybe it is, but even so, explaining that to buyer is going to be a problem.<p>If Apple insists on this course of action, the eventual solution is probably vector maps. But a good vector mapping API doesn't exist for developers, doesn't work for many maps that only exist as rasters, and will take much R&D to make into a reasonable reality. In the meantime, I would hope that Apple chooses to unbreak the hundreds of popular mapping apps they broke last week.<p>If Apple insists on getting rid of the old behavior of the Caches folder, they need to deprecate it over the course of a year or so. None of us even figured out this would happen until after iOS5 went live, despite extensive testing from many devs. How this went live is beyond me.",1318733839

Your resume needs to be scannable so individuals can quickly assess whether you are worth exploring further. Think of the resume as getting your foot in the door.

I understand what a great tool it can be and that many people use it. But for presenting an online resume for myself, I've been using StackOverflow Careers.

Since then, he has backed off his claim.  (He later went on and continues to be a proponent of legislative laws for proper surveillance and forcing companies to be more security compliant).  So, even Bruce doesn't think encryption is a good idea.<p>Excerpt from a 1998 essay, ""Security Pitfalls in Cryptography"" that sums it all up:<p>""Strong cryptography is very powerful when it is done right, but it is not a panacea. Focusing on the cryptographic algorithms while ignoring other aspects of security is like defending your house not by building a fence around it, but by putting an immense stake into the ground and hoping that the adversary runs right into it. Smart attackers will just go around the algorithms.""",1318730512

I think copyright has lots of problems - but people not paying for anything isn't one of them.<p>My frustration is that the people who don't like the old structure won't allow a new structure to monetize itself. The greatest thing that could have come about out of the shell of the music industry was a way to pay artists directly. Pirate Bay could put that system in place tomorrow if they cared to. But it hasn't happened and won't happen if people don't actually pay.<p>The app store and iTunes are the closest we've got to that. But it doesn't make any difference that devs are independent - people crack their stuff and seed torrents all the same.<p>So there is another better model that could have existed. But it is 'disappeared'.<p>There could also be respect for the individual's right to mind their own creation.\nBut that is also disappeared.<p>Truth is the anonymous mob of the internet is another sort of unaccountable and unelected government. I wish it were different.,1318730464
