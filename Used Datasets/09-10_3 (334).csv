That is, I don't believe ""undefined behavior"" in the C Language exists for speed <i>as such</i>. Rather, undefined behavior is machine-specific behavior and it exists in C so the programmer can write machine specific code, the C Language being a ""high-level assembly language"" or ""system-programmer's Swiss army knife"". Speed is one outcome, certainly but there are other ways to get speed (a Just In Time Compile can come at least close naive c code). The <i>point</i> isn't speed. The <i>point</i> is ""do anything"", the point is that a chip designer can write c code and look on his screen to see the resulting assembler and decide where to go from there.<p>It may be the llvm folks bypass this point because llvm is ""virtual machine"" rather than a chip. But it is slight annoying not to mention this if ""What Every C Programmer Should Know""<p>Perhaps they should have called their article ""what C-programmers should know about optimizing compilers...""",1306032504.0
