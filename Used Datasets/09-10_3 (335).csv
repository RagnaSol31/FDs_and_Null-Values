I'm not trying to be snarky: I'm typing this on Firefox in Linux and I've almost excusively been on Linux since 2002. I've been elbow deep in this stuff for years, hacking and tweaking and experimenting, etc. I'm at the end of my rope, about to jump to Apple with all the lock-in and overpriced shit and inflexibility and patent abuse, etc. At least it is easy to use and maintain and has many powerful, flexible and even niche applications. And well-supported libraries.<p>I'm starting to see those free software ideals I've held so dear turn into tradeoffs. I'll trade in some 'freedoms' for more capable, abundant, and better supported software that allows me to get work done easier and more effectively.<p>If RMS wanted GNU software to spread then he shouldn't have gone into politics and preaching. He should have made sure that GNU software was more useful to the software users. To most people software freedom is too intangible to be counted as a benefit. Hell, 99.9% of people couldn't even explain it in very basic terms if you asked them. He's just created software for enthusiasts and hobbyists. Not a bad thing, but not his goal either.<p>Anyways, I've grown out of it.<p>I'm just talking about consumer-facing software, by the way. I know free software will always have value in education, commodity software that is not your primary business, etc. It is always going to be an abysmal failure on the desktop unless a free software Steve Jobs appears out of thin air, though.",1269831579.0

For some reason they decided to ignore the query parameters to a url when caching so for /img.png?123 they simply look up file /img.png in the cache. If they would just stop doing that it would be trivial to deliver newer versions to the edge servers by simply referring to it as /img.png?124 . If they could just add this it would work perfectly for most use cases I can come up with.,1269831534.0

If you're doing a commodity business with marginal costs like file storage, you might actually worry about cost of goods quite a bit, but if you're primarily charging for scales-to-the-moon-IP rather than server resources, it is highly likely that you'll never have serious scaling problems and the scaling problems you do will be tractable to well-understood solutions.  (Most of what makes Dropbox a great backup solution is the non-commodity part: the user experience, which a) rocks and b) is hard to duplicate and c) can be offered to the entire world for free.  Then there's the portion of the business that is ""save gigabytes of data to a spinning metal platter"" -- <i>that</i> is a commodity with actual marginal costs.)<p>Take a look at 37signals, StackOverflow, or FogCreek, for example, in terms of the scaling needs of real, stupidly profitable businesses.  I think you could probably fit all three companies' hardware in my closet and have room left over.<p>Or, at the lower end of the scale, take my business.  On a very good day I might get a thousand people to sign up for the software.  That's a huge number for me (more people than I know in the entire world!), but it is a very little number for a computer, even a modest fraction of a modest server sitting in Slicehost's rack.",1269828542.0
