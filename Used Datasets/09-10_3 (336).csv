See whether you and your friends can agree to a schedule that leaves you with a good block of uninterrupted time.  Perhaps they would prefer to do things in the afternoon, leaving you the mornings free.  Or they may be earlybirds, leaving you the evenings.  This latter might be hard, though, as your work time would come at the end of the day and you might be tapped out.<p>Another recommendation might be meditation, rather than additional overt effort.  It would take practice, but 5 to 10 minutes of quieting the mind might allow the context you want regain to emerge more quickly.  I'm not too experienced in this personally, however, although I do find lost context returning to me once my physical environment quietens.",1251687312

But in the next five or ten years, I'd be quite surprised if Congress passes a plan that produces a very significant positive impact.<p>The core problem is that any policy that actually improves healthcare will by definition result in far lower healthcare spending.  That means lots of doctors, nurses, insurance companies, etc will lose money and jobs.  In a Congressional system, determined, concentrated factions will always beat the public as a whole.  Very few people will vote out their own Congressman if healthcare reform fails.

16,795306,comment,795208.0,795254.0,0,0,mullr,,,"Your cleanup argument holds true for C and its ilk, but not for anything else.  In C you DO have to do manual cleanup, but in any language with exceptions you can (and should) do that in a finally block.  Or in C++, via one of the many scope-aware smart pointer classes.  In higher level languages, it is idiomatically correct to have many exit points from a function.<p>As for being harder to debug... it depends.  Again, if you MUST do manual resource deallocation, then I can see your case.  Having duplicated cleanup code inside the control flow gets old fast.  But if you've got exceptions, then such a rule leads very quickly to unnecessarily deep, convoluted control structures.  I've flattened many such structures by a) factoring chunks out to separate functions and b) returning early when appropriate.<p>It is very common for a function/method to either throw an exception or return a default value based on some parameter.  In these cases, it's pound-you-in-the-face clear to have a list of ""if(check) return whatever;"" clauses at the top.  If you do this before resource allocation, you don't even need to worry about cleanup.  This feels like a much ""purer"" way to write a function to me, almost like applying pattern matching before falling back to imperative mode.",1251686458

63,795254,comment,795208.0,795208.0,0,0,makecheck,,,"I always go a step further, and use at most one ""return"" in a function.<p>I find short-cut ""return"" statements frustrating for many reasons.  For example, there's a risk that proper cleanup will not always happen, it is harder to see state and program flow when debugging, and it's no longer simple to make every-case changes by adding things to the end of the function.  They're really just another type of ""goto"".<p>The only ""advantages"" I can think of are saving a few keystrokes, and having slightly better performance by not using a variable for the return value.  In my experience, neither of those things has ever mattered.<p>In other words, I'd do this:<p><pre><code>  <type> result = defaultValue;\n  if (condition)\n  {\n    result = val1;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    result = val2;\n  }\n  return result;\n</code></pre>\nWith this approach, there is never anything after the ""return"", ""else"" or otherwise.",1251684373

Imagine a ""new"" page where only 1 in 10 posts are worthy of upvoting (about the same as now.) Now, after some growth, imagine that changing so only 1 in 100 are valuable. Then one in a thousand. If you don't weed out bad submitters, it eventually becomes so hard to find the things that <i>are</i> interesting that you either start ""grading on a curve"" and just upvoting the best of what you can see—thus creating schlock like Reddit and Digg have—or you give up and move on to another site.<p>To put it in telecommunications terms: you need to keep the signal clear throughout transmission. If the clarity drops, amplifying it again (through a process like voting) will only pick up the bits that survived, and will also amplify some of the noise in the process.
