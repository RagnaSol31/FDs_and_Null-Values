8,1263984,comment,1263544.0,1263544.0,0,0,OmarIsmail,,,"Congrats! I had this idea about 8 months ago and knew that it was going to exist in some form on the web within 12 months. Now there are two services that are entering the space, so that is very cool.<p>However, my original idea seemed to be a combination of both webchiever and iactionable. And to be honest, I think both are necessary to make a successful service. Since founders of both companies are in this thread, I'll just lay out my thoughts here for you guys to incorporate as you see fit.<p>Fundamentally, achievements and points are a form of motivation/incentive that the designers of software/service can use to reward behavior they want the users to do. Now this has one really big assumption, that the users of the system actually care about the points and badges. For my high level thoughts around motivation check out my blog post (<a href=""http://mysimplemindedworld.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/a-framework-for-understanding-motivations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mysimplemindedworld.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/a-framew...</a>)<p>So going by Bartle's classification, the people that are motivated by points for their own sake are the achievers. And for some sites, having a few achievers do a heck of a lot is enough. However, if your leaderboard only has 5 people on it, the competitive aspect isn't really there and so achievers aren't AS motivated, and you don't get the Socializers/Explorers.<p>So you want to have quite a few people part of your leaderboards to spur competition, set standards, and show off their stuff. However, for small sites that can be difficult.<p>The solution? Aggregate points/achievements across many sites/services. Follow the standard of Xbox Live and have the meta-game of overall Gamerscore be a big motivator. So while that one particular site may not have been that interesting to you, if you know that you can increase your overall NetScore by another 100 by contributing to it, well that's just the extra bit of motivation you need to do.<p>You then have a centralized identity that people can show off. You also then have a service that sites will want to use to motivate their users. Of course you have the standard chicken/egg problem, however there are enough sites that want to outsource this kind of point/badge system you'd probably have it cracked.<p>Here are the specifics for my idea... which I liked to call SocialScore.<p>There are two point systems at play. There is what i like to call the ""internal"" point system, and then the ""meta"" point system.<p>Internal points are applicable only for a specific site, and are used to power a site's leaderboards. So let's use twitter as an example. If they signed up to SocialScore they could create an event such as ""get a follower"" and that would be worth 100000 points. Writing a tweet they could make 5000 points. Following someone is 10000 points. Whatever, totally arbitrary and up to the site owner. It's only used for insite comparisons anyway. You then have a leaderboard widget system, and also show leaderboards on the central site.<p>You then have a badge system. Just like Xbox Live each site that signs up gets a fixed number of SocialScore points, and an upper limit of badges they can give out. Maybe you start with 100 SocialScore points you can give out (per user) and 20 badges. Of course there needs to be a verification/approval system in place to make sure people don't just register a ton of fake sites to get lots of badges. The integrity of the system is very important.<p>The interface/rule engine I concepted would consist of the following. A site master would register a series of events with the SocialScore system. So would register ""Get a follower=1000 points"" and the system would return an event id. And there could be an arbitrary number of events a site could register.<p>The site master would then create a set of requirements on which to award a particular badge. For example To Get Badge ""Follow Master"" a user needs to have event id XXXX happen 100 times. Or you could get a bit more complicated and be event id X happens 10 times and Y happens 5 times and Z happens 30 times. You get the idea.<p>Now on the programming end you have a very very basic API that just registers events. It's just one call ""registerevent(userhash,eventid)"" and the SocialScore system handles all the point calculations, badge awarding, etc.<p>The SocialScore site can then provide a bunch of widgets that client sites can embed such as leaderboards, profile-badges, etc. I'd even have the SocialScore system have a javascript library that would handle notifications, etc. But that's expansion stuff.<p>The business model here is great too... your first block of SocialScore points and badges are free, if you want to be able to award more SocialScore points and badges site masters have to pay for them. I disagree with the per-event payment model that Webchievements is pursuing since there's too much risk for the site. Also, if the aggregator site gets enough traction there are sponsorship and advertising opportunities. There's the obvious regular advertising, but then there's the cooler advertising where sites will want to be promoted to users of SocialScore.<p>So there's my original design laid out. It seems to be more ambitious than what both IActionable and Webchievements are going after... I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.",1271213231

When practicing on the early problems on Project Euler, vectors and mutation were language features I simply didn't need for some time, so I didn't learn them until later.

I've never gotten a qualified business lead from a directory (and I'm listed in several thanks to some certifications I've earned int he past). They are always looking at the rate and keywords rather than ""Is this person good to work with?""<p>At the end of the day, personal referrals are the way most people do business. It's inefficient, yes, but so far I've never seen a suitable replacement.",1271210904

54,1263934,story,,,1,2,elblanco,"Ask HN: Pricing models, stand-alone software vs. enterprise what works?",,"My company is currently (or should I say typically) reviewing pricing for our product. We're too small to compete against our largest (and much more successful) competitor directly, but we've historically priced to stay about 20% below them. They gear their offering as an enterprise rollout typically costing in the millions, while we pitch to stand-alone users. Obviously it's hard to compete well in this arena.<p>We're looking at repositioning ourselves towards the other end of the market, against other stand-alone vendors. But our pricing is about 2x theirs even though we offer about 2x the features. There are many more vendors in this space, and one defacto standard vendor that looks to be on its way out.<p>We've gained pretty good traction in both areas, but we feel we're getting close to maximizing this ""in-between market areas"" space and want to expand. It's obvious to us right now, with the way the market is, that competing against our enterprise competitor more directly will just result in us getting squashed like a bug (they don't do very many acquisitions and out technology wouldn't integrate easily into their portfolio anyways). So it looks like we'll be fighting down market.<p>Since we're priced well over those competitors, we have three choices.<p>1) Pitch what we have, and hope our feature delta carries the day. We have evidence though that we've lost a few bids to cheaper, but less capable competitors.<p>2) Lower the price on what we have to directly compete. But we risk cases where we might have made $100 to instead make $50 without guaranteeing at least a 200% increase in sales to make up the difference. Plus the perceived ""premium"" value for our product potentially goes out the window and we end up head to head against the wrong competitors.<p>3) Build a new ""lite"" version of the software (for minimal effort, just turn off some features) and sell that as a new SKU. This helps us directly compete down market, while still being able to offer a flagship to our upmarket folks. This is the option that currently has the most traction. But it risks the same problems as option 2, while also increasing the complexity of our offerings (and all the stuff that goes with that).<p>Anybody have experience with this kind of thing? How'd it work out? Any tips, ideas?<p>(sorry I can't talk directly about my company or the space we're in, it might make sense to model us like an MS-Office competitor. Except that the large enterprise competitor is Google Docs, and we are also competing against MS-Office, iWorks, Star Office, Open Office etc. and everybody charges for their software...there's no advertising revenue in our space. The competitive landscape is almost exactly like that.)",1271210731
