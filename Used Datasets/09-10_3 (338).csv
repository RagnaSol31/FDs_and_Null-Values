1,1379382,comment,1378462.0,1379136.0,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"Here's how RPython is ""faster than C"":<p>1. PyPy's Python interpreter is written in RPython, a subset of Python.<p>2. CPython is an interpreter written in C.<p>3. When compiled into a JIT, PyPy's Python interpreter is now generally faster than CPython, sometimes by a wide margin.<p>4. Code written in RPython is faster than code written for a nearly identical purpose in C.  The C code in question has been the target of aggressive optimizations for years while the RPython code is relatively immature.<p>Now, for many applications I'm sure C remains faster than RPython.  But for the application RPython is designed for--writing an interpreter for a dynamic language--I think it is safe to say that RPython appears faster than C.<p>The fact that the PyPy's interpreter is cleaner, safer, and more maintainable than equivalent C code is also a huge win.  Again, the point of the original post is that RPython could become an simple implementation language to create fast interpreters for dynamic languages.  It could also become a target language for other compilers.<p>Anyways, as others have pointed out, Lua is a considerably simpler language than Python.  LuaJIT is a really remarkable piece of engineering, especially since it was written by one guy, but it's really a completely different project than PyPy.  Its aim is to make Lua--and only Lua--extremely fast.  If PyPy's Python implementation gets no faster (which I think is unlikely) the potential ability to easily create new dynamic languages that are similarly speedy is itself an amazing achievement.",1274842713

Its just that IMO complex pieces like JIT, threads and GC take some time to stabilize. So while I am all for Perl 6 being on Parrot and Parrot seems to be quite a feature rich VM I would want to see it used in the field for at least a year before I use it for a critical application.<p>For the same reason, I would probably pick up the JIT/unladen-swallow version of CPython (whenever it comes out) only about a year or so of being out.<p>At the moment I use Python quite a bit and have started to use Ruby sometimes. No PHP. Perl 6 and Parrot appeal to me because of their feature set. As for the syntax, I prefer Python syntax much more than Perl 5/6 but thats subjective. I would very much want to try out Perl 6 as it brings a lot of good stuff to the table, I think syntax would be a small price to pay for those features.",1274842556

E.g., for the factory pattern the common practice (outside of some well designed APIs e.g., google collections) the common practice is:<p><pre><code>  public class Image {\n    public Image(byte[] data) {\n      // create the image from byte array \n    }\n  }\n \n  public class ImageFactory {\n    public Image createImage(File file) throws IOException {\n      // read data then create an image\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nvs.<p><pre><code>  public Image {\n    // the same constructor, but then ...\n    public static Image open(File file) throws IOException {\n      // Do the same thing as factory would do\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhat's the advantage of the first approach, provided there's no per-instance state (and thus reason not to just use a static factory method) within the ImageFactory class?",1274839681

Anyway, on x86 processors, ""rep movsX"" was faster from 8086 to 80386, but since the 80486, it is faster to do assembly unrolling for reducing the jump penalty (as the ""rep movsX"" doesn't do unrolling, being its conditional jump a penalty). On CPUs with prefetch hardware support -e.g. SSE2-, you could still speed it up a bit more, by fetching/ordering future cache line before needed, avoiding pipeline stalls.<p>The shown example, that just writes to RAM, is probably just fast enough (it is harder to optimize read cases), although a bit of unrolling could reduce jump penalty impact (specially on non superscalar or in in-order superscalar CPUs -typical ARM included on handheld devices-).",1274839668
