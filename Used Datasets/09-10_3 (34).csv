We are indie developers and would love to hear your feedback on the game! Thanks in advance.<p>A short preview video can be found on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kancueq_jWE&feature=youtu.be To enjoy playing ‘Trap the Doge’, download it from Apple App Store at the following address: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id907985694; and Google Play at this address: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trapthedoge.ios<p>The objective of the game is to trap the Doge and thwart his escape plan. At first glance, the game is simple and easy to play. A player just needs to tap the light blue dots on a 9X9 matrix in order to block the path of the Doge. However, after a few trials, you might find that it is not as easy as you thought. It might require some level of strategic planning beforehand in order to trap the Doge within the green dots. Otherwise, the Doge would get around the green dots, reach the edge of the matrix and you will lose! So, think twice before you tap any of the blue dots on the screen! Once the Doge is surrounded by green dots, you are successful. The fewer steps you take to trap the Doge, the higher score you get.<p>Wow! Very Game! Such Trap!
