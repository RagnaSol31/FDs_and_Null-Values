It is time to fix all that we damaged on my body over the past years.<p>Well, with this time I have really jumped into gathering and wanting to absorb more information.  And, I want to understand how the information affects my life, this world, or those I love. I use Evernote (www.evernote.com) to collect so much data, then find the back-up data that I had no choice but to find such a system to manage it all.  And, I now enjoy finding the information which can help others.  So, I have designed Evernote notebooks for them.  They can just access it, and they will find a very well organized ""notebook"" of information which they may be able to use now or later, or they may be able to add to and come up with a solution to some issue they were working on.<p>Now, when I am in the hospital, as I was last week, and I did not have my computer with me, I was a bit testy.  However, my phone has an Evernote phone program on it and I was able to do just enough gathering and learning (I never add something to a notebook without first reading it through, top to bottom.).

The ""beliefs"" they are talking about are rather trivial: strictly formal abstract logical statements which look very hard from intuitive point of view, but they are relatively easy to construct and relatively easy to disprove (provide a counterexample for). An attempt to base your work on one would instantly lead to an error in a proof, which will be found upon review.<p>On the other hand, programming is actually a branch of engineering, a much less formal discipline. TIMTOWTDI, and not just in Perl. Everything in programming is subjective. Results of programmer's work aren't simply ""correct"" or ""erroneous"". Basing your work on a ""false belief"" will just require spending more effort on it, or lead to a lower quality product.<p>You can imagine an objective false belief, but it would be some kind of triviality, like wrong understanding of initialization order for base classes in C++, or behavior of modulus operator for negative numbers. Nobody is discussing this kind of stuff with any grandeur.<p>edit: tl;dr: in math it may be hard to understand whether you're objectively wrong.

45,1407867,comment,1407464.0,1407644.0,0,0,nfnaaron,,,"""So who created programming languages?""<p>We did, but we did it on purpose. Programming languages are mere tools, subsets of human language. Human language evolved as part of human evolution, and is as intimately part of the definition and condition of ""human"" as a beating heart and a gleam in the eye.<p>Programming languages are created for limited and specific purpose, <i>relative to human language</i>. They take a few months to a few years to create. They're ""received"" by most of us, and only if we volunteer.<p>Human language wasn't created, it evolved, like feet and stereo vision, over hundreds of thousands of years, from grunts to sonnets. We have no choice to absorb language because language is part of the bath of human existence. It grows with us as the result of interaction between environment and genetic capacity, just as we grow arms.<p>To refer to computer languages as ""language"" is somewhat grandiose. They are very little like human language, and more like the rules and vocabulary of baseball. In other words, a computer language is merely one use of human language. You could refer to the traffic code or the penal code as language, and it makes about as much sense as referring to computer code as language. They all three are  the same thing, a description of rules and vocabulary, meant to accomplish a set of goals in a constrained environment.<p>In contrast, human language has no purpose, not in the sense that traffic code and computer code have purpose. You can't decide to use human language or not, no more than you can decide not to use blood. Human language just is, and it's that difference in specified purpose and no purpose that tells me they are not the same thing, nor even like each other. At best, computer language is an extremely small and constrained subset of human language.<p>The answer to ""why are objects so unintuitive"" is in the question's implied requirement that a computer language be able to describe an object as fully as human language, <i>and</i> that we can understand such an object with all the precision and ambiguity which human language allows; that's impossible.<p>The relationship between real world objects is both: physical and independent of human thought; and subjective, contextual and dependent on human thought.<p>A real world object, like a car or a row in a database table, obeys physical or mathematical laws independent of human thought.<p>Objects also have relationships that don't exist without humans. The car and row mean different things depending on how we decide to perceive them. The row, in the limited context of SQL, is a collection of data that must adhere to constraints, and that's expected to be produced and consumed in limited ways. The car, in the limited context of the traffic code, is an object that moves through the traffic system according to (or not) designed and learned rules of motion and safety.<p>The row, in the limited context of love and ambition, is potentially my partner for the rest of my life, or this afternoon's rejection. The car in the same language is a symbol of desperate love, as so memorably programmed by Bruce Springsteen in Born To Run.<p>To expect a computer language to completely, intuitively and consistently describe an object makes no more sense than to expect a love song to determine the rules of traffic.<p>Or something.",1275790838.0

Certainly, Keen seems to have the point of view Shirky is describing.  Carr is more nuanced, but still seems to be arguing for something pretty close to that point of view.  These points of view are uncommon amongst hackers, they're quite common in other parts of society.  Certainly, many journalists seem to want a return to the 1980s.",1275790317.0

61,1407849,comment,1407576.0,1407576.0,0,0,bdickason,,,"I've built startups in the gaming space for the past ten years. Some are successful (esports.com was sold back in the 90's), some mediocre (gameriot.com reached over 1 million uniques for a few months), and some failures (I won't bore you with these but they never got off the ground).<p>I don't recommend doing the gaming thing. It's a very competitive space with very little actual 'dollars' on the advertising side. Gaming was the 'in' thing for 2009, and the people who sold ads against it still floundered.<p>With that out of the way, here's my two cents:\n1) Gamers don't like to pay for anything. Period. They have a very high piracy rate.<p>2) PC gamers should be your target. Console gamers rarely do significant 'gaming' stuff on their PC. (I know this is a generalization but I strongly believe it) The exception are transactional sites (see point 4)<p>3) I would strongly suggest that you avoid a 'social network for gamers' at all costs. I've built a few of these and they all fail miserably. The only marginally successful ones are XFire and Raptr. Rupture never really launched but was purchased for 10m so I guess you could call it a success?<p>4) Tying into game API's is ridiculously hard because you have to get every 'publisher' on board. The 'Developer' of the game always wants to do cool stuff with their games, but the publisher controls the budget for external integration and API's and what not.<p>5) Cheat Codes is the one area that hasn't been done to death that I see some potential in. Sites like Cheatcodes.com and MyCheats are not very social, built on old technology, and are RIDICULOUSLY profitable.<p>6) If you build ANYTHING for PC, make sure it is focused around World of Warcraft. It's the cash cow and nothing else compares.<p>7) Gamers don't like to leave their houses. I know that this 'myth' has been debunked countless time but the fact is, it's very hard to get someone to go somewhere else to play a game with their friend. Just hit them on their console or computer.<p>8) The one idea that I've had floating around is a 'lifestream' type site for gaming. I envisioned it as a low tech solution like 'upload your kill shot, brag about it' or something like that. People just take a pic w/ their iphone, you check the timestamp against their Xbox gamer tag to see who they were playing against, then you tag the photo w/ their names. Could work w/ video too. Console gamers don't really have much that ties them to their PC, so the iPhone (or any mobile device) is one of the few ways to get them while they're playing.<p>Sorry for the stream of consciousness. I'm a bit jaded from being in the gaming space for so long. Recently started something focusing on another industry (hair salons, oddly enough) and it's very gratifying.",1275790236.0
