The topic of conflict, religion (one of your examples), is only the medium. To rephrase, people decide when to fight, the people's beliefs are only a push. With enough discipline, a hardcore religious person can avoid a religious war.<p>> <i>Most people reading this will already be fairly tolerant. But there is a step beyond thinking of yourself as x but tolerating y: not even to consider yourself an x. The more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you.</i><p>From what I can tell, Mr. Graham, you make the assumption that identity ('labels') itself is bad and should be minimized. I disagree. Identity, whatever the kind, serves the purpose of providing a person a sense of self. In other words, identity helps create a sense of belonging and protection. Forming an identity is like entering a family.<p>* Whether that family is good or not is subjective.<p>Mr. Graham, using your religion metaphor, a religion does provide many useful outcomes. After the Civil War and into Reconstruction, there was massive economic turmoil. There was a large debt to be paid, the sharecropping 'trap', the Financial Crisis of 1837. During that time, a lot of churches were formed. Essentially, the purpose of those churches is to provide emotional relief from the horrid state of the Union. These churches were a coping mechanism for the people. Generally, they worked. People formed a religious identity with the people they were with. Religion provided comfort. Identity is not always bad.<p>As a political example, in 1860, a party known as the Populist Party was formed. It was composed of farmers and the Grange. These people formed this 'Populist Party' identity because they all faced common problems: long hours, a cycle of debt, and control by monopolies. In a short span of time, the spread their identity and 4 million people joined the movement. They promoted the idea of a 8 hour work week, direct federal loans, and graduated tax rates. Many of these ideas are implemented today. Political identity provided people a voice. Their identity is beneficial to many people today.<p>* This came from my U.S. History notes from class.<p>Mr. Graham, I agree with you that social identity causes many problems, but it also provides many benefits. Please do not dismiss identity as completely harmful.<p>I am sorry if I offended anyone. Downvote me if you wish.",1234061986

In real life, a person is going to have a lot of real identities (that can be actively ignored by that person, but not so easily dispensed with.) The same person might be a father, an accountant, a divorcee, an alcoholic, a cancer-survivor, a member of an ethnic group, a 45-year-old, etc, etc, and all of these will inevitably effect that person's mental state and behavior.<p>A relative of mine voted for BHO because she thought he would be ""good for teachers"". Lots of people think this way. A friend of mine loved a previous governor because he was ""good for divorced fathers"". Public policy is a huge subject, but people will throw away every consideration for a specific connection. People who don't play this game (or play it badly [1]) become the victims, rather than the benefactors, of a massive bureaucracy.<p>The advice is, in fact, really bad advice (if intended generally).

I think I have a rough notion of what was intended, but understanding how it works better would be more enlightening.<p>The essay also attempts to separate science from things like politics and religion. I'm not sure that's a good idea. Lots of things that masqueraded as science, medicine, and rationality in the past look ridiculous to us now. In fact, history should tell us that any system of thought that looks so obviously right probably has big blind spots.<p>To use the example in the essay, the label ""scientist"" might not help you in negotiations or politics. There, you have to understand what the opposition wants in order to get things done. Identifying yourself as a scientist doesn't prevent empathy, but it can if you use that system of thought when you shouldn't.",1234060939

It doesn't seem that it's completely identify based, at least to me.<p>I drive a Jeep -- love old Jeeps. It's part of who I am. But if somebody started ragging on Jeeps in a forum I was in I don't think it'd matter. I wouldn't feel threatened. I like Jeeps. So what. I also like puppies.<p>Some subjects make people feel threatened because to talk about them, in any fashion, is to <i>personally criticize their judgment and their intelligence.</i><p>It's the degree people feel threatened. Most people, when you poke around at their politics or their religion, realize their is something deeply irrational going on in their head. They don't take kindly to having people mucking around in there, questioning their sanity -- their value as a fellow person. Religion and politics are topics where the fact that emotions drive reasoning is very close to the surface. It makes probing difficult.<p>As a further example, I disagree with Paul's opinion on languages. Inevitably we get into a discussion of what ""best"" means. At the end of the day, ""best"" usually means whatever I personally value. To criticize that is to criticize how I make opinions. Paul values terseness. Bob values availability of programmer. Joe values available libraries, etc. Once we start questioning judgment -- especially for programmers -- it gets personal.<p>I've been in the consulting biz for a while -- long enough to move from code monkey to trying to help managers make better decisions.

The Sorrows of Young Werther is about unrequited love, after all. I think it is the emotional, moral, intellectual and psychological content of literature that challenges. Not the theme. Pride and prejudice is considered the epitome of the romance novel by many, after all. 55% of the novels in America are sold in the genre. And here's what the Romance Writers of America say about the genre:<p><i>""the main plot of a romance novel must revolve around the two people as they develop romantic love for each other and work to build a relationship together. Both the conflict and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain subplots that do not specifically relate to the main characters' romantic love. Furthermore, a romance novel must have an ""emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending."" Others, including Leslie Gelbman, a president of the Berkley Group, use a more shortened definition, that a romance must make the ""romantic relationship between the hero and the heroine ... the core of the book."" In general, romance novels reward characters who are good people and penalize those who are evil, and a couple who fights for and believes in their relationship will likely be rewarded with unconditional love.""</i> [1]<p>In this way, reality is sanitized for mass consumption.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel</a>",1234059910

He thinks that the answer has much to recommend it and that it is not an identity.  He is right in the first respect and very wrong in the other.<p>Ditto with ""Having considered the alternatives rationally, I reject the notion of having an identity vis a vis [religion, politics, etc]"".",1234058813

It takes a lot of faith to put one foot in front of the other when the path before you spans wide, untrodden.<p>Eckhart Tolle sells a good mindset to carry this sort of work.",1234058804

The more improbable the belief, the less valid it is. One doesn't have to prove that a theory is 100% wrong, merely that on the scale of probability it scores poorly against a rival theory.<p>For example, I may believe the earth is 4,000 years old but it is a demonstrably false opinion. It doesn't matter how sincerely I believe this or that a quarter of the planet's humans believe that. \nSimilarly, there is one good explanation for how and when life originated on earth, and all the other ""competing"" opinions are highly improbable.<p>One of religion's goals is to explain the world, but science does a much better job, and yet people's religious beliefs are expected to be respected, even if they are stupid and childish (which they are most of the time). Another goal of religion is to set a standard for morals, and yet holy books are full of despicable, horrendously grotesque, anti-human ""morals"".<p>I think that one of the reasons people have a hard time admitting their religions and religious beliefs are fantasies is that they have been indoctrinated since childhood that faith is a virtue, to not ask WHY. Some of this appears to have its origin in natural selection, because children who believe at face value what their parents tell them are more likely to survive.",1234058765

There's also the obvious problems that a) few people are likely to want to use such a system and b) those that do are probably skewed to favor some particular point of view.<p>There is just so much wasted energy on the internet not being harnessed for actual progress. There are many blogs etc that have been created with the specific purpose of progressing some cause or area of expertise but people are just turning up, yelling opinions at one another and leaving with very little gained. Such is life I guess...",1234058678

They wanted to give an impression of something being done by always having someone around. The problem is that we got less done as we no longer shared ideas or even had a clear understanding of what everyone was working on.",1234058526
