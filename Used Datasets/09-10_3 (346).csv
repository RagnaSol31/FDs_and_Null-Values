I don't believe we truly _fundamentally_ understand the universe, maybe it's not even possible to actually understand it fully, but the scientific method gives an incredibly useful framework for us to model and reason about the universe and to actually get useful results with that framework - and it works along a whole spectrum of abstraction and different disciplines.",1300589880

But Danny's a publisher, and as such, each cache hit is one less pageview that his website gets.

A <i>direct</i> result of that has been that it's become much harder to launch things, and there is correspondingly less innovation coming out of the Googleplex.
