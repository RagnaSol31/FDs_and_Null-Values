Startups possess many admirable traits and many big companies manage to capture some or many of these. And many startups have problems like politics or bureaucracy that you find in big companies. Saying that a startup is somehow conditioned on the number of employees you have is a naive definition of startup.<p>Clearly there are many big companies that have some of the burdens that come with that. And at the same time many big companies have managed to dominate industries for decades, make huge pivots, and innovate in new areas far better than startup competitors. IBM did a huge pivot in the 90s. Apple made a huge pivot in the late 90s. Xbox Kinect is actually some pretty amazing technology. Google building self driving cars is an amazing innovation.<p>To say that big companies can't be lead through big changes, can't be entrepreneurial, can't make pivots, can't bet their brand on one big vision/product/push, or any other trait we admire in startups is ignoring history and reality.",1300503063.0

11,2342831,comment,2342432.0,2342572.0,0,0,alphaoverlord,,,"Unfortunately, metagenomics is currently the lowest hanging fruit of genomics/biology right now. Sequencing has gotten exponentially cheaper to the point that these types of projects are feasible (the paper you cite is actually a proof of concept for their metagenomics pipeline), that everyone is just sequencing this shit out of everything. That said, there are quite a few pitfalls with this current approach:<p>1. Big data in biology is still lacking comparable analytical capability.<p>2. Most high throughput sequencing technologies (next gen sequencing) is using polymerase based technologies that have short reads. Polymerase (the basis of PCR) requires a primer to start the reaction - and the choice of primer can introduce non-trivial bias into the obtained results. Short reads are pretty good in dealing with most bacteria, but the reaction gets pretty hairy with hyperthermophiles (bacteria with regions high in GC content) and more complex eukaryotes (long stretches of repeated regions are difficult to resolve with the shotgun approach).<p>3. We will probably only see DNA reads that are slightly different from what we know to exist already. The generalization they make that 99% of species cannot be cultured with current methods is true - but an analogous scenario with DNA can be made.  The sequencing reactions will probably be optimized for sequences with similar composition to what we already see. The task of extracting DNA from bulk material is not trivial - this can remove large swathes of species from view even if the sequencing is trivial. Complex 3D RNA and DNA structures such as hairpin loops and noncanonical pairing makes sequencing hard.<p>It's definitely still a difficult question to tackle, but more difficult than doing it are answering the questions ""What can we learn from this?"" and ""What should we sequence?""",1300502968.0

It's still a 250-person company. I don't see how just cutting it off restores agility that a tiny team with a nascent project has. A large project has more stuff to break with more people that need more links to communicate, increasing the inertia of the whole thing and slowing it down.<p>What might be possible is some type of Skunk Works with independent leadership, which generates new ideas but leaves the fleshing out to the rest of the company.
