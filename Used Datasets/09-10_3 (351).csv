With -$210.00 in my checking account, it was all I could do to hide my excitement when a local auto insurance company called me in to interview for a senior/lead software development position.<p>I was almost immediately apprehensive when I arrived.  The entire office basically amounted to an open call center, it was messy, and there were tangles of 10Base2 coax running haphazardly across the floor between computers.  Not a good sign.<p>Though I had made it clear that I was interested in web development, it turned out that the job would mostly entail RPG and VB6 (what a combination).  At that point, I was already looking for the door and thinking of polite excuses.<p>When the interviewer handed me a generic two-page application to fill out, as if I were interviewing for a job at McDonald's, I knew it was time to leave.  I handed the application form back, thanked him for getting in touch with me, wished him the best of luck finding someone else, and navigated back through their 10Base2 obstacle course as quickly as possible.",1282963421.0

Most people aim either for (a) or for (b), but not for both.  csallen's suggestions elsewhere in this thread are useful, as with one exception they fulfill both (a) and (b).<p>This rule can be tipped upside down: it's best to follow people whose tweets mostly fulfill both these criteria. This rules out a very large number of people.  It's amazing how many people fill their tweetstream with the news of the day from TechCrunch (or HN).  It may be interesting, but it's already widely shared.<p>Personally, I find twitter most useful as a highly tailored source of links.  That makes it sound similar to news sites such as HN, but the experience is different because you choose which people to follow.   For instance, I get a lot out of following @NicholasGruen, who ran the Australian Government's Gov2.0 taskforce, @rjlipton, a leading theoretical computer scientist whose blog was the main clearinghouse in the scrutiny of the recent claimed proof the P is not equal to NP, @gnat of O'Reilly Media for an eclectic collection of tech-related links that for the most part fall outside the purview of the standard sources (TechCrunch etc), etc.  Of course, those particular sources are just ones I find interesting, and they may not interest you.

A party like Conde Nast may not be popular with the reddit crowd but to pretend they're just a bunch of clowns that would be swayed by a jerk move like this is simply stupid. If you think that there is no protocol to buying a business of this size try to take over even a very small website by announcing publicly that you are 'in talks' before receiving your first answer. Then you can tell me how well it worked.<p>> Conde Nast just embarrassed themselves with a large portion of their customers, and not just the ones at reddit.<p>Not really, Conde Nast has different priorities than reddit. This is unfortunate for reddit but then they should have done better research on who they were selling to. They differ in opinion on a lot of things, I would call it a 'rocky marriage' at least and possibly there are by now grounds for divorce. But overall I think the reddit guys have been creative enough to work their way around the rough edges and Conde Nast has behaved like a rather reluctant parent. It reminds me very much of the winamp takeover by AOL.<p>> Cheezeburger guy jumps in with a brilliant move,<p>What's brilliant about it? Offering to buy them out? If figure that if you're serious about something like that you go about it the diplomatic way, not the cowboy way. Unless of course you don't really want a deal.<p>But, maybe pigs can fly, and maybe you are right. But I <i>highly</i> doubt it.<p>I get approached on average 3 times per year to 'sell my company', I can tell just by the way in which I'm approached if someone is serious or not. And even if they are serious, we usually just end up chatting for a bit and then we both go our ways. If such a party would announce their intent in the media before sounding me out they might as well forget about approaching, <i>especially</i> if they're not nearly as well known as either the acquisition target <i>or</i> the seller. Then it looks like they're trying to gain publicity over my back.<p>> and you question protocol and additionally seem upset if he's not actually expecting them to sell to him.<p>Yep. It wastes bandwidth and gives this guy airtime that he shouldn't have. Unless, of course he really is serious and just hasn't figured out how to handle a situation like this. But as it is it just looks like a rather stupid ploy to get their attention in a negative way. The redditors (the subject of the sale here) must be wondering right now if it would be possible to find an even worse buyer than CN.<p>> And hardly an anonymous coward here, just following corporate protocol of our culture and keeping my job.<p>That's what I said. So you don't stand by your words after all. Just imagine your boss would read your writings, you might want to delete them, right? And your job is in M&A?",1282961268.0

I worked at one company where we even kept roadmap information secret from the sales department, for fear that it would leak to customers and stall current sales to customers who might just wait for the newer product if they knew the details. I think the defining characteristic may have been that these were big-ticket items: if you buy one, you're not going to buy another for a few years. On the other hand, at another one of my employers, a company selling enterprise software, it was much more important to maintain an ongoing relationship and to establish trust. That required more openness about future plans, to customers who buy a product, buy maintenance contracts, and keep buying more products, once they decided that we were a company that they could do business with in the long term.",1282961249.0
