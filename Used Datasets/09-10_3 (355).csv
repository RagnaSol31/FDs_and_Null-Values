No matter how skilled they are - in fact, the more they practiced, the better.  I have trouble seeing this as as-quick as a semi-intelligent QWERTY pad that can correct most errors by proximity.<p>Sure, loops are fast, but are they as fast as a move and tap?  And how about ergonomics - is it more tiring, given that the distance travelled is <i>huge</i> compared to many others?<p>Totally-blind typing: awesome.  Huge advantage there where accuracy is important (Graffiti ain't bad, but small errors can magnify as you may cause a command gesture if you aren't watching).  I'd call it a definitive ""win"" there.  But how about other uses?",1288666773.0

Tricks like premaking the overlord, using extractor trick, etc. Have been around for over 10 years since the early days of Starcraft 1. Any person could come up with this build, the question is where did the idea to rush for 7 roaches come from? It sounds like that was manually set as the target goal by the creator.<p>I have yet to see a programs which is better than human at finding optimal builds. But what programs do excel at is simulating a build so you can see how the timings work out, allowing you to find your own build by experimentation and tweaking. Sure a program can help automate some very minor fine tuning details (which would be easy to find but perhaps  tedious).",1288664554.0

People say silly things when they view age extension through the highly mythologized lens of ""mortality versus immortality"", rather than seeing it as a difficult set of scientific and engineering challenges, each of which merely extends your life expectancy.<p>For example, suppose that we had medical treatments to prevent cancer, almost all infectious diseases, and aging. Your life expectancy goes up, but sooner or later you're going to be hit by a bus or something -- not exactly eternal life.
