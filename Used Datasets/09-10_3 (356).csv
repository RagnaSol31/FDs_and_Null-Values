Intuitively it is obvious, but why is the relative reasoning incorrect?<p>There is no formal distinction between absolute and relative quantities, and no theorem that says that expected values can only be taken from absolute quantities. There are just random variables, and these have some distributions, and they can be independent or not. Nothing prevents you from taking an expectation of a random variable that is a ratio of two other random variables.<p>Another angle - I could say that our definition of expected value, based on weighted arithmetic average, is completely arbitrary, and instead define my own expected value G[X], based on the geometric average. Suddenly, the relative approach becomes correct: sqrt(2 * 0.5) = 1, so the expected relative improvement from switching is 1. What the hell is going on?",1281149448.0

It doesn't matter that the probability of picking any particular number will be 0, as long as the probability of picking any one between the two in the letters isn't 0. Any time your guess hits the correct range, you win. Any other time, it depends on whether you got the big envelope or the small one.<p>So knowing just one endpoint of a range is, oddly, evidence as to which way the other endpoint lies - as long as it might be either one. You just take a guess <i>that depends on the number you know</i> in such a way that the smaller the number you see, the more likely you are to guess it's the smaller of the two, but are never certain. Presto, guaranteed you'll get more than 50% right, as long as you get fed both the small and the large envelopes in equal proportion.<p>If you can't be sure the other guy is playing fair and might favor giving you the low envelope, you need to look at something like the Monty Hall problem.",1281148530.0

The flaw is still that the variable is undefined (or infinite probability) in one part of the word problem, but <i>treated as defined</i> in another. So, start with when you first chose the envelope which has y. At this point ""y"" is undefined, and can be the higher or lower amount. That's the key. Yet, you then continue to propose that by switching you gain 2y - y = y. That equation is not okay, because ""y"" could have been the higher amount, and the equation breaks down. Once you assert the equation holds true, you have thus defined the original value of ""y"" from that first envelope choice (i.e. ""y"" was lower).

Oh, and also reality.<p>Edit: But it is brilliant that this comment would be by someone named <i>CapitalistCartr</i>, what with the class war looming and right v left being an anxious distraction. I can't see how anything other than copious amounts of fear will keep the class war staved off--xenophobia, war, and culture changes surrounding the religious do the job nicely though. Pretty easy to summarize the sources of power.<p>I don't have much expectation that people will feel played, so looming but maybe not likely. Fox is famous for Fox New at the same time as Family Guy, The Simpsons, and American Dad, and hardly anybody pauses at that; quite a prominent mix of Right v Left right there by an ideologue like Rupert Murdoch.<p>The very wealthy purchasing power and profiteering on fear.

If you do switch you might either win money or lose money relative to what was in the envelope you chose first. Let's compare the possible gain to the possible loss (without worrying about the probability of having a gain or a loss):<p>1. The possible gain is equal to the possible loss.<p>Proof: The two envelopes contain x and 2x, so you'd gain x if switching from x to 2x, and you'd lose x if switching from 2x to x. The possible gain and the possible loss are both equal to x.<p>2. The possible win is larger than the possible loss.<p>Proof: Say the envelope you chose first has y. Then the other envelope has either y/2 or 2y. So if you gain money by switching you gain 2y - y = y, but if you lose in the switch, you lose y - y/2 = y/2. Clearly y > y/2.<p>This version kept up at night for days when I first read it. I never figured it out --not that I had any chance of doing so, given that Smullyan couldn't figure it out either--, I just got used to not understanding it...",1281146665.0
