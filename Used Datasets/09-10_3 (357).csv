You wouldn't use a user-entered mutable title field as an indexed unique key in a data schema.<p>FUSE is great but it abstracts the back end, not the interface. That's a seperate issue.<p>Platforms like J2ME with object persistence solve half the problem. Fast access to structured data is a breeze, but the user has no control.<p>All data is meaningful to the user at some level, even if it's as shallow as ""Settings for the Blah app"" or ""The entire Blah app"". If an object persistence platform forced all data to be wrapped in a user-meaningful container, which the user could manipulate atomically but not look inside, that would give you the best of both worlds. It would probably also encourage more modular and interoperable data design.",1263956388.0

Instead, we're trading the future earnings of US citizens for Chinese goods. That might have been ok when our debt was low and the goods were low-value, but now our debt is unsustainable and the goods are high technology which we invented and used to produce, but don't anymore.

The fact that they are encouraging AWS usage is remarkable for a few reasons. First, it's a testament to cloud computing's growing importance. Second, we're talking about a lot of human genetic data that may soon be traversing the network between various institutes and Amazon's servers, with all of the security and privacy consequences thereof.

But to achieve this growth the dictator needs help from the army or the police (any group of men with guns will do) and that comes in the form of letting them indulge in their own corruption. This leads to a national death spiral as the only way to get support for your corruptive endeavors is to let your subordinates pillage their subordinates. It is a toxic trifecta of mistrust/corruption/lack of institutions which leaves the country entirely dysfunctional.<p>It's a fascinating article. You should read it.,1263955951.0

33,1063889,comment,1063715.0,1063734.0,0,0,elecengin,,,"Not exactly - what is being described here are two exploits.<p>The first exploits the difficulty the market has in determining the ""NBBO"" - the National Best Bid/Best Offer. This is the best price for buying and selling the stock on all markets. This price is important because the market must route an order to the market with the NBBO if it does not have the best price (due to RegNMS). To find this price, the market's themselves must process the quotes from all the markets. This same process can be done by private companies, and sometimes they can calculate the NBBO faster, and leverage the fact that the market has not yet updated it's value.<p>The second exploit they describe is much simpler. It leverages the fact that if an algorithm can determine that an institution wants to buy a large quantity of a given stock, the price movement of that stock becomes more predictable. Therefore, VWAP and associated algorithms are falling out of favor by institutions since they are most easily predated. Now, many institutions buy access to custom boutique algorithms tailored to hide the large purchases and avoid predation.",1263955118.0

We plan on bringing in an external developer to take over a few 1 or 2 tasks that we feel would help free up our some of our time / attention for more of the domain specific things that make our startup unique.<p>Outsourcing / external development philosophy issues aside for the moment, I'm curious what strategies others use for minimizing risk in terms of access to our codebase. Maybe I'm paranoid but I would feel more comfortable delivering a semi-doctored repository which doesnt include things like api keys, user data etc until we are able to build a trusting relationship.<p>I dont think spending more than a few hours on such a solution is a good use of our time (we are young and fledling as I mentioned and I dont meant to exaggerate the value of our codebase / data). That said however, Im thinking of writing a script to do something like,<p>- clone our repository\n- strip out sensitive pieces of data (api keys)\n- remove the repository files (.git/) (on 2nd thought, I guess this is a double edged sword. Its safe b/c it prevents access to sensitive data but OTOH it makes the vcs merge case much more cumbersome)<p>So what strategies have you had luck with in this type of scenario?",1263953100.0
