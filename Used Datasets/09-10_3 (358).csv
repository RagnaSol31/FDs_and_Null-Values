It must be overriden for a particular class of objects.<p>The first part of your example is due to the conversion between primitives and objects for method calls.  It has little to do with prototypal inheritance.<p>Then, you override the method on an instance of String.  When you set toString to null, of course, the call to toString fails.<p>Lastly, you override it on the prototype of String, which will apply to all String objects.  Why is this an unexpected error?  toString is on the prototype, because it's defined on the class, not the instance.  I'm not sure what the confusion is here.",1333940285.0

This really hit me in the article: ""my choices of threaded Lisp implementations was limited to OpenMCL, and in FreeBSD it's CMUCL"".

Obviously, your QuickLisp package manager now helps find and install useful libraries: I used to install all dependencies into each of my Common Lisp projects, which I don't do anymore.<p>I also wonder if the Reddit team's decision might have been Clojure if Clojure had been mature when they developed Reddit.

Let's say hypothetically there's a business that needs $1m to start, the maximum revenue it can make is $50m/year of which $20m is profit. Why shouldn't they raise venture capital? The business would be providing a return for the investors because the business would be making money. Not every company needs to be making billions of dollars to exist.<p>VCs make their money by investing less in a company than their stake is/will be worth, if they invest $1m for 10% of the company and that company is then making $20m/year profit they have made a worthwhile investment... haven't they?",1333939665.0

The country is so polarized that people from different sides of the aisle won't agree on the color of the sky for fear that the other side will gain some partisan advantage.  The concrete issue here is that conservatives have many, many reasons for addressing the energy crisis, but they will not join any fight that requires them to admit the existence of human-caused global warming or admit the validity of any motives couched in environmental language.  Those two issues are the kiss of death for any nationwide cooperation on energy issues.<p>Not that there aren't troublemakers on the left as well.  Any talk of reducing dependence on other countries is liable to rile up people who think more and more interdependence is the cure to everything.  If we all drink from the same well, then nobody will poison it, right?  Right.  And how dare we treat other countries as scary and unreliable; how offensive is that?  If only we were more dependent on them, we would be forced to give up our xenophobia.  Discussing motives is a non-starter on either side of this cursed issue.<p>Hell, <i>willingness</i> to set aside that discussion won't be enough; it will take discipline and determination, because opportunistic blowhards will speculate about motives simply to derail any bipartisan cooperation.  ""Are you sure you want to collaborate with those people?  You don't share their kooky, immoral motives, do you?""  Energy efficiency has so much polarizing baggage, yet such a broad appeal for a variety of reasons, that setting justifications aside is like declaring a cease-fire.

Electricity is NOT going to be a major issue. We could go on with non-CO2 producing nuclear power plants for another 100 000 years with the amount of fissible material on Earth. The big issue is going to be ""how can we replace gas/fuel"" ? If I remember correctly, 70% of the oil is the US is used to power cars only. We can have natural gas combusting engines for a while, as a replacement, but what's after? Bio-Fuels won't work: you have to put more energy to produce them than what you get out of it. It has a negative yield. Wind power is not transportable. There's no way you can make a normal car move with solar panels. How about electric cars ? Well, it's going to be massively expensive, unpractical to recharge, and there's nothing indicating you can effectively use it to power heavy trucks needed for goods transportation.<p>Of course, the issue will not come up suddenly.

Prior to the computer revolution, someone describing your work as hacking would be insulting your work (and you).<p>Tron and WarGames brought ""hacking"" in the computer sense to the forefront, referring to gaining unauthorized access to computer systems.  It's not quite clear how it went from being paid more than you're worth to unauthorized entry of  a skilled nature, though I suppose ""hacking"" may go back to the physical act of hacking at a lock or a door through persistence.  Instead of pursuing a goal without the correct tools, now hacking implies pursuing a goal without the correct tools because no such tools exist; it now involves its own skill.<p>The scope of the term has expanded from unauthorized access to a system to unauthorized modifications to a system.  I think that expansion is fair.  Moving from unauthorized modifications to a system to making a new system or authorized modifications is where I think many of us draw the line.<p>If you have a neat idea but the source code and development environment are designed to help you implement that idea, it's not hacking.  If your idea requires changing things that somebody's lawyer thinks ought not be changed, then there's a case to call that hacking.<p>Dunno about its overuse in HN (haven't seen any examples) but the mainstream media and a few overly ambitious coders (and more so the noncoder people who hire them) are definitely misusing the term.  Words like ""jealous"" and ""decimate"" are also commonly misused but nobody notices.",1333937260.0

Lisp has many goodies that make programming in it a joy: the REPL, macros and the lack of syntax are some. I won't go into the details, but rest assured, it's cool. People become Lisp zealots for a reason.<p>I honestly don't understand this sentiment. For me it's nearly impossible to work in lisp and not think ""If only this were some other language..."" The <i>baseline functionality</i> I'm used to from other languages, like even type checking, is absent. It's like writing in assembly just for the degree of control you have as compared to managed code. I mean yeah writing something in assembly can be fun in its own way, but the result will almost certainly be awful, and you'll solve problems that have built-in solutions in other languages.",1333937239.0

However, at some stage the Sushi-chef recommended it to me free of charge since it was season and he wanted to offer me a special treat. Since I liked the taste I regularly add uni to my order.
