Parts of it he contracted out, and the contractors handled the permits.  Other parts he did himself, and so had to file for his permits in person.  It went something like this:<p>Homeowner: ""I'd like a permit to build a garage.""<p>County Clerk: ""Your contractor will handle the permits for you.""<p>Homeowner: ""I'm going to build it myself.""<p>County Clerk: ""Why would you do something so selfish?  Don't you want to create jobs for hard-working locals by hiring a contractor?""<p>""Hard-working locals"" being a euphemism for ""My friends and relatives.""  The parts that were handled by contractors sailed through inspections.  The parts he did himself, he had to wait months for a county inspector to come out and in some cases was repeatedly failed for bogus reasons.  Nobody ever wanted a direct bribe, they just wanted him to pay their friends/family for services he didn't need.",1301713059.0

There are various kinds of teaching situations (college, private school, inner-city public school) and various kinds of CEO situations.  Apples and oranges.<p>The psychological burden of teaching can be pretty intense.  Depending on your situation you may have to deal with:  unsupportive parents/administration, paying for school supplies out of your own small paycheck, noticing and reporting child abuse, dealing with the issues of your pregnant ninth graders, dealing with violence toward yourself and other students (including gun violence and gang violence), etc. all while you are trying to inspire in your students an appreciation for cosines.",1301713029.0

19,2398946,comment,2398782.0,2398782.0,21,0,JoshTriplett,,,"This change (making bribes legal for the payer, just not the payee) seems highly sensible.  Right now, if an official demands a bribe for something you have a right to in the first place, you can attempt to report them, but meanwhile you have to do without, with the associated cost to you.  With this change, you can still report the person demanding the bribe, but in the meantime you can choose whether it would cost you less to go ahead and pay the bribe (and hope to get it back later) than to do without whatever you'd needed in the first place.<p>This won't help in all cases, though: as I understand it, some countries (including the US) have laws against paying bribes in other countries, even when such a prohibition effectively prevents doing business in those countries.",1301712507.0
20,2398945,comment,2395883.0,2397761.0,3,0,xiaoma,,,"As I said, making it more competitive to become a public teacher would be a good idea.  I had almost forgotten about how many elementary school teachers in the US dislike or even struggle with basic mathematics until reading your link, but that's definitely a big issue.  I don't think I ever encountered the craziness of using animals or fruits to represent tens or hundreds as mentioned in Dr. Ma's book, but it's no surprise to hear it.<p>I know this isn't going to be a popular view, but some major problems in US schools are caused by an obsession with small class sizes.  From everything I've seen, I'd say that the importance of small classes is dwarfed by that of having a good teacher.  The smaller the classes are, the more teachers you need and the less selective you can be about them.  I think this is one of the primary reasons the US (and just about every western country) spends so much more money per student than say Singapore and gets little to show for it.<p>In general, I like the system of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore for earlier schooling.  On the flip side, their weakness is college.  What works well for giving everyone a basic grasp on fundamental skills doesn't work so well when they need to become self-directed learners.  A lot of the current discussion is on increasing the focus on creativity and student autonomy, but there's a long, long way to go.  The other huge problem is that after entering a school it's almost impossible to fail out of it and students not planning on grad school often just coast.<p>But tokenadult, you must have already known all that!  In your earlier comments, haven't you said you've spent a huge chunk of your life in Taiwan, learned to read Chinese well and already critiqued children's teaching materials there?",1301712410.0

The battleground is content. Sure there's plenty of spam and scams, but people love craiglist listings because there is so much unique content.<p>One major contributor to craiglist becoming so successful as a website is essentially the ease of posting content.  That lead to lots of content and not coincidentally lots of traffic, but it also means that much of the data is unstructured.  Creating more intelligent ways to interact with data requires some structure, but the easiest way to structure data is to complicate the listing creation process.  When someone figures out a great balance and has enough search traffic to keep listers coming back, craigslist will have a real competitor.",1301710744.0

I tried when I turned down a government contractor for a position maintaining a couple servers for a position where I would be responsible for a few hundred for a lot less. They just pushed the money and got offended not understanding I needed the challenge and learning experiences. I left the situation feeling a little guilty and then just figured out you need to do what's right for you and not get into explaining it to people who won't even remember you in a few months.,1301709822.0

In the arthouse-film world, Super 8 filmmakers can normally choose between 18 fps and 24 fps, and don't have the same baggage Hollywood does in which only one of those ""looks right"": both 18-fps and 24-fps films are accepted by audiences as legitimate. Yet some directors choose one, some choose the other, and some directors switch depending on the film, because 18-fps and 24-fps shooting produce different stylistic effects.",1301709639.0

Skins has been technically excellent since its onset, I even got my wife (Canadian) watching it. Shameless is another example. Even shows like Hollyoaks (if it's still on) are technically great, I actually thought their quality of shooting (the clearness of camera positioning, etc.) was better than shows like 24 were managing and it's a rolling-production with 1 week to film an episode and 3 episodes airing a week.<p>I'm talking, look at the first episode of Primeval. It was atrocious across the board from acting to directing and 3D graphics; especially for reaching an audience of ~6.8 million. Compare that to the outstanding production qualities of Stargate Universe that only got ~2.3 million in a 5x bigger market.<p>My example are shows like the Canadian Flashpoint, which despite a decent budget and getting 1 million viewers can just be awful. The stories often have little reasoning behind them (shit literally just happens), the direction can often be gaudy by trying to make grand shots and just utterly failing. It often feels cold, like they're not using close-ups right. I often find this in many British shows too, comedies and traditional dramas not so much, but especially a lot of the police shows can be awful.",1301709637.0
