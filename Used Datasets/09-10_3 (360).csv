I mean, it's not like any of these conditions are new or somehow they're being made up. There are a series of things -- each of which has to be necessary and sufficient -- in order for the argument to take drastic action to hold water. This has always been the case, and this will always be the case. This is the nature of convincing anybody that drastic action must be taken -- about anything.<p>We just choose to talk about one goalpost or the other. It's not like people are making up extra requirements of proof simply to make it harder on the other side. The only reason folks talk about each of these goalposts one at a time is just to make the conversation easier on everybody.<p>So yes, if you get through the ""man can change the environment"" hoop, which I believe, you have about a dozen other hoops to jump through, some of which I find much less plausible than others, before you get to the ""we must do something now!""

Doe and Moffit (the two main campus libraries) were shut down, students created do not cross lines, and a bunch of idiots pulled the fire alarm in all the big buildings.  Berkeley students with technical majors who were too busy working to protest had to evacuate buildings because protesters kept pulling fire alarms.<p>If you walked through Barrows or Dwinelle (humanities buildings) they were empty. Conversely, if you took a stroll through Soda or Cory (CS and EE respectively) they were packed with students finishing final projects.<p>I once had a professor who stated that no matter what, Californians will always vote for less taxes and more services, which is exactly what is going on now. I don't understand how they can chant ""End Budget Cuts, Don't Raise our Fees!"" in the same sentence without the cognitive dissonance making itself blindingly obvious.<p>I took a stroll to see the actual protest today. It was a bunch of kids who wanted to feel like they were part of something; a large group of people who wanted to scream and cheer as if this was a football game. Students were trying to shout over each other to lead cheers to get their own little slice of revolution. In the end, they presented no solutions besides ""Cut Executive Pay"" and have contributed nothing to either cause they were fighting for.",1258771921.0

Just be glad the UC system hasn't instituted the mandatory furloughs that the CSU system has, effectively shortening each semester by more than a week.
