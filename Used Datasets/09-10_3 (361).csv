I hope that the potential and actual startups/businesses on this site don't have this attitude. If this was the prevailing attitude then to say the economy would 'suffer' would be an understatement. Whether an MBA improves or signifies ability is another matter entirely.",1261105183

But, what's not bullshit?  A good MBA program is an amalgam of fundamental concepts in economics, sociology, mathematics (at least stats), and such.  Six Sigma might be analyzed, but it's not presented as a fundamental truth or even a profound idea.<p>Let's take a specific example:  the concept of ""agency costs"".  An economist defines these to be the inefficiencies resulting from one's agents (those doing work for him, and those doing work for those agents, etc.) having different incentives than himself.  MBA program include agency costs as one of many economic concepts discussed.<p>A friend with a Harvard MBA was selling his house while living in another city.  He noted that the traditional real estate agent's ""6/4"" commission structure (6% of the first 100K and 4% thereafter) causes a rational agent to sell as many homes as possible without regard to the actual selling prices.  Why bother seeking out a buyer willing to pay $20K more when you only get $800 of that?  It would be easier to seek out an additional seller instead.  An agent incentivized with this structure likely would not act in his best interests.<p>So, my friend persuaded an agent to accept a very different plan:  2% up to the price he felt he could get by putting out a FSBO sign in the front yard and 10% thereafter.  With this, the agent could earn significantly more by working to find a high-paying buyer.  The house ended up selling for a little more than the ""FSBO sign"" price, so he at least saved on commission.<p>Those here without MBAs might also think in this way -- much as those without CS degrees might also understand algorithmic complexity.  It's not that the content of a top MBA program can't be learned through self study in the same way that good developers are sometimes self taught.  But, to suggest that the fundamental content of an MBA program is ""bullshit"" ignores what is valuable.<p>Perhaps we are most aware of frat-boy MBAs' self-important yapping, but the fundamental concepts of these programs are generally sound.  I have an MBA from a less-than-Harvard program and have found what I learned there to be of benefit.  And, I consider myself pretty much bullshit free.",1261105138

The reason that encryption techniques protecting DVDs and games fail is that the thing doing the decrypting is the thing that the enemy possesses: the game machine or dvd player.  The machine has to have the decryption key in it somewhere, thus the whole stack of cards is a sham.<p>This is totally the opposite.  The drones need only have the capacity to encrypt their video and decrypt command/control information from the host.<p>Both drone and host are unique devices that could (given their incredible pricetag) easily have unique public/private key pairs for each drone and each control station.  Before takeoff each could be paired by an exchange of fresh keys.

Nobody is saying the GPA doesn't measure something, the question is whether or not it measures something relevant to the hiring decisions of your shop. From what I've seen, there is actually a negative correlation between grade and employability.</i><p>Sigh. I could try to convince you that your personal observations are not representative, and you could probably tell me the same thing, and we would end up yelling past one another. We could both scream for data, and probably disregard the data that doesn't back our viewpoint and continue yelling past one another.<p>The problem is that we both have a vested interest in believing what we do. You've already admitted that you have a GPA that probably would not satisfy most hard-line GPA targets. I'll admit up-front that my GPA likely <i>would</i> satisfy most company's targets; this means I already lose a gold star.<p>This is a shame. I have not drawn any conclusions just from your self-confessed low GPA, but you have already prepared to consider me irredeemable. I'd probably ask some probing questions, realize that you've been bloody busy outside of classwork, and not think too much of it. This strategy could work both ways, for what it is worth.<p>I could just decide that if I were rejected at a company where you were vetting me, I am perhaps better off not being there. If I were hired, I'd have to deal with the chip on your shoulder about how I have already shown I can't hack because of some single arbitrary metric. But that would be out of the spirit of this site, and would assume things that probably aren't true about the users. So, instead, I'm going to try to provide a counter-argument.<p>Here's what I can say in my defense: I got that GPA without really giving a damn about my GPA. I found the topics I was working on fascinating enough without the motivation of grades, and got good enough at them that I was able to perform well on tests and assignments anyway. I guess I could've gone farther and just not done the assignments and skipped the tests, but requiring that much disinterest seems petty.<p>I wasn't trying to prove myself to anyone. And I still found time to play with things and hack on things of my own outside of the classroom. The only big strike against me, perhaps, is that I didn't get involved at all in open source until later on; I never published most of the things I was tinkering with in college. It doesn't mean I wasn't tinkering though, just that I wasn't public about it.<p>On top of that, I had an entire network of machines in my dorm room that the administration would've thrown a fit about had they known; I can only imagine what the power bill looked like. Having this taught me a bunch of things a networking theory class never would.<p>On the other hand, my networking theory class allowed me to make connections from experience to theory that made a whole lot of other things become obvious almost as soon as I was exposed to them. I drag this quote out from Deming all the time, because I think it is the best argument for not just focusing on the immediately practical: ""Experience by itself teaches nothing... Without theory, experience has no meaning. Without theory, one has no questions to ask. Hence, without theory, there is no learning."" FWIW, I haven't stopped learning just because I left college; to be honest, I think I would go stir-crazy if I did.<p>Hopefully, what I've written above makes some sense. Unfortunately, I've been shot by your generalization, and would not have been able to explain any of this had you said this in a group where you also controlled admissions. I think hard grade cutoffs in both directions suck, because they make a universal predictor from a weak indicator of arbitrary performance through unknown motivations.<p>Please, for me, and those like me who arrived where we are without the motivation of sucking up to our superiors and fitting the mold, don't be so hasty at nailing us to the wall. You'll just end up cultivating bitterness, and groups of people who don't want to work with one another based on something completely arbitrary.",1261104192

This problem  is an indication that *Writable classes are poorly designed. Instead of having public constructors, they should each have some sort of static method, akin to that of a factory class, that implements some sort of intelligent pooling and reuse.<p>Also, NullWritable is awesome!

53,1002411,comment,1002309.0,1002309.0,0,0,ig1,,,"This article is bullshit. It's premised on a single piece of evidence: the decline of jobs for MBAs. Holding the decline of jobs in a recession as a sign a qualification is worthless is ridiculous. The demand for engineers has gone down as well, does that mean engineering qualifications are worthless ?<p>Following the same logic if the demand for MBA graduates went up then it would make sense to argue that MBAs are valuable. So if we look at the early 2000s where this was true was Lucy Kellaway writing articles calling out the merits of MBAs ? - well no, it turns out Lucy Kellaway has been writing articles slagging off MBAs since the 90s.<p>Ms Kellaway is just using the recession to ride her hobby-horse.<p>We shouldn't be any less critical when reading articles that support our personal opinions than those that oppose them.",1261101817

There are plenty of other more believable things for them to be repelled by. Are they only talking to women who choose their profession based on whether or not they want to meet their future husband in the workplace (i.e. ""I won't find a suitable husband among energy drink consumers"")?<p>I find it hard to believe that 'energy drinks' are associated with 'being a geek.' I've certainly never seen anyone that was considered as 'geek' drinking a Red Bull + Vodka mix, but they are wildly popular in areas. I've certainly never seen any energy drink marketed to geeks in advertisements either.<p>> <i>That aside, in my experience I see two mostly-exclusive classes of ""geek"": people who are much more fascinated with producing technology and people who are much more interested in consuming it.</i><p>I know plenty of people that do both. My friend/co-worker bought himself a 30"" monitor for his work desk (with his own money) just because he was annoyed at only having 2 20"" monitors at work (his home setup is 3 screens). He's happy now because he can fit multiple Gvim windows on the screen at a 'usable size.' Yet he has all the latest gadgets (Kindle, iPhone3G, etc). [edit: I should make it more clear that he is a 'builder-type' person that has no love of meetings and would rather 'get the job done.' I really don't think that he falls into the 'people that are more interested in consuming it' category.]<p>I don't see how those two groups are mutually exclusive.",1261101781

If you can begin correlating data points with enough outside information you will be able to extract at least a shadow of the original information.,1261101606
