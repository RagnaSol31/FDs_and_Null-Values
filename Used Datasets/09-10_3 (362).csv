Most people I've known in technical majors have as broad an education as any liberal-arts major I know. I personally feel that even in the absence of breadth requirements (which at my university are non-trivial), most of my classmates would be as well-educated as they are now, simply because they have the ability to read and absorb information.<p>Students who go to college and get a liberal-arts education often don't retain their major-specific knowledge once they move into the job market and into a role that has nothing to do with what they studied. What they are supposed to retain though, is learning- and critical-thinking skills that make them better at various jobs than someone who did not go to college at all. And that same learning- and critical-thinking ability is something technical majors also develop quite well - hence I don't see a liberal arts education as having a monopoly on developing 'generalists' or really providing any advantage in that regard.<p>Naturally this is also a problem of efficient allocation. I think there is value in the knowledge produced by every field - however we require different levels of supply for different skills/knowledge - and I would further argue that this variation in demand for skills has always existed throughout human history. Since society is both funding education and creating this demand, it makes sense to me that we meet that demand partly by creating the correct supply of variously-educated citizens.",1322189949.0

I'm not sure I buy into it.<p>It may conceivably devalue the degree itself by making it less uncommon, but skills likely lose value at a much lower rate. There are also network effects - the pace of modern science and engineering goes almost entirely on the fact that we have a great many people working at once and sharing results.<p>There's also nothing to stop you from studying engineering then getting a job which uses a completely different skill set. A liberal arts degree is not a career training program in most cases. Opportunity cost is one big reason why this is less acceptable than it could be. However, it may be that different program models make different revenue models more viable, driving down the opportunity cost.<p>Of course, none of this addresses the quality problem.

But many of the others probably don't and they actually think that by voting for a bill like SOPA they are doing a good thing overall, and they are actually saving people's jobs (once they fall for MPAA's whole propaganda), and don't even take into consideration that by ""protecting"" those jobs, they could be destroying a lot more, not just economy-wise, but liberty wise, too, simply by voting for a bill like SOPA, which was of course mainly written by MPAA/RIAA themselves.<p>This is why I cringed when I watched the CNN GOP debate the other night and some of them were basically saying they would listen to the ""experts"" or ""advisors"" and go with whatever they are proposing. This is how we keep passing laws like these.

Blended business models rarely work.<p>My guess is that something similar will eventually happen in education.  Some institutions will specialize in getting you a paycheck and others will specialize in broader education.<p>I view purely academic coursework in the same category as other luxury goods: it's something some people find fun and exciting and if they want to pay for it, so be it, but society should not foot the bill.<p>Whereas practical ""get a job"" coursework I view as something that just about everybody needs and maybe there's a good argument for public subsidies or other policies that encourage it.",1322187585.0

But as it is way too many people major in liberal arts and other impractical subjects.  Lib arts should be a highly selective group, limited to scholarship recipients and any rich kid whose family has the money.<p>Treating all majors the same really hurts kids who come from working class backgrounds and might not know how society really works.  Rarely will you be rewarded for learning for learning's sake.  Major in engineering, accounting, nursing, etc.  Then your future is pretty solid.
