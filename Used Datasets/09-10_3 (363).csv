So I think something is missed if my experience is entirely chalked up to ignorance.<p>My post was written fairly quickly and got more attention than I expected.  Looking at it again and looking at Turbinado's code, I can see how you could suggest that I don't understand monads.  And I probably don't understand them to your level, but the code reflects the result of trying to compose together a number of libraries into a sensible system.  Wrapping those libraries in composed monad transformers was vastly more complicated than just dropping down to the IO monad, so I stripped down...<p>w.r.t monads: they're lovely for constraining code behavior and for building DSLs, so other languages have added monad libraries.  They haven't forced the entire language to live within monads...<p>w.r.t incremental data structures: I mentioned in my post that I wasn't happy with multiple data types.  Multiple constructors sound even less productive.  Currying is a solid suggestion.<p>- Alson",1268535594.0

Now the project is complete and we've gotten deals with several companies to build software for them. Though the deals aren't necessarily big, we get by day to day expenses and operations from the income from that.<p>My problem right now is, we've build several applications but we don't have a product at all. Our operations right now is really all about developing customized applications for small to medium companies. We oftentimes accept projects at a really low price in hopes to gain customers and connections. This has been happening for the past several months.<p>We have some ideas but we haven't got the time to implement them due to several ongoing application development projects with clients.<p>Our plan is to reject all incoming projects so we could focus on our ideas.<p>What advice would you give me?",1268535406.0

In most cases, the brakes are plenty capable of stopping the vehicle at full throttle (the exception was a 540-hp Roush Stage 3 Mustang travelling at 100 mph with the throttle locked -- in that case, the breaking distance was tripled to a total of ~900 feet).<p><a href=""http://www.caranddriver.com/features/09q4/how_to_deal_with_unintended_acceleration-tech_dept"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.caranddriver.com/features/09q4/how_to_deal_with_u...</a><p>One of the interesting points in the article was that the Toyota Camry -- with throttle forced wide open -- stops in a shorter distance than a Ford Taurus without any issues.<p>On the other hand, the article also points out that at 100 mph, it wouldn't have been immediately obvious that the breaks were working, even though they were (though at 70, you would have felt an immediate effect).",1268535265.0

His investments include Intel, Intuit, EA, Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems, Cypress Semiconductor and even Facebook. Yet, he's so humble in person you would not have guessed how influential he is. Here are some of my favorites:<p>In an era of commercialism and rampant greed, you need to be reminded about the powers of idealism, community, diversity and self-respect.<p>1. Begin with an end in mind. Know where you are going to understand where you are now.<p>2. Accept responsibility for yourself. Put the monkey on your back. Obstacles to success are usually not external.<p>3. Embrace the unknown and distrust the known.<p>4. Understand then be understood. Listen to how others see things. Try to put yourself in the other person's shoes.<p>5. Focus on implementation. Organize and act around priorities.<p>6. Make commitments and live up to them. Do what you say you are going to do.<p>7. Never ask people to do something you would not do.<p>8. Continue to learn. ""It's what you learn after you know it all that really counts."" John Wooden<p>9. Obey the absolutes of right and wrong. Adhere to your principles even when it hurts to do so.<p>10. Develop some humility. Most entrepreneurs are long on ego and need more humility.<p>11. Don't take yourself too seriously. Learn to laugh at yourself.<p>12. Focus on the glass being half full and not half empty.<p>13. Play to win. Do not fear failure. Fear of failure is often worse than inertia. Take risks and embrace failure. There is no disgrace in failure if you have acted in a fair and honest manner.<p>14. Be aware of the shadow you cast.\na. Avoid the total focus on what is good for me.\nb. Look at how your actions affect others.\nc. Put your ego in place so people can communicate with you.\nd. Show your commitment to your people and their importance to your organization. Create a sense of belonging.\ne. Be genuine and natural with people and be honest and consistent in dealing with them.<p>15 Finally, get your priorities straight:\na. Family is ",

Trying to stay positive is good for your mental health. Never complaining, not so much. Completely hiding your feelings is bad for one of the most important things in life: Making a true and honest connection with other people.<p><i>Give honest and sincere appreciation. </i>\nOr to put in a more general way, seek honesty and communication.<p><i>Arouse in the other person an eager want. </i>\nAha! This must be the secret to influencing, but.. uhm... how do you do that exactly?<p><i>Become genuinely interested in other people. </i>\nSure, again seek genuinely human connections, that's a good thing.<p><i>Smile. </i>\n:)<p><i>Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. </i>\nNot for me, you can call me anything as long as you're good to me. A great old guy completely screwed up my name once, to the point of calling me a completely different name. \nBy the time I realized he was NOT talking to someone else, it was in front of company and I didn't want to embarrass the old man. He kept calling a name which was 100% not my name, but he was a great guy! I like that guy a lot. So yeah, what ever. It's not about the name, it's about showing you care about someone, the name's just a small part of that.<p><i>Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. </i>\nIn other words, interrupting people is rude, and talking too much is also kind of a dick move.<p><i>Talk in terms of the other person's interests.</i>\nCommunicating with others is honestly hard, it really is.\nOne ""trick"" you can use is try and frame things in a way the other person can understand, use metaphors invoking things they like etc. As you communicate with someone the understanding between you and them will grow and you can communicate more with less effort.<p><i>Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.</i>\nOh I bet that's another secret, and how do you exactly and sincerely make people feel important? All I can guess is listening and communicating without treating them a like an inferior.<p><i>The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.</i>\nSure don't be that guy that looooves arguments. Unless you're having dinner with Brits, arguments are just damn good fun, it's bad if you can't hold your own!\nAnd some, in fact often the most important arguments can NOT be avoided. In fact, a pathological avoidance of arguments will in the long term NOT make you popular.\nThe above rule can be put more simply as: ""Don't be a dick.""<p><i>Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, ""You're wrong""</i>\nDon't be a dick.<p><i>If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.</i>\nBe honest, communicate, don't be afraid of failure or embarrassment.<p><i>Begin in a friendly way.</i>\nDon't be a dick.<p><i>Get the other person saying ""yes, yes"" immediately.</i>\nAnd how do you do that exactly? Do you open with: Is the sun bright or what?<p><i>Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.</i>\nDon't be a dick.<p><i>Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.</i>\nOr maybe you should seek agreement, and try and make them see things your way and tell them how their way of thinking inspired yours, and don't be a manipulative sociopath.<p><i>Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.</i>\nDon't be a dick. Be honest, communicate... I feel like I'm repeating myself.<p><i>Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires. </i>\nI am repeating myself.<p><i>Appeal to the nobler motives.</i>\nYes appeal to things which are good and legal, not damaging and/or illegal things.<p><i>Dramatize your ideas.</i>\nCommunicating with other is really hard. You can't just dump a succinct thought in your head and expect everyone else to get it.<p><i>Throw down a challenge.</i>\nOr offer something that's fun. Just don't bring people down and don't be a dick.<p><i>Begin with praise and honest appreciation.</i>\nPositivity, honest communication, etc.<p><i>Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.</i>\nDon't be a dick, but do be honest and sincere. Don't be an obtuse prick, people do appreciate honest communication.<p><i>Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.</i>\nDon't be a dick.<p><i>Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.</i>\nUse the Socratic method of teaching. If you can that is. That shit ain't easy!<p><i>Let the other person save face.</i>\nDon't be a dick, and try not to embarrass people.<p><i>Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be ""hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.</i>\nYou might not want to ""make it rain"" with cash, but verbal recognition cost you nothing so the ROI is like infinite.<p><i>Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.</i>\nYes, when most people think you don't think much of them, they'll meet your expectations.<p><i>Use encouragement.</i>\nDidn't we just talk about that? \n<i>Make the fault seem easy to correct.</i>\nDon't be a dick, be honest but positive and don't embarrass people.<p><i>Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.</i>\nThe best you can do is invest a lot of effort into honest communication and making the other person feel respected and that you think of them highly. And then try to tell them why what you suggest is important to you and try to communicate your ideas as best as you can, dramatically, with things they are interested in, etc.<p>And if that's not enough, you're screwed. But maybe they'll still do it. Just don't be a dick or a sociopath.<p>Now recently I by accident (pointless small talk before a meeting) found out my manager and I share a common interest.\nWe've been talking about it often because we enjoy talking about it.<p>And recently I also mentioned I wished one of the projects I'm on had him as a manager, but I was also happy he was happy not be part of that cluster fuck.<p>Yet I've never red ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" and I haven't seen this website before today.<p>All I try to do is:<p>1.

They even won't engage a lower gear until your speed is low enough so the engine doesn't over-rev.  Even virtually all manual transmissions have interlocks preventing an accidental shift into reverse (though this is a very difficult mistake on a 6-speed).,1268533153.0

I was really scared that I would shift into reverse and harm my car. Finally decided to pay heed to my fears and didn't do it until after I had tested just how much pressure it takes to do the switch while standing still with my feet on the brakes.<p>I don't mean this to say that I defend Mr. Sikes, but the fact that reverse is just one up from neutral is kind of scary. Just how careful would you have to be to avoid doing the shift?  Is there a check in the system that prohibits shifting to reverse if the car is moving forwards?",1268532601.0
