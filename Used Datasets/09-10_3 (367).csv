Those are all personal choices and I don't have a problem with those people suffering the consequences in exchange for what I perceive to be the greater good: that a motivated kid from middle or lower income family (such as I was) is able to attend MIT, thrive there, and as a result go on to have a substantially more fulfilling life. Oh and by the way, as part of that life, you'll have to pay back that money that someone fronted you when you were penniless, unemployable outside a mall context, no credit history, no significant employment history, etc.<p>Taking that opportunity away from all such kids, in exchange for having no one be able to make a poor choice specifically around student loans, is not a good trade, IMO.",1266545007.0
