10,1323382,comment,1323064.0,1323064.0,0,0,pw0ncakes,,,"Strong static typing is great. You can cut your runtime bug count by 70-80% easily if you know what you're doing, which provides an enormous increase in productivity. Also, type discipline seems to lead naturally to better architecture. You have to build your data structures and functions from the ground up, which tends to kill a lot of the sloppy thinking and nonexistent architecture that you sometimes see in the dynamically-typed world (although this can't be blamed on the languages, because a lot of users of such languages write great code).<p>Dynamic typing wins on prototypes and small projects, but for a project of more than 2000 lines, I'd be hard-pressed to see a case where dynamic typing wins.<p>Of course, I'll add the caveat that <i>good</i> dynamic typing is essential. Most people think dynamic pwns static because they're most familiar with Java and Python, but Java has shitty static typing (you have to declare types, and moreover end up needing to subvert the type system to do anything interesting) whereas ML and Haskell have awesome type systems.",1273114554.0

In order to know that, they pretty much have to implement the whole thing and see. And, if they find things that are poor performing (i.e. its primitives do not line up with DirectX's primitives), they're going to push for changes to the spec to make it efficiently implementable. But, those change proposals are likely to fought by the other browser makers.<p>Also, I believe Adobe is likely to ask for changes to the <canvas> specification too.<p>Plus, <canvas> is not that important if you have a high performance SVG implementation.<p>Finally, <canvas> creates a situation where animated advertising cannot be easily distinguished from other content and cannot be separately blocked from other, useful, Javascript on the page.<p>So, I think there's more uncertainty regarding the <canvas> specification than people might expect.

The Unified ideograms are four words wide, but the non-unified extensions are larger, iirc. And while disk space is hardly a problem anymore, you might see why programmers from 10 years ago may have made different choices.<p>> But it still seems to me that extending Unicode to also include those variatons of characters is a better and more clean solution than these workarounds.<p>I certainly can't argue with that. But Unicode is a standard, and real problems don't have time to wait around for standards bodies. In the eyes of many East Asian organizations, Unicode is broken now, and so the burden falls on the programmer.<p>Even here in the US, there are tons of data sitting around in tables encoded in Windows-1251 and ISO-8859-1. Having had to deal with UTF-8 and Latin-1 mismatches in the past, I don't find ruby1.9's encoding all that onerous myself.",1273112430.0

I know people at MS as well, and most of them prefer to live outside the city where they pay a sane amount for a nice house instead of a cramped apartment, and lower crime rates. My experience is that it is only the young 20 somethings that want a vibrant nightlife that prefer the city.<p>Putting the company downtown will effectively force everyone to go through the I-90 or 520 bridge which suffer from massive traffic or live in the city. City life is not for everyone.<p>And about the exercising, there's much less to be done downtown unless you like doing everything indoors. Walking around the street isn't very entertaining unless you are shopping or eating at restaurants. You could take the time you save from not having to commute to seattle and use it to exercise.
