Blackstone in his Commentaries alluded to this right to rebel as the natural right of resistance and self preservation, to be used only as a last resort, exercisable when &quot;the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression&quot;.[71] Some believe that the framers of the Bill of Rights sought to balance not just political power, but also military power, between the people, the states and the nation,[72] as Alexander Hamilton explained in 1788:<p>[I]f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude[,] that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.[72][73]<p>=======<p>If you accept above interpretation, why don&",
