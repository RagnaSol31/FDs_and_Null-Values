Wide reach is important to a marketer who helps their company by making an impact on sales but a developer doesn't care about reach because ... why?<p>As a sole developer, you require not only the technical knowledge to complete the initial job of writing the software that attracts the traffic to generate revenue, but you also must rely on yourself to place and promote it adequately to have significant returns enough to cover both investments of time and energy.<p>""80 apps"" is great news for a developer if a good percentage of them are yours, serving your ads. Otherwise, its at best 1/80th of a chance they are running your ads, but probably worse as each app is not created equal. If yours is a ""killer app"" that is use most often, its more than likely not ad-driven unless a guy likes playing iChess on the shitter.<p>All of the data you provided is great - but none of it ties to money paid. 10.2 billion ad requests means dick if there wasn't any money exchanging hands. You said yourself there's no definitive evidence of people making a lot from mobile app advertising, so I'm not sure what point you were defending in the first place.",1277259392.0
