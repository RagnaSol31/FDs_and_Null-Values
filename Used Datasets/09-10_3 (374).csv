The asyncio library depends on some Python 3 features that other developers have implemented.  I believe there is some kind of 2.7 backport of asyncio.  No one is stopping development but the core Python team is not interested in releasing new versions of the 2.x line.<p>The gap has been getting smaller.  Python 3.5 will include %-style formatting for byte strings.  I helped implement that feature since I feel it will make porting code easier (plus it makes some programming tasks, like network protocols, easier).  The strict handling of bytes/unicode is what really trips up people from porting and there is just no good way to further smooth that path, IMHO.<p>I feel the upgrade path has been handled badly.  People were wildly optimistic about how fast people could port code and much more effort should have been spent on making the transition easier.  A little too much purity instead of practicality.
