1,2478177,comment,2477788.0,2478149.0,8,0,georgecmu,,,"My guess is that it doesn't assume anything about your motion model. The real question you should ask is what's the frequency of the positioning solution. Your generic GPS unit computes solutions at 1Hz, more sophisticated ones do it at 5Hz, surveyor quality units can do it at 10-20Hz depending on firmware, but I think they're pushing the limit and probably assume something about the motion model. Applanix and Novatel solutions that use inertial sensors definitely make pretty strong assumptions of the motion model (see Kalman filter).<p>OmniSTAR in particular and DGPS in general will operate under assumption that errors due to ionospheric and tropospheric effects change slowly in time and space. If this assumption is correct, then dynamics of the vehicle won't affect the corrections themselves.<p>My point with all this is that 99% of the corrected GPS solution should theoretically be within <i>x</i> cm of some point on the true path of the vehicle no matter how it moves in a plane. The question is, if you're interested in real-time solution, how far will the vehicle be from that point by the time you get this fix, and if you're interested in capturing vehicle's travel, how well will the curve fit through these points match the true vehicle path.",1303613941.0

I know this is hardware and software dependent ... but it's still common for it to be at least 20 seconds even on the best hardware, I think.   Apart from making apps that rely on GPS awkward (""please wait an indeterminate amount of time while we find your location"") it also means much greater power use because the GPS has to be active for longer (GPS seems to be something that noticeably uses a lot of power in my Nexus One).",1303613810.0

17,2478161,comment,2477855.0,2478062.0,1,0,Detrus,,,"But in practice, how many bad abstractions are there? From what I understand the Go team sees VMs as bad abstractions and they're ubiquitous.<p>The Go compiler can be fast, essentially as fast as a VM. Go can already run ~3x slower than C and they haven't put much effort into optimization. V8 is ~5x slower with a larger team working longer, 50,000 LOC compared to ~12,000 LOC of Go. To get the security of a VM they discourage the use of low level stuff by putting it into an unsafe package. This makes the binaries compatible with NativeClient, which actually checks for malicious programs. Go code can be sent as text and compiled quickly enough client side.<p>So they get many of the features of a VM while cutting down on complexity with some clever tradeoffs. The language is not for everyone's tastes, but their fundamental approach will surely lead somewhere.<p>In practice people make bad abstractions constantly and build huge legacy on top of them. Lately people have been trying to clean up the mess by starting from a pretty low level, like Go and Redis.",1303612855.0

They have very detailed information on their phone users, but they'll have to think through how they can monetize the information legally. Could we see these companies developing the ability to say, ""the user of the cell phone X, who is a 14 year-old girl, spent 2 hours in this store on this day"". That data on an aggregate basis could be very valuable to companies--companies that would be willing to pay for this kind of insight. ""We noticed a spike in teenage girls visiting your stores in the northeast within a day after launching your ad campaign. It didn't have as large of a spike in this region of the country however."" I think investors would be willing to buy this kind of information too. Imagine the edge a hedge fund would have if they had this sort of insight into consumer trends.<p>I suspect there will be a huge need for tools to analyze and make sense of the data that this new market will demand. I'm sure there are already some startups headed down this path, and I'm sure large communication companies would rather use a vendor for this data analysis than learn to do it themselves.<p>I think this is definitely the edge of a huge new market.",1303611491.0

So a single ELB can span EC2 instances in multiple zones within a region.  So I could have 4 EC2 instances in us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c, and us-east-1d, with an RDS instance in us-east-1a and a read replica in us-east-1b.  What happens when us-east-1a goes down and every big user in that AZ has failover mechanisms that start moving instances, EBS volumes, RDS databases, S3 buckets and who knows what else from us-east-1a to us-east-1b,c, and d?  Those AZ's get overloaded, API endpoints get slammed, and the whole region goes down in flames.  It didn't matter that these availability zones are hosted on separate infrastructures (from what I gather, the zones are separate datacenters in the same city with low latency connections between them, but separate power sources and backbone connections).  Meanwhile, all's quiet on the US-West front.<p>That's what got me thinking about failover across regions.",1303610691.0
