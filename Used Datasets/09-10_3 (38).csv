Saying someone cannot argue with capitalism because they benefit from it is just an ad hominem attack. No one in the modern age can live outside of capitalism therefore everyone becomes a part of it. The equivalent stance is ""feudalism should not end because you have benefited so much from feudalism which has given you your life so far and all you own"" if said while feudalism was the norm. Everyone on this planet is presently affected by the positives and negatives of global capitalism.<p>Feel free to argue the ideas of the protests or the point of the article, that some people are living in New York very cheaply.

11,3116484,comment,3114859.0,3116344.0,2,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"""You seem angry.""<p>The reply by tptacek discarded the point I was trying to make and claimed that I was just complaining because, according to an uninformed claim of tptacek, I was having trouble raising equity funding.  The goal of tptacek was to try to gain upper status via an insult.  That was a personal attack for no good reason, and I was angry at tptacek.  Otherwise, I'm not angry at VCs.<p>For PG's post, it seemed to be deliberately a bit far away from what VCs do.  It's frustrating to see such from the other side of the table.<p>""Traction isn't necessarily the same as revenue.""  Well, one form of 'traction' is a lot of users, and in some cases can have that long before any revenue.  Examples include the early months of YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.  So, they had a lot of 'unique eyeballs' per month, and the assumption was that there should be a way, somehow, to 'monitize' that.  Maybe.  Usually.<p>In my case, a lot of eyeballs mean a lot of Web pages served and, for my Web pages, a lot of ads displayed.  Then a lot of eyeballs mean a lot of revenue and, in my case, nearly all that revenue pre-tax earnings.  Or, yes, I thought of 'monitization' up front.  My most important Web pages have been carefully designed to have a banner ad of 720 x 90 pixels across the top and some number of ads 300 x 250 pixels down the right side.  So in my case, 'traction' and 'revenue' go together.<p>""PG's view of the world isn't a universal rule.""  Yes, that is a weak version of my main point.<p>Maybe some LPs have asked their GPs to fund only 'traction', but likely some VCs are still able to fund something off the back of a napkin if they really want to.  Even if they could, to me that's a bit moot:  VC funding or not, likely not, like anyone on Main Street, I still need to build a successful business.  At one time, a shot of VC funding could have helped my project a little.  But now I'm so close to going live that what VCs do is getting to be a bit irrelevant.  I'm still in touch with some VCs in case my personal funding runs out, but my guess is that it won't.  Lots of pizza shops get to earnings without VC funding, and my project should be able to, also.",1318736983.0

Having something that small makes it practically useless to have there. As a programmer, you might consider something like SlideDeck (slidedeck.com) to make a really nice presentation of your apps various screens.<p>- In your price break down, it seems that your main differentiator between plans is the number of teams someone can manage. You say each is ""designed for"" a different purpose, but don't indicate in any way how. If there are truly design differences, you should highlight them.<p>- If there are NO differences, here's an idea: Completely remove the plans and pricing. You offer the free plan to manage one team. Give EVERYONE that plan automatically (since you force users down this path anyyway). Don't mention price or anything. Leave indications in your control panel that they can add additional teams to manage. When they're ready to add them, prompt them for payment then. You'll likely see an increase in conversions because interested parties won't be swayed by potential future prices (even if they'll never hit it). Typically, if they want to add more teams, it means they're very happy with the features and are more likely (probably) to give you their cash.<p>- See if you find a way to progressively reveal your interface. Your signup asks for the typical details right up front. I'm certain you could let people poke around in your interface for a bit before asking them to save their progress and register a new account. This would even indirectly solve the problem of your tiny screenshot. :)<p>Hope this helps a bit.",1318736715.0

The general public doesn't get the same kind of place at the table, by far. But politicians are not embarrassed by that.

My parents, girlfriend, and brother were bit by endless amounts of spyware, spam, and trojans because they used windows.  I had to reinstall windows on my gf's laptop 3 times because adobe are useless worthless fuckwits who fill flash and pdf with security holes and her computer was repeatedly infected.  Every time I went to my parents house I had to clean endless amounts of crap off their computer.  My brother's laptop was infected with a virus that tried to get into bank accounts.  He owns a pair of pizza stores and does his accounting on his laptop, and he accesses bank accounts with significant funds in them.  Using ios fixed all the above.<p>While in theory it's nice that people can run any application they wish, in practice, it sucks.  People end up having to be experts on computer security.  As a group of computer professionals we've pounded on this for twenty years and it simply isn't fucking working.  If telling people to be careful what programs they run or what websites they visit worked, it would have worked long ago.<p>Instead, I give them ipads for casual browsing and they're finally secure.  My parents don't need my help to get pictures off their camera.  There finally is a way for non experts to securely use the internet and applications -- just buy stuff from the app store.  It won't spam you, it won't steal information, it won't install spyware, and it will most likely do what it claims to do.
