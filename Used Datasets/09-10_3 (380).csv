It's just that Best Buy only tends to sell the very lowest of the low-end stuff, but marks it up to high-end prices.<p>This is true of almost all retail stores, which is why I pretty much only shop online now.  The brick-and-mortar stores want to blame sales tax or too-low online prices for their woes, but the reality is that they only sell crap.  Most people do not want to buy crap, and don't.  As a result, the brick-and-mortar stores that only sell crap are not doing too well compared to the online stores that sell things people actually want to buy.<p>(Notice how Apple's retail stores do fine.  This is because they actually sell good products.)",1262746767

How to read corporate reports and papers; whatever the CFOs want you to see,.<p><i>The Secrets of Economic Indicators</i>, Bernard Baumohl. How to read the whole economy's report cards.<p><i>Hedges on Hedge Funds</i>, James Hedges. Exactly what you need to know before you hand over your money to a hedge fund.

Thus it's likewise difficult to advance the state of our art.<p>You try talking to most FPers about this stuff, and they get angry because you're telling them that Haskell is not the most optimal language for building a GUI.  Go look at XMonad, they say.  I'm sorry, but one damn example doesn't quite cut it.<p>You try talking to mainstream folks, and they always default back to the ""where are the big, successful functional programs?""  For christ's sake, when did the size of your codebase become something to be proud about?  Did you become a goddamn excel-spreadsheet manager or something?  The fact that all current systems are done in OO/imperative is not a good thing because quite frankly, most code SUCKS.  And you know it.<p>For myself, personally, I've found the purity and laziness of Haskell too useful to dispense with.  It's just <i>that</i> much better than other languages like OCaml because of the lazy bit.  So what do I advocate?  Leave the UI code to the imperative/OO languages, and do the backend in Haskell.  This wins no fans in either camp.<p>But the pure FP camp is the one that has something to prove, so we're the ones at a loss here.<p>I think we should try to build <i>part</i> of a good, stable system in something our language is good at.  In the real world, 80% is usually good enough, so lets get the 80% we're really darn good at (yes, I think <i>pure</i> FP is good at 80% of any task in any stack).  Things that exploit parallelism and/or correctness seem ripe for the picking.  Things like databases, or any sort of data processing.<p>Look at what the Erlang guys are doing with CouchDB.  Even a full blown web backend seems like fair game.  The problems I've had doing one have not been technical or related to Haskell.  They're psychological (i.e. student syndrome).

The article claims that the Piraha language lacks abstractions, including counting. Perhaps that could count as incompleteness, but I'm not so sure, and the article doesn't say enough to clear it up. Even if a person cannot use recursive linguistic forms, such as ""I saw the dog by the river"", they can say, ""I saw the dog. The dog is by the river"". Can they also say, ""Another dog came to the river""? Is that enough context, without tracking the precise count?<p>Another thought, just because they don't <i>care</i> about a historical fact, is the fact that the story can be told in the language enough for completeness? Even without precise numeric counts?<p>Does Turing completeness even make sense as a description for a natural language?",1262744238

A fund which is fully funded under a 6% return assumption which then takes a 20% hit to its assets due to a sudden market downturn then becomes underfunded, and the sponsoring entity is required to make catch-up contributions.  There is no difference between the public and private sectors in this regard.  However, as stated by the author, the pension beneficiaries of a public system have much more powerful tools to force their interests to come first in the event of underfunding than do private pension beneficiaries.<p>There have also been cases of manipulation of the actuarial numbers, including a case in New York or New Jersey (can't remember which) where the actuary doing the pension study was also a paid consultant for the public sector unions.  Not surprisingly, he concluded that significant benefit increases could be managed at the current funding level.",1262743749
