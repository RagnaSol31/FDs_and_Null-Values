7,2798494,comment,2797261.0,2798169.0,2,0,goodside,,,"The answers to the first two questions are related, and unfortunately complicated. I was <i>almost</i> referring to the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR), but I actually meant a slightly older event, the end of the inflationary epoch.<p>The inflationary epoch is rarely understood, but it's really so qualitatively different from everything that came after that it's worth referencing as a starting point for the Universe as we know it. Intuitively, you can think of the inflationary epoch as an extremely brief flash of time where things were so bizarre that nobody really has any firm idea what the hell happened. What we do know is that somehow the Universe expanded by a linear factor of <i>at least</i> 10^26 (it could actually be septillions of times higher; we just have a lower bound) within a tiny, tiny fraction of a second and then pretty much stopped.<p>Theoretical physicists mostly agree that the Big Bang happened a tiny fraction of a second before the inflationary epoch ended, but it's all speculation at that point. Pragmatically, it's very useful to call the end of this epoch the ""beginning"" of the Universe even if strictly speaking it started a few trillionths of a second earlier. Inflation was so fast that you can't really describe anything useful in terms of pre-inflationary distance. Everything that we could ever observe or care about in the Universe all emerged from some volume of space that was smaller than an atom until right before inflation stopped.<p>Why inflation stopped is very much beyond my understanding, but the metric expansion process that took over afterward, Hubble expansion, is negligibly slow by comparison. It's so slow that it's generally ignored in any context with time scales shorter than hundreds of millions of years. This is an important point for establishing what exactly we're talking about when we say the ""beginning of the Universe"". As far as the expansion of the Universe goes, the places that things were in 10 seconds after the Big Bang is more-or-less where they were the next day, and the next year, and the next millenium. Hubble expansion only matters over really big distances or really long times, like billions of years.<p>So, to finally answer your question, this is why I just said ""in transit since the start of the Universe"" without any other explanation. In practice, it doesn't matter whether you take it to mean ""10 seconds after the Big Bang"" or ""10,000 years after the Big Bang"", just so long as you're referring to distances that applied somewhere near the start. Most notably, the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation was emitted by an event that occurred only 300,000 years after the Big Bang, and there's good reason to think we're not likely to ever do better than that in terms of what radiation we can feasibly detect. This is why you hear it described as ""remnants of the Big Bang"", though really it was more directly caused by the formation of hydrogen 300K years later.<p>The 46 Glyr figure is admittedly ambiguous, and could refer to either of two things. The first is what's known as the <i>surface of last scattering</i>. This is what the CMBR is all about. The CMBR basically happened everywhere at once, and as you go further into the future the light that you're seeing from it came from somewhere that was further and further away at the time the CMBR was emitted. Right now, the light we're seeing from the CMBR came from points in space that are currently 45.7 Glyr away. (In cosmology, distances are almost always given in terms of present-day distance for consistency. This is called the ""co-moving"" distance if you want to be explicit, which alleviates confusion that might result from just calling it the ""current"" distance.)<p>The second thing the 46 Glyr could be is what I was actually referring to: the radius of Earth's <i>particle horizon</i>. This is the co-moving distance between us and the most distant point that would be reached if you emitted a light-speed signal from Earth's location right after the end of the inflationary epoch. This also coincides with the ""observable universe"", the portion of the Universe that was sufficiently close to us at the end of inflation that signals emitted from it could in principle reach us today. The two concepts are really equivalent, just with different frames of reference. This region has a boundary that's about 2% larger in diameter than the surface of last scattering. That extra 2% corresponds to the distance that radiation could have traversed theoretically (but not actually, due to plasma interference) during the 300,000 years that elapsed before the CMBR was emitted.<p>I don't have time to give a proper answer to your ""at rest"" question, but very tersely: The assumptions about simultaneity and privileged reference frames that get pulled out from under you by special relativity are actually pretty reliable in cosmology. You can, as a practical matter, be very sure whether or not your space ship is moving or not by looking at the stars around you. Most people are so caught up in the idea that the Earth is moving around the Sun and the Sun is moving around the Milky Way that they never bother to learn that the pattern doesn't actually go any further. The largest-scale structures of space are foam-like clusters of billions of galaxies, which become less distinct and more homogenous as you zoom out. Galaxies themselves do very little movement beyond drifting along with the metric expansion of the space time they're sitting in. Most ""peculiar movement"" is caused by gravitation within galaxies, not between them. This is quite literally what a galaxy is: It's a cluster of matter where gravity causes stars to have a peculiar velocity that cancels out the metric expansion of the space between them.<p>Further reading: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310808"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310808</a>",1311475990.0

But that would probably take ten years.

Add it in bit by bit and you can work out the actual implementation details, growing it from both the top and the bottom of the OS. And the end user gets the benefit of an ""imperfect"" but functional implementation of these ideas for the, I dunno, fifteen years it'll take you to core out the old OS while it's still running, and dump in some new chunks that do the Right Thing all the way down at the deepest levels.<p>I wish this guy the best of luck in building a functional OS from scratch that does the Right Thing.

I think Dell's keyboard quality has gone down since then.<p>These days, I tend to prefer good laptop keyboards.  I like the short throw; also, many of them have a more precise and consistent action than the mass produced detached keyboards.<p>I'm not familiar enough with the recent Apple keyboards, although I will complain about their (and others') laptop designs of recent years that place the keyboard at the back of a ""huge"" shelf of real estate often also having a sharp front edge.  (Those features bother my wrists no end, particularly when I don't have control over the height of the work surface.)<p>I've spent time on a variety of stuff going back to DEC terminals (and some yet older stuff I no longer recall).

I don't suppose its switches were all that ""de luxe"", but it was very smooth and I could really move on it without tiring.  And/or I was younger ;-) and spent enough time with it specifically to become rather accustomed to its feel.<p>As for Emacs, every time I start, I quickly tire of its key combination and the discomfort they cause me.  I suppose I should try one or another remapping, but I end up switching programs before I get that far.  Perhaps if I'd started with it when I was younger, I would have built up a requisite flexibility and muscle memory more rapidly than discomfort.<p>(As for obsession, I now find the screen and keyboard two of the most important features of a system.

About a year ago the futility of defining negative goals (""Don't smoke, don't waste time online"") became clear to me but I saw more to it than the notion that saying ""Don't X"" makes you think of X. I thought it also has to do with the fact that behaviors are in our lives because they serve a purpose, and removing certain behaviors without addressing the needs they filled leaves ya unbalanced. Going on walks, like you linked from the article, really works for me.<p>About that time, there was a slideshow on here covering effective ways to change your behavior & the role of willpower when you're doing it. The main points of the presentation were: 1) willpower is limited, and 2) changing our environment makes the most difference when altering our behaviors.  Here is my summary:<p>1. Willpower alone isn't sufficient motivation for long term change.\n- Know that willpower won't sustain a long term change by itself, although it can get you started.<p>2. Attempt Baby Steps, not Big Leaps\n- Seek tiny successes and tiny changes. Then build on what you've done with another step<p>3. Notice how the environment shapes your behavior\n- Changing the context of your life helps sustain long term changes in your behavior<p>4. Focus on creating new behaviors, not stopping old ones.\n- Focus on action, not avoidance.<p>5. Failures don't necessarily indicate a lack of motivation\n- More like a failure of planning. Find a way to make the behavior easier to do<p>6. Recognize and understand the power of triggers.\n- No behavior happens without a trigger. Find ways to remove or alter triggers in your environment<p>7. Information alone doesn't lead to action\n- Our environment needs to be set up in a way that helps us capitalize on that information<p>8. Focus on concrete behaviors rather than abstract goals\n- Abstract: Get in shape. Concrete: Walk 15 min. today. Turn your abstract goal into a series of baby steps.<p>9. Try to change a behavior for a short time, rather than forever\n- A fixed period works better than ""forever""<p>10. Remember, behavior change need not be difficult.\n- Behavior change can be relatively easy when you take many steps to increase the probability that your desired behavior will occur.",1311473683.0

You start with zero followers just like a blog starts with few readers. You don't give up just because no one's listening, you create a bit of history by effectively loss-leading - writing content that no one will initially see and contributing to what you might want Twitter to be. Over time, through search, links from your blog and interacting with other Twitter users, you will build up some interaction and (if that's what you're there for) influence.<p>I suppose the impatience and expectations of new users are that challenge for Twitter, though it'd be nice to see more people realise this for themselves rather than wait to have it solved for them.",1311473652.0
