But having been involved in Occupy Oakland's legal and anti-repression work what we have found is that since police have discretion as to when they can turn the devices on and off and when to upload, the video always seems to be mysteriously missing whenever defense lawyers request it. The officer will say that they forgot to turn it on or that it malfunctioned. If there is an instance of a protestor throwing a bottle that video is always available and is splashed all over the press.",1337396392.0

The drop happened exactly when the FB shares were made available to trade (11.30 - 11.38), before this time they had been trading fine (in big volumes). You would expect the people that were holding these shares as a proxy for FB to have anticipated that others like them would have wanted to sell that morning and done so before the moment arrived. In fact, there is evidence that this did happen in that there was big movement of ZNGA in the first hour of trading and at around 10.50.<p>This means that is was much more likely that it was down to bad trading algorithms.

(in reference to bitch being used in multiple incident, pornstar in slides etc).\n  c) there are some trolls who harass women/women confs. do you know much zed shaw gets trolled? i don't see him complaining about how uninviting the community is and blaming them for not getting things done (also, he would not agree with any point I make, but that's not the point of this reply)\n  d) there is a difference between getting offended by something and anything.<p>let me tell you a story: there was a famous author who wrote a book once, and at the book signing, one group of women came to talk to him, and told him that they were happy that they didn't find a single offensive word in the book. he said he was happy they know what they were looking for.<p>also, i agree some women are being harassed, but blaming solely these incidents as the reason for lack of women is misrepresentative and just making women objects to whom people have to provide support to get them in, rather than making them people who want to get in.<p>no matter what my point is: if you (men or women) want to get something, and can't do it, don't blame it on other people for that not happening.",1337393166.0
