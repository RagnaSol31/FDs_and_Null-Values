Gawker's legal representative would have to be summoned and indicted by a grand jury, unless the firm chooses to waive that right and proceed to a hearing.<p>Gawker Media LLC is a Delaware company headquartered in New York. Title 18 ยง3237 provides that any offence begun in one district and completed in another (eg CA and NY) can be prosecuted in either district, but it would probably be most practical to do so in California.<p>Gaby Darbyshire is COO and legal representative of Gawker Media, and per a letter [1] taken into evidence during the search was fully apprised of the situation. The letter did not repudiate or disavow Chen's actions but rather emphasized his employment by Gawker and use of his home as his regular place of employment. Under the doctrine of <i>Respondeat Superior</i>, Gawker is liable for acts carried out by Chen because an agency relationship exists between them; and because he committed a crime, in the scope of his employment, with the purpose of benefiting his employer. Even under the stricter rules of MPC 2.07, Gawker's COO and CEO appear to have approved and even reveled in Chen's illegal actions, and thus acted with <i>scienter</i>.<p>1. <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5524843/police-seize-jason-chens-computers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/5524843/police-seize-jason-chens-computer...</a> 'Gawker's legal response to police'.<p><i>small voice</i> I think...\n(edit: FYI grellas is a real attorney, whereas I'm just thinking about trying to become one...don't rely on anything I post!)",1273891696.0

25,1349224,comment,1349135.0,1349135.0,0,0,jcnnghm,,,"Quickbooks sucks in a major way.  If you could come up with a simple accounting system that didn't take three full minutes to load, even with an SSD, 4 processing cores, and 8GB of memory, you'd have a winner.  Even if your software was really bad, it  would probably still be better than Quickbooks.<p>You'd probably have to support these basic features:<p>Write Checks<p>Track Account Balances and Transactions - These need to be able to be imported in standard formats.  The format Quickbooks uses is XML.  I found it simple enough to reverse engineer that I was able to convert CSV dumps from my bank to QBO files and get them importing into Quickbooks.<p>Categorize Transactions - I need to be able to say what each transaction is.  I should be able to setup filters to automatically categorize imported transactions.  For example, at the convenience store Wawa, I buy exactly two things, coffee and gas.  If the transaction is less than $5, I want it to be categorized as personal food, if it's over $20, I want it to be categorized as gas.  I should be able to set this up, and never have to categorize one of these transactions again.<p>That's all it would really take.  You would probably want to integrate with one or more invoicing systems to track receivables.  You could setup an API then build connectors for popular applications, like Freshbooks.  A good interface for accounting for bank deposits would be helpful as well.",1273891116.0

Those are at the heart of any project I've been involved with, as stuff naturally gets delayed and shuffled around all the time. I have yet to find a sensible way to get a comprehensive status-view of a given <i>Goal</i> (consisting of multiple stories) in pivotal.<p>Take for example this mantis ticket, esp. the ""Relationships"":\n<a href=""http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=11330"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=11330</a><p>At a glance I can see what state this Goal is in, what the progress is, what it depends on, what it is blocked on (if anything) and who is involved.<p>With a few plugins mantis will also add fancy progressbars and time estimates. I think there's even a plugin to compute a velocity similar to pivotal, even though I've found that feature amazingly useless in pivotal so far. Perhaps it works better when your tasks are very uniform and your teammates are robots instead of humans. ;-)<p>As for the higher level ordering (enforcing an ordering on Goals), for that Mantis uses the Roadmap, which can ofcourse also be modified at any time as needed; <a href=""http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/roadmap_page.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/roadmap_page.php</a><p>Note also that all those extra-fields that are enabled in that mantis installation (Platform, OS etc.) are optional and customizable.

But even with SQL, something, usually the server, parses the text/string based query into what is essentially a format similar to this.  Sharding and clustering would be ""easier"" too if you didn't need to do them in your application, if the server side stuff just handled it.  Removing the need to parse SQL can remove the need to do that from your stack, but the server usually handles this anyway.  The way we think about sharding and clustering now usually puts that functionality into the application or into middleware where you need to be aware of it.  There's nothing stopping a server from taking a text based SQL query and offloading all those scaling features from the app itself.",1273888820.0
