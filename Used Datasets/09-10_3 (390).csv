(According to Chapman, using this aneutronic fusion technique with helium-3 isotopes would yield 493 MW per mole. But boron is a more attractive fuel source because it is abundant on Earth and helium-3 is scarce.)</i>""<p>This looks like nonsense. I think it was supposed to be megawatt-hour -- the quote is essentially correct, after you r/megawatt/megawatt-hour/, r/MW/MWh/, and r/specific power/specific energy/.<p>No idea why they are using this unit outside its native context (electricity generation).<p>-------------------------<p>I don't know about specific power, but the (theoretical) specific impulse is very  good. The exhaust speed of the fusion alphas is sqrt(2 * 2.9 MeV / 3.7 GeV/c^2) = 1.2e7 m/s (or 0.04 c). Since these alphas constitute all the mass of the fuel/propellant (which are the same in this scheme),  this is also the <i>effective</i> exhaust velocity.

That is not at all as inclusive as you argue. Math notation comes from mathematicians and is designed to facilitate communication between people of that profession. The notation is very functional and efficient for its designed task.<p>To create a new set of symbols and notation designed specifically for those who are not mathematicians is a waste of resources. Professors, whom would be responsible for teaching such a thing, would have to translate all of their concepts from ""professional notation"" to ""novice notation"" when lecturing. This involves them learning a totally new set of notation designed for no reason other than teaching. Furthermore, anyone who wanted to pursue mathematics professionally would have to then learn ""professional notation"".<p>Aside from these logistical difficulties, I fail to see how a different set of notation would be any clearer or easier to understand than the current notation, which is already widely accepted and considered useful. Essentially, you are arguing that math notation is too difficult and so it should be simplified. That is like saying Faulkner or Joyce is too difficult to read so should be rewritten for those without the ability to comprehend the source document: it sort of misses the point.",1309312941.0

If you want to keep things feeling deliberately old timey and worn, adding a little bit of aged film overlay would go a long way (some decent examples of this type of aging, though fully black and white instead of just partially desaturated, can be seen in the games PB Winterbottom or Limbo).<p>Out of curiosity, what led to the bullseyes being spherical instead of cylindrical?<p>--\nPB Winterbottom <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMZyAsVlMoU",
