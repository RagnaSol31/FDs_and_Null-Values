I like that it is a different approach and all, but when I have something to sell I'm not going to wait until the right  ""theme"" comes along. If I have a guitar that I want to sell now I shouldn't have to wait until a music theme comes along.<p>Maybe I am missing something and I would love some direction if anyone can provide it, but it seems like the whole idea is to provide a platform to sell the junk you have lying around in a fast and convenient manner. Waiting until music day to sell my Strat doesn't sound very convenient.<p>No disrespect to the founders or anything, I'm just a little confused.

And while I have not looked it up or done any calculations, I suspect that if you integrate over total exposure (watts/m^2) to microwave radiation per unit time on your head, for the average person, the sun will come out on top over the mobile. Especially those near the equator. And since you can't hold all variables as equal we can likely usually find two people where phone + sun is equal but phone or sun exposure for the other person is more. So I argue for many persons we can find another who is doing okay whose total microwave power absorption from sun is equal to that of our person's sun and mobile exposure.",1319251340.0

However, risks may depend on power and frequency of the radiation (while it is true that ionizing radiation causes cancer, one can't rule out cancer effects at other, non-ionizong frequencies through unknown mechanisms). If it can be shown the sun puts out much less mobile-phone like radiation than your phone, then the conparison is not really valid.  Put another way, the question is, ""will I be exposed to more mobile-phone like radiation (1.8 Ghz) from a five minute call, or from standing in the sun for five minutes?""  I tried to use a blackbody model of the sun to answer this, but I failed.<p>There's also effects of the heat given off by the phone heating your head, but I ignore that.",1319249772.0
