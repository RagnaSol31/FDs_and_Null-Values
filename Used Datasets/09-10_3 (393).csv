After all, it's their only revenue stream.<p>Apple, on the other hand, besides being traditionally nicer to its customers (as shown by them toping the user and support satisfaction surveys every damn year), also have the iTunes and iPhone App Store to get money off of customers with older iPhones, so they can afford to give them a new iOS version. And they also use the iPhone as a lure to their other device offerings (iPad, Macs, etc), so the benefit from users of an older iPhone not feeling left behind iOS-wise.<p>Perhaps the biggest reason is this: Apple still sells older models (such as the 3GS, 4G etc), especially to other parts of the world. So it's an added incentive that those are upgradable to the latest iOS.<p>Now, since you asked, perhaps Google doesn't want to add to their Android dev expenses the potentially huge expense of supporting older devices.",1319857131.0

(And if you're a programmer, I'm not sure which of those options is going to prove more expensive.) But, of course, the rest of Harvard is open to the backpack-wearer, and MIT even opens their libraries (I'm proud to routinely impersonate a graduate of MIT) so this isn't much of an objection.<p>On a slightly more serious note: They also won't let you into the labs with just a backpack. If you'd happily accept a sub-market wage to be taught laboratory research techniques, in a piecemeal and haphazard fashion, by sleep-deprived world experts equipped with state-of-the-artish equipment, engineering graduate school is the game for you.

Availability of source code isn't the goal; it's just a necessary condition.  Because iOS devices will only run code signed by Apple's keys (and Apple doesn't distribute those keys, obviously), it's impossible for a developer to distribute software via the App Store without separating the software from the freedoms.

So maybe if I have some time I'll refactor it to use the new API, which looks like it's a lot better than the old extension API.<p>One cool thing is if you statically link your binary and build on ubuntu 10.04, you can actually just directly deploy binaries to Heroku, even though it's not a supported language. Just throw in a package.json file or whatever to trick Heroku and specify your Snap binary in your Procfile.<p>THANKS SNAP GUYS!",1319854195.0

Therefore, quality assignment should be calculated specifically for a particular user, based on all available criteria, using a method selected by said user. Methodologies based on group-think or admin-think will always lead to a measure of quality which is ""ugly"" or ""bad"" for someone, at some point. So, center quality around what the user wants. In today's social networks, central management of data quality is an absurd notion left over from the early days of the Internet. It always leads to data deletion, user exclusion, or other forms of censorship. All data should remain, but should be filtered, for each user, based on what the user wants.
