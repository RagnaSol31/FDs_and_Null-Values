1,162159,comment,162155.0,162155.0,0,0,pg,,,"<i>Google...didn't sell out....Because Google had a deeply felt sense of purpose: a conviction to change the world for the better.</i><p>This reads well, but I believe it's false.  From what I've heard, the Google founders were willing to sell at various points, but they always asked more than acquirers were willing to pay. Just like Facebook.<p>The real problem with VCs is not that they're inclined to sell out early.  As a rule, founders are the ones who want to sell out; investors would rather the founders kept working to generate them more upside.<p>The reason there aren't more Googles is not that VCs encourage radically innovative startups to sell out, but that they don't even fund them.  One of the things that has surprised me most about VCs is how conservative they are.  They're terrified of doing anything novel, in case it blows up and their partners laugh at them.  They won't invest in anything unless everyone thinks it's a good idea.  Which is a problem because really novel ideas always seem like mistakes to most people.",1208051441

I think I can answer your question very simply: they all suck, and you have to find which one sucks the least for you.<p>For me, OSX is mostly eye candy any keyboard junkie should steer clear of. Also, it tends to be sluggish and not as responsive as other OSs I've tried. The spinning beach ball (I call it the pizza of boredom) is a very common sight.<p>Linux is about plug and pray. Maybe, hopefully, if you're lucky, things work out well on your computer. I mean come on, Ubuntu, in 2008, made a big fuss about the new (yes new) screen manager that lets you visually control multi-monitor setups. Whoopie. Welcome to the '90s.<p>Vista is rubbish. SP1 made it better but it's still annoying. If it weren't for the hassle, I'd switch back to XP. More than OSX, the eye candy is very distracting and useless.<p>XP is old but darn good, kinda like an old pair of jeans. It has flaws but they're familiar and known-enough to be fixable.<p>So should you switch from OSX->Ubuntu? Is your software Ubuntu ready? Are you ready to drop to the command line fairly regularly? Are you ready for a different GUI? It's certainly doable, and perhaps easy, but it's a lot of ""easy"" steps to be taken. That may be too much work for you.<p>Good luck.<p>Pierre",1208050982

I can recall some marathon pair-programming sessions where we mind-melded and got things done very quickly.<p>If there is an imbalance in skills, pair programming will sometimes devolve into one of the developers asserting control and dominating.<p>The lowest-common denominator form of pair programming ""Can you take a look at my code?"" is very effective for finding bugs. Simply having to explain yourself can reveal issues.<p>I hate the term ""Can I drive now/do you want to drive"" for pair programming.",1208050884

I always thought the cover of ANSI Common Lisp was a nod towards his life (and death).<p>For those of you who do not know much about the Alan Turing man, I suggest that you check out one of the excellent biographies that have been written about him. He was a really amazing and interesting guy. And the persecution that lead to his suicide provides a valuable (and tragic) lesson on the evils of homophobia.",1208050200

I could make fun of Textmate and 37 signals who popularized it, but I really don't want to start flamewars. Come on... Unix is the king when it comes to text editors for programmers: vim&emacs rule.<p>Besides, there is simply co much to look at when it comes to pedestrian text editing (Textmate style): netbeans, komodo, eclipse+plugins, aptana - all built for Linux first, OS X - second.",1208049679

14,162145,comment,161980.0,162094.0,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Glossiness increases the contrast between lights and darks so that movies and other things look crisper. You find it mostly on media-centered systems. On a lot of laptops it is either the only option or available for about $25 more.<p>I don't think OSX and Vista have too much to do with it. My brother's Macbook doesn't have a glossy screen and I'm not sure they even offer it. I'm not sure about the other models though. Vista is only software, since MSFT doesn't make the hardware on PCs, so I don't see how that contributes to glossy screens.<p>The reason I would give for it is that it is a way to add a feature to a product that differentiates it from other products. It doesn't matter that the glossy screens have enough negative effects to counter the 1 advantage. Company A came out with it to sell more computers, so companies B, C, and D all had to develop their own version to compete. Consumers can be silly that way. I was.",1208048596
