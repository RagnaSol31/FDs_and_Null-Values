9,82281,comment,82007.0,82007.0,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"The article is very verbose. They only answer the 'how' question at the very end (burying the lead?). Apparently it's some kind of weighted work pool:<p><i>Tovey and Nakrani set to work translating the bee strategy for these idle Internet servers. They developed a virtual ""dance floor"" for a network of servers. When one server receives a user request for a certain Web site, an internal advertisement (standing in a little less colorfully for the dance) is placed on the dance floor to attract any available servers. The ad's duration depends on the demand on the site and how much revenue its users may generate. The longer an ad remains on the dance floor, the more power available servers devote to serving the Web site requests advertised.</i>",1195609266
10,82280,comment,81985.0,82102.0,0,0,yariv,,,The main difference in effort between a Scala/lift and Erlang/ErlyWeb implementation is that making the Erlang app distributed and linearly scalable doesn't require any coding. Just store the process IDs in Mnesia and when you add more nodes add those nodes to the Mnesia schema and you're done.<p>Not having to restart your Erlang server (and therefore lose your client connections) to do code updates is also pretty cool.,1195609127

21,82267,comment,82267.0,81976.0,0,0,theyoungceo,,,"I built my entire startup on .NET because I think the feature set is richer, Visual Studio is a great tool, and speed of development is faster. I've done extensive work in PHP and Java in the past and both were much harder to work with IMHO. I also have backend applicatiosn and mobile devices that run versions of the framework, so the entire solution lent itself very well to .NET. I happily paid windows server and SQL server 2005 licenses as well; money well spent.<p>Feel free to crucify me now, but remember that customers don't care what you made it in -- just that it works and brings value to them.",1195607385
