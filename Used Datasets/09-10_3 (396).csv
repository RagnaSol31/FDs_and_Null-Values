1,127727,comment,127322.0,127660.0,0,0,rms,,,"I think it was changed for the upcoming conference, but I may be misinterpreting it. It seems like there was a one week period when they let anyone become a member in January 2008, for the 2009 conference. After that, registration was closed and presumably celebs can still get in. But if you had $6000 during that one week period, you could get in. This is in contrast to the previous conferences where you needed an invite to get a floor pass.",1204509373

Sure, many people here build web sites, but don't forget that such startups still represent a relatively small fraction of total amount of software written.<p>I am involved in two startups and both use C++.<p>1. Video codecs (encoding/transocing) and IP video streaming. This is for my ""day job"" startup where we do IP video security.<p>2. Pikluk Browser (downloadable from pikluk.com) is written in C++ because that project requires a fairly low-level Win32 hacking.<p>And even our Rails web application uses external C-libraries for image manipulation.",1204509237

My emphasis was that the transition from ""startup"" to ""business"" seems to happen when you connect with paying customers.<p>I even posted a post to this effect where I basically summed up the most interesting part (for me) of a marketing book:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=127157"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=127157</a><p>In order to have a clear value proposition to get people to give you their money, you need to answer (according to the book) these questions in succession of difficulty:<p>Who you are / what you do / for who / because they need what thing that they can't do without you / unlike your competitors / your different in what way / which is a very important distinction (how?) and makes people care (why?).<p>I'd say most startups start with ""who they are"" and stop.  Some make it to ""what they do"" although not expressed clearly.  The part about ""for who"" and ""why they care"" never seems to be spelled out, just implied or something.<p>The first response is by some guy who took this as both a personal attack and an attack on the whole Y Combinator community!<p>Then PG comes on and says, ""well such and such venture capitalist says he funds business that solve a problem the founders had.""<p>I try to point out that that only holds true as long as that problem is one a huge market of people are also having and are willing to pay for the resolution of.<p>Then, in a rather futile and pointless exercise, he goes on to systematically knock about 30 points off my all-time high of 80, perhaps under the delusion that I secretly covet a high point tally so I can impress him or something.<p>It's like, the very mere suggestion that people need to tie their technical ability to practical solution solving for paying customers, especially in this economic climate, seems to meet with rage and fury from programmers who seem to take basic economic reality like a personal insult or something.<p>> ""Make something people will want"", since people don't \n> always know what they want.<p>That would need perspective and ability to anticipate possible patterns of future development, ability to assign probabilities to multiple scenarios, etc.<p>All ""right brain stuff"".  Most programmers I've come across, especially here, couldn't seem to care less as long as they post their startup and score points from peers.",1204509107

And then ask for advice.<p>So here's my advice:<p>Maybe you just came across wrong to me in writing; it's easy to do - I've done it myself.  I should give you the benefit of the doubt, but I won't because most others won't either.  Before you consider any career move, I'd suggest you seriously consider evaluating your people and communication skills.  I don't care what you pick, if you turn people off like you just did to me, you will have problems succeeding.  Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I suspect not.<p>Show me that I'm wrong about this, earn some trust, and keep asking for help.  Interesting to see how this turns out.",1204507815

You can learn by following, but most likely you will become an outstanding leader by doing instead of following, ie. by doing what leaders do.<p>All your statements statements ""lead"" towards the follow then lead direction. In my opinion its more interesting to know your followers, as there are good and bad. Especially for start-ups it is useful to have the _right_ type of followers, namely in activists and diehards. There's a pretty good HBR article about this from this past December titled ""What Every Leader Needs to Know About Followers."" A must read for aspiring leaders!<p>-oscar",1204507491
