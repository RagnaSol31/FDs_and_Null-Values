(2) Expertise is only accomplished with relentless practice. (3) The most productive society will be accomplished if citizens are made to constantly work at their discipline.</i>  (made one minor edit)<p>You haven't supplied a definition of the term ""expert"".  It turns out that the word ""expert"" is usually defined in one of 3 ways:<p>(a) an expert is a person with unusual skills, talent, or productive abilities<p>(b) an expert is a person who has a lot of experience in a particular field, job, branch of inquiry, etc.<p>(c) both (a) and (b)<p>So you can unpack your reasoning in one of 3 ways:<p>Using (a): ""A productive society is one with productive people.  Productiveness is acquired only through practice.  So a society that forces its people to practice all the time will be most productive.""<p>Using (b): ""A productive society is one in which everyone has practiced a lot.  'Having practiced a lot' is achieved only by practicing a lot.  Therefore the society that forces everyone to practice a lot will be most productive.""<p>Using (c): ""A productive society is one in which everyone got productive by practicing a lot.  Everyone gets productive by practicing a lot only if they practice a lot.  So a society in which everyone practices a lot is the most productive society.""<p>or using commutation, the above becomes:\n""A society in which everyone practices a lot to become productive is productive if everyone practices a lot, so the most productive society is one in which everyone is forced to practice as much as possible.""<p>(a) begs the question of how productivity is acquired.  (b) begs the question of the value of large amounts of practice, and (c) is a tautology.<p>If you do much reading about the history of science, technology, or industry, you'll find that a certain level of practice/proficiency are very important, but that many of the achievements we celebrate were due as much to luck or circumstance as to doing huge amounts of extra homework every day.<p>So spending too much time practicing a few skills makes you worse off, because you limit the chances that you will have one of those lucky experiences that will lead to something genuinely new.  Of course, you'll <i>look</i> really diligent and studious, and no one is going to tell you that you should work less or study less, but the economic concepts of ""diminishing returns"" and ""opportunity cost"" are valuable here.<p>You don't have to take my word for it, though.

I see no evidence that Boston and New York were any more diversified than cities such as Baltimore, St. Louis, Cleveland, or New Haven.

Why did so many American cities fall apart at exactly the same time?  The diversification argument simply does not pass the smell test.<p>I think the strength of New York and Boston are due to a couple factors 1) crime never passed a certain tipping point at which most of the productive citizens left and 2) they both are traditional homes of industries that have done well the past thirty years ( finance and education).
