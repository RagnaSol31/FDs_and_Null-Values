1,127062,comment,126981.0,127050.0,0,0,NSX2,,,"Patentable and useful doesn't necessarily mean good business.  I'm assuming the ""bored developer"" wants to start a business around whatever idea he can't think of.  There are ideas, some useful, some even patentable, but to make a business you need not so much patents but the ability to present it in such a way that a prospective customer thinks, ""That provides me with more value than the price they're asking for, so I should buy it.""  Think of it this way: are Starbucks lattes patentable?  But they are a good value to half-dead zombies on their way to work/on their way back from a grueling day of work.  That makes them I think like 10 billion a year, roughly same revenue as Google.  BeOS was awesome and technically advanced and I'm sure had many patents.  Who paid for it?  Nobody.  Company's gone.  There's a difference.",1204423106.0

33,127030,comment,126809.0,126822.0,0,0,cstejerean,,,I fully agree with you. Polling would only be interesting if in addition to answering the poll the users would post comments. I like the overview of the different votes at the top of the thread that the polling feature provides but I think there should only be 2 ways of voting:<p>1. vote only when you add a comment by specifying your vote in addition to the comment<p>2. upmodding someone's vote/comment automatically adds a vote from you for the same choice<p>We need to keep in mind that a benefit of polls is that the folks answering can answer without worrying about loosing karma if they vote for the least popular choice. But we need to balance this with the fact that readers of the site don't gain much from just reading the numbers of a poll.,1204420796.0

I'm looking for something where the interaction is first client-to-server, then client registers a ""callback"" address and port that it will listen to.  This would be followed by a server-to-client call where the server will send updates/events to client as they happen, the client then decides what to do with those events.

As time remains constant and life becomes more complicated, I suspect people will become more selective and use more of the kinds of services they would actually bother paying for and limiting their interactions with things that are interesting, but not enough if they actually cost something.  That said, most non-programmers usually start the ""what would I want built for me"" process from the perspective of ""that would be so useful that I might even consider paying for it"" whereas, from my experience with programmers (trying to recruit for my own startup efforts), most programmers start the ""what would I wish someone built"" process from the perspective of ""that I would respect this guy's technical ability a lot.""<p>Case in point: there are tons of ideas that can become good, useful, practical valuable services based on standard, already existing technology reconfigured in different ways.
