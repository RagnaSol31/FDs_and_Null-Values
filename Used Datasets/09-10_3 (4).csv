In a simple statement, there have been no studies in man\n    that have indicated brain damage.\n\n    The &quot;holes in the brain&quot; is an even more outrageous deception. These\n    popular holes are areas in brain scans that appear less active in\n    attracting radiolabelled agents that are agonists for certain receptor\n    site areas. The pictures that are shown for comparison are not of the\n    same person with or without MDMA in them, but of different people, one\n    of whom has used a lot of ecstasy and the other one without any such\n    history. The quintessence of this line of mythology is an article that\n    appeared recently in the Willamette Week.  It not only assured the\n    reader that there were holes generated by serotonin loss, but that they\n    became flooded with dopamine (the default neurotransmitter) and, being\n    attacked by hydrogen peroxide, produced rust.\n\n    Sorry, drug warriors. No damage, no holes, no rust.&quot;[1]\n</code></pre>\nGranted, that was from an interview in 2001.  For more recent research see erowid[2], and simonster&",
