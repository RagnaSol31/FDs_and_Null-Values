I have invested a lot in AIX, DB2, Oracle and Solaris over the years. It's just that handing the reference to what your product should be compatible with to Microsoft and then trying to compete against them in one of their cash-cows is pretty much the ultimate stupid thing one could try.<p>Microsoft has been caught more than once in unethical and illegal activities, so, why take the risk? Are the APIs so far superior than anything else around? Is it working? Is it bringing a meaningful flow of new cross-platform software? Are the languages so wonderful nothing else comes close?<p>And yes: the US patent system is deeply flawed. And so is he justice system that allowed MS to abuse its monopoly numerous times. I can only hope both get fixed because the US is too an important market to ignore. It seems the EU has a good grip on the situation and maybe the US can follow its leadership on this.",1243216170.0
