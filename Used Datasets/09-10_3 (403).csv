If Nate says not to use Keyczar, my advice is that picking it right now might be a professional embarassment in the coming year.</i><p>I read his comments as being ""there is nothing good; here's why all of these things suck, but I grudgingly guess Keyczar works for some people"".  The only alternatives under discussion are cryptlib, which only has C bindings currently, and djb's new thing which uses brand new (well, four year old) ciphers that nobody other than djb really understands or knows to be secure.  Given that Keyczar has some major corporate backing, <i>and</i> a reasonable level of community support, it seems a pretty solid choice...despite its imperfections.  djb's thing <i>might</i> be an awesome choice...but we don't know and I'm definitely not qualified to figure it out.<p>Again, I'm just some guy, you know?  I don't understand the nuances of security very well, but I read what I can and try to make some sense out of the kinds of answers security experts provide (which, for some reason, always seem to be qualified into being no-op statements; I guess because committing to recommending something means you can be proven wrong later when that recommendation proves insecure).<p>So, my reading comprehension I guess is as weak as my crypto knowledge, since I came away thinking, ""Well, there's nothing good to use.  But maybe Keyczar or cryptlib is better than what we're doing now; djb's might be awesome in the future.  cryptlib has an annoying deployment aspect and would require me to write bindings that would probably be insecure, so Keyczar seems maybe the best of a bad lot.""",1247621865

This will flush out the corners of the language for you.</i><p>Warning, there is a strong tendency to write a compiler for the language as <i>you</i> understand it, not as it is. The surface structure of the language, it's syntax, can be mastered by reading its grammar, and the kinks ironed out by actually implementing a lexer/parser for it.<p>However, it's deep structure, the semantics and evaluation are only understood through rigorous mathematical semantic models, or at least through implicit understanding after 10 years of use. At least for sophisticated languages.<p>A previous knowledge of other superior languages will corrupt your current attempt to understand an inferiour language. To give you an example, I think any Scheme programmer will have a difficult time implementing Pascal as it's specified.

37,704944,comment,704887.0,704887.0,0,0,jswinghammer,,,I don't see how any sector of the economy is responsible for the inevitable bust that follows an inflationary boom. We had massive inflation over the last 8 years and when that inflation started to be curbed the bust that followed is no one's fault but the people who started the inflation in the first place. California's budget woes are the result of spending too much during a boom not realizing that we were all living in a fantasy world.<p>The article doesn't address the fact that intellectual property is a form of wealth that is perfectly fine to invest in. Yes there was a lot of errors made during the boom but that's true of all of the booms including our most recent stock and housing bubbles.<p>I'm still long on the technology industry as a whole. I think there's a lot of good work still to come and I'm looking forward to seeing it. I just hope that the next time inflation comes our way we identify it sooner and act accordingly.,1247620934

Since around 2000, when I first read the book, I heeded his advice.<p><pre><code>  For more information: click here\n  To sign up, go here\n</code></pre>\nwere cardinal no-nos, if I remember correctly.<p>But it looks like everybody else uses this technique, and the average web surfer is more likely to click give the redundant area to click on.<p>Maybe people are just more comfortable with ""click here"" when the links lead to an undefined word, like Twitter.  Would it be true to say that most people on the web don't know what Twitter is?  Do most of Curtis's visitors know what it is?  If most of his visitors don't know, are they clicking on ""here"" because it's a more comfortable link given Twitter is undefined?  While each of his test cases vary in wording, the first 3 are all alike in that twitter is the only word hyperlinked.<p>My theory is that people are less likely to click on hyperlinks if the hyperlinked text or word is something they don't know about.
