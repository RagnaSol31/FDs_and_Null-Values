11,656692,comment,656645.0,656662.0,0,0,timwiseman,,,"To focus just on your comments about mathematics, let me point out that going through at least algebra at a minimum is valuable for everyone in a modern society.<p>First it is highly helpful in handling even basic household finance.  Second, you cannot hope to understand even basic statistics without it (and with the way the media throws out statistics it is very dangerous not to understand at least the basics if you want to be a participatory citizen).  But far beyond all that, it goes a very long way to teaching you how to think and how to make reasoned and rational decisions.<p>Also, I think you vastly underestimate the number of jobs that require going far beyond algebra.  Virtually all technical jobs of any kind requires calculus.  This includes almost all engineers, virtually all scientists, and most analysts.  Also, most finance jobs involve math far beyond algebra.  Remember that even fully analyzing interest rates involves calculus (or at least formulas derived from calculus, and a good analyst should know where they come from).  And that is again before realizing that the mere study of math helps teach you to reason and think.<p>I am focusing only on math here, but I think you will find anyone in an advanced society will benefit greatly from algebra and far more than you seem to expect need calculus.  I also disagree with most everything else you said, but I will just focus on math for the moment.",1244943767.0

Most American schoolchildren do <i>not</i> get to choose their schools.<p>I went to a charter high school whose curriculum focused on letting us do individualized projects catering to our interests.  Its 7-hour day (8:30-3:30) seemed far less oppressive than the 6-hour-and-20-minute day at my public middle school.  I've kept up with it after graduation, and they now offer after-school classes and programs until 5:00, and summer courses.  And kids go, even though they don't have to.  Why not, when their friends are there and the programs are stuff they're interested in anyway?<p>Similarly, I don't mind working long hours at the Googleplex, because my friends are there, they give me food, and the work is interesting and meaningful.<p>When those conditions aren't met, you'll find many fewer people bragging about how much time they spent at work.  Some working-poor people will work two jobs to make ends meet, but they don't brag about it, they complain about it.

PyPy, an even more ambitious project. So Jython was stuck in a coma with a pre-alpha 2.2 release for like half a decade, while CPython marched on, and no new maintainer was able to bring it back to consciousness -- despite huge demand for it, since Jython at the time was the perfect solution to problems in Java and Python. Finally Frank Wierzbicki came along a couple years ago, squeezed out the stubborn 2.2 release and is on the verge of version 2.5, at which point we can consider Jython back open for business. There's a kind of similar story with Psyco, and I think that one also concludes with PyPy being the ""right answer"" to the original problem.<p>But back on topic -- in some ways, the dynamic-language communities are collaborating on common VMs. The JVM team is trying to make things easier for other languages with ""invokedynamic"", the .NET world is keeping up at least (DLR? dunno), and LLVM has good traction as a compilation target.<p>However, I doubt we'll see anyone devote significant effort to porting Python or Ruby to Parrot until Perl 6 lands and provides a compelling demonstration. Meanwhile, PyPy is getting close enough to its goal that we might just want to wait and see if their JIT-compiler-generator solves all of these problems in one shot.",1244941444.0
