But web applications only ever have one entry point and one output point - the request and the response. You don't have multiple simultaneous controls or views to worry about, so there's little point applying traditional MVC to solve this non-existant problem. Your application, be it a CGI script, mod_perl handler, or even an all-in-one embedded Perl template, receives one and only one request for any one invocation, and it must generate one and only one response.
