The more money that is in circulation (printed) the less value to each person that holds it. Imagine a game of Monopoly where everybody had as much money as the Bank; nobody would have much spending power. When this happens in the real world, such as the 90's in Argentina, in Zimbabwe, and elsewhere throughout history, it's called hyperinflation. The U.S. has uniquely been able to get away with excessive printing because of the dollar hegemony, a good credit rating - ""backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. governement"" - from having a stable government, and dominating the world economy. But we're not invincible... even Rome fell.",1255744655

It's obvious how it saves time - the more you answer emails, the more people reply. So you end up sending three times as much email each day as you would have if you only answered twice a day.

Changing system themes, even on a rooted phone, requires downloading an image specific to the ROM you're running, and flashing that over top of your current ROM.  Changing to another theme, or reverting to the standard theme, requires re-flashing your phone every time.<p>That said, I would love to see installable themes where the user can download/select/apply multiple themes on the fly without flashing/rebooting their phone, but at the moment, I think it's a result of Android taking the simple/efficient route for implementation.",1255744109

Fortunately there's a solution that's complimentary to the ""no background processes"" restriction that I'm <i>sure</i> some cretins at Apple have at least mocked up, if not implemented:<p>They just need to expose specific interfaces to launchd (Apple's clever init/rc/cron/xinet replacement), for doing particular kinds of local notifications. An app could register (with user confirmation) that it wants to have a limited helper run when an event has occurred: cron-style schedules, at-style timers, ""Moved more than X meters"", ""Am near X:Y"", etc. The registrations would be managed just like with the current push notifications.<p>With that, there'd be only a few other APIs needed to absolve the want for background processes. The ability to enqueue HTTP requests would make quite a number of apps friendlier to multitasking, and its already implemented privately in MobileSafari.
