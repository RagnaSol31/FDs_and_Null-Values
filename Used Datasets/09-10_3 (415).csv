The whole lecture was about how kids can't work with disconnected mental abstractions until they reach a certain level of cognitive development (the Formal Operational Stage.) It was also enforced that moving between stages of cognitive development just takes <i>time</i>, not more or better prerequisite education. In that light, it's kind of obvious that young children shouldn't be being taught math, any more than they should be being taught first-order logic.",1269741460.0

You need a locking mechanism - which you'll probably implement using (wrapped) native syscalls. Not only does that break cross-platform operation, you'll also have to work on and fix (but find first, of course) bugs in the locking implementation. As you spend more and more time on this and your app starts growing, you'll find yourself spending more and more time working with the limitations of the filesystem you're using (file size limits, directory size limits, access times for files in large directories). You can hack your way around all that but then you have to face other critical tasks. Say .. backup and restore procedures. Can you do partial backup/restore operations? No? Well, get ready to write code for that too. And you preferably want to be able to do those live. Remember those locking issues you solved when you started down this road to hell? Yeah, they're back with a vengeance now.<p>How about a full restore? Maybe you should have implemented a replay-able log system to get that full restore up to speed with the state of the db since the time of the last backup.<p>Or maybe this isn't exactly the right point at which to re-invent the wheel :)",1269740686.0
