Neat.<p>However, I don't see what this has to do with my original comment. It doesn't address any of the concerns I raised about the john_dahl's comment. Specifically, I'm wondering how several competing web frameworks results in splintering of the Ruby community. Isn't competition good? Don't we want a variety of tools that meet different needs?<p>I frequently see Merb mentioned as an alternative to Rails in response to some gripe about Rails. Developers obviously have needs that aren't met by Rails. So my question is how is this merger a positive thing for developers? What's wrong with having several tools that are used for different scenarios? Of course, 100 competing web frameworks that are essentially all the same doesn't do anyone any good, but surely there's nothing wrong with several if they specialize in different areas.<p>john_dahl's comment essentially applauds the merger as a unification of the Ruby community and implies that it's a disadvantage to have competition.

It is exactly the same (Resume to Interview) regardless of the type of job in question (Banker vs Developer vs Babysitter).  Where is the customization?<p>As more and more work becomes digitally distributable thought-work, why aren’t we judging people based on relevant examples of their work?  Why is an entry level hedgefund analyst judged by a 30 minute ""tell me about yourself"" interview as opposed to the performance of her personal  account (and the verbalization of the rationale behind it)?<p>I think it is interesting that we just assume that ""talking to someone"" is the ultimate tool for determining intelligence, competence, and fit.  Ultimately, talking to someone measures how well they can talk, not how well they perform.

53,408324,comment,407869.0,407869.0,0,0,thwarted,,,"I worked at a company, back in the mid-90s, that wasn't doing so well (I found out later because of really bad decisions by the owner) and cut everyone's pay by 20%.  Full-time employees took a 20% cut and part-time employees could only work 4 days a week.  At the time, this seriously hurt the goodwill that we, as employees, had for the company.<p>One concern was that if we could continue to live on the reduced income and were happy to do so, there was no reason to restore the salaries if the company ever turned around.  So anyone who stuck around at the reduced rate was only delaying their leaving the company eventually anyway.  All this did was keep people from being forced to find new jobs sooner.<p>Another concern was that _everyone_, the employees known to be valuable _and_ the dead weight, were potentially paying to keep the dead weight around.  The ability to do cut-backs gives you a bonafide excuse to get rid of the dead weight, cut the fat, and operate leanly.  One way to do that is by giving your top performers more responsibility and showing them they are valuable; the good people will step up to the challenge.  By keeping under-performers around, it sends the message that the company actually isn't interested in surviving _as_a_company_.  ""You mean I have to take a pay cut _and_ I still have to deal with these personnel inefficiencies? No thanks.""",1230080933.0
