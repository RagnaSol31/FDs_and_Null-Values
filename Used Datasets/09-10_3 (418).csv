We are talking about ONE certain contract...and in this case, it involves a month-to-month contract.<p>As for negotiating earlier, again, you sound like you are reading from a college textbook. Nothing wrong with it, but I run a start-up and things are not usually as perfect as books may make it seem. ie. We did just as aggressive negotiation at the time of signing up and got the best deal in the market at the time. Also note that at the time the server was given to us, the host had put in money that they had yet to recover. When we went back to renegotiate, that cost had been recovered.<p>""Why sign a contract and then renege six months in?""<p>Usually because some unexpected variables change. Happens all the time, especially in a start-up. And right now, in this economy, even more so!<p>Lastly, your point that you should negotiate just as aggressively at the beginning is well taken. However, doing that and re-negotiating to get the best deal at all times are not mutually exclusive.",1228182581.0

Just reading the first words of pg's essay cheered me up. when pg talks about programmers, there's no worldly spirit in what he writes. You don't see words like professional, certification etc. He writes like a kid writing about his favorite hobby. This article actually saddened me. Like its been pointed out, you really feel the author squeezing the fun out of programming. It reminded be of the stories in the Bible with the Pharasees and Scribes. They put on the outer mask of religion but rejected it's inner power: The Holy Spirit. Similarly, there has to be that inner love for programming to make good stuff.<p>I'm not trying to say I think the guys wrong or a ""Scribe"".
