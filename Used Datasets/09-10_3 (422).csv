With regard to your first three points:<p>1. My call quality is excellent in NYC. I get a dropped call maybe once a week. It's not even something I think about much. I see Verizon customers around me dealing with more dropped calls.\n2. Email and SMS are fantastic. Better than my work-issued Blackberry.\n3. Network. I have 3G almost everywhere I go, but I understand that this varies widely by geographical area. People without coverage obviously won't benefit much from an iPhone.<p>With regard to the Blackberry comparison, I'll flat out say this: I prefer the iPhone keyboard to the Blackberry keyboard. Plain and simple. Maybe I figured out the right places to touch the screen, but I type faster and more efficiently on the iPhone. I didn't make any scientific comparisons, but every time I'm forced to compose something on the Blackberry, I inwardly groan. My fingers and hands are not particularly small.<p>If you heavily use Exchange, I imagine iPhone's integration leaves something to be desired. I haven't tried it.

Pages are badly formed with lots of adds and without any SEO and Accessibility in mind. Sometimes when the page does actually contain a relevant information Google will give it a pour pagerank because of pour Signal vs. Noise ratio or because it's far from the top of the page. Poorly formed pages are hard for search engines to deal with but it seems Yandex does a better job (at least in Runet).<p>Yandex Maps has a Killer feature - you can measure distances with a simple tool. I have no idea why no one else does that!<p>Another important thing: Google is not faster (if not slower) than Yandex in Russia. That's something which I notice when I compared Yahoo! and Google while I lived there. Yahoo is a little bit slower than Google and when one makes a couple of searches (trying different words and phrases) it becomes really annoying. Yandex doesn't have this problem. Moreover it loaded faster when I used it outside of Moscow in regions with a slower internet connection (may be their datacenter was closer, I don't know).<p>And if you consider entering the url in the address bar it's even faster to type ya.ru vs. google.com. Of course it's not an issue now when I use browser hotkeys (type 'y search term' or 'g search term') but from my experience there are lots of people who still type the URL.<p>But the major key to success was a large ad campaign on TV when Runet was really young and small and no one heard about Google yet. I remember the time when I knew about two websites: Yandex and Mail.ru and those two still mean internet to my mom. Yandex became a synonym to 'search' alongside with Rambler. But unlike the later Yandex keeps innovating and it's still ahead of Google which surpassed Rambler last year.<p>I'm pleased to see that there are countries where Google does not own the market. Unfortunately it’s not the case in Europe where people use it 99% of the time even though there are great local search engines. Competition is great and it’s the only thing that drives the innovation.<p>It’s really funny when one person says to other 'Just google that' and the other opens Yandex and search but in Russia it’s the usual thing.",1231636769

Here is what the creators of processing say:<p>'Processing was never intended as the ultimate language for programming visuals; instead, we set out to make something that was:<p><pre><code>    * A sketchbook for our own work, simplifying the majority of tasks that we undertake.\n    * A programming environment suitable for teaching programming to a non-traditional audience.\n    * A stepping stone from scripting languages to more complicated or difficult languages such as full-blown Java or C++.\n</code></pre>\nAt the intersection of these points is a tradeoff between speed and simplicity of use. If we didn't care about speed, it might make sense to use Python, Ruby, or many other scripting languages. This is especially true for the education side. If we didn't care about making a transition to more advanced languages, we'd probably avoid a C++ or Java-style syntax. But Java makes a nice starting point for a sketching language because it's far more forgiving than C/C++ and also allows users to export sketches for distribution via the web.'<p>(quote taken from <a href=""http://www.processing.org/learning/gettingstarted/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.processing.org/learning/gettingstarted/</a>)",1231636324
