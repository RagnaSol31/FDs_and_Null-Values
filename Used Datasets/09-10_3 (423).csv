To me, the value added by the IDE - autocomplete, extra method, generate getters and setters, find references completely, utterly and totally blow text editors out of the water. I wouldn't waste my time reinventing the wheel on a new text editor. If I were super motivated, I'd write eclipse plugins to do whatever I needed.

In fact, as I pointed out, most of the apps on the top of the chart are <i>not</i> $0.99.<p>More importantly, though, is that the charts are just one tool. They offer insight into what is <i>already selling</i> on the store. The charts aren't voodoo, and you don't just magically appear on them one day. Sure, they have an obvious positive impact on sales, but it has absolute no effect on the ability of other apps to sell or make it onto the charts themselves.<p>Changing the way the charts work is a bad idea, for a lot of reasons. The most important is that the proposed solutions are even easier to game then the current system. The real solution to the perceived problem is to add more ways to discover apps.<p>Search on the store needs work, and ""featured"" is entirely editorial (and the choices aren't that great in my opinion). More ways to find new products like a ""movers and shakers"" view, a ""top rated"" view, etc, are better ways Apple could actually improve the situation for developers and customers.",1229738025.0

11,404125,comment,404009.0,404009.0,0,0,mdasen,,,"I don't believe that programming is something you need to just get.  I've seen a lot of people struggle on assignments like these as a TA.  Usually, it's that they're missing certain concepts, but they don't know which ones and they can't debug themselves.  If you know 70% of basic Java, you won't be able to create a working solution.  You'll get tripped up on a type mismatch error that just makes you bonkers until you give up because you don't know what the error message means or you tried to make a templated array rather than an Object array and casting it to a templated array or whatnot.<p>There are lots of little pitfalls in programming that are just terrible.  In C, you can just walk off the end of an array (or the beginning).  In Java, you can store an object in an array and then modify that object in both the array copy and the one you have in a regular variable because Java works by reference, not by copy.  A lot of the time, you just need someone who is a lot more learned in programming to notice that.  It's not that you don't get a concept like object references, it's that if it's not in your mind, you don't notice when your code does it and it takes a long time for these things to really get into your mind to the point that you catch them fast.<p>And most people give up.  You get hit enough times with silly things like these and you just want out unless you're truly dedicated.  I know when I was learning, I hit all the trap doors.  It's why I noticed them when other students made them.  Heck, back in the old days of Java, you could easily screw up things like int vs. Integer and not notice it - especially since a lot of professors might not make a distinction because for veteran programmers, we know that pitfall, but also because its place is at the start where students get inundated with syntax and such a distinction might go unnoticed (or abbreviated as int in notes).<p>I would think schools should hire more TAs to help students through those pitfalls except that most students like to do assignments at the last minute where these errors become the source of the mind-breaking stress.",1229737945.0

These contexts may run highly detailed simulations (including the core ""where I am"") or more abstract thinking (including the current conversational or semantic context). For a human being, the ""primary simulation"" results in a powerful feeling of self, perhaps because the here and now that you are feeling is also the here and now that you are simulating.<p>While sustaining these contexts, the system is able to explore related information and can choose to break focus on a certain context, or to open a new context. Usually, a discarded context can be quickly restored, such as in the case of restoring an interrupted thought. Perhaps, then, contexts are continually run, stored, and restored. I don't know. What I do know is that the primary world simulation (with its continual sensory update) is rarely broken without the system electing to do so.<p>That would be ""losing consciousness"" :)<p>Whether received through sensory input or through memory in the form of stored simulations or related concepts, the constant exploration of related information influences the context that spawned it (and often the other contexts as well).
