It doesn't matter if the javascript engine is fast if the page looks like crap or developers continue to spend a lot of time trying to get a consistent experience across browsers.,1258696603.0

Instead we've changed the culture so most of this generation starts their working lives with tens of thousands of dollars in debt.

How do you use which state--or country's--law will apply. A contract isn't just an agreement, it's an attempt to predict the future. Because U.S. law is forever changing, it's difficult to know what it is likely to be. \nBut I don't think that the ""language that survives"" in contracts is necessarily opaque because of Darwinian principles.
