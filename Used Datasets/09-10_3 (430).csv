Like many revolutionary products the iPhone isn't the first device to ever offer these features but it IS the first device to make them accessible to the masses. Part of that is a good user interface but an equally, or possibly more, important part of it is advertising. Apple educated customers on what the device could do out of the box. Now they're even advertising third party apps. As a result many people are able to use services & technologies that were out of reach to them before -- or they were ignorant these things even existed. Lots of people will say marketing doesn't matter and it's just fluff and blah blah but making people aware of something, and making it possible for them to use it, is a huge part of what makes a technology revolutionary.",1245981565

I really like hearing about this kind of hacking vs using something like provigil.<p>My experience has been that I can function with less sleep (4-5 hours with 1/2 hour nap), but less optimally, eventually. The naps can often be very refreshing, and sustaining even, but eventually it's not enough. At least for me. I've done these sleep patterns for about 6 months at a time - with longer sleep once a week.<p>Exercise (more precisely, blood flow to the brain) makes a big difference for me.

I needed to keep track of billable hours across often 3,5,7, or more projects and tasks (and categorizations of work type) at a time, and manual recording was just not cutting it.<p>This was a Windows shop, and I found, of all things, a little AutoHotKey script whose interface was, in the main, exactly what I was looking for.<p>At a predetermined interval, it would pop up a dialog asking whether I was still doing the same thing.  The dialog was on top but did NOT steal focus.  If I was in the middle of typing something, I could continue uninterrupted.<p>If I was doing the same thing, one click to dismiss.  If not, I could select one of an active set of items from a dropdown list, and time recording would start logging that item instead.  If I was doing something new, I could type it into the textbox at the head of the dropdown list, and it would become the identifier for the new record.  No additional dialog or multiple step set up:  Just type it in and go.<p>Also, if I remembered to do so, upon context switch I could click its icon in the taskbar to get the same prompt immediately.<p>Data was saved as simple CSV or similar.

A subset of records would have their start and/or stop times recorded incorrectly.   I could fix them manually, when summing and reconciling, but grumble.<p>2)  I would have liked a further interface to tweak records on the fly, for when I recorded the wrong item, got called away from my desk, or whatever, while the program continued to measure my time under the last/wrong event.<p>I never got around to learning AutoHotKey's scripting and improving it.<p>That job is over with, now.

I actually fully agree with the principle that it shouldn't matter much at all who says something, as long as there are facts to back up what the person says. I have said so before here on HN.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=555734"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=555734</a><p>But on two recent occasions, I have seen submissions that were so flat wrong (this is the second occasion) that it would take serious work to reply to the wrong factual statements in detail, and meanwhile I felt it important to buy time by registering immediate factual disagreement with the author by the general statement that the author is not an acknowledged expert on the issue discussed in the submitted article. In both cases, I kind of half expected that someone who agreed with the author would refer to verifiable facts that might support the author's conclusion, but in neither case did that happen.<p>The kind of reply that takes time and effort to make to a factually mistaken submission I have made in another place in this thread. Yes, in principle anyone or no one might have a correct statement about a matter of fact to add to one of our interesting discussions here. I hope that if people have statements of fact to make about controversial issues such as how much human genetic limitations constrain the improvement of education, then they will take care to cite verifiable sources for the crucial factual statements and join issue with those who disagree with the factual statements.",1245978026
