1,1256165,comment,1255858.0,1255858.0,0,0,glhaynes,,,"This makes an interesting thought experiment: what if Adobe decides to take on Apple directly by throwing their weight behind Apple's main competitor, Android. CS5.1 is shipped as a free upgrade to CS5 and replaces the iPhone-compiler with an Android-compiler. Organizations with existing Flash content decide that they had might as well do a quick/dirty port of their apps using CS5.1.<p>What will the results of this be?<p>* Lots of Flash content gets released on Android. This expands Android's software market considerably, though with a cost in performance/platform-integration (both in terms of UI and in terms of taking advantage of low-level capabilities).<p>* Many of the best/most popular and money-making Flash apps will get an iPhone OS-native port. The cost to write an iPhone app is relatively low; if you're talking about a game, the vast majority of the cost is usually in the assets. The iPhone developer tools are very good, there are lots of developers: finding an iPhone developer willing to make a native port of your game engine isn't difficult or expensive relative to the number of users you open up your investment to. Thus iPhone potentially gets the best version of many originally-Flash apps.<p>Thus, Android continues to have more possibilities (theoretical and, in some cases, actual), but a lower overall level of quality, integration, and performance... an issue its apps are already widely accused of. And iPhone, which has a tremendous lead in number of apps, loses out on a few — again, a fairly unpopular set which would have generally not fit in on the platform as well and would have slowed Apple's ability to require adoption of new platform capabilities.<p>It's hard to see the downside to Apple here. And it's hard to see how this does anything but make Android less attractive and iPhone more attractive for most mainstream (the overwhelming majority) users.",1270951101.0

Facebook absolutely will launch a friend finder (although they'll have privacy problems and they'll have to be careful) so most friend finders will get crushed.\n2. most current sites are confusing- don't actually understand what they do within 10 to 30 seconds of looking at the site.

We don't all write in processor-specific assembler because it's not (developer-time) efficient, and because we can accomplish a given task without having to resort to such a low level. For example, it's far more efficient to write in higher-level C and compile for the platform as necessary. The entirety of the software development ecosystem is ""intermediary layers"". C compiled to a platform target with GCC is sure as hell an ""intermediary layer"".<p>I can't help but think that what Jobs means here is ""intermediary layers that aren't ours automatically produce inferior products"".

It's not the quality (Titanium mobile apps are nearly indistinguishable from most iPhone apps), the speed of development (like you said, not having to use Objective-C). Unfortunately it is probably protectionism. To protect the dominance of the AppStore.

And to get that you need a salesforce and so on.] And with all this, the cost of making one successful sale is going to average about $50,000.
