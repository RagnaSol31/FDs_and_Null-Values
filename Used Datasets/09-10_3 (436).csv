To paraphrase an insightful author (who I cannot remember right now), it is an expensive device: apart from the initial investment, you will be paying Apple in order to tailor the device to your own desires, whether that involves downloading an app, a book, or a magazine to read.<p>Also, there's something else that gives me something to consider before contemplating another Apple purchase: the whole Flash dilemma seems to fit in too well with Apple's business goals for everything to be about Adobe being 'lazy' and having a poor-quality product in Flash. While Adobe may have its issues (can have high RAM requirements, particularly in Linux), I think they have enough talent that it could be fixed, at least for target platforms (probably not Linux, sadly, but at least popular mobile devices). On the other hand, Apple has no reason to allow flash. Why would you buy a $5 game if there were other, ad-supported versions that you could get for free through Safari?<p>I'm not panning Apple in general.

That's just not possible for books. (Though it might eventually be possible for digital books, DRM or no.)<p>I think it even might be legal, and it's certainly low-risk, for you to buy a book, slice off the binding, feed every page through OCR and put the result into any format that you like for your personal use... but it's so much work that you'd probably rather spend the five or ten bucks and cope with the different book-reading interfaces. (If you're interested, though, I hear the Fujitsu Scansnap is pretty nice.)<p>The other factor is piracy, of course. Perhaps the need to compete against pirated books will eventually drive the book industry to shed DRM. I do wonder, though. Counterintuitively, books really may be harder to pirate than digital music -- at least for now, and for my taste -- because the lowest-common-denominator format is plain text, and plain text can be painful to read. After spending five minutes reading a Project Gutenberg book on the iPhone the other day, and tripping over poor spacing, miserable hyphenation, and misplaced chapter breaks the whole time, I found myself craving the ability to spend three bucks on a version that had been laid out by a competent typographer.<p>What I hope is going to happen is that eleven different iPhone reader apps will come out, and compete, and the profit margins will flow to the one that lets artists and typographers lay out the books in a thoughtful manner, and then everyone will copy that one. But, even if I get my wish, we might have to suffer through years of garbage first, just as we did with CD-ROMs, or laser printers, or the early days of HTML when the blink tag and the animated GIF roamed far and wide.",1270257857

But that's not an argument for the iPad being a creative tool. It is not part of the process of utilizing its own SDK.<p>Until I can add features to an iPhone/iPad without shelling out for one of Apple's ""real"" computers, I will consider the iPad a consumption-only, and thus an unnecessary, device.",1270256658

64,1237939,story,,,133,165,johnswamps,Ask HN: got any food hacks?,,"I'm having trouble finding a way of consuming food that has an optimal balance of being healthy, cheap, quick, and tasty. I don't want to eat ramen (or most processed foods), but I don't want to spend an hour every day preparing, cooking, and cleaning. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions to share (tips, recipes, whatever). I'm a single grad student, but advice for others is also appreciated.<p>For example, I remember an HN submission where the writer talked about paying someone who lived nearby and cooked well to drop off leftovers most evenings. Someone else talked about preparing a whole bunch of meals the first weekend of the month then freezing them (this probably requires a second fridge). From the body building community I picked up the idea to drink a lot of milk, because it's a great source of cheap good calories. I'm not necessarily looking for actions so drastic and perhaps ""gimmicky"", simpler ideas would work just as well (""making such-and-such is really quick and makes a bunch of leftovers that taste just as good as the first time"", etc.)",1270256540
