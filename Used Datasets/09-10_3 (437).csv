1,1157886,comment,1157280.0,1157565.0,0,0,z8000,,,"I thought of this idea the other day and got stuck on how to best push messages to hanging clients in a generic way instead of the simple requestNumber request-response correlation here.  I ended up just making it app specific and either generating a unique client ID per hanging connection (a UUID) or using the username of the logged-in human using the hanging client.<p>Anyway, this is a nice architecture indeed.<p>However, as a pure proxy, I would think nginx would be more appropriate for its (albeit poor but swappable) load balancing, rate limiting (a 3rd-party module), caching (memcache, redis), and general volume of usage.<p>In fact, there's the beginnings of a nginx upstream based redis module that supports redis' GET that could be made to RPUSH and BLPOP the result.<p>FWIW, I'm the author of redis-node-client. It should be noted that Promises were removed in favor of continuations in the latest Node.js on Github and I've updated redis-node-client appropriately. Thus, the sample code in the article is outdated by 2 days or so.<p>Using LPOP in a polling loop to wait for the response is not that great of an idea. It would be better to use BLPOP or ""blocking left pop"" which blocks the client connection (think ""long polling"") until there's something in the given list to pop. It does not waste resources and the results are returned in much less than the worst case (e.g. 100ms here). I haven't added BLPOP to redis-node-client yet though but it should be simple to patch.<p>To scale this beyond a single frontend, popFromQueue could potentially put the response back via LPUSH when the queuedRes[requestNumber] is nil... ""Oops, this wasn't for me, let me put that back."" Or, it could/should use something more formal.<p>Why does the Ruby worker shell out to redis-cli instead of using Ezra's client library?<p>Finally, ""The previous spike..."" What does ""spike"" mean here?",1267408663

Its actually shockingly easy to brew amazing tasting black tea that is in the coffee- expresso strength in terms of caffeine.<p>First of all: Get loose leaf black tea, trying out several varieties to find a baseline one you like. Black tea is the simplest to brew of all the caffeinated tea variants. You'll also want to experiment with water temperature, steeping time (not that long, else you'll get the bitter flavor bits that no one like), and how you go about steeping (i\n've found that disposable tea bags that I can fill with loose tea is best for me). I've fine tuned this process for myself to the point that I can make super strong tea that also naturally tastes sweet!<p>The mistake that many people make with tea vs coffee is that they equate the jitteriness with the caffeine working. In tea, there is also theanine, which moderates the jitters that occur due to caffeine via being a very mild muscle relaxant, and I am lead to believe that theanine has been found to have wholely positive cognitive effects generally.<p>That being said, coffee or tea are only helpful if you have a caffeine dependency, or you are amidst being tired/groggy to an extent that interferes with work. If your issues with doing work are not those, drink the tea anyways because its tasty, healthy and easier on the stomach/body than equivalent volumes of coffee (also tasty) or sugary(real or fake) energy drinks. and/or go talk with a doctor to figure out why you can't do work.",1267407740
