I'm looking to hire/partner and want to make sure I'm doing what I can to recruit and inspire the best technologists available.<p>Since my job is basically to handle everything other than development, including keeping my developer partner happy, are there any tips the HN community can share for inspiring and keeping the best developers?",1262742984.0

From my experience they do not benefit from iterative development the same way we do. They do but they iterate when solving the problem, usually on paper. If they make a design mistake and it's in production or prototype phase it's much more costly to address. And because of this development cycles are longer and a lot more time is spent upfront.<p>I've watched and assisted mechanical engineers that spent days working out the math on the reliability of a class of lasers (and belts, motors, fans) subjected to sitting in a warehouse, followed by periodic motion and change in atmospheric conditions then launched (missile launch or space launch).<p>After the analysis was complete I could code up the math in a matter of minutes. Then expose it to all sorts of boundary cases and add it into a mathematical model of the entire system. Sometimes, at this point, it would go back to analysis to address some new found issues.<p>I have great respect for such engineers. Solving real life problems, like this, thoroughly is worlds away from what most programmers enjoy - creating.<p>EDITED: Clarifications ~",1262742951.0

When I look on craigslist, I see serviced offices and subleases that run $12-14 per square ft. Even if you expect 25% overhead for DSL, power, whatever, on a 2,000 square foot office space we're talking $2,500 - $2,900/square foot. Share that with 15 people, that's $166 - $199/month/person.",1262740087.0
