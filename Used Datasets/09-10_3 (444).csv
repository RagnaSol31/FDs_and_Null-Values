One $700 Sony laptop that I tested had a screen that flexed diagonally if I closed it with one hand.<p>Another medium grade laptop (I think it was a Dell) had a body that flexed inward if I laid my hands on it between typing.<p>In contrast my MacBook feels sturdy and dependable.  I can throw it in my backpack without needing to cushion it in a bulky laptop bag because I know it can take it.<p>And I am confident that over time my MacBook will pay for itself in lack of need for repairs.  As far as the single mouse button goes I just plug in an external mouse and work away.  But over time you do get used to the two finger on the touchpad right click.,1255053531

Most property investors (myself included) are mindful that equity growth in real estate, when it happens, is normally only a few % points above inflation - it's profitable because you leverage a bank's money - you only put in a small amount of cash, so those few % points are pretty good against your investment. A simple example that clearly ignores interest costs, maintenance etc<p><pre><code>  I put 10% ($30K) into a $300K apartment, and owe a bank $270K. \n  The market grows by 5%, so the apartment is now worth $315K \n  but I still only owe the bank $270K so my $30K has grown to $45K\n  a 50% return.\n</code></pre>\nNow if you need an investor to put in a sizeable chunk, that equation will be different.<p><pre><code>  I put 40% ($120K) into the same $300K apartment. \n  After the growth of 5%, my $120K is worth $135K. \n  That's a 12.5% return.\n</code></pre>\nAt the upper extreme, if I invest 100% of the property my growth is 5% - better than bank interest in the US at the moment, but only just. Not an attractive deal (and I still haven't factored in interest and other cashflow costs).<p>So that's my response to your out-of-the-box idea - for it to help you (by reducing or removing rent / mortgage costs) it probably won't be attractive to an investor (smaller returns than more diversified investment). Happy to be proved wrong, and different investors do have different needs!",1255050163

Non technical people almost never delete their cookies (at least from what I've seen).<p>The way I've tackled it before is let them do X first (select their celebs lets say) without registering. Drop the cookie and create a user record linked to it. Then tell them that if they register they can access their list from any computer (work and home are big sellers). It's pretty effective for getting registrations and you shouldn't encounter as many problems as you think you will. If you're encountering a lot of trouble getting users to register, give it a try for a couple of weeks and see if you get more adoption.<p>Alternatively you could let them pick their celebs first, then make them register. It's kind of annoying for the user but let's them see what's available (and get a little invested) before registration.<p>Anyway, just my 2c.",1255050109
