The food industry has caught on to the organic trend and there are now organic factory farms which are only slightly better than non-organic factory farms.  And organic guidelines don't prohibit the use of some pesticides.  Granted, what they might use isn't as bad, but it is pesticide nonetheless.",1237079116.0

That way, when you need to pull down some new code (but not any media assets) you can just do that, but everything is still being tracked by the superproject.<p>Also, keep in mind that git will hash all of a commit at once. So if 500 2k files changed in a commit, the time spent hashing should be almost the same as hashing a 1MB file.",1237079010.0

Thus, as I said earlier, dose is not relevant.""</i><p>Is that based on your personal experience, your (unsubstantiated) belief, or any scientific data? This is an honest question. Though I have smoked pot, I never smoked more than one joint per night.<p>Sure it's none of my business how much other people consume just as long as no one gets harmed. But you're assuming that people are responsible and most people aren't. Murder is murder, but there are accidents that could be avoided if people were not mind-altered. And I am referring to alcohol, not pot.<p>I don't think it would be too ridiculous to hold pot to a higher standard than alcohol, for instance. Solely for practical reasons. Alcohol is legal. Pot is not. If imposing caps on consumption would reduce the resistance to the legalization of pot, then it COULD be worth considering. This is speculation. I am not saying it would be worth it, I am just saying one should not discard any possibilities without a more in-depth analysis.",1237078817.0
