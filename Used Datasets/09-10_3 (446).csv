4,799298,comment,799050.0,799208.0,0,0,rimantas,,,"Actually there are two different things—the parser and the rendering mode. The choice of the former depends solely on the MIME type—no matter that docypte you use if your page is served with text/html MIME it will be parsed by HTML parser. And keep in mind, that every slash in ""/>"" is treated as invalid attribute by this parser, so serving your XHTML page as text/html may be not the best idea. BTW, do ""view source"" of such page in Firefox 3 and you will see all slashes in red.<p>And if you did happen to server XHTML with proper MIME there could well be the case that your page would take longer to load on Gecko <1.9 — it did not support incremental rendering of XHTML so your document had to be fully loaded before it could be rendered.<p>HTML engine choses rendering mode (standards, almost standards, quirks) depending on DOCTYPE (for XHTML parser it is always standards mode). HTML engine must be always ready to recover from markup errors (and HTML5 does a good job describing what to do), XHTML parser can just die on the first error it encounters.",1251856636

Cinderella probably had her boring days once she was ""living happily ever after"", but the week or so it took to get hitched by the prince WAS just as dramatic as all that, and the outcome was worthy of the drama.<p>I think because high stakes and high drama processes DO happen in real life, we simulate them with vicarious experiences of narrative so we can be ready mentally.  If we don't digest stories beforehand, we won't have a model for when we discover we have cancer, risk losing a job or a deal, court a loved one, try to get accepted to an ivy league school, etc.<p>And if there isn't SOME drama in your life with real stakes and real risks, you probably need to go out and take on some challenges.
