Building in-browser clients on a JavaScript XMPP client saves developer effort and aids interop, because each web client isn't inventing its own ad-hoc buggy mutated version of the protocol, based essentially on the same semantics, but with arbitrary changes to syntax.<p><a href=""http://orbited.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orbited.org/</a><p><a href=""http://js.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://js.io/</a>",1249869571.0

Think 60 Twinkies a day plus a 3000 calorie diet.<p>Even at much less intense levels, it's challenging to eat as much as necessary to maintain weight <i>if you have a healthy diet</i>.  When I was training 100 miles a week (not all that much for a serious cyclist) I ate around 3300 calories a day.  If my diet included stuff like Big Macs and triple mochas with a muffin, that would be easy.  But if you aren't in the habit of eating lots of processed and fast foods, it's actually quick a bit of work to eat that much.",1249869554.0

However, since many of them are fundamentally old-school marketers, their metric for matters is Successful Product Launch and to do a Successful Product Launch you have to make a lot of noise.  Indeed, absence of noise means a failure.<p>Six weeks later it isn't their problem anymore.<p>This is not how I would suggest thinking about web design for most people here.  Web design supports business goals.  Redesigns support business goals.  You measure business goals, when they go up as a result of a redesign, you bust out the freaking party hats.  When your talented design firm goes off and produces a heartbreaking work of staggering genius that succeeds in reducing conversion by 23%, you thank them for their time, exchange a firm handshake, and do the next project better.<p>Now, as a fact of life, you are probably going to learn that ""pretty"" and ""converts well"" have very little to do with each other, and that a lot of iterative improvement beats the everloving stuffing out of big-bang redesigns.  (Don't take my word for it.  Collect data and run the numbers.  I'm right, but your designers won't believe me until they see the numbers.  They probably won't believe me after they see the numbers, either.  That is when you fire them.)<p>I know a lot of designers chafe under the notion that the best possible use of their time is probably creating 96 different versions of the signup button in slightly different shades of red to test against each other.  Yeah, life sucks that way -- I didn't get into CS to do SQL optimization for CRUD reports, either.  I suggest taking up a hobby.  When you're on the clock, do productive work.",1249868595.0

Even if it doubles several more times, you still don't have enough to launch a very ambitious future endeavor but all along you're risking a random decline in a huge, valuable, and concentrated asset.<p>Assuming your goals include having a family and secure financial life for yourself and them, I would be inclined to start taking money off the table as soon as I could be taking it off in $250m to $500m chunks. Not to say you need to sell it all, or even a controlling interest, but having had experiences of deep 6-figure losses in my trading account (which is extremely liquid 12 hours of every day with very low slippage), I know that I'd sleep a lot better with $300-500m off the table, and then get back to work growing the remaining 75% of the company into your multi-million.<p>I would seriously consider though still taking on your second big endeavor with outside investors.

Trenchant observation, old fizgig!<p>To be fair, I've read a couple of articles like that and (to me, at least) they've been interesting because they'll sometimes explain the approach they had to take to support state in something as interactive as a game. So I always have a kind of <i>morbid</i> fascination with Haskell articles. It's so foreign; like a silicon-based life form. Still, my morbid fascinations will lead me to find those articles on my own, and do, before I see them linked on HN.<p>But if our goal is to ""smelt an ever-purer"" HN, it seems we should only submit a link to 'implementation of Canonical Application X in language L' if it answers one or both of the following:<p>1) How is the approach (non-trivially) different in L than in most languages? Did the language make something harder or easier? Why?<p>2) What about the implementer's experience is of value to us? Any gotchas to look out for?",1249866443.0

I would make this argument myself, but it has already been made pretty well by PG:<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/boss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/boss.html</a>\nStartup founders seem to be working in a way that's more natural for humans...each species thrives in groups of a certain size...groups of 8 work well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50 is really unwieldy.<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a>\nYou could probably work twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if you focus you can probably get three times as much done in an hour.
