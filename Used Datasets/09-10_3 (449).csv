I can tell you now that a small guy working from the bottom up with individual institutions is much better placed to solve real problems than a top-down bureaucracy. The only hurdle is convincing them that they can trust your system with confidential and life-critical data.,1231898221.0

Well, suppose you had asked me to pay a nickel to read this comment thread.  I value my own time at about a hundred dollars an hour.  I've already spent more than a nickel of time reading this thread, so clearly I should have been willing to pay a nickel to read it.  But the mental decision point on whether to cross the penny gap or not, plus the amount of friction it would take for me to authorize this transaction (fish out credit card, type in digits, sign in, click ""Are you sure you want to pay $.05 to this merchant?"", yadda yadda), is worth far more than a nickel of frustration to me.  That increases the cost of the content to me but it is revenue that <i>you don't capture</i>.<p>Rather than selling things for micropayments, do what essentially everybody does in this space: sell a microcurrency in macro-units ($10, $20, etc), and then make authorizations to spend the microcurrency as friction free as possible.  For getting over that penny gap on the first transaction, you probably want to give people a significant incentive to buy their first hit of microcurrency -- 100 dragon eggs for $5 instead of $10 like usual, whatever.<p>Clarifying edit: for non-Americans reading this comment, it might be useful to know that a nickel is .05 USD and a penny is .01 USD.
