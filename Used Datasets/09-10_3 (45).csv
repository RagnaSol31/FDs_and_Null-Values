A very brief evidence of this fact are those that exercise all the time (hence have both elevated breathing and water intake, and yet don't gain weight.)<p>Regarding the tree, you're absolutely right. If only you were a tree that would be a useful comment. Unfortunatly the metabolic process of a tree (all plants) is different to that of an animal. A plant requires water, carbon dioxide and sunlight. Throght the process of photo-synthesis (which only plants can do) carbon is removed from the atmosphere using sunlight as the primary fuel. So, if you like a plant ""breaths"" sunlight, ""eats"" air and defecates oxygen.",1305868981.0

For comparison, the Tyler/Longview (nearest city of size that isn't a suburb of the other) area has about 415,000 people.  The population of the next-nearest major area in Texas?  Dallas/Fort Worth at 6.6 million people.

There is a reason why hackers gravitate towards Silicon Valley: people like to be with other people who are doing the same thing.  Tyler is by no means dumb.  As the author--who admittedly also posted here that he didn't want to debate the article--points out, there are two universities (University of Texas-affiliated, I might add) and two junior colleges.  The area is also home to pipe and robotics companies.  It is also very insular, especially when it comes to ""being shown how things are done"" because the Dallas area has been the older, wiser brother to Tyler for decades.<p>Oh, and ""nothing about local politics?""
