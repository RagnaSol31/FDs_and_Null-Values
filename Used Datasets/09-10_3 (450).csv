11,1021733,comment,1020568.0,1021103.0,0,0,spc476,,,"The only call to killing non-believers in the Old Testament (Jewish religion) is Leviticus 24:16 (King James translation), ""And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.""  One other passage, Exodus 22:18 (""Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live"") may be construed as such, but there's some controversy over the term ""witch""---the original Hewbrew word also means ""poisoner"".<p>In the New Testament (Christianity) there isn't a clear cut statement about killing the unbeliever.  There is Matthew 1:34, ""Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword"" and Luke 22:36, ""Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one"" but no direct commandment to otherwise kill the unbeliever.<p>In the Koran, I found three passages that directly state the killing of unbelievers (translation by Mohammad Habib Shakir):<p>2.191 And kill them wherever you find them, and drive them out from whence they drove you out, and persecution is severer than slaughter, and do not fight with them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight with you in it, but if they do fight you, then slay them; such is the recompense of the unbelievers.<p>4.98 They desire that you should disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so that you might be (all) alike; therefore take not from among them friends until they fly (their homes) in Allah's way; but if they turn back, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and take not from among them a friend or a helper.<p>4.91 You will find others who desire that they should be safe from you and secure from their own people; as often as they are sent back to the mischief they get thrown into it headlong; therefore if they do not withdraw from you, and (do not) offer you peace and restrain their hands, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them; and against these We have given you a clear authority.<p>And one passage about killing those that wage war against Islam:<p>5.33 The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement,<p>I only looked for passages that directly stated it was okay to kill unbelievers; I did not look for mor subtle passages that implied such.

27,1021717,comment,1020845.0,1020845.0,0,0,strait,,,"Asking this question is a good place to start, but the answer goes way beyond mere reluctance. I would say that many people are very intelligent in ways that outstrip their ability to communicate this knowledge effectively.  Natural written languages are very blunt instruments in contrast to the highly-involved abstract concepts that our brains are capable of 'discovering'.  Some things are very difficult to explain effectively and take much patience, forethought, style, and lengthy prose.  Fewer are talented in this area, or you might say that certain skill sets intersect less frequently. (Talented writers and talented mathmeticians/scientists). Even great professors often struggle with explaining things in layman's terms.<p>Take the English laguage, for example.  Very flexible, but still feeble at tranferring highly abstract concepts.  It wasn't designed/evolved for this purpose, so this is not surprising.  Talented writers can get quite far on the abstraction scale, before text becomes a verbose and confusing mess, but there must exist a potential space for a future spoken/written language to be created, better suited for explaining abstractions, somewhere between the current common natural languages and terse mathematical notation (which itself requires much textual explanation).",1262136229.0

40,1021700,comment,1020427.0,1021346.0,0,0,dalke,,,"I talked about TDD as a testing system and as a development system. You, like Beck, say it's only the latter, so I'll restrict myself to that aspect of it as well.<p>Worst case scenarios cannot be left to the test framework neither can good test cases. Leaving them out means the code is going to reflect an optimistic view of the requirement. A more pessimistic view may well entail extensive changes to the code, just like a more optimistic view may well be a lookup table if only two values are tested.<p>I never promoted the calling a function every possible way. In most cases that would take too long to be called a unit test. On the other hand, if there are only two possible ways then I would go ahead and do those as unit tests.<p>When I talked about ""confidence"" I referred to it as minimizing doubt. Other than a few cases of formalized testing or complete enumeration, I agree with you that you cannot be confident that the program works, if the interpretation of confident is ""100% certainty."" However, confidence has multiple shades of meaning, such as ""I'm confident that I'll live to see 2010"" when I know that that's not 100% for sure. In software the statement of confidence is more ""I'm confident that the software is deployable with an acceptable risk and cost of failure."" I don't think TDD leads to that level of confidence.<p>My position is like yours - 100% coverage is rarely worth the cost. I managed to get 99.8% coverage in a code base last year and failed to get 100% because I couldn't test two malloc failures without a day or two of additional work which clearly wasn't justifiable. My comment was the weaker statement that TDD does naturally lead to 100% coverage.<p>I wasn't talking about changing a developed API, my example was coming up with the API in the first place. If I develop the tests while I experiment with API and possible implementations then it's extra work with little benefit, and an obvious cost of time spent to develop those tests and modify them as the API changes.<p>What's wrong with OCP? As far as I can tell, what's wrong is the name. How is OCP different than ""code reuse"" and ""reusable software libraries""?<p>I've just now done some shallow research on this. Meyer's original form promoted implementation inheritance, which is one of the forms of code reuse I've done. Martin's form of OCP promotes abstract interfaces, and I've grown prefer concrete interfaces. He specifically eschews public attributes and global variables, as being against OCP. I use them, but then again I also use Python, where these have different meaning than C++.<p>I'll also point out that Martin's form of OCP mentions ""software entities"" but really seems to mean ""classes"" based on the examples he gives. Template metaprogramming and Lisp macros seem to be two of many techniques that aren't mentioned in his discussions. For less esoteric topics, neither is Javascript code inserted into a web page during HTML template evaluation, nor dynamic code generation (eg, with LLVM), nor any place which takes an eval(). Those seem to be cases which can be quite useful and yet are counter to OCP.<p>As for your last paragraph, you've said that unit tests are totally different than TDD, but here you seem to say they are part of the same concept. My point is that good software development styles give the consequences you mention there. While TDD is one method people have used to learn good development technique, it isn't the only. Other development techniques must be learned, and these are not part of TDD as it's taught. My assertion is that TDD adds little to those techniques and as such isn't at best a weak concept.",1262135485.0

You're thinking balance sheet.  Administrative costs for Medicare and the VA are far, far lower than any insurance company.  It's a fact.  And that's before you consider that the insurance companies are taking out profits on top of that.  This isn't an indictment of the ideas of markets in general -- this is more a statement that insurance companies aren't in anything resembling 'markets' and have no accountability to anyone.  Who else gets away with 15-20% yearly rate hikes for a decade?  They're getting <i>less</i> efficient.<p>Similar story for SS.  Per dollar managed, they're orders of magnitude lower in fees than any organization on the planet, because they process a ton of money through a dead-simple operation.  Any inherent differences between ""public and private"" are noise compared to those fundamentals.  It's not about public and private.  If you want, you can argue that they should be doing more complicated things instead..  but then I think about my parents' impending retirement, their 401k recently, and am pretty glad that they kept it simple.<p>So anyways -- you're entitled to your own philosophical opinions about whether things like medicare and SS should exist -- but factually, they're much more efficient at what they do than any private sector equivalent.  Also, what they do would most likely never be done by the private sector on it's own.  If you think it just shouldn't be done, that's a coherent position of course.",1262135473.0

Now let's not give the propaganda machine any ideas ;-)<p>Of course, one is plausable and the other is not. One is also a hyperbole to illustrate the point.  Basically, in the last 10 years we had about 400 people/year die of terrorism on average (took 9/11 number and spread them over 9 years).  There is a higher chance of being shot by your neighborhood cop than dying from terrorism. Now that's plausable. So lock up all the policemen in jail, that's more effective at preventing American death than what the TSA has been doing.<p>The point was that TSA in all these years has nothing to show for. There have been bombing attempts but they have been stopped by near by passengers and/or air marshals.<p>By now, instead of millions of harassed citizens TSA should have had a glass display case of at least a couple dozen explosive devices + some terrorists behind bars.",1262134990.0
