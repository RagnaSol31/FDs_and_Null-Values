19,1274201,story,,,4,1,AlexBlom,Ask HN: Help me beta TConsolidate.com,,"	Hi All,<p>I’m hoping a few of you can take the time to help beta test a Twitter app I have been tinkering with. The purpose of this application is to prevent direct message spam.<p>This is achieved by allowing users to set up custom spam filters. YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE YOUR OWN SPAM FILTER UPON REGISTRATION! Any message that does not pass this spam filter is stopped from hitting your Twitter inbox (though it does not do a constant fetch) but a local copy will be kept by the script in your ‘Spam’ folder for review incase it was important. The script will also send you e-mails (at your choice of interval) telling you which messages were blocked that it thought were spam for your review. While there are other functions in the script itself (i.e. create folders, save local copies of DM’s) the main use of this script should be to setup a DM filter and let the e-mails tell you what was blocked.<p>The website to join up is Tconsolidate.com and signup should safely link with your Twitter account via Oauth. Keep in mind this has simply been a hobby project of mine in my spare time. I am aware most links do not work on the website but they should within the script itslf. Any feedback is appreciated.<p>What this script should do for you (the two big ones are key): • Send you daily, weekly or monthly reports on all of your received direct messages • Allow you to create custom SPAM filters to filter some messages into SPAM (let me know if you need help setting this up) o Spam messages should never hit your Twitter.com inbox • Allow you to create folders and move DM's to easily categorize and save the good ones • Easy and fast maintenance / cleaning of your inbox • Blacklist some users so you never get their DM's<p>Issues I already know about: • I know graphically this is ugly right now • Server response time might at times be slow • Broken links (ie Help, WTF) Things I'd love for you to especially look for: • Is the signup process clean and simple? • When joining were you forced to put in your e-mail address? • Are you receiving the correct reports (ignore formatting) • Is the SPAM filter you established workign and stopping messages from hitting your Twitter.com inbox? • Folders etc working cleanly for you?<p>Cheers, Alex",1271558474

22,1274197,comment,1273923.0,1274174.0,0,0,natrius,,,"Search ads are very different from content ads. People click on search ads because they look like search results and they often give the user what they were looking for. There isn't a huge quality difference between search engines, so sticking ads everywhere would likely lead to an exodus of users.<p>Content ads make money because people see something that catches their eye while reading the content they came to the site for. This requires having several ad spots rather than just a couple at the top of search results. Content is usually unique, so there's a high annoyance bar to reach before you start to drive people away.<p>Yes, fewer ads make the ads shown more effective. I remember Hulu ads more often than I remember TV ads. (Then again, I watch far more Hulu than TV these days.) The problem with this approach is that advertisers aren't willing to pay enough money to cover the losses from showing fewer ads.<p>What you and the author are suggesting is a demonstrably unsuccessful strategy for someone who is running a website until you can convince advertisers to pay more money for ads with less competition on the page.

This is the case even when the analysis is the exact same or very similar as the original. You either need to copy formulas over for every data set/sheet or write VBA code to automate this, which still isn't as flexible as in R.""<p>In certain circumstances you are right. Wanting to use the same spreadsheet for a very, very similar task is often annoying. This can be avoided if you knew from the start that you wanted to make something more reusable, but sadly that isn't always the case. Of course there are ways of automating them (VBA as you mentioned, or DB connections when appropriate, sometimes UDF, or just organizing the data in the correct way) but this is definitely one of my major annoyances.<p>""Excel has indexing capabilities (F5 which goes to an address), but not by row/column names.""<p>Actually with the name manager you can do this. Simply name the row(s) and column(s) you want to index by, press F5, and type ""my_col,my_row"" and you are there. It even does the ""and"" selection for you, which you can easily exit out of if you want. Not sure if it is in versions prior to Excel 2010, but I don't really find myself using this all that much.<p>""Additionally, you can't do multi-step analysis that involves segmentation/sub-setting of the data very easily with Excel. This is related to the first point about changing an underlying data set or its dimensions. There are ways around this, but they are VERY annoying.""<p>Your first statement is only correct if you mean ""you can't do <i>some</i> multi-step analyzes"" because some of them are just plain simple. Also, I don't find the occasional annoyances (which typically have to do with using match(), vlookup(), cross_product(), or similar functions) anywhere nearly as annoying as some of the other things I have to deal with when programming. Dates can be a pain in the ass. Even in Ruby.<p>I'll be clear in saying I have no idea about what R can do. I've only toyed with it due to lack of time, but I do know that Excel can do a bunch of really cool things. Solver, remote UDFs written in any programming language (including Ruby running on a linux box), forms for pointy haired bosses, pretty awesome charts if you know what you are doing, cubes, goal seek, data tables, macros, formula auditing, db connections, etc.<p>What I don't like is the general vibe that Excel is, and only is, for MBAs and R is, and only is, for comp sci kids. That just isn't true, and I don't have to know anything about R to make that claim because I know some comp sci kids some of the time get a ton of value out of Excel.

We have a winner!<p>If you are so blind as to think that looking around and seeing nobody like you for values of you in minority groups in a position doesn't discourage qualified people, well, then you're not only ignorant of the last 30-40 years of social science research, but also live a life so self-unexamined as to not be aware of your own privilege.  Thank you for the demonstration.<p>Queue the downmodding... now.",1271556240

Usually it is defined as ""withdrawn from a center or place of concentration; especially having power or function dispersed from a central to local authorities"".  Are you really proposing a new mechanism? Why is it going to be advantageous?  How would it interact with the patent system?  What leads you to believe that the US FDA could grant ""exclusive approvals"" on drugs when the drug industry is worldwide?<p>The quid pro quo for patents is a short term (17 year) monopoly to the inventor in trade for adequate documentation so that the invention can be generally exploited and used after the monopoly period has passed.  Your proposal seems to have a different view of what the role of patents is (or should be).",1271556222
