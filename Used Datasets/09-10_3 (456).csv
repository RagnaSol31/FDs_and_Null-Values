Even with insurance, employer support, and many donations from a large community supporting, he was told that a) the procedure would cost approximately $1-1.1M, and b) that a downpayment in the order of $400,000 would have to be received PRIOR to approval being given for the procedure to go ahead. His insurance? Would only cover $350,000, after the procedure.<p>His illness? Cystic Fibrosis. His age? 32.",1331434743

We normally don't make much of it, certainly less than the rate that we can flush it through our system. We can produce more than we can handle for short periods of time if needed, but it's not sustainable. Put us in a situation where we have to keep producing lactic acid beyond sustainable levels for more than a few minutes, and we won't last long either. That doesn't make lactic acid proof that human bodies are self-limiting. I mean, we don't keep going forever, but lactic acid is not the reason for that.",1331434742

Evolution takes a long time, and even the spectacularly obvious gross phenotypic changes you see between various breeds of dog, occuring over the last 10,000 years or so, has not produced any actual speciation yet. And really, unless the amount of interbreeding between two ""separate"" populations is infinitesimally small (or actually zero, because they are truly separate, e.g. on different sides of an impassable mountain range or sea), speciation simply doesn't happen.<p>I can't forsee any situation in at least the next 100,000 years which could produce two viable populations of humans which would remain separate enough for long enough for them to be considered two distinct species, and for one of them to become extinct.

Using a little bit of hyperbole is a valid writing technique.<p>Remember that language is not the same as formal logic.  ""Never"" can easily mean ""just about all the time except for these odd circumstances"".  And that's fine.  It makes language more compact and conveys enough useful information.  In the case of a headline, its job is to hook you and make you want to read it.  The less wordy and the less your brain has to parse, the easier it is for that to happen.<p><i>A good plan is not one that magically pops up in your head, but one that you refined many thousand times through sweat and experience.</i><p>Certainly true.  And articles like these take the result of all that refinement and try to distill it down to some best practices and tips so others don't have to expend the same amount of sweat.<p><i>If people want to negotiate piecemeal, they SHOULD! If they do that often and work out how to act in different occuring situations (good and bad ones will come with EVERY strategy), then their plan will gradually improve.</i><p>Unlikely.  Negotiating piecemeal is sub-optimal.  I think the article did an excellent job explaining why.  It would be better to focus on the reverse: apply the best strategy in all cases, and try to figure out the (likely few) situations where it may not work out best, and learn from that.<p><i>I claim that the worst strategy, but with very well worked out details and executed by a practitioner with a lot of experience and who is well shaped for that strategy, will beat most people applying the best strategy.</i><p>This doesn't really make sense to me.  A bad idea with great execution is still a bad idea.  Wouldn't you rather focus your energy on developing good strategies instead of wasting time and effort on a flawed model?  You're also assuming that most people will apply a good strategy poorly, or at least below average.  I don't buy that.
