The charter of modern democracies promise equal ownership based on birth or residency, not on whether or not you pay rent.  Or rather, the preamble states the goal of equal ownership.  The fine print in the thousands of pages of legal code give actual ownership to an oligarchy of the civil service, congressional committees, and organized factions.  You may like to get an ownership share based on paying rent, but you have no legal or moral claim to it, just as you have no legal or moral claim on controlling your landlords' spending.<p>BTW, you are also confusing totalitarian with authoritarian.  Authoritarians deals with the management structure of a government, totalitarian with the scope of its activities.  The US government in 1800 was non-authoritarian, non-totalitarian.

When such sophistication develops is an incredibly hard question; thus far, we have punted, and have decided to use physical ages. This may be the least oppressive way to handle this dilemma, but the cynic in me wonders if we do this only because it is only optimal in a very short-term and fuzzy cost/benefit analysis.",1236737505.0

The current system protects children from politics, but why?<p>You mention targeted political pressure, but only in a vague sense; it almost seems like foreboding of something unknown, and therefore scary and threatening. It may not be for you, but for people who develop this sense of foreboding about everything unknown, this sort of argument can carry a lot of weight.<p>Anyway, this pressure already exists. It is how people already have formed political identities when they reach voting age, and are willing to defend them, even irrationally, against people of differing political philosophies. If they don't get it from the parents, or the teachers, or the media, they'll get it from their peers, who will have gotten it from the prior three sources. Protecting them in this sense seems like an almost insurmountable problem.<p>Or maybe I misunderstood what you mean by political pressure?",1236736886.0
