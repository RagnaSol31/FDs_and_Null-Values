There is a sort of cultural split in theoretical computer science between &quot;A theory&quot; (algorithms and complexity) and &quot;B theory&quot; (logic/semantics/program verification).[1] And these in turn are sortof geographically divided, with complexity being popular in the US and logic in Europe. The concept of loop invariants comes from the program verification tradition, I guess it gets less emphasis when focusing on complexity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1521/origins-and-applications-of-theory-a-vs-theory-b"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1521/origins-and...</a>",1411265747.0

For now that means things like hydroponics and aquaponics.  In the future that could be more sophisticated biotechnology or nanotechnology of some sort.<p>Its sort of a localization and distribution mindset.<p>One basic idea is that if food is produced far away, as it is often produced hundred or thousands of miles away, some energy must be expended to transport it.  So if a tomato grows hydroponically in the corner of the room, the distance it needs to travel to my mouth in order for me to eat it may be say 10 feet.  If it grows in the ground 500 miles away, it would need to travel 500 miles (plus 10 feet).  Certainly the energy required to move a tomato 500 miles is greater than zero.  Add that up for everything you eat, and there is a fair amount of inefficiency.<p>Another idea is that producing food or other needs locally means less dependence on more centralized control and distribution systems, which means more security for individuals and families.  Its sort of like extending the idea of solar panels and 3d printing.  If we can get our own energy from the sun, and print out our own products, why do we have to go to the store to buy food that was grown 400 or 4000 miles away?",1411265270.0
