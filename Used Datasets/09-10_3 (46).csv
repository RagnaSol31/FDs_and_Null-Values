I definitely appreciate the gnu.org link.<p>I guess where I disagree with all of this is in my implementation. I choose to provide services (as a consultant) rather than goods (in the form of modules or themes).

For example, compiling numpy (a python package with ~ 100 kLOC of C code):<p><pre><code>  - CFLAGS=""-O0"" -> ~ 20 sec\n  - CFLAGS=""-O1"" -> ~ 35 sec\n  - CFLAGS=""-O3"" -> ~ 60 sec\n</code></pre>\nSince the amount of parsed code for those modes is approximately the same (for numpy it is exactly the same, but one could imagine differences in glibc headers, etc...), this shows that parsing is not the bottleneck anymore if you build non-debug builds.",1289369411.0
