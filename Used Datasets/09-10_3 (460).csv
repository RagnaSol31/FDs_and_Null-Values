3,580746,story,,,4,0,slvrspoon,Why google wants you to google yourself,"http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1893965,00.html","The act of Googling oneself has become the digital age's premiere guilty pleasure — an activity enjoyed by all and admitted by few. The phenomenon has even been the subject of scholarly research. Last year, a team of Swiss and Australian social scientists published a study concluding that the practice of self-Googling (or ""Egosurfing"" as it's sometimes called) can partly be traced to a rise in narcissism in society but is also an attempt by people to identify and shape their personal online ""brand."" The authors of the survey no doubt returned to their cubicles and Googled themselves to see if the study was posted online. (It is: right here)\nRelated\nPhotos\nGoogle Earth Adds Historical Photos\nSpecial Report\nTop 10 Google Earth Finds\nStories<p><pre><code>    * Google Earth Takes On the Prado's Masterworks\n    * Even Google Gets Frugal in the Recession\n</code></pre>\nMore Related<p><pre><code>    * Why Cuil Is No Threat to Google\n    * Google Unveils ""Universal Search""\n    * Google Tricks\n</code></pre>\nThe folks at Google are well aware that their site handles millions of vanity searches every day, and that users aren't always thrilled about the results that pop up when they Google themselves. (See TIME's photos: ""Google Earth Adds Historical Photos"")<p>""The reason people search for themselves is that they're curious about what other people see when they search for their name,"" says Joe Kraus, Google's director of product management. ""One problem is they don't have any control over the search results. Either they don't like the search results, or what happens most of the time is, they're not listed on the first page. If your name is Brian Jones and you're not the deceased Rolling Stones guitarist, you don't exist.""<p>To give people a bit more control over search results, Google introduced a new feature this week it calls a ""Google profile"" that users can create so that a thumbnail of personal information appears at the bottom of U.S. name-query search pages. Once users create a Google profile, their name, occupation, location (and photo if they choose), appears in a box on the first page of the search results for their name. Next to the thumbnail info, there's a link to a full Google profile page that in many ways resembles a Facebook page.<p>The similarity to Facebook is no accident. Google profiles are the search giant's fiendishly clever attempt to turn your egosurfing pain into their gain. By giving users a modicum of control over the results that appear on a search for their name, Google hopes to establish a social network beachhead and take on wildly popular sites like Facebook and MySpace. Facebook users who otherwise couldn't be bothered to set up a separate profile page on Google might find the idea appealing if it gives them some control over the Google search results for their name. And if you're already using Gmail for email, Google Maps for directions, and Google's Picasa for photo sharing, you may wind up spending more time with your Google profile than your Facebook or MySpace page.<p>The Google profile lets you set up a personalized page where you can include links to your blog, Twitter feed or company website, plus share online photos and link to your other personal profiles on sites such as Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn. There's room for a brief bio, along with a place to list your current interests, places you've lived and schools you've attended. There's also a space that asks you to list your ""superpower,"" proof that the engineers at Google have a sense of humor. Or think they do.<p>Like Facebook, your Google profile doesn't display any private information unless you've explicitly added it. You can share info with friends and family, and control who sees what. There's no Google profile feature that lets you ""friend"" another user — at least not yet. But there is a ""Send a message"" feature that lets anyone with a Google account email you without revealing your email address. Another feature called ""My places"" displays all the cities you've entered on your profile and your current location on a map. A Google map, of course.<p>The more information you add to your profile, the higher your page is likely to be ranked on a Google search for your name and associated keywords, such as the name of your hometown, your job title, or where you work or go to school. And the more richly detailed your Google profile is, the more Google knows about you. There's no advertising attached to Google profiles, but in the future, the company could easily sell ads targeted to your personal details, much as they've already done on Gmail.<p>These days, Big Brother isn't just watching you — he wants to know your superpower and the name of your childhood pet. And he already knows you like to Google yourself, so don't try to deny it.",1240801005

There are a few small consulting shops and the big players - citibank's new facility, kroger (I worked there), PG (I have done consulting there) and of course 5/3. The overall culture is very, very old school, there's lot of red tape and very few people doing new and interesting development. Speaking as a Cincinnati/NKY native, unless you want to land a permanent cubicle at one of the big companies, find a way to live elsewhere!!! Just because you are working at a startup does not mean you have an unstable source of income - just less stable than one of the big enterprises. I realize how negative I sound about this area... but having grown up there, went to school near there and worked there. IMHO your chances of sharpening your skills and having a rewarding and fulfilling career in software engineering while living in Cincinnati are slim to none. As a native, I strongly recommend reconsidering this now rather than 2 years down the road when it will just be that much harder to move - some imagined sense of stability is not worth your job being hellishly dull! Now, that does not mean some people are not happy in the cubicle and there are no good jobs in Cincinnati... it's just such a bad environment for development.",1240800676

28,580721,comment,580209.0,580684.0,0,0,bokonist,,,"Well, personally, I'm an abolitionist.  But even if I believed in public schools, there are many aspects of our school system that do not even make sense on their own terms:<p>1)  Kids are mandated by law to attend school, but then when in school, teachers cannot even adequately punish unruly kids because that would violate their civil rights (thanks to a bunch of court decisions in the 70's).  That means the worst kids get little discipline, and the good kids get locked in a building for six hours with juvenile tormentors.<p>2)  Schools make less intelligent kids feel like they are inadequate because they are not as good at a narrow range of academic skills. And for what?  There are many productive ways to earn a living that require neither algebra, physics, or history.<p>3)  The worst delinquents do not want to be at school.  The teachers do not want them at school.  They do not get anything out of school because the teachers have no ability to control them.  The system is benefiting no one.<p>4)  Teacher pay has absolutely no relation to the quality of their teaching.<p>5)  Districts pay a ton of money for the tools required to equip a vocational school.  But those tools already exist in the workplace, and these craft businesses all used to except teenagers at entry level positions where they could learn the ropes for free ( or even get paid).<p>6)  The smart kids who actually do want to learn are usually not allowed to.  They are usually beyond the curriculum, yet are forced to go follow the exact curriculum set out by bureaucrats hundreds of miles away.<p>7)  We live in an era where there is far more information in the world than anyone can ever learn, and where most economic value comes from specialization. There is simply no reason to have a centralized curriculum, outside of reading, writing and arithmetic.<p>8)  There is no clear reason to have specialist teachers.  Schools could be designed as parental coops.  Or as a series of workplace internships.  Or as apprenticeships.  There are many, many models to use.<p>9)  Why not use older students to teach younger students?  It saves money and breeds responsibility.<p>10) Why segregate by age?  Why cut off children from the rest of society in a big box building?  Kids always act better when they are trying to impress someone older.  Older kids act better when they know younger kids are looking up to them.<p>11)  Despite a tremendous increase in the hours spent in school over the past 90 years, tests of numeracy and vocab among the general public have been flat.<p>12) Why assume that we need high school.  We got through the 19th century just fine without it. What changed?<p>13)  We send kids to college to supposedly educate them, but where the real result is spending 4 years of partying and no responsibilities.<p>14)  The left puts up huge fights against voucher funding for private schools, because they fear that will lead to more class segregation.  So instead, many posh suburbs have essentially become expensive private boarding schools where the parents live too.  Instead of the different classes living in the same town but going to different schools, they live in entirely different towns altogether.<p>15)  A student has his school paid for for 18 years.  But after that he is entirely cut off.  Why can't a student take a few years off when he's young and does not appreciate school, and then have the money available when he's older, and realizes he needs to a community college degree to achieve his chosen profession?<p>16)  The school system pretends that it is supposed to raised up the lower classes and increase their earning potential.  But in reality, the reason for much of the earning differential between drop outs and graduates is that there are needles barrier to entry laws for many professions.  Take away those laws, and lower class students could simply self study and test into the jobs, rather than spending a huge amount on college.",1240798920

32,580717,comment,580289.0,580289.0,0,0,samlittlewood,,,"Very nostalgic. As a games developer at the time - some of the things I remember as being important:<p>The setting into which it arrived:<p>Games for the successful cartridge based machines were selected and scheduled by Nintendo & SEGA. There were a limited number of slots per season - competition within genres was avoided, often in favour of in-house games, or allied publishers.<p>There was a wave of CD based machines at various levels of development. These were characterised by wince inducing hyperbole, a lack of attention to any of the media of which they were supposed to represent the convergence, and an inability to engage with the developers who had any chance of creating titles that would sell.<p>I remember the first 3DO developer conference - big hotel bash - hot swag (why embroider an off-the-shelf shoulder bag when you can have one made exactly to your specs), Incomprehensible eulogies delivered by new-media 'visionaries', and, um, the chocolate CD. Meanwhile, the experienced games developers who were calling out the inadequacies of the hardware and OS were being told that they were irrelevant, and to shut up.<p>This was not a happy place for games developers - between the politics and uncertainty of the cartridge machines,  and the approaching new-media desert.<p>Into this arrived Sony:<p>They had bought a UK game developer - Psygnosis, who had (IIRC, courtesy of SN Systems) sorted out a good set of PC based development tools with english documentation.<p>Once they had something to show, they invited ~100 UK developers to Great Marlborough Street for a chat -  other than knowledge - the giveaways ran to a cup of coffee & a couple of biscuits (1).<p>The tech. demos using a slow prototype (so T-Rex's head only) were fascinating, but other things were more significant: The attendance list demonstrated to those within it that Sony really 'got it' - this was a peer group of people who had made, and were making, games in the UK, and having assembled that audience, the Psygnosis staff (a part of that peer-group), explained how they wanted to help us make games - IIRC, not much persuading was needed.<p>(Another memorable moment was the opening of the first Devcon in London - several hundred developers in a huge conference room. Phil Harrison(IIRC) walks onto the stage and casually asks if it is anyone's birthday today. A few hand's go up. ""Happy Birthday - here, have a Playstation"" and indeed, those bodies got machines (at that time, rarer than hen's teeth))<p>(1) There may also have been sandwiches.",1240798502

It actually reminds me of the Bravia ad from 4-5 years ago (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOrV-5vh1A&fmt=22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOrV-5vh1A&fmt=22</a>) where Sony had tens of thousands of colored balls bouncing in a San Francisco street.<p>The collaboration with Vimeo with the Flash overlay is also a nice touch.",1240797646
