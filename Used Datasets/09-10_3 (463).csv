They just want to go somewhere interesting, for cheap.<p>Therefore, rather than only considering the single lowest-cost <i>edge</i> on the graph (that is, an A-to-B flight to an interesting place), you could consider lowest-cost <i>paths</i>, using a pathfinding algorithm (secondarily weighted by the popularity of intermediate cities/vertices as temporary destinations.) Thus, instead of going to city X, it would recommend going to Y, staying a month and taking in the local culture, and then finishing the trip to X with a short, local flight in the off-season (or any other method of travelâ€”it could integrate with Google Maps to see if it would be cheaper to drive between each pair of intermediate nodes than fly.)",1276311511.0

Justice is just sort of beneficial overall, so we shouldn't violate it without having a really good reason.  This ""really good reason"" thing is what executive pardons (and similar powers) are for, and even that is abused pretty heavily.<p>Justice does not mandate that all rules be followed.  It mandates that all rules be equitable, and be enforced equitably.<p>Finally, while using the rule ""Do whatever leads to the best outcome"" is a perfectly good way to operate as an individual, it is unenforceable on a societal level.  This is why we have other rules.  It's impossible to figure out just what has the best consequences, so we try to produce more concrete rules that improve consequences overall (hopefully which don't have too many consequences of their own).<p>Following the personal rule ""Do whatever leads to the best outcome"", even when it goes against society's laws, is called civil disobedience.  When done for a good cause, it is not generally vilified.  The catch to civil disobedience is that you must accept the consequences of your actions.",1276311349.0

Seriously, relax.<p>They keynote sees a lot of press, many of whom got press passes. Yet it also sees a lot of less credible press (e.g. Gizmodo) who buy standard event tickets, clogging a spot, to be there. The same thing happened at I/O.<p>And I've met enough non-developers who were sent there for whatever reason to realize that it isn't the core of developers.",1276308389.0

The guy who taught my freshman physics recitation section was a full professor who'd written a few textbooks; I didn't find out until years later that as a young man, he had spent the War in Los Alamos.  My differential equations class was taught by the head of the department, and so was my freshman chemistry class.<p>I didn't appreciate how special it all was until I compared notes with friends from high school who had gone elsewhere.  One of them told me that his freshman chemistry class consisted of a box of cassette tapes and a classroom section taught by a very overworked grad student.",1276308316.0
