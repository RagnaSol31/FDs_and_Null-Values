It can easily be observed that the type of Y is (P -> P) -> P, that is, a proposition implying itself implies itself. Since the first part is obviously a tautology, this reduces to a proof of ""for all P, P is true"". Hooray, anything is possible! This is closely related to Löb's theorem, Gödel's incompleteness theorems, and all those other fun things.<p>The net result is that there is a fundamental equivalence between true theorems that cannot be proven (cf. Gödel) and correct programs that cannot be shown to halt (cf. Turing).",1266720971.0

His solution is that biological stuff just has these special properties, that's a ""brute fact"" about biological stuff and it's not true of silicon stuff.  And I think most philosophers of mind (who are, by and large, nonprogrammers) think that's too 'magical' to be true.<p>In fact a very popular idea now in philosophy is that consciousness is (in some sense) a fundamental physical property, and when physical things are arranged in the right way, they become conscious like us or any other animal.  And the proper arrangement of particles to invoke these high-level conscious properties must help organisms survive, or else it'd be unlikely that we have them.  And so machines structured the right way can probably be conscious too.",1266717697.0
