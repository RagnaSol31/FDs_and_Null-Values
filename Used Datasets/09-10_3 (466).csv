I also think the annoying alarmism is caused by not identifying the changes in intellectual habits.<p>For instance, in the past the high school math geeks all knew how to use a slide rule, and mastering it was an intellectually satisfying task.  Now that slide rules have been replaced with calculators, the geeks instead know how to solve quadratic and differential equations with a technical calculator, which is an intellectually satisfying task to master.<p>The problem is that some of the ""old school"" can't really <i>see</i> the new skills and knowledge.  They see only the lack of the old skills, and thus determine that X has been dumbed down and the kids today don't learn anything hard anymore.",1260673188.0

And no - can't do that in lisp.<p>What do you mean by serious multiprocessing in lisp? Does it have a distributed database included? Or a node registration and message passing framework? Or a process control framework? Can it run my 10000 processes? Does it have portable networking and thread implementation where nothing ever blocks... Or did you mean that I can have for example the sbcl threading <a href=""http://www.sbcl.org/manual/Threading.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sbcl.org/manual/Threading.html</a> and can build all of that on my own? I could do the same in c... but I won't - erlang is better for that.<p>I'd also argue with ""nice oo in lisp""... for some values of ""nice"" :) For big projects I want a code browser / ide. I want types in my OO. I want the code to be structured in a way that makes the methods belong to classes. I don't want old-style message passing OO (not saying that it's bad... it's just not what is used these days in big projects). I want new-style enterprise-level OO with interfaces and self-commenting code where you write what you want to do, because every single person in your 100-person team has to understand it without any comments when you're not around.<p>So everything that's left imho is easy prototyping. We can shoehorn every paradigm into any language - sure. But then you get something that can do everything and isn't good for anything in particular. If I learned lisp before python, I'd probably say the same thing about python... it's just not worth the additional attention, because they're both easy-prototyping languages, where you can promote the code into production when your first design is ""good enough"".",1260672867.0

When I do use a Lisp family language, it is most often Gambit-C Scheme to build small standalone executables - and sometimes Franz or SBCL Common Lisp.<p>BTW, I consider Python and Ruby to be fairly interchangable - use whichever you like best. Both are great languages with great libraries and supporting open source projects.",1260669849.0

Python's writing, however, is everywhere, including the wall.<p>""The writing is on the wall"" is an expression not meant to be taken literally.<p>> So I would say this killing argument is premature.<p>Actually many of us are working with ECMAScript outside browsers, often coming from Python and similar languages. Interfacing from C and C++ to V8 is incredibly easy. Have you ever tried to make Python modules?<p>Also ECMAScript VMs have plenty of security features that come extremely handy, like security. Python security, in particular sandboxing, is almost impossible to achieve and the work-arounds you need kill performance even further.<p>As a former Python fan, I could go on and on for pages.
