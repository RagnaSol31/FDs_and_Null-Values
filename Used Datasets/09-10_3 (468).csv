This means that modern Icelanders can read the Sagas (written in the 10th and 11th centuries) with relative ease. The majority of people will read them in the same way we read Shakespeare or Dickens (with modern spelling and some footnotes), but with some effort they can be read by most well-educated Icelanders in their initial forms.<p>While isolation had a great deal to do with this initially, nowadays it's mostly because of the work of the Icelandic Language Institute, which religiously updates the language to add new words for concepts that didn't previously exist. They also work with the Icelandic Naming Committee, to maintain the list of acceptable first names that Icelandic children can be given - if the name you want to give your child isn't on the list of previously-used names, you have to submit it to the Committee to make sure that it is appropriate (i.e. can be spelled in the Icelandic alphabet and fits into Icelandic grammar).",1278385189.0

Each drive was brought online out of the storage pool, its files copied into the pool volumes, and finally the drive was added to the storage pool. It requires an extra drive already in the pool to pull this off, but given that it worked very well, far better than some of the horror stories I've heard about people trying to transplant RAID 5 and 6 setups when other NAS solutions have failed at the server level.

Team management is not needed at this time and it also doesn't require any repository integration or bug tracking.<p>Any recommendations?",1278382169.0

[...] The 'base design' consisted of a 4000 ton model planned for ground launch from Jackass Flats, Nevada. Each 0.15 kt of TNT (600 MJ) (sea-level yield) blast would add 30 mph (50 km/h, 13 m/s) to the craft's velocity. A graphite based oil would be sprayed on the pusher plate before each explosion to prevent ablation of the surface. To reach low Earth orbit (300 mi), this sequence would have to be repeated about 800 times, like an atomic pogo stick.</i><p>What could <i>possibly</i> go wrong?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsi...</a>",1278382156.0

If you have multiple connections open you can minimize the RDP window; the connection is maintained but the window is not refreshed so it doesn't use your connection.,1278382129.0

So what if there are no absolute metrics. That doesn’t seem to matter all that much.<p>If I count my sheep on their way out of the pen and if I count them again on their way back into the pen I can be reasonably sure that if those numbers match, there are no more sheep on the pasture. I don’t have to look for missing sheep. This seems like a useful statement. I would call it true.<p>Sure, sometimes it doesn’t work. Tests with other people have shown that I sometimes tend to overlook a sheep. Further tests have shown that I sometimes misremember the number by the time the sheep are coming back. But other than that it seems very robust.<p>Why not call that statement true? Do postmodernists expect that this would only work here but not in other cultures? And if that were the case couldn’t you just test that, no need to throw your hands up in the air and give up? Do they expect that it might work on Earth but maybe not on Mars or Alpha Centauri? Testing that would also be no problem. It’s at least not impossible, no reason to give up.<p>Where’s the beef?<p>(The sheep story is blatantly stolen from this essay: <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/the-simple-truth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yudkowsky.net/rational/the-simple-truth</a>)",1278381871.0
