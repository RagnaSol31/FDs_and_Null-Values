The evidence being that of those who make it, many barely make a single useful contribution over a lifetime of research.  The question is really about whether more than 1 in 73 deserve to be able to try - and my opinion is that, really, no.  But there shouldn't be 73 in the pool to start with.<p>PhD training should start earlier (maybe after Sophomore year of college), and should be much shorter and more intensive.  I think that peer-reviewed articles (and not a dissertation) should be the standard by which a PhD is judged (this is the case in many European countries).<p>But I agree with you that the quality v. quantity balance seems a bit skewed.  \nWe need fewer PhD students, and their studentships should be redirected toward paying more to the good ones and their supervisors, toward more funding for their projects (I believe this was your point in the linked comment). We need fewer journal articles (maybe), but deeper contributions.<p>Yet: so far, it's what we've got.  It works pretty well.  Yeah, it sucks to be a PhD going through the grind, watching the 4th-years in the lab slowly deflate as they realize they're going to have to get real jobs.  But perhaps we were all crazy to believe we could really make a career out of trying out crazy ideas and telling other people about them.",1257214062.0

Then, you'll allow folks arbitrary access to other people's data, silently.  I have seen a lot of Rails code that guards against this by checking access before critical actions -- again, this will work fine until you forget to do it.  Instead, establish the convention that you <i>only</i> instantiate the model objects through something which guarantees authorization, and then the existence of the model object is proof that access to it is authorized.  (Adjust as required if you work in banking or state secrets.  I write bingo cards for a living.)",1257213759.0
