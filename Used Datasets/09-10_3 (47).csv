Maybe as more places start using Google indoor mapping this particular problem will be fixed. Most of the errors will likely just be a lack of context provided to Google or a lack of information available in a format Google can access.,1348988312

62,4592170,comment,4591649.0,4591887.0,2,0,kijin,,,"I don't think the distinction is that clear-cut.<p>One of the reasons that governments don't want to write good laws is because there is too little incentive to write good laws, and too much incentive to write bad laws. One solution might be to replace those irresponsible lawmakers, or at least augment them, with those who actually do have an incentive to write good laws.<p>Participatory democracy is <i>not</i> simply the idea that more people can write better laws. The number of participants, by itself, is meaningless. Part of the idea is that if you invite a diverse range of individuals and groups to participate in the process, at least some of them will have enough motivation, passion, and intellectual prowess to outmatch the ones who don't. Open-source software might not have any performance advantages over proprietary alternatives, but at least it will be easier for somebody to spot a backdoor.<p>I have a lot of respect for people who are trying their best to curb the influence of money on politics. But if the idea is that politicians will want to write good laws once the influence of money is gone, I think that's just as naive as the idea that you're criticizing. No matter how we tweak our campaign financing regulations, there will always be people who don't want to write good laws, and those kinds of people have an unfortunate tendency to want to become politicians. To ignore this crooked aspect of humanity is a fundamental misapprehension of how government works.<p>So, electing the right sort of people is only half the solution. The only way to ensure that those who are elected keep wanting to write good laws is to force them to write good laws or else face severe repercussions (e.g. being recalled or thrown in jail). But in order for the rest of us to detect deviations from good lawmaking and inflict appropriate repercussions on responsible parties, first we need to know what the hell is going on. So even if having more eyes does not automatically lead to better laws, at least it will make it a bit more difficult for those who write bad laws to get away with it. It's a lot more difficult to get away with a backdoor if the relevant commit was signed with your key and the whole world knows it.<p>""Our elected 'representatives' don't represent us in any literal sense, as if we were doing the ruling 'through them'. That is nonsense. They rule and we don't. But because we can easily deprive them of power at certain intervals, they have (at least theoretically) the incentive to rule in a way responsive to our interests."" - Jean Hampton, <i>Political Philosophy</i>",1348985669

You can use less characters and communicate the same thing better. Such as...<p>-'Leave your email and we'll let you know when Shoutt arives' change to 'Request a beta invite' and change from 14px to 18-20px. Alternately, remove this text entirely and change button text from 'Submit' to 'Request Invite'.<p>-Logo could use a bit more spice<p>-Where you say 'what do you want to shoutt about', I'd use your logo in place of 'shoutt'<p>-'an app for you and your campus' can be moved under the logo and put it on one line instead of two. Alternately you can move 'Exclusively at Stanford University' under the logo.<p>-Make the button and email form a bit smaller in relation to everything else. And consider something with a more low-key/elegant look, like rounded corners and with effects when the cursor is in the box: see Bootstrap forms. I'd also change the placeholder text to a more low-key font color, same with the button color. It shouldn't draw so much attention (at least not if it says 'Submit' if it says 'Request Invite' drawing attention is good).<p>Just incremental improvements, everything looks great as is. Feel free to email me if you want to follow up or for future feedback.<p>Good luck!",1348985254

The minimum standard should be 30mph.  In Canada the standard city speed limit is 50km/h, which converts to about 31mph.  I find in Canada that people tend to follow the 50km/h speed limit far more readily.  Nobody really follows the 25mph limit in the USA.<p>Since people like even numbers, the standard speed limit in america should be 30mph, not 25mph.",1348985049

Their special events are always filled with the same bullshit: 'Amazing'. 'Magical'. 'Incredible'. 'Unbelievable'. Ok, Apple have very talented people working on their products, and they're extremely proud of what they do (they should be), so I get that they can't help but roll out the same marketing spin for everything they release.<p>This of course backfires when we get these products in our hands and they're not everything we expected them to be. The biggest change that needs to happen at Apple now is that they need to breed humility into their culture, and show it more in public.<p>The last hint of humility I saw from them in recent years was the word 'beta' slapped onto Siri at its original announcement, and yet Forstall still put on a flawless presentation that showed Siri as far more capable and responsive than it's been in the wild.<p>The most recent of course, was Tim Cook's Maps apology. Steve Jobs would never have written that letter, and I'm glad that there is now someone running Apple that knows when an apology is due, especially one that recommends alternative products in the meantime, rather than shovelling shit on them in an Antennagate-style ""we suck, but look, everyone else sucks more, na na na na na"".<p>It takes a certain kind of person to get a company like Apple to the top. It takes an entirely different kind of person to keep them there. I can only hope that this is first step in Apple forging a more honest, humble, real relationship with it's consumers, because in time that will be the only thing that can secure their future.",1348984856
