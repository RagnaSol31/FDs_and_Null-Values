(30 year treasuries are paying 3.65% now.) Sure it's easy to point out during the worst financial crisis of the last 70+ years that the S&P has fared poorly over the last decade. However even now, in a time of relative disaster, over the last 50 years (the timeline we're looking at if we're retiring at 30 and dieing at 80) it's returned about 8.5%. (That's using this chart <a href=""http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/charts/chartdl.aspx?symbol=%24INX&CP=0&PT=11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/charts/chartdl.aspx?sym...</a> and a little math). Average since the Great Depression is more like 10%. While many people now believe it will be lower going forward even the worst skeptics are talkinng more like 7-8%. I don't know that I buy it because, as the old joke goes, economists have predicted 9 out of the last 5 recessions, but even if so that's a vastly different picture than 4%, and excludes the fact that there are many investments with higher ROIs to be found readily if you're either willing to do more work or accept more risk.<p>That's not to mention, FU money doesn't have to mean a jet-setting lifestyle. It just means enough to do what you want. One could live very happily in most of America spending $100k/yr, including their home. That's actually quite a bit when you consider that you're not paying income taxes, just capital gains. It's like making $150k, or 3x the national average.
