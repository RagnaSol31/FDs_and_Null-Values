Take the following piece of code:<p><pre><code>  String foo = """";\n  for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {\n    foo += ""x"";\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe inside of the for loop can be replaced with:<p><pre><code>  StringBuilder tmp = new StringBuilder(foo.length());\n  tmp.append(""x"");\n  foo = tmp.toString()\n</code></pre>\nAs you will notice, we are still copying over the string foo each time we concatenate. So building strings with + inside a loop will still give you the feared copy-string-each-time behavior. The new String.concat() trick is only useful for crafting long strings in a single go, i.e. in a single expression.",1257735561.0

(Claims that the GOP have offered no solutions are one of the most blatant lies of the entire process; it's simply objectively false. You may not like them but they exist...<p>It's funny, during these last few months of the debate, this topic has come up a large number of times among my social group (largely in a community and neighborhood messageboard startd as an alternative to my HOA board and in proper startup fashion now has advertisements).<p>There certainly <i>are</i> many examples of work done by the GOP in this area in the last administration (mostly around medication pricing), but as to this particular case the GOP has been <i>very</i> late to the party and has brought substantially no ideas to the table until very recently -- generally running and obstructive tactic vs. an alternative tactic.<p>I believe the alternative bill they presented a week or so ago was political theater mostly. There was no chance on it getting debated, voted on, or really seriously considered (particularly this late in the game), and the party knew that. That's why the opening portions of the bill didn't contain policy, but rather a stream of consciousness of party talking points. They simply wanted to be able to point to it and say ""see? our ideas aren't even being considered!"" knowing full well that most people won't have tracked the submission date of the bill. David Gergen offered a different but similarly minded analysis today.<p>What I thought was interesting is that, when I asked people, and threw out ideas almost a year ago now, the right leaning members of my community generally came up with some very good, feasible plans that addressed the bulk of this particular issues (no recision, no denial of coverage, must accept people for coverage even with preexisting conditions, balanced by an open market place, all insurance is moved nationally, breeding open competition etc.). But these weren't offered up by the Party (capital P) until many months later. Instead the Party chose to run a scare campaign that had very little to do with the actual contents of <i>any</i> of the proposed bills (including doing a Godwin and interjecting Nazis, which was clearly the point  knew they had no appropriate counter argument in the wings anymore). It was wholly disappointing.",1257735486.0

A healthy lifestyle has quantifiable metrics in regards to the levels of cholesterol, processed sugars, vitamins and aminoacids you should consume daily.<p>The food you consume also interacts in complex ways that go beyond what has been formally quantified, but a casual observation of people who eat leaner foods and vegetables instead of processed sugars and dairy products is pretty good circumstantial evidence. There's a reason why dissociative diets can produce different effects on your body even though by the end of the week you may have eaten the same in terms of the amounts of calories and nutrients as other people.<p>I have two personal observations in favor of that: I have psoriasis, and the level and redness of the rashes is directly correlated to my daily intake of fruits and abstinence of coffee. I also know several people who are healthy vegetarians who have been keeping insanely good dieting regimes for several years, and it's remarkable how good their skin looks in comparison to other people of their own age, less wrinkled and more elastic (not being a scientific observation, my sample size is still large enough to be adequately convinced personally).",1257732208.0

I'd take no offense to this statement.<p>I also know very few good salespeople who can code.<p>This post was written because I had clients who had built software, sold it off, and then were all big in their britches and thought they were marketing gods.  The ads they wrote were totally awful and they blamed everyone but themselves for their high bounce rates.<p>Maybe there are coders who are marketing gods.  Just know that people have a finite amount of energy, so if they are studying marketing, they probably aren't bothering to write solid apps.  Jes' sayin'.",1257732193.0
