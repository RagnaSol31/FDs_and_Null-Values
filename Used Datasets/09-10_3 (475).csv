At a minimum, the charts should be annotated--for example, with to-do lists at particular points on the grid. About half the charts show their thin data in heavy grid prisons. For these charts the main visual statement is the administrative grid prison, not the actual tasks contained by the grid.</i><p>See the discussion at Tufte <a href=""http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=000076"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0...</a><p>I do mine using LaTeXe!",1280026588

Also a 280HP engine is measuring the output, thermal energy is easily 3x that.<p>So a better way to think about it is BTU / seconds * (time) = BTU of an A bomb.  If you assume at it's peak a high end fart releases 10x the daily average per second you come to vary different numbers.  Basically divide his number by (10 * 60 * 60 * 24) and you get a little over 2 years.<p>PS: His ""average"" fart has the energy equivalent of ~9% methane but it's moving a lot faster than 30MPH and it's at more than 1atm (speed without pressure is meaningless).",1280026417

Now sit down from 9AM to 2PM and call them, one by one. 2PM - 5PM you do emails and follow ups.<p>Incoming links and pagerank do jack squat for you if your clients have a habit of purchasing software solely through trusted vendors and relationships. You really are better off offering a 40% commission to mid-sized computer support companies and focusing on one city each month, instead of getting 100 blog articles written about you. At least then you can develop a training/certification program and allow support companies to call themselves ""Licensed $FOO Vendor""; your buyers wont worry about support, since the guys in their neighborhood can help them with the HR product, and you might even get link-backs from the support companies themselves.<p>Btw, I really urge you to blog about your marketing experience.

30,1544835,comment,1543782.0,1543782.0,0,0,lkrubner,,,"I first learned programming using Hypercard. This was back in the mid 90s. It was huge fun. HyperTalk was close to English and was the easiest programming language I've ever encountered. From HyperTalk I branched out to other script languages - AppleScript, PHP, Perl. I did all kinds of programming for 10 years, before I began learning ""real"" languages like Java.<p>In general, script languages make it easier for people to get started with programming, but HyperCard was an environment that simplified a great deal. It was even easier to learn that your average script language. It made assumptions for you, to help you get started. Yet it was amazing how much you could do with it.<p>I think HyperCard got flattened by the Web. I do not think it is coming back. Nowadays if people want an easy-to-learn environment that allows them to build a wide range of software, there is the web.<p>If there is a market niche to be filled, it might be a package that tames the Web somewhat. The web is a little too wide open, and the beginner is confronted with a lot of choices before they have the knowledge to make those choices. HyperCard reduced the number of decisions that you had to make up front. Yes, there are packages like Dreamweaver and Flash that help with web and multimedia production, but they do not hold your hand like HyperCard did. Both of them are for professionals, they are scary if you are first learning. A package that makes a lot of assumptions for you, to get you started, might find a niche, even now. And even more so for something like the iPhone, where it is a little easier to make starting assumptions.<p>For me, the story of HyperCard is one of missed opportunities. In 1995 I went to the big tech/photo expo at the Javitts Center in New York City. At the time, interactive multi-media CD ROMs were suppose to be the next big thing (there is a scene in Jurassic Park, which came out in 1994, where the young girl expresses excitement over ""an interactive CD ROM"". After the web took off, it was hard to remember why CD ROMs were suppose to be a big deal). Macromedia was there, promoting Director. I looked at Director, but I was sure that this niche was going to end up being owned by HyperCard. I felt that anything so easy to learn was going to get a huge following, and then a lot of those people would evolve in serious professionals who would use the tool they were familiar with to keep building stuff (which is what made PHP successful, just a few years later).<p>Macromedia adjusted quickly to the Web. They took Director and stripped it down and came out with a simple product called Flash. Which eventually grew up to take over the space in exactly the way that I thought HyperCard was going to do.<p>Apple had something important in their hands in 1995. But they made bad decisions. Really, it is remarkable how many bad decisions they made in the mid 90s.",1280025388

I hacked around on computers until about 12 or 13, at which point I cut that hobby out and tried to learn how to become ""cool,"" whatever that meant.<p>About 10 years later I found Hacker News after watching a talk by Jessica Livingston and then reading Founders at Work.
