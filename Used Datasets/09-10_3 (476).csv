Anyway, it will be hot for at least 5 years so it doesn't really matter what will replace it.<p>Until then, the next version of XMLHttpRequest should somehow provide a way for the server to send a request to the client, not needinng the client to make requests all the time...<p>\nOr maybe you should be asking what will replace or make better the DOM?\n",1193276774.0

Especially Enterprise software.<p>This group of people have no idea or whatsoever the requirements of an enterprise software. All they know is how to create a beautiful websites. I'm not saying that sarcastically, I like beautiful websites. <p>But this group of people judge the quality of the software from the UI perspective; if UI == sucks then software sucks. They believe that a wonderful UI == best quality software. That may be true but it's a wrong generalization.<p>Not to mention that web-designers and 37signals NEVER work on any enterprise software. They simply work on small projects because it's their specialty. ",1193276337.0

I never used to care enough to think that having everything under the sun covered was a problem. I think in the end, Microsoft's enormous technology and feature base will be what does them in.<p>To use Silverlight as an example, I think it sucks. It's bloated and I don't get it. I'm tired of playing catch up with MS technologies and all the freaking featues they pack into them. I mean: ASP.NET. ASP.NET AJAX VB.NET 3.0, LINQ, F",
