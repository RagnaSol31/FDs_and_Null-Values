1,227063,comment,227026.0,227026.0,0,0,enomar,,,Write some software that gives voters a way to monitor what their representatives are doing and how they are voting.<p>Perhaps it could provide a means of informal electronic voting.  Perhaps it could standardize the way government officials communicate with their constituencies.  Perhaps that would lower the barrier of entry so more people would be involved in their government.,1214359131

13,227051,comment,226893.0,226893.0,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"A few years ago there was a fellow who gave a presentation at a PostgreSQL user group.  He demonstrated an easy to understand way to virtually eliminate sql injections attacks.  I can't find the paper now but if I recall properly it worked by allowing you to specify a prototype of the kind of statement you want to expand and then checking if the statement being prepared was structurally equivalent to the prototype and then throwing an exception if not.   For example if you specify a prototype like<p><pre><code>   select name from emp where {x = 1}\n</code></pre>\nthen you're telling the system that you want your where clause to have the AST structure {variable operator constant}.<p>Then you let the application generate whatever sql it wants however it wants, e.g.<p><pre><code>   ""select name from emp where x = "" + $x\n</code></pre>\nThen if the database server gets something like<p><pre><code>   ""select name from emp where x = x; delete * from emp""\n</code></pre>\nThe statement doesn't match the structure of the prototype and an error is returned.  This allows even a novice to specify the kind of sql they want to allow without having to learn much.",1214358172

Also, the end game (at least until Velious) wasn't nearly as developed as WoW's is, and relied on raids held by huge guilds or even the entire server.  This led to higher-level players frequently not having access to any near-term rewards, and eventually losing the addiction.<p>FFXI's problem was with lower levels.  The reward for gaining a level didn't seem as important as in either EQ or WoW.  Equipment never seemed like a major reward either, as most players essentially rented equipment from the auction houses.",1214356686
