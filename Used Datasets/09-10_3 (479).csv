I have long been shamed out of owning my introversion by the extroverts who dominate American culture. Extroversion has long been considered healthier than introversion, and introverts often try to push against our natural tendencies in order to fit in, to seem normal so people will stop scolding us. Extroverts are unintentional bullies, demanding that everyone join their party or be considered queer, sad or stunted.""<p>The 'we're oppressed' thing just comes off as so bitter to me.  Maybe I feel this way because I'm a lot more sociable than I used to be and have seen this issue from both sides.<p>I've noticed introverts who have become more outgoing and those who haven't have very different takes on the issue.  Those who are still introverted tend to be a little more bitter and into the victim thing, and say introversion is a core personality trait.<p>Those who worked on becoming more outgoing will say their desire to socialize is more mutable than they once thought it was, and that a lot of their past so-called introversion was just shyness and not liking being around people because they weren't good at or comfortable with it.  They still seek out and enjoy their alone time, but on the whole they say they're glad they got better with people.<p>* It's possible the ones who changed weren't hardcore or 'real' enough introverts.<p>* You could also start nitpicking the way I used the term, and start debating what 'introvert' <i>really</i> means, something most discussions on this topic devolve into before long I've found.",1242525026

It's what I have at home, running opensolaris on Xen.  I mapped the usb drives natively to opensolaris so I'm not creating disk images on each.  It's still fast enough to stream movies on.  Not counting the external hard drives, it'll probably cost you around $200 for the PC, and about $125 per terabyte (usually around $25 per usb enclosure).<p>One of the reasons I used Xen is because OpenSolaris still lacks proper network drivers for just about all the network cards I own.  It also had issues with my external usb drives, so it was just easier getting linux to handle the hardware interfaces to opensolaris.<p>I use it as timemachine backups for my macs & media storage...  but on a cheap budget.",1242524646

I have not removed them under the assumption that they will simply fade to meaningless over time.  I believe the ""Conversational Japanese"" course is still under construction but the owner ""published"" it for testing purposes.  Getting quality content is my primary concern at this point!<p>Didn't mean to scare you with that enroll button haha.  Enrolling at this point really doesn't do anything other than give you full access to the course (you can then rate/review it, access the sections, and partake in the forums).<p>I have a story to think about letting people in w/out enrolling but am unsure how well that would work because then it is hard to gauge a) how popular is a course and b) should a user be able to review the course.  Plus I intend to eventually allow course owners to charge for their courses if they so desire and want to get users used to enrolling since eventually that may have a checkout process attached to it.",1242523469
22,612807,comment,610140.0,612352.0,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"Thanks for the response. As you pointed out, much of the disagreement is over the terms being used. The term ""anarcho-capitalism"" brings to mind some kind of fascist world ruled by big corporations, and this is not what self-described anarcho-capitalists envision at all. They are opposed to all forms of coercion. Most corporations, if not all, are of course tied to the State in some way.<p>You also hinted at the acceptance of individualist anarchists. Correct me if I'm wrong, but anarchists have no problem with the coexistence of different communities, each with their own flavor of anarchism. The difference between anarcho-""capitalists"" and other individualist anarchists is not very large, and is one of degree. Once individualist anarchists are accepted, only semantic issues prevent the acknowledgment of these other anarchists.<p>But I agree with you that it's a big source of confusion for them to call themselves capitalists. It also doesn't help that some of them describe themselves as being right-wingers.",1242523463

However, it's possible to understand a bit of the places you visit by meeting the locals and letting them show you their way of life. It may sound like baloney, but I have experienced that many times :-)<p>Often one assumes that others have the same values and the same habits that one has. Meeting the locals in their ""natural habitat"" is a way of understanding the local values, the local culture. I do abhor that kind of traveling where you sit on the top deck of a bus and drive around a city while some dude with a mike points to touristic attractions. That stuff you can find on Wikipedia. The cool stuff is to meet locals who will welcome you to their houses so you can have dinner with their families, or show you the underground night scene that tourists never experience, or invite you for a weekend at their country / beach house. That's the good stuff.",1242523385

The lack of notification on signup was a caching problem.<p>After signing up for (enrolling in) a course you should be taken to that course's landing page.  A navigation section gets added to the sidebar when in a course that lists out that course's sections (assuming it has any).
