Some anecdotes from one homeschooled through high school:<p>- Many homeschool families will form study groups for some of the subjects less conducive to individual study (such as music or hard sciences) and will have a knowledgeable parent or outside teacher lead a class or two a week. In grade school I took a homeschooling drawing class taught by a former art teacher turned homeschooling parent. But that was my only experience.<p>- My local public high school had no problems letting me on campus for part of the day to take a couple classes. I took a lab science class, and was in the music classes every year.<p>- Some community colleges offer a ""Running Start"" program for high school students, and they don't care which high school you come from. So my senior year in high school I was at the local CC part time learning German, taking Chemistry and an English class.<p>There are also a wide variety of ""official"" homeschooling programs that have popped up recently. Either the curriculum is rubber-stamped, or they bring in certified teachers. I didn't take part in any of that as it wasn't required by law, and I/we didn't see a need.<p>So those are my experiences. YMMV widely by geography.",1240968259

Storage is cheap, indexing algorithms are well-known, and the problem space has been heavily explored.<p>And it's misleading to talk about the entire web. Google may index billions upon billions of pages, but only a small percent actually get shown to the user, or stored in memory. And I would say that a smart kid with a few computers or a couple of bucks can build the index.<p>Then the hard part starts. Machine learning to correct search placements, based on features like clicks and time in index. Algorithms to detect spam. Anticipation of user data needs. And all the nitty gritty of linguistic analysis to better sort your index.<p>These types of things require new and innovative thoughts. In my mind, building a search index is just standing on the shoulders of the giants that came before.
