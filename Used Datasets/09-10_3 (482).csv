4,939188,comment,937918.0,937918.0,0,0,dmoney,,,"Writing a program is maybe 10% what you want it to do, and 90% telling the computer how to do it.  So I think the question of when we won't need another programming language can be answered as: when the default programming language of the day has libraries and/or syntax that grow to include every ""how"" that's been done before.  This way you only have to specify the ""what"" unless you're doing something nobody's figured out how to do.<p>So I guess my idea of the limit programming language/environment would be that it's automatic (or at least trivially easy) to make 90% of every new program into a gem, and then automatic/trivial to find the gem that does exactly what you need, as well as to debug it.  (maybe rubygems are already this good, i haven't looked into them).",1258077381

For the free app, it's 59%. I presume that once the free app expires on a users phone, they uninstall the app, which partially explains the lower active install rate. In hindsight, this may not have been such a good idea, because it's possible (though I haven't confirmed this) that the active install rate is accounted for in my ranking in the app store.<p>For the free version, I also have the app ping my server whenever it is started.
