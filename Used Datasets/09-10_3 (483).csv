(if it spins,we can measure distance traveled)<p>--<i>Hubcap based communications</i>: My cars recognize and exchange information (shopping lists, to-do lists, language courses)<p>--<i>Hubcap based entertainment</i>: Quickly transfer songs/files/etc. -- hooks into your audio system.<p>--<i>Hubcap based computing</i>: Use those idle cycles while your sitting at the light to help with gene folding.<p>--<i>Hubcap based energy</i>: Spinners?

I know that both San Fran and Boston have some of the highest living expenses in the country, and while living in Florida isn't cheap, I would be surprised to find Tampa to be just as expensive (Miami, sure, but Tampa?).<p>Also, the tax rates for both personal and corporations are higher in CA and MA than in FL (and FL doesn't have a state income tax), and I can see the higher regulatory costs in CA and MA being highly unattractive.<p>This leads into a question I have:  Why did Silicon Valley become this computer Mecca?  Why not Boston?  My guess is that the tax and regulations up through the late 60s/early 70s favored California (coupled with the nice weather) and what you are now seeing (as CA collapses into debt) is merely inertia.  If I had to pick an area for another Silicon Valley to arise, it would be Austin.",1235872257

12,498682,comment,497951.0,497951.0,0,0,edahan,,,"By all measures, the RTP area of North Carolina should be growing startups and growing massively large companies with the best of them.<p>UNC, Duke, NC State + dozens of smaller colleges/universities within a one hour drive provide a very well educated work force.<p>An existing network of colleges exist within a several hour drive (Wake Forest, etc.)<p>The financial center (hopefully things will return to at least ""functioning"") of Charlotte is a day trip in a car.\nWashington D.C., Atlanta and New York are airplane day trips and Boston, Chicago and Miami are overnight trips away. Attracting constant attention from traditional VC funds is not a problem.<p>There is a strong base of both Tech and Life Sciences companies in RTP. This base can provide everything from internal skunk works within these companies to employees leaving to create startups.<p>The weather ain't all that bad - for the East Coast.<p>So - what is the real problem - it isn't money.<p>The problem can be found in passivity, complacency and parochialism.<p>I was once told (by a Silicon Valley born and bred person), ""everyone has their prejudices - but these folks (around RTP) actually let that get in the way of making money."" The Silicon Valley is not filled with folks singing ""Kumbaya"" - but it is filled with folks who are more than willing to put aside whatever personal feelings they may have if there is a buck to be made.<p>One of the most prominent venture capitalists in the RTP region once said (in private) that all the ""entrepreneurs"" around here are hoping that one day they can afford a nice beach house on the Coast, instead of . . . . being entrepreneurs.<p>Nope - RTP is an example - it isn't only about the money.<p>It's really about the people.<p>BUT - money for seed/startup development is essential.<p>Funding startups shouldn't come from the government - it should come from a For Profit Seed/Startup fund that works with, supports and Compensates the Seed Infrastructure (incubators, tech transfers, economic development agencies). The Seed Infrastructure should not concentrate on being landlords, academicians or civil servants. The Seed Infrastructure should concentrate on sourcing, screening and providing post Seed investment oversight for companies that will ultimately be worthy of traditional Series A investments.<p>And remember, this Seed Infrastructure is, for the most part,already funded by local/state governments, academia and corporate sponsorships.<p>The idea of simply throwing money into a broken system won't work. The idea of expecting the traditional VC stage of the Risk Investing industry to innovate or nurture is fallacious. Regardless of what Alan Patricof said in his NYTimes article - VCs don't nurture. VCs provide growth capital for those Seed/Startup enterprises which have reached a level of traction and validation.<p>Thomas Friedman was even more delusional with his idea of giving 20 VC firms $1 billion each to generate innovation. All you are going to get by giving VCs $20 billion is somewhere between $2-$2.5 billion in management fees for the VC firms.<p>I do not know how you can generate an ""entrepreneur"" mentality in a short time - after all, even the success of Noyce and Friends took a while to take hold after they left Fairchild to start Intel.<p>But, I do know the way to start - please read (and feel free to comment) - <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/ElliottDahan/start-fund-feb2009"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/ElliottDahan/start-fund-feb2009</a><p>Elliott Dahan\nThe Growth Group\nelliott(a)thegrowthgroup.com",1235872147

I have lived here for 5 years and as an Indian American and I am yet to experience a single experience of racism. This has to be plain luck because in the few months that I lived in NYC, I experienced some.<p>Seriously, visit Atlanta, see how many African Americans, Asians, Indians and yes, gay people lead a happy life very much free from pain caused by bias over here.<p>If you really want to fight racism, please at least praise the lack of bias and openness in a community when you see it.

Let's say some guy comes up with some really great hubcaps.He can grow to become the best hubcap maker in the world. But he's still just making hubcaps, and most people don't care about them.<p>But the people who do stuff in media, for example music or tv, always have potential to change the industry. Same with anything communication related. These are core industries that are fundamental to human beings - so startups in those areas always have huge potential. Like muxtape for example, or justin.tv, those startups can change the world. They are not changing the world yet, but I can see that with the right things in place, they can change the world. It's the same with microprocessors, anyone who was in the field knew that if size went down, price went down and so on, microprocessors would make a huge difference. They did not predict the apps that would be enabled because of them.<p>Why did they not? Microprocessors created a platform, and a platform opens a brand new field for new people to create ideas within. When a startup works on something that creates a new type of platform, then breakout ideas can happen on the platform. Hubcaps are not a platform that others can build on. They're the end of a line.",1235871420

Two of the most successful companies started in Atlanta: CipherTrust and Manhattan Associates (although you may not think of the latter as a startup now) were started by Indians. I personally know of several other ""very likely"" to be successful startups started by minorities.<p>If you read news about Startup Riot on the front page of HN in the past week, it is run by Sanjay Parekh, another successful Indian American entrepreneur out of Atlanta.<p>I am Indian American and I cofounded a startup in Atlanta last year. I have yet to experience <i>any</i> bias. I have worked in Silicon Valley at a startup and the startup community in Atlanta is <i>at least</i> as welcoming to minorities as in the valley. The valley attracts more minorities simply because there are more opportunities<p>Nearly 80% of the engineering team at CipherTrust consisted of Chinese, Indian and African American engineers.<p>California in general may be much more liberal than Geogia but Atlanta is a very very open minded place not just for ethnic or racial minorities, there is a thriving gay community in Atlanta.
