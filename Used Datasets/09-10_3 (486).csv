He just needs to understand the syntax and concepts of a new language.<p>SICP uses Scheme, not Java.  SICP does not teach Java's syntax, nor object-oriented fundamentals, nor web development with Struts.  What possible rationale makes this a good suggestion?",1213839596

It took few cops to keep peace in each town.<p>By the time somebody went in front of the judge, everybody new who did it, and 99% of the time they were found guilty, and where shipped to jail.<p>Of course, there are many drawbacks to it.  If you oposed the party, you will be swiftly send to jail.<p>Very effective, in a scary way.\nThen democracy came, and crime shot up.  Still relatively low (compared to the US), but still much higher that it used to be.<p>In a democratic society, it will be problematic to have cops being judges too. The problem is that there will be always bad apples among the cops, and giving them such great power, makes a fertile ground for abuse, and with no real check and balances in place.",1213838902

14,221411,comment,221134.0,221134.0,0,0,sah,,,"The reason to prefer simplicity is that fewer bits of information are required to store a simple theory.  This makes simple theories easier to use correctly (since there are fewer bits which can be subject to transcription errors, for example).  So among equally predictive theories, the simplest one has important advantages.<p>If simplicity is also aligned with some bias in the natural world, that's purely a bonus.  You might expect that to be the case if simple mechanisms were more probable than complex ones, and simple mechanisms were more likely to lead to simple behavior.  So maybe there's something to that idea, but maybe not -- this author seems to know a lot more about it than I do.",1213838346
