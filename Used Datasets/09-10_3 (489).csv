Check out some dissenting opinions from the article:<p>""A class I took in 2007 taught how to create a website with tables. I found out this year that they are finally teaching table free websites. Being a few years behind is definitely not smart, especially when you're paying so much to learn this information.""  (If you think the point of paying tens of thousands of dollars per year for college is to acquire knowledge whose shelf life is shorter than the time you spend there, then it's no wonder you think it's a bad idea.)<p>""[Students] don't know, yet, that they need to be constantly monitoring blogs and twitter for the latest information on the industry.""  (Methinks this person is confused about what ""web development"" is, thinking it means self-promotion and getting blog traffic rather than developing good web sites.)<p>""I think I learned more on my co-op at the time on web development then I learned in the class room. Only the concepts were relevant in the classroom - the languages and the techniques weren't.""  (Silly colleges teaching concepts instead of specific technologies!)<p>It's funny how so many web developers think that having the latest technology is absolutely required, instead of thinking about the costs and benefits of staying up to date.  The only aspect of web development where fashion is a driver is UI design.  Cutting-edge UI design sometimes (not always) requires cutting-edge UI implementation technologies.  For the rest, hell, every site has its own needs, and your site's needs might have been technologically solved years ago.  I think these kids could benefit from taking a calculus class and realizing that the concepts and the notation are older than their parents (hah, didn't know there <i>was</i> anything that old, did ya?)",1239501427

Are you selling iPhone apps or iPhone development services (or both)? I ran out of content quickly and was left a bit confused.<p>Also, the 2 secondary tabs don't really have any content, so why are they there? If you keep them you need graphics, even on the coming soon tab.<p>All that said, the iSk8 app sounds like a cool idea, and kudos for partnering with DSC.",1239501183

I know there are a lot of SIP providers out there and that their services are incredibly commoditized - but a SIP provider Skype is not.<p>Name a single other app/service with a well-established and globally-known brand name like Skype, where you can download an app, chat for free immediately with nearly everyone online, and also make land-line calls with a really hassle-free purchase process.<p>Skype is already considerably more expensive than a lot of other VOIP solutions out there - but they succeed much like Apple succeeds, by offering an easy-to-use product tied to a well-known brand for a price that's fair to consumers (but far from cheap). They don't need to race to the bottom like other undifferentiated SIP providers just to get customers.<p>There's a lot of value in user experience and branding.",1239501172

I'm an exceptional programmer in the language I know best, but it is not Ruby.  Your friend would not consider hiring me because of this too I'll bet -- yet I could probably build his site twice as fast as the best Ruby programmer.<p>You live with the limitations you impose upon yourself.",1239500906

There are C players who have the talent to become B players in 6 months, and A players after 5 years, and B players worth having because of their other abilities (management potential, mentoring).

22,558030,comment,557602.0,557602.0,0,0,dkarl,,,"If you're asking the question, then you're too young to decide against college.  Keep your options open.  It won't hurt your web development career, and if you change your mind about your career (like most people do between the ages of 18 and 25) you won't be stuck playing college catch-up.<p>You really don't want to go to college when you're years older than the other students.  All the kids will think you're a loser, and they'll think you're creepy if you try to hang out with them.  You'll think they're shallow and irresponsible, and you'll resent it when they do as well in class as you.  No, thanks.  Now is the time.  Just go.  If the obligatory college pastimes of drinking, socializing, and watching foreign films sound silly to you, I've got good news:  you'll have LOTS of free time at college to work on your web development skills.<p>P.S.  He got a variety of responses and a lively discussion among people who are still interested in web development.  The answers would be much more predictable if you could ask the people who entered college as programming freaks and developed an interest in economics or anthropology.

But that does not mean that lithium is hype, its all about energy density, good luck trying to drive an electric car with lead acid cells in the back, it would weigh a ton.<p>Maybe he should use a lead acid battery... in his cell phone.<p>Lead acid is great for many purposes: cheap, ridiculously easy charging circuity, good enough energy density.

The president of the U.S. can exercize his influence abroad but he can't exactly force other countries to do what he wants, unless he threatens with penalties (not limited to military action), which would help denigrate the image of the U.S. abroad even more. Obama's administration can pass whatever laws it wants. Financial institutions will always find a loophole to be exploited.
