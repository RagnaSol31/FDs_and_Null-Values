The first two of the three concepts you list are in Monotone, and I don't think they are in BitKeeper.<p>I don't think I am an expert in source control, but here is my source control resume:<p>* I spent a year (1996-97) where my primary job responsibility was maintaining a homegrown source control system.  That was when I started using source control.  So I've been using source control software for 13 years.<p>* Around 1998, I ported patch to native Win32 (although I never released the port, sigh.)<p>* I've been individually responsible for administering CVS and Subversion servers at two different companies, and part of a team that administered a CVS server at a third.<p>* I've used CVS, PVCS, Subversion, Git, darcs, Mercurial, and bzr.  I wanted to try out ClearCase, Vesta, OpenCM, and Monotone, but I never got around to it.<p>* One night, I wrote a client to Socialtext's REST API that provides CVS commands and semantics (including conflict detection and automatic merging) for command-line editing of their Wikis.  (Available at <a href=""http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/sw/stclient/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/sw/stclient/</a> if you like.)<p>Okay, so now you know I'm really not an expert; I've never even implemented a full source-control system from scratch once.  So take my opinion with a grain of salt.  Here it is, though:<p>Git is indeed a fantastic achievement.  It is the first source control system that's really designed to be used as a storage platform for applications.  It's about 10Ã— faster than other source control systems.  (I haven't used Perforce, but I hear it's pretty efficient too.)  It provides cryptographically secure authentication of the entire history (an idea taken from Monotone and OpenCM).  And the ecosystem of tools around Git is dramatically stronger than the ecosystem around any other source-control system, which is sort of a replication of the major innovation of Linux: decentralized innovation.",1236391156

2,506213,comment,363.0,363.0,0,0,stuntgoat,,,"Allow users to subscribe to other HN users' synopses, such that I would only see my favorite commenter's synopsis. Simply place it to the right of the link, taking up all that space that is not being used yet; put the synopsis in a more transparent color than the other text- like the <0 down-modded comments.<p>We ( as synopsis authors ) would invent shortcuts for rating and summarizing the content that would fit to the right or be truncated. And when a user clicks on comments, the full synopsis is always at the top of the comments.<p>And maybe the descriptors that different users would implement ( like their own tags/ratings for the content ) would become unique to that user, eventually, and have contextual meaning to that author. Each synopsis author would have their own tags that they could reuse. Only people who subscribed to that author could see their synopsis so authors' silly or cryptic or worthless synopsis descriptors would not clutter HN readers' experience unless they subscribed to a particular s-author ( synopsis author ).<p>So each user could have a customized right-hand HN site by subscribing to other synopsis authors and each synopsis author would have their own ways ( tags, most likely to start ) for communicating concise summaries/likes/dislikes of the content posted on HN.<p>This is the thread that started this suggestion:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=503983"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=503983</a><p>I wanted to move this thread here, since it is more appropriate.",1236390773

Because I really don't think that domain-squatting counts as either hacking or productive economic activity (""making something people want"", as pg puts it); when it's being done in order to get paid for worthless clicks, it's borderline fraud.

But data needs to be entered in the system somehow and patients need care and attention; and it makes sense to me to focus on one thing at a time, especially with a mission critical field such as health care.<p>> You could employ someone else to transcribe her notes at a salary more reasonable for the work but it is still, or at least should be, an unnecessary overhead.<p>People differ philosophically concerning what is important in health care. Some want quality and some want cheap ( most probably want both ). I don't work in the health care industry but I am curious how doctors would want to have their jobs structured at HMOs; do doctors want less patients and more time spent with them or do they want less time and the ability to see more patients?",1236388931
