The key point of the article is that it was a cultural rather than a resource based shift that helped Denmark become energy independent.""</i><p>To which you replied with something simultaneously vague (do you pose all of your arguments as questions? Are you practicing for Jeopardy?), and a straw-man misrepresentation of the original comment:<p><i>""I take it you're happy we haven't drilled any of our resources, haven't built a refinery in decades, and haven't built a nuclear power plant since the 1970s...are you saying that because we've basically forbidden the energy markets to work efficiently inside our country, energy prices are going high, and it's a good thing because maybe the culture will shift like Denmark?""</i><p>...which you followed with several long expositions about the virtues of the free market, and your inability to adequately predict the complexities thereof.<p>So based on my reading, to the extent that you're making any argument at all, it seems to be that regulation is the primary cause of energy price increases, and therefore we should lower production regulations (...and also drill more...) to lower prices.  This argument has little to do with the OP (that we need to use less energy), and as I pointed out, it teeters on the (faulty) premise that if only we could de-regulate energy <i>production</i>, we'd somehow be moving closer to the Efficient Free Market Utopia That Will Solve All of Our Energy Problems (tm), while ignoring the fact that we <i>heavily</i> subsidize wasteful energy consumption.<p>So, at the end of the day, I'm led to the same conclusion as the OP:  in a ""free market"" where we subsidize the hell out of wasteful consumption, and do little (or nothing) to promote systemic energy efficiency, the obvious first policy step involves <i>reducing our wastefulness</i> -- not drilling for more oil.",1218419996.0

What's the most popular language <i>for a certain type of task</i>?  C is certainly not exactly ideal for quickly setting up a dynamic website, and no sane person is going to use something like Java to write a video encoder.  A better question would be, <i>when there is a reasonable choice between many languages for a given task, what is the relative popularity of those languages</i>?",1218419961.0

4,272715,comment,272641.0,272641.0,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"No, Google is an information aggregation company.<p>I'm spending the summer in a town I don't know much about, and today, I wanted a sandwich, and my refrigerator was empty.  So I went to Google Maps, and typed in ""Intersection of $street1 and $street2, $town, $state to sandwiches"".  Yes, ""to sandwiches.""  And it gave me a list of sandwich shops ordered by distance from my apartment.  I clicked on one, saw the map directions, and went for a walk to grab myself a Subway.<p>Think about this for a second--the vast number of different levels of data aggregation, along with language parsing and tagging, necessary for such a seamless system to exist--yet it becomes incredibly useful in practice.  And with useful services, especially useful services that allow people to search for commercial products--be it a sandwich or a computer--comes advertising money.<p>But the reason they can <i>be</i> an advertising company is because of their information aggregation.  The ads are just a way to make money off of their core idea.",1218419519.0

That is, some of the most useful improvements are also the ones that take a surprisingly small amount of time to implement; the bottleneck for many of the most useful changes is not coding time, but good ideas to implement.  There's always a bunch of hard, complex projects that are lying around, but what is always in short supply are the easy, simple projects whose hardest part is coming up with the idea/algorithm/concept for it in the first place.<p>Of course, the other bottleneck for ""short and simple"" changes is convincing a developer to do it... or even convincing oneself to do it.",1218419276.0

Its just that when proprietary software fails, nobody really notices, because the reason it fails was <i>because</i> nobody noticed it and bought it.<p>That's one of the differences between OSS and proprietary software; OSS fails when nobody cares enough about it to continue developing it; proprietary software fails when nobody cares enough about it to use it.",1218419113.0

Add to that the fact that for the average Google user, URLs are for geeks, and we can see where it may be very difficult to get people to realize that the knol pages are Google controlled content.  Even more difficult to get them to care.  They got their information.  Case closed as far as they are concerned.

I found some of the statistics in the case of Windows source indicative of lower readability and maintainability...defined global funcs and structs counts are higher than the Open Source systems (FreeBSD and Linux) and file length is significantly longer, even though Linux is a significantly larger codebase (the largest of all of the systems analyzed).  But, of course, that's just numbers...roughly meaningless without context.  And, obviously, Microsoft manages to keep shipping code that mostly works, and they hire some of the best developers in the world.<p>Here's the paper:<p><a href=""http://www.spinellis.gr/pubs/conf/2008-ICSE-4kernel/html/Spi08b.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spinellis.gr/pubs/conf/2008-ICSE-4kernel/html/Spi...</a><p>And some additional commentary:<p><a href=""http://www.spinellis.gr/sw/4kernel/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spinellis.gr/sw/4kernel/</a><p>Anyway, while I've never seen the Windows source code, I have looked at FreeBSD, Linux and Solaris, and all are pretty good.  I think FreeBSD may be the cleanest (partly because it tries to be fewer things to fewer people than Linux), but probably not technically the most interesting.  And, of course, I've only taken a few quick trips through FreeBSD and Solaris, and I've actually written driver code for Linux.  Doing real work in a codebase always makes the warts more apparent.",1218417554.0
