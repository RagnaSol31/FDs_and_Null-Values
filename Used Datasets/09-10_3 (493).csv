They're more like attractions.<p>I pay $60/month for climbing (in Maryland), or it's $16 to go once. Rental harness and shoes is about $9. The prices fluctuate depending on the gym you go to though. Mine offers classes sometimes too, so if you want to take those it will be more money, but by all means they're not required. Try to find a local rock gym; googling works fine and searching climbing forums.<p>I go with a few coworkers who also caught the climbing bug, there are also always regulars at the gym who you get to know after a while and I sometimes meet new people at the gym to belay me. (You can't really climb by yourself as you need a person to support you on the ground ['belay'] unless you're bouldering. Bouldering is close to the ground and is generally more inventive and harder as the problems (a problem is a set of hand/foot holds that you have to traverse to complete a route in bouldering) tend to be very technical. For more actual explanation on how everything works, wikipedia is a great resource, or alternatively, you can just contact me.<p>It's a great hobby, in my opinion. Good for physical development, good for meeting new people and very rewarding as you see yourself progress to harder climbs.",1228440712

38,386448,comment,384606.0,385819.0,0,0,bokonist,,,"It wasn't just the American west that attracted the ambitious.  Sample from a time and place with healthy entrepreneurial capitalism and I think you'll find that ambitious people had a much greater inclination towards starting a business than they do today.  Examples: every American city pre-1930, most of Western Europe between 1815 and 1914, the Netherlands post 1600, and Venice in the 15th century.  Nothing like our modern ""organization man"" economy existed in these places.  Ambitious, upwardly mobile people did not find safe jobs as managers.  They did not rise to the top by climbing the ladder.  They started workshops, built factories, and captained merchant ships.  The British East India Company and the Medici bank were among the world's very first startups, and they were both highly successful.  I'd also note that the Medici bank had fewer employees than a well funded silicon valley startup.  And each of its nine branches was a semi-independent startup - kind of like your ""pooled-risk management company"".<p>Of course, in places without entrepreneurial capitalism, most ambitious people aimed to work for large existing organizations - usually the government, church, or military.  Examples:  France before 1815, the papal states, China for its entire history, the late Roman empire, modern Japan, and modern Europe.<p>It seems part of your thesis is: ""For most of history, ambitious people sought to join large organizations such as the church, state, or army.  But with the rise of entrepreneurial capitalism, ambitious people instead chose to start or join small, growth oriented businesses""<p>I agree with this part of your thesis completely.  My point of contention is that I don't think entrepreneurial capitalism began in the late twentieth century.  Entrepreneurial capitalism began in earnest around the 17th century, and peaked across the Western world in 1914.  Then the world wars and the progressive movement almost completely wiped out entrepreneurial capitalism and replaced it with the civil service state/managed capitalism.<p>The rise of Silicon Valley is a step towards restoration, not a brand new innovation.  Nor are venture capital firms anything new.  It used to be that banks and angels were the primary sources of venture capital, see the Boston Associates for one example of many: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Associates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Associates</a>.  But post-New Deal, banks were highly regulated, non-risk taking entities.  The 95% marginal tax rates severely limited the supply of wealthy investors.  The founders of Silicon Valley had to basically reinvent the wheel and call it a different name.",1228439594

The one advantage that a language scoped packaging system has over a system-wide system is developer adoption.<p>Debian, Gentoo, Redhat, FreeBSD, etc all depend on heavily on volunteers to create the packages, manage dependencies, issue security announcements, feed bug reports and patches upstream to developers, etc.  I've used Gentoo for a long time and I've watched it struggle in recent years as it loses volunteers.  New releases take longer to reach portage, some software never finds its way to portage at all, and I find more and more broken packages.  The only Ruby package I install from portage is Ruby itself.<p>The thing is, <i>every</i> Ruby developer uses RubyGems.  There are no volunteers because the developers themselves create the packages for each release.  I <i>think</i> this is more sustainable, even if I <i>don't</i> think RubyGems is as good as the packaging tools used by the major distributions.",1228439126
