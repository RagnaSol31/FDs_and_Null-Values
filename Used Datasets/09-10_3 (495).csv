You can always go back and ""tweak"" IE if you have time.<p>Companies can thrive on less than 100% of the market; look at Apple as one example. You don't have to win <i>everyone</i> over to succeed -- and in this case, IE6 share will continue to decrease with time, so your market segment will increase likewise.<p>Don't kick IE6 users out, but don't go out of your way to make the experience flawless. If the issues are fairly noticeable, you can put a note saying ""You're using an outdated browser; for the best experience please upgrade.""",1222826389
