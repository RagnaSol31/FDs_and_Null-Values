Even if Bluray had a slight edge of HD-DVD because of PS3's (it's obviously not a huge edge) this would lead to more rentals (and Blockbuster dropped support for HD-DVD from stores after running a pilot and finding out Bluray was renting 3 to 1).<p>Since Blockbuster isn't renting HD-DVD and Walmart stopped selling them, studios are being forced to release on Bluray which means people have access to more titles, which in turn makes Bluray players more valuable.<p>This snowball effect is slowly (for now) killing the HD-DVD industry.",1203213371

I'm inclined to believe it, though, because of the corroborating fact that he also invented the word ""bit"". That's pretty compelling. And impressive.",1203213245

To say the capacity for rapid brain-digital interfacing wouldn't have an impact on intelligence would be like saying the internet is unlikely to effect society. Not saying I subscribe to the guy's timetable though.<p>I agree about the goal part. I'd say GO would be gone way before then anyway. It'll take a new algorithm and some more computer power but not general intelligence. The actual Turing Test is always a good one, but if they passed it computers would be way more intelligent than us to beat us at our own game.",1203212955

Caveats and all, trolls are characterized by their participation in negative-karma two-person conversations and  down-voting of their comments by a diverse and changing set of users. A simple learning algorithm should zap the predictable ones. Trolls are nourished by attention and early detection and removal should nip that behavior in the bud.",1203210565

Indexing for search is the simplest of the bunch and the most likely use of the tech that we'll see soon.<p>RWW has it right that the major challenge this poses to Google is a proliferation of industry specific applications that monetize better information management by virtue of knowing exactly what their users want and figuring out creative ways to aggregate it. Google is particularly weak with multiple languages: their focus on language-agnostic translation tools makes them vulnerable in foreign markets.<p>Then again, if Google provides the tools to let these vertical portals manage their own on-site advertising, who cares who is doing the actual document indexing/analysis?",1203210135
