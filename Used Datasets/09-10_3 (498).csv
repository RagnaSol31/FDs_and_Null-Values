If you are broke, like me then consider using an email to sms gateway. you will need to know the subscriber's provider. It can work if you are offering a one-way sms service such as updates. Watch out for SMSC spam catchers . 2. If you have money, but no time then you can use a provider such as Clickatell or Verisign and they will do all the background work. All you will need is an access to their API plus a monthly fee of 500-1500/month on top of SMS fees. 3. You have money plus time plus contacts then Forget all these guys and provision your own short-code, then start emailing your contacts at Verizon and them to  give you access to their SMSC. When people say ""I don't know how twitter pays for 250k SMS/month"" they don't know that Twitter is probably paying less than your startup will for 10k SMS. that is the advantage of working directly with the carriers. SMS is super cheap for them. 4. You got money, but want to be careful, then I suggest <a href=""http://mobivity.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobivity.com</a> or <a href=""http://textmarks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://textmarks</a>. This service charge you for zero to only a few bucks and give you a unique keyword plus short-code. You can easily talk to Greg Harris who is the CEO of Mobivity and he is very open to entrepreneurs looking to use his service which is why he has an API.I mean  he will literally let you launch a product competing with his. Textmarks doesn't have an API to my knowledge but you can certainly email Ariel Poller. i would try something like apoller or a.poller@textmarks.com. Be smart when you choose a provider that offers a short-code.When you rent a shared short-code, it can change at any time and now your 50k users have to know your new short-code. If you are doing a interactive SMS service, that can suck. If you are going for the private short-code, then you are safe as a long as you can shell out 1000/month. If you are proficient with Mobile applications, the best way to go is to build your own messaging application. Now when someone sends you a SMS or you send your user a sms ask send them a link as well and ask them to download it. there you have it, no more SMS fees for that guy and your messages can be 500 characters long. OOps I gotta go make more coffee. Email me if you like and I can be more detailed, i just went on here without knowing exactly what you are doing.",1192499980.0

Ruby OO is nice, but then OO is often the cause of problems for me (python makes quasi functional styles easy). <p>People don't really use XML with hibernate (and haven't for some years from what I see). Hibernate does try to cater for every corner case though (perhaps the cause of the ""bloat""). But its the 80/20 rule again - most people only want 20% of the features, the problem is that every one wants a different 20% (hence you get subjective bloat). ",1192498311.0
