Even children do this.  (Well, Zuckerberg might not find personas, roles, and code-switching intuitive, but I think super focused computer types are not representative... ;) )  There is scholarly work to back me up, but I can't think of any names to start with except Labov and Goffman -- they are completely brilliant mind f<i></i>s if you bother to read them.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Eve...</a><p>Re the UI -- spot on, but maybe that is a UI problem, not a UI boundary condition, and we could start researching cues for persona switching on the computer screen.

Get shit done to make yourself happy.<p>When reading a few responses here, I'm taken back with the comment ""It's easy for you to preach, you don't have kids"". In real life, I heard similar sentiments.<p>I'm having a hard time trying to understand the feeling when people said such things. Having kids is a choice, no? The same thing with living über-minimalistic life. People who don't have kids may have serious problems too.<p>Me and my wife, we don't have kids. But what we do have in terms of problems:<p>1. Selfish, arrogant, and wasteful parents. We helped them a lot and never received a single thanks. They love to have elaborate parties even though they are broke.<p>2. A 14 years old sister. Amazingly selfish little brat, complete disconnect between what she wants and what our parents could provide. Fucking android for 14 years old, what for? I cannot imagine her coding up some android app.<p>I don't have a million dollar and far from it. When I was 26, I swallowed the ""American Dream"" Kool-aid bottoms up and really needed that 1 million dollar:<p>We bought a big house, with .25 acre land. We owned 3 cars. I did all the stupid things that can only happen if you own a house: upgrading HVAC, kitchen, etc. etc.<p>Only 1 thing I did that wasn't stupid: paying for wife's school.<p>Now, we don't own TV, 1 car, 1 couch, < 700 sqft apartment, 2 cats, and 0-10 minutes commute.<p>When we went through the transformation, crazy things happen. My sisters respect me a lot more. When they want superfluous things and I said no, they listen far more than they ever did. Crazy things happen with the parents too. They listened, twice, when I told them about the elaborate parties.<p>Not needing money empowered me far more than money ever did. And I'm quite sure that I'm not unique in that regard.\nMy future kids won't have lawn to run around or the latest apple gadgets to pimp around. Their life won't be govern by money. This plan may or may not work, my real life friends would be the judge of that.<p>To drive my points further, unrelated to my life story, several tech co-founders have told me directly. ""The best time to raise money, is when you don't need money"".<p>Extra brownie point: To buy freedom into United States (the easy way), you really need a million dollar. <a href=""http://bit.ly/9RItQM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/9RItQM</a>",1292907051.0

When google returns the Airbnb url, the optimal thing for them to display is ""Airbnb"".  If they returned the extended title, it would blend in more with the other search results, and it might take a user longer to find it.<p>The title plays an important role with the your whole customer user experience if you consider the role it plays in getting them to your page.<p>By providing flexible search anchor tag text, you can hint at google about your service relevance, while also targeting users who are already familiar with your brand.",1292906751.0

In addition, we have a system that systematically overrepresents the interests of rural counties.<p>There is a relatively ""easy"" way to fix the second problem: states with large populations should start splitting into multiple states.

Because it's artificially low - so the argument goes - that's what explains (at least in part) the current levels of competition.<p>Infrastructure players claim that once regulatory certainty is provided (against net neutrality) - then, since the pot of profits for infrastructure providers will increase - this will in turn encourage more entrants to the market.<p>Actually - one way you might argue against their economic argument is say: okay, but if the profit pot is only being increased because infrastructure players are bundling content, then infrastructure players that want to give users completely free reign to surf where they want will be priced out of the market.  Bundlers will be able to subsidise network access at a lower price because of income generated through the content.  Non-bundlers won't be able to do this and will quickly go out of business...  Since big media content is already tightly controlled by a few large corporations, only a few infrastructure players will be able to provide such subsidies.

When it comes to creative writing I enjoy using pen and paper, but since it often needs to end up in digital form at one point or another I sometimes skip that step.<p>When it comes to <i>diagrams</i>, though, nothing beats pen and paper. I have long given up any hope of finding them later, though - all but the most important diagrams are destined for the recycling bin from the get-go. That's an approach I picked up from the 37signals blog or one of their presentations somewhere, and I highly recommend it. I no longer worry about making it legible or easy to understand, I just dump my ideas onto the page. For extremely important diagrams, I suppose I could then scan it before throwing the hard copy away, but I can't remember ever doing that. In the context of web development, sketched diagrams have always been a short term intermediate step for me - my code may not be as clear or well-documented as it should be (I try!) but it's still more obvious and less hassle than my chicken-scratch diagrams.",1292905556.0
