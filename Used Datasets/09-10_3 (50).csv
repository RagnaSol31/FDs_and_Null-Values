21,954312,comment,953913.0,954242.0,0,0,mbrubeck,,,"Some things I find interesting about Chrome OS, even if I don't end up using it myself:<p>1. Web apps are a plus for a secondary device, because you won't need to copy files back and forth, or install sync/VCS software (a hassle for non-expert users).  HTML5/Gears storage remove some of the disadvantages by letting you continue work offline.  (On the other hand, services like Dropbox have made it just about easy enough for non-expert users to do this with traditional ""local"" files.)<p>2. No user-installed native code means certain security concerns could be greatly reduced.  All installed code is signed, verified on boot, mounted on a read-only partition, and can be restored to a pristine state by the firmware.  Web apps are subject to browser same-origin policies and to Chrome's process isolation.  Downloaded native code can run only in the NaCl sandbox.  A broken app can't trash all your stuff, because data from each web site is accessible only to that site.  (On the other hand, web apps are almost universally vulnerable to XSS and XSRF and to server-side exploits.  NaCL has been broken before and will be broken again.  The web security model is a start, but it has flaws both in design and in practice.)<p>3. The interface is simplified in a few key ways.  Instead of windows that represent <i>documents</i> within <i>apps</i> and often have their own separate <i>tabs</i> or <i>pages</i>, everything the user interacts with is a tab within a browser.  Not a big deal for savvy computer users, but for novices this is one less concept to learn.  Everything is a web page; they don't need to be ""installed""; they all appear in the tab strip and have addresses that can be bookmarked and emailed.  (On the other hand, web apps share only the most basic UI conventions; they are often radically inconsistent from one to the next.)<p>4. The Chrome team's obsession with speed may prove to be one of those subtle, hard-to-explain benefits.  (Like trying to explain why Apple's obsession with detail matters, to someone who hasn't used their products.)  I never had a problem with Firefox until I used Chrome for a few days; now any other browser seems painfully unresponsive.  Same thing with git compared to darcs/bzr/svn.  When more operations move from ""fast"" to ""instantaneous"" it changes the feel of the product, and that affects usage patterns.<p>5. Compared to Windows, Mac OS X, or normal GNU/Linux distros, Chrome OS has less overall code, is conceptually simpler, and has few legacy/compatibility constraints.  If it's managed right, this could mean that it will be faster to evolve and optimize, easier to secure, and ideal for experimenting with new technologies and user interfaces.  It will also help motivate next-generation web applications and web standards.",1258788193.0
22,954311,comment,953454.0,954006.0,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I was specifically addressing the claim that any scientist not entirely forthcoming with their data clearly has something to hide. This is clearly false - in the same way that one cannot presume someone is guilty because they won't let you search them.<p>Think of this from their perspective: they're sick and tired of crackpots and conspiracy theorists taking their data, running ludicrous analyses on them, and misinforming the public. They don't have the time to shoot down every single terrible interpretation of the data there is, so the best action is to hide it.<p>Not saying this was the right move, but entirely understandable given their situation. The fact that they were not volunteering their data around is certainly not by itself damning evidence of any sort.",1258788150.0

The more well-educated people we have the more California's economy is likely to grow.

Even if they needed third-party apps (which is debatable), if you left the platform, there would be a hundred thousand more people scrambling to take your place.<p>2)  You are presumably developing for the iPhone instead of doing, oh, Enterprise Sales because you don't want to do Enterprise Sales or you are not good at doing Enterprise Sales.  <i>You are doing Enterprise Sales.</i>  The Enterprise doesn't care about the product you're selling enough to devote more than 5 minutes a week from a call center in India to the deal.  If you have doubts as to whether this is a good sign, consult with your local Enterprise Sales engineer and ask what stage in the pipeline he thinks you are probably in.<p>3)  If you stopped developing for the iPhone and started developing web applications or desktop applications or, indeed, almost any other type of software, you wouldn't have to ask anyone's permission to sell your software or improve your software.<p>4)  It seems that you're spending an awful lot of engineering time trying to get permission to market your software to people who think it is worth $2, on the outside.
