You will have to pay capital gains taxes when you sell your shares, however.<p>4) If it is restricted stock (e.g. vesting), there is a tax issue.  It is simple to deal with, however.  Like others' have pointed out, you need to do a an 83(b) election.  It is a simple one page thing, but you have to do it in a timely fashion.  So look into it now.  If you don't, you will get taxable income as your stock vests, which in most cases, is not what you want.  The reason you don't want this is you will have to pay taxes on ""phantom income,"" i.e. on taxable income that isn't associated with associated cash flow.",1208742386

That being said, I can't see any MBA program being worthy of a <i>hacker's</i> time.<p>MIT's program is recognized as one of the most quantitative programs, but from experience, it is really not all that quantitative or analytical. My graduate program at MIT (TPP) was in the third floor of E40, right next to the Sloan School (across a walk bridge).  I took some classes there (various econ courses).  I helped TA one MBA class entitled Digital Business.  My wife was a statistics TA there (PhD in OR dept., also in E40).  And my one of my thesis advisors was a Sloan professor.<p>When I took classes there the actual MBA students (as opposed to other MIT grads and undergrads) were easily overwhelmed with the math and frankly not interested in it.  Many would start and drop my wife's courses (through no fault of her own!).  As a result, the actual MBA courses ended up being dumbed down, even though I wouldn't be surprised if the MIT program <i>is</i> more quantitative than others.<p>The MIT MBA program is also known as a more geek friendly place.  There is an IT track you can select.  But, similarly, the classes aren't for hackers at all.  My wife took one of the core computer classes, and it was so ridiculously not hackeresque it wasn't even funny.<p>Anyway, you can easily learn everything on your own.  Is there value in networking?  Sure.  But you can get that without spending $120K+.  You can either enroll in a program like the one I did where you actually get paid to go to it (imagine that?).  Or you can just start participating in the community (business plan competitions, talks, social events, etc.).<p>Are there other reasons to go?  Sure.  In many jobs on Wall St. you still need an MBA to cross a threshold in the company.  My sister-in-law is in one of those jobs and they eventually paid for her to go to an executive MBA program on the weekends.  She didn't learn anything there she didn't already know.",1208741805
15,168969,comment,168840.0,168935.0,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"By default, I block ads. If I find the site to be useful (the litmus test is ""will I return?"") then I unblock the ads. Why do I do this? There are far too many digg/reddit link whores that for all intents and purposes add no value to the Internet, but have tricked me into clicking on their links. The sites that are linked usually repackage somebody else's work into their template, and have manipulated the system into getting people to click on their links. In some cases, it is flat out copyright infringement. And if you load the ads on their page, they have won. In fact, they'd probably use the ad revenue to help legally defend themselves if the original authors of the content they copied were to sue them. It's quite despicable and that's why I can reconcile blocking ads. Like I said, I unblock ads on websites that I find useful.<p>If you find a website useful, I think it is much better to act in good faith and put up with the ads. If the ads bother you, then try to find an alternative website for that purpose, or contact the authors and present your dilemma. Perhaps they will offer a subscription service sans advertisements, or tone the existing ads down a notch.",1208741797

20,168964,comment,168636.0,168636.0,0,0,flipbrad,,,"""Fifty years ago it would have seemed shocking for a public company not to pay dividends. Now many tech companies don't. The markets seem to have figured out how to value potential dividends. Maybe that isn't the last step in this evolution. Maybe markets will eventually get comfortable with potential earnings. (VCs already are, and at least some of them consistently make money.)""<p>Does this not worry anyone? It's basically a statement justifying investment based on confidence, not that an investor is able to reliably guess whether a company will be able to generate PROFIT or not, but that it will be able to generate EARNINGS at all!<p>this is not investing in two birds in a bush (likely to be profitable). It's investing on the basis of four in the nest (potentially earning money at all!).<p>that's astoundingly risky. Now, either you believe investors are stupid and risk-insensitive (or risk-blind! not uncommon in a bubble) and will keep investing the same sums of money as they ever have, or you believe they are clever, credit strapped and most certainly not risk insensitive. Option A means a world of pain up ahead for investors and their backers, because we're in a mighty bubble. Option B means PG is wrong (though doubtless he'd like to be right, because it makes flipping seedstage companies from the YC stable a hell of a lot easier)<p>Based on the total inability of even the biggest players on the scene -  e.g.YouTube, Facebook and Bebo - to monetise, I really don't see how the confidence to move to an earning-optimistic (from profit-optimistic) investing mode is at all justified. If anything, earnings are less certain than they ever have been, the slide should be the other way.",1208740622
