I found that very unnerving. On the other hand, I found that you can ask if you are being detained and if not, if you are free to go. It's a funky kabuki dance you do. There actually a video on that site of interacting with a border patrol agent. The agent wanted to detain, search, and interrogate the driver but the driver understood that since they were not at the border the agent did not have authority to do so, even though it appeared that the agent stood his ground. It was a very interesting interaction.<p>I remember in my mid twenties I was driving with the chief of a local police department in his personal car a good ways from his home (long story). While we were talking, his speed got too fast and he passed a radar checkpoint that a state trooper had set up.<p>I never saw a man go from totally macho to totally polite and subservient quicker in my life. It was all ""yes sir"" and ""no sir"" and ""I believe I was not paying attention to my speed and was probably speeding, but I have no idea how fast I was going"", etc. You would have thought that the man's personal deity had appeared to him from the way he acted.<p>The trooper gave him the ticket too! It my my heart warm to see the system working the way it should.<p>Of course, many times the system doesn't work the way it should, and once you have too many laws you easily reach a point where law enforcement officials can capriciously determine which ones to enforce and which ones not to. (We reached that point a long time ago) Adding extra cops and border agents does not make these problems go away and in fact just make them worse.

Definitely no offense taken at your comments...<p>I forgot to mention that the guard at one point said, ""You have no rights here"", which I found oddly unnerving.  I realized at the time that I had no idea what rights (if any) I had on Canadian soil at the Canadian entrance checkpoint.<p>I agree with you about the best strategy, and that the guards are not likely to be cordial, etc.  The experience taught me (for the first time) what it feels like to be someone who isn't automatically given the benefit of the doubt by law enforcement officers, and nudged me firmly in the direction of libertarianism (small L).<p>I think the most worrisome aspect is when the law empowers guards, police, etc., to use too many whims.  There was also no method for oversight... in retrospect I should have asked them to send a supervisor over, but in the stress of the moment I didn't think to ask for one (though my subsequent phone call suggests that the supervisor wouldn't have been sympathetic)...",1260753160.0
