The next day all my tires were flat from the sand and gravel that got lodged between the rubber tire and the rim.  My windows were down and the inside of the car was full of sand and dirt and plants.<p>The second time, I fell asleep on the interstate. The sound of the tires on the dirt woke me up and when I pulled back onto the road, the car started doing 360ies until I crashed into a guard rail.  I never fell asleep again and no one was hurt either time.  I was really amazed both times that the car didn't flip.  The second time, the people behind me saw me spinning out of control and like, 5 cars pulled in behind me. I feel really lucky, not only for myself, but for others I could have hurt.<p>I ride motorcycles too, not in a long time, but I remember times when I'd be going through a turn and hit a patch of sand or dirt and lose traction.  It's quite scary. Almost went off the side of a mountain when I got my first bike and still didn't know to handle high speed tight turns. Sure knocked the invincibility out of me.",1269481986.0

With a couple good submissions or comments, you could have that in a matter of days.<p>The community has grown, and these restrictions aren't ""indexed to inflation"" so to speak, so the bar is lower all the time. Also, while I personally agree that downvotes should only be used for trollish things (or really just done away with in favor of flagging), that has never been universally agreed upon (and I have seen this topic come up a lot).",1269479675.0

But the female engineers I know make it a higher priority in their job searches because they've been burned this way before, in work and in school -- specifically because they are women.  I don't know any male engineers who feel that they've been in situations, in the context of engineering, where they were systematically dismissed because they were men.<p>I mean, you hardly need a locker room atmosphere to turn women away.  Plenty of little things can contribute.  Maybe you have a guy who constantly fawns over one particular coworker.  Maybe the team has grown to expect that the women will bring the bagels on Friday mornings.  Maybe the labels ""emotional"" or ""too sensitive"" stick a little too easily.  Maybe t-shirts at work events only tend to show up in men's M-XL.  Maybe another group tends to explain things to the new female engineer in very small words, implicitly not acknowledging her as a peer.  Whatever.<p>Here's the thing:  you need to be sure that the women in your workplace are comfortable telling you these things.  As a man, it can be <i>hard</i> to realize that there are problems when the work environment is 90% men.  Why?  Because you're not on the receiving end of all the bullshit, most of the stereotypes and cultural norms work in your favor, and most of the people you know are the same way.  Very few men are thinking, ""man, I wish I could make women feel unvalued.""  Most of the toxic behavior happens out of apathy or ignorance.<p>But, even then, most little problems, in isolation, are just that:  little problems in search of solutions. Unfortunately, when women do speak up, what they often hear is, ""I don't see the problem.  That's never happened to me.  I think you're overreacting.""  That response is, I would venture, why having another woman on the team is reassuring:  because she probably would see the problem, it probably has happened to her.  That response is why women in engineering want to know they'll have someone (male or female) willing to back them up, or at least to listen:  because they're used to having to go it alone.",1269479464.0

You can go to a great deal of trouble performing secure key distribution, but if you don't have a way of knowing you're doing it with who you think you're doing it with, you're basically screwed.<p>PGP is nice in that it bundles key distribution together with authentication, so you can at least be sure that the person you spoke to first is the same person you're speaking to now, assuming nobody's taken a $5 wrench to their knees.  Unfortunately, PGP and all other factoring based key distribution methods are only secure for a limited time.  People often say things like, ""Secure for 1000 years assuming...""   What they don't tell you is those assumptions (e.g. crackers only use classical computers with Moore's law scaling resources and currently known algorithms"") are ridiculous.  In general, advances in algorithms alone accelerate things greatly.  Messages you send in PGP today will probably be trivial to crack within a decade, and that's not even accounting for quantum computing!  Note:  If you are interesting enough, this translates to messages you send today <i>will</i> be logged, archived, and cracked within 10 years.  This is fine for credit card transactions.  Not so fine for government secrets.  (If you ever hear of a government employee transmitting state secrets using PGP, you are well justified to freak out.)<p>Quantum Cryptography promises to at least get rid of that problem, since the impossibility of cloning quantum information means that keys cannot be archived and cracked at a later time.  However, authentication with a party you have not physically met remains a bit of a pickle.",1269479388.0

83,1217394,comment,1216983.0,1217324.0,0,0,rosser,,,"For your first question, I can only extrapolate from my own experience. Having, thankfully, never been in an avalanche or with a group that triggered one, take that for what it's worth. That said, the groups I've been out of bounds with have guys outnumbering girls at a ratio well over 10:1, so simple odds are against the guys. The few times there have been women with us, they've tended to be a bit more level-headed and safety-conscious. (As always, the plural of anecdote is not <i>data</i>.)<p>Your second question doesn't really make sense. First, there's no ""protecting"" someone from an avalanche. In a slide, you're looking at kilotons of frozen water moving towards you at a speed limited only by gravity and the slope of the mountain face it's falling down. If you're lucky, you're ""only"" buried in something whose density upon settling approaches that of concrete, and not carried into the trees at speeds that will pulp you on impact.<p>Moreover, when you're riding out of bounds, you take your runs one at a time, precisely because of the avalanche risk.  If there is a slide, the rest of the group will come looking for you once it has subsided. The odds of finding one person buried in an avalanche are bad enough; looking for more than one at a time pretty well guarantees someone's not coming home that day -- or ever again.",1269479066.0
