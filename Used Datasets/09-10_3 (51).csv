And remember how open they are required to be, which is ""not at all"". They could stop releasing source tomorrow, and, short of feeling morally superior, there is nothing anyone could do about it.</i><p>I don't think the issue is whether or not they keep the source open, but whether or not their marketing is dishonest or hypocritical. I, for one, don't care that the iPhone has a completely closed ecosystem. If, however, Apple came out and said that their platform was free and open I'd be pretty annoyed.",1302335726.0

If you've studied ancient greek in school, that part of the test is probably as easy for you as the algebra part must seem to anyone who went to school in the past couple of decades (it looks about as hard as math homework from when I was 15 or so).<p>edit:<p>It's interesting. I do have a certain romantic attachment to this kind of classic humanist education, e.g. it irks me that the history and geography section has me floundered and I'm somewhat sorry that I didn't have the drive to do better in Latin in school.<p>But then I think, there's so much other interesting things to know and experience. At times when I wish I could read Cicero's <i>Orationes In Catilinam</i> in its original form, I need to remind myself that I can read and understand, say, this little piece of genius:<p><pre><code>  fib = 1 : 1 : [ a+b | (a,b) <- zip fib (tail fib) ]</code></pre>",1302335452.0

Our boss, who conceived of it, thought he was some kind of old school mainframe (""Big Iron"") guy who talked a lot about using the unused capacity on all the desktops at companies at night (the ""Dark"" part, like ""dark fiber"").<p>I wrote the Linux kernel block device module and the other guy on the project wrote the part that ran on all the users desktops, mainly just a key-value store indexed by block number (the users liked to kill the process, which made it terribly unreliable).  Back then, we used Linux purely for development, under the theory that once we ""proved"" it worked with the rinkydink Linux open source operating system, the company could then justify the purchase of the HP-UX and AIX kernel development kits and we'd port it to machines that people ""actually"" use.<p>We all know how that last part turned out.<p>But really, if you want to do something exactly like this (rather than the VMs that davecampbell suggests) these days (that is, since about 2003), you'd be best off using md software raid over Network Block Device.
