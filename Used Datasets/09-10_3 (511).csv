9,587921,comment,587881.0,587881.0,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, they're definitely giving you the short end of the stick.  It's unfair.  It's terrible.  But there might be nothing you can do about it.<p>Most sites with an API have in their API agreement that they can cut you off at anytime with or without reason.  Zillow states:<p><i>Zillow.com may change, suspend or discontinue the Zillow API and suspend or terminate your use of the Zillow API, Zillow Data, and/or Zillow Brand & Links at any time for any reason, without notice.</i><p>They've decided that you were great when you were adding value to them, but now you're a competitor and they're going to shut you down.  This is the unfortunate circumstance of relying on services that can change their terms at any time.<p>I don't agree with the extent that RMS takes the free software argument all the time, but when he talks about cloud computing, this is what he's talking about.  Providers are saying, ""Don't worry.  Leave everything to us.  It will be nice and you don't have to maintain anything.""  It also means that you have no recourse when they decide to change their terms.  You become beholden to them and their good graces - sounds like a feudal relationship in a way.  Cross your lord and you'll live to regret it.<p>Really, the worst you can do to them is get them a lot of bad press.  Maybe that will swing the power to your side - ""attention developers: zillow will just cut you off from their API if they see you as competition.""  Might make Zillow more amenable to paying you a little more.  Lots of sites would jump on publishing such a thing.  The FSF or other FOSS advocates might write up stuff as a ""warning: don't let this happen to you"" about cloud computing.  Zillow, I'm sure, would like to avoid their name in that mess - probably to the tune of more money than they're offering now.<p>Just remember.  Enemies threaten; friends warn.  Be very nice with Zillow and kinda casually mention that you think you might pitch TechCrunch on the idea of a story about the situation - cutting off API access and all.  Remember, you're happy to sell and not mad at them, but that they might not come off looking so nice in the press at $250.",1241142617.0

In the RedHat 5 days (a decade before RHEL 5, mind you) the BSDs had a huge third party software library available using either the ports tree to compile from source or using ""pkg"" files precompiled from the same source base and available for download from the distribution FTP sites.<p>The BSD package management platform doesn't really address OS upgrades, which has been a weakness for me when considering it for business use. The preferred method of upgrading for a long time was to check the code base out and recompile it periodically. FWIW this doesn't have the Gentoo stigma -- it's not done for the optimizations, it was simply the most pragmatic way to distribute updates to large systems over the small network links of the time (you can easily maintain an up to date system over a dialup modem if you've installed it some other way).<p>NetBSD specifically has a focus on running on as many architectures as possible. This isn't a big win for you perhaps, but it makes the OS suitable for installation on embedded devices. The NetBSD distribution tends to be fairly small, which also plays well into running on modest devices.<p><i>Why would I want to use one or the other?</i><p>I would suggest selecting one and giving it an honest assessment for six or so months, trying to use it daily for the same things you use Linux for. Linux has overwhelming developer and industrial inertia behind it, so you may well find that you prefer CentOS, but it will broaden your horizons, particularly around the edges -- firewalls, RAID, kernels, package management, and so on.<p>You might also do the same thing for Solaris 10 (particularly not OpenSolaris first). It's a really interesting mix of some legacy stuff (a miserable default shell) and some advanced new features (dtrace, zfs, smf).",1241141842.0

But most people find that... in that total silence that stretches to days, during the extended meditation sessions using the techniques, profound and terrifying things you have long suppressed come bubbling up.  Its really intense and emotional.  Women often burst out crying during the sessions.<p>The idea is that while you are cultivating detachment, these things bubble up, and you are not reacting, only observing... you condition yourself to deal with them.  By doing this for ten days at length, you wash yourself of your demons.<p>I found that this happened for me.  I stopped worrying about the things that had bothered me daily after that course.  I was in India when I took the course, and consider myself a half-assed buddhist, so I didn't have a problem with the relgious aspect, but you're right, it is not totally free of dogma.<p>The key thing to remember though is that they don't claim that a single ten day course will dramatically improve your life permanently.  They just claim that you can learn the technique in that length of time.  You still have to practice daily, several hours a day according to them.  I admit that... I don't, really.  I did for several months and then stopped.<p>But what I have taken away from the course is a deeper understanding of myself, and I make daily use of anapana when I experience distress.  It works, helps return me to equanimity, and I think it actually makes me smarter.<p>I can say that for me, the experience was... deeply spiritual.  Only I don't believe in spirits, I'm an athiest.  The things that happened to me during that ten days were profound, and were pretty on par with the claims the hippies coming out of the courses before me were saying.<p>The course was the hardest thing I've ever done, by far.  I'm really glad I did it.  But as your experience points out, mileage will vary.<p>The key to the whole thing for me was that... verbal thinking is not thought, its just a reflection of underlying mental processes... and if you just shut the fuck up inside your head, you find that you have a lot more room for productive work, and thought, and you become smarter.  Before that, I confused thought with productive mental work, and so the chatter in my head never ended.  Now I can clear my thoughts, and have an empty mind and this is so important for using my limited brain power productively.<p>The REALLY interesting thing is that at the beginning of the course, nobody can NOT THINK for more than a few seconds.  By the end of it, you can go for minutes at a time.  And it feels GREAT :)",1241140044.0

To my understanding, the simplistic reason that hard AI has failed and always will - while it uses digital computation as a platform - is that its a HARDWARE deficiency.<p>Are you saying that hardware deficiencies are never resolved over time?<p>>I'm generalizing but AI people all seem to be algorithm gurus who feel that the next algorithmic breakthrough will be ""the one"" to create an AI.<p>I study AI at Stanford and I've never met anyone who thinks that.<p>>I think what they miss is that the physical manifestation of brain and body are in fact required to be conscious. Disembodied consciousness cannot exist since conscious beings (animals) have complex biological systems known as bodies that enable what we view as intelligence.<p>You need to justify that.  The reasonable argument closest to what you are saying is that sensory stimuli are required for intelligence.  This isn't hard for a computer to simulate.<p>>Yes, computers are infinitely better at rule-based computation than animals. No, they cannot pass simple tests of consciousness that a mouse can,<p>Like what?<p>>and theres really no prospect of it happening because a better algorithm is created; fact is, animals and even insects don't think based on algorithms.<p>This needs justification.  If they aren't computing, then what are they doing?  You're looking down into the dualism abyss...<p>>Algorithms are models of the real world, not the real thing.<p>No, algorithms are neither.  Algorithms are sequences (trees, if you prefer) of instructions.<p>>Being conscious means using ones eyes/ears/mouth/nose/skin to feel, hear, smell, speak to interact with the world around you.<p>So are blind people less conscious?  What about those with no sense of smell?<p>>It means having agency and not just checking a set of pre-written rules in order to decide what to do next.<p>What makes those two things mutually exclusive?  When I make a decision I consult my values and my goals and attempt to make the decision that gets me closest to my goals without compromising my values.  Where do my values come from?  Some of them are based on instinct (i.e. genes, i.e. hard coded) and some come from parents/society.  My goals?  I'd say most of them are just milestones on the path to other goals, and then that there are a few fundamental goals that come from biology (e.g. I fundamentally want to reproduce, this means that I need to attract a mate and earn enough to support a family, this is made much easier by an good education, etc.).<p>>Its a biological system that enables that.<p>Why?
