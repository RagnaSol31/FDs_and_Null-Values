Standard compliance solves the same problem, without having to lock down the system. If programmers are unable or unwilling to conform to standards, then this is again not the fault of the system[1]. Give up on arguing that there is any sort of causation between ""locked"" and ""just works"". It's wrong.<p>[1] Actually, in this case it's the fault of the system. The lock places a false sense of security on programmers, which is pretty dangerous.",1319874985.0

""Getting to the startup level"" is not so simple a concept as ""either you get there or you don't."" People arrive at this destination with widely varying amounts of skill, preparation, connections, and credentials. Not all entrepreneurs are equally attractive.<p>So wh-uws' point makes a lot of sense. If it seems that disadvantaged-group-X is having more trouble securing funding than other groups, it doesn't necessarily mean investors are to blame. It could very easily be the case that X is running into issues earlier in life that, generally, make it much harder for its members to become great entrepreneurs. When trying to answer the question, ""Why do so few females run funded tech companies?"", it might make sense to take a few steps back and ask, ""Why do so few females study computer science"", or hell, ""Why do girls play with dolls while boys play with legos?""",1319871995.0
