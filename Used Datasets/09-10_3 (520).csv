It's completely different from a sustained propaganda campaign that explicitly tries to equate the crime of theft with copyright violation, which is what the MPAA and RIAA did.<p>Censuring them for using the word ""steal"" in this case is just nitpicking.  That's why no one's doing it.  It has nothing to do with ""only applying to creators outside the community""",1339811973.0

(The rest of this comment comes from McConnell.)<p>Some people have objected to the ""10x"" label, making an argument like ""We had a super programmer on our team once. He was so obnoxious he alienated the whole team, and overall productivity was actually better without him.<p>In general, any practical definition of a real 10x programmer has to include the effect the programmer has on the rest of the team. I have known super programmers who were obnoxious. More often, a supposed super programmer with an obnoxious personality was really an average programmer, or worse than average, using an obnoxious personality to hide a lack of performance. The true super programmers I've worked with have generally also been cooperative team players, although of course there are always exceptions.""",1339809240.0

Nobody could get a top-level domain, you could only get second- or third-level domain names, and anyone could get one. And importantly, TLDs were neutral. They weren't belonging to any company (although operated by one, usually)<p>But now, you have the poor man, who can afford a $5 .com, but he can't get a second-level domain on the new TLDs since they're owned by a company, and it only lets people have them for a high price or with special conditions. The poor man also can't afford the $200,000 needed to get a new gTLD.<p>This creates a two-tier Internet: The rich, big companies can get shiny new huge chunks of domain space, whilst the smaller companies, organisations and individuals are simply peasants, subordinates, who can only register on the second and third levels.<p>Furthermore, it introduces a huge level of corporate control we haven't seen before. Yes, .com is operated by VeriSign, but they have to let other people register .com names. They can't just do whatever they want with it. On the other hand, Google owns .google, and they can do whatever they want with it. It's theirs. They own that part of the internet, at the top level, and they have complete control.

For a fair comparison, those victims would need to be excluded. Not to mention the question of what portion of those 2 million users are active enough on Skout to even represent a realistic target.
