It was absolute chaos. He's a great hacker and a brilliant guy, but some people are truly shooting themselves in the foot for the sake of being ""old school"". It all comes down to a stubborn laziness. There's definitely a balance between sticking to what you know and prematurely ejaculating over the latest and greatest technologies.

The consequences of this go much further than just speeding up algorithms-- we can take plain old linear methods like SVMs and apply them to any data type on which we can define a kernel. This is huge, because it allows machine learning to break free of the vector world in which the algorithms are classically defined. Want to classify gene sequences?

School was viewed as a waste of time.  I wasted a good portion of my life doing manual labor jobs.<p>One day, I read a book on IQ and took the IQ tests in the back of the book.  The description next to my score said something like ""With this IQ, you can be anything you want to be"".  Regardless of the accuracy of the test or the description, I was inspired and have since gone on to do some great things.",1272417901.0
