In fact, if something is a trend, it's a guarantee that a market (of some kind) exists and it can save you a lot of time and research. Most big markets have large numbers of high value competitors and they're not all pioneers. Indeed, most companies with significant turnover were not pioneers in their field - they came in with ""me too"" products that merely improved upon the existing popular ones before they became too entrenched.<p>The trick is to get in when something <i>becomes</i> a trend but before the <i>masses</i> realize it's a trend and you have hundreds of competitors making similar improvements to the core products and services as quickly as you are. As well as being my belief, it's one of the core tenets of Michael Masterson's tackily-named (but a great read nonetheless) ""Ready, Fire, Aim: Zero to $100 Million in No Time Flat.""<p>With your reference to the App Store, I suspect you might agree with this, but have a different idea of what a ""trend"" is. I consider the App Store and developing iPhone apps to have been a trend in late 2008, not long after the earliest developers were starting to share revenue/sales figures, but <i>before</i> the masses had figured out it was going to be a giant cashcow. Now developing iPhone apps is just ""what you do"" rather than a <i>trend</i>, IMHO.",1277084961

You can use a compiler to generate JSON to feed to the system, retaining the flexibility of having the compiler running but skipping the parsing step. Why not compile straight to CSS? Well, why not? For simple sites that may be just fine. For more complicated sites it might be desirable to screw with the CSS before compiling.<p>My real meta-point here is that compiling isn't that scary. The idea of load you may get from g++ or GHC is not generally applicable. And as JS gets closer and closer to C-speeds it'll matter even less. (Not saying it will <i>reach</i> them, but you don't have to.) And there are already quite a few compilers in the mix; every web language has one (JS, CSS, HTML, SVG) and adding another is not like an enormous scary step. I suppose this is another consequence of the continuing deplorable move away from having compilers be a required class for a degree; truly it is one of the most powerful techniques of computer science that is relatively difficult to fully encounter outside of a formal education. (Like everything else in programming, it isn't impossible, but as it is very easy to walk away with a <i>degree</i> without ever having encountered one, so much moreso it is easy to not encounter one in informal education too.)",1277084153

No manager wants to wade through elance or one of the other sites looking for that diamond in the rough. So I started thinking that there has to be a better way and I started thinking what about an invitation only site where members invite new members and there reputation is tied to there recommendation. For example they may be a good developer to hire but they may not be good at recommending other people. Their recommendation score would then suffer and if it got low enough, they would not be allowed to invite other to the site. Conversely those that where good at spoting talent would get more invites that they could send. As well maybe a minimum rate that participants would have to adhere to would keep the site from becoming a race to the bottom like the others.

Don't worry if your current skills aren't a perfect match - you're experience (C++, graphics/performance-sensitive code, teamwork, tight deadlines, etc - the stuff other people mentioned) means you can probably pick up whatever you need on the way without much trouble and a good developer (assuming you're not applying to a big company with a clueless HR team...) should be able to spot that.<p>I found that having a background in C++, before moving to other languages (Python at first, now clojure wherever I can get away with using it) actually helped me program better. C++ makes you careful about managing resources almost to the point of paranoia - at least manual memory management does that to me :) and the C++ performance myth makes me pay a lot more attention at making sure my code is fast, regardless of language (though thankfully I've managed to kick the premature optimization habit in favour of choosing appropriate algorithms). I don't think I'd have picked up Python and Clojure (and Java and...) as easily if I hadn't went through the C++ pains, so you're epxeirence should serve you well. With a bit of luck, whoever you end up interviewing with will recognize that.",1277083049

He might need a loan or investment to cover the gap until you are cashflow positive, but in this case he is stealing from you instead.<p>It's not even an ""investment"" on your part, because he seems to have utterly no intent to pay you back.  That's just stealing.<p>For comparison, in an honest situation, he would be either:\n* paying you a normal salary as an employee\n* paying you a higher rate as a 1099 contractor (to account for your reduced security and benefits)\n* or paying you less but accepting the difference as your personal investment in the company -- so like any investment, if the risk pays off, you would be paid back MORE than your investment in the future.
