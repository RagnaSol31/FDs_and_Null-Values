And that's exactly the reason why I won't watch political films... not even if they're saying something I agree with.<p>For a complicated issue like corporate personhood (if indeed that's what this is about), I'm willing to entertain arguments either way, but I want them written down in black text on white paper and limited to a few pages, so I know I'm not being manipulated. And then I'd like to seek out an opposing viewpoint in a similar format, and make up my own mind. I don't see why anyone would want to subject themselves to a political film at all.",1287280779.0

You can't author anything for it when using Apple and Linux doesn't even get a runtime (Mono doesn't count, can never be feature-complete).<p>Apple doesn't seem quite the same.

The language didn't need to change much. The two things that have changed are so major they couldn't be majorer: (1) it took people 10 years to actually figure out what they had in JS; (2) the implementations needed to catch up. While 1 may be more or less done, 2 is still in full swing. This will enable further innovation. It's not even clear we need major changes to the language itself.

If you've worked with startups before, just not the technical side, talk with some of the programmers you know and ask them to give you a lesson or two or even just direct you towards some good resources and cheat-sheets (these are a lifesaver for me).
