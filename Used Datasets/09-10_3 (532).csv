I understand the desire to be transparent, but be careful what you share.<p>Also, condense everything into a shorter video. This first video could have accomplished the same thing in about half the time. I don't have time to watch 10 minute videos (unless they're <i>really</i> interesting/captivating), but could probably watch 3 minute videos. Maybe try writing out a script rather than rambling off the top of your head.",1201399118

Scoble lives in this strange world where he can exert his hob-nobby influence over the rich and powerful by making completely pointless requests...such as increasing a 4999 friend limit. And Zuck, being the person to take such a request, is of course a great man, and not at all just a smarmy, lucky copycat whose big innovation was spamming everyone at Harvard.<p>Have you ever sat through the entirity of one of Scoble's video interviews?  Has anyone?",1201399117

4,104826,comment,104802.0,104802.0,0,0,mixmax,,,"Did a nice real-world hack in Ibiza some 10 years back...<p>A friend of mine and I went to Ibiza in may hoping to land some kind of bar job, thinking it would be pretty easy.<p>It turned out that we weren't the only ones to have gotten this great idea, and all the bars and clubs in the place had already hired for the summer season, so getting a job was near impossible. After having been there for around 2 weeks we had no money, no jobs, no food and no money to get back home. And we didn't even speak the language..<p>Desperate measures were needed, So I thought up a plan...<p>Back home I had been to this club where a guy was running a tequila slammer bar over in the corner of the club -  basically just a slab of wood across two upright steel drums, a bottle of tequila, sprite and lemons and a couple of shot glasses. He would fill the shotglasses with half sprite, half tequila, slam them into the table so the sprite fizzed up, and people would gulp it down while it was still fizzing.<p>I noticed that noone did tequila slammers in Ibiza...<p>So my plan was to locate the club I most wanted to work in (the one with the hottest and most drunk chicks obviously), talk to the manager and tell him how amazingly cool I was, and that back home I was a huge celebrity with my crazy tequila slammer bar. And that he should be honored that he was the first one I offered to strike a deal with to do my stuff. He would make loads of money, and his place would be the most popular in town because of me and my amazing skills.<p>I had of course never done a tequila slammer in my life...<p>So I sent my friend down the club I had chosen pretending to be my manager with a handwritten letter explaining my successful (and faked...) track record as a master tequila slammer showman. He said that I would be along the next day, and that they had 24 hours to consider my offer, or I would move on.<p>The next day I went down to the club to meet the manager. He was impressed by the letter that I had written, and agreed that I had to be quite a star based on the experience and track record that I had made up the day before. So we struck a deal: I would get a 14 day period to show that I was as amazing as i said I was.<p>The next day my friend and I set up a bar in the back of the club and got ready for the action. I was scared shitless since I had set pretty high expectations for everyone, and the word had gotten around the club about this crazy guy that was supposed to be some kind of star. To top it off the manager of the bar had brought in the managers of quite a few of the other bars to show off his new amazing crazy new tequila bar. Everyone was expecting a huge spectacle of a show.<p>Since I had never done a tequila slammer in my life it was pretty obvious that I needed to do something drastic to survive this. So I went for broke and decided to start off by doing the first 10 shots myself, get totally drunk and just go crazy. And pray to god....<p>It worked: It went totally wild, I ended the night wearing nothing but underwear, having slammed tequilas on the bar, on the walls, the floor, the ceiling, and on peoples forehead. I think I broke at least fifty shot glasses, I was standing, sometimes lying, in a poddle of tequila and sprite. But people loved it.<p>After 14 days I got a sweet deal, making good money for being drunk, chatting up girls and generally having a splendid time. There was even an article in a major Spanish magazine about this crazy drunk Dane in Ibiza slamming tequilas on peoples forehead...",1201398974

When we had investors there for demo day, we literally had to put the founders outside in a tent.<p>Fortunately we can expand in time if constrained in space: just have multiple dinners per week.  That would get us 7x without needing to find a new building.  I've had my eye out for places in Cambridge, but it would be really hard to beat the current one.",1201398785

Student status six months early and with hundreds of hours less work.<p>I would personally call this ""reading the rules and understanding how they work"" rather than ""hacking the system"", but maybe that's what they mean.",1201396339
