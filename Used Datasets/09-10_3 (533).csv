0,165884,comment,165343.0,165852.0,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,> Cars are more convenient/practical in rural areas<p>Not really true.  It only seems that way because of the development pattern subsidized highways have enabled.  In much of the world housing is clustered in dense towns in rural areas.  This was the normal development pattern in the US in the 1800s.  Rural towns were fairly dense and walkable.  The productive land was around the town.  The housing was not needlessly spread out through the productive land.,1208397451

If you like them and accept them, then they'd get to choose whether they'd like to stay with their existing micro VC or jump ship for YCombinator.  Granted, filling one of your limited slots with people who have opportunities elsewhere may be a waste of your time.

To test this, I propose the following experiment which requires PG's co-operation. I propose that PG also post comments / submissions etc under some other username and then compare the average upmods for posts under the ""pg"" username vs the random anonymous username.\nThis can be started at an unspecified time in the future and run for lets say 1 month. Only PG will know what username he is using other than pg.<p>I also propose the same for nickb and other prominent users. It may turn out that people upmod stuff from more recognizable names when they might have left it at neutral if some other user had submitted the same content.<p>Well actually it may already be the case that they are  posting under multiple names.<p>Might be an interesting social experiment.<p>edit : Or is it already underway? nickb is pg :P?",1208395444
