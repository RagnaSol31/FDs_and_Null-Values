This means that I have access, for example, to smart engineers + scientists in academia who want to keep doing research for pleasure but make spare cash on the side. (p.s. we're hiring people for part-time, remote work arrangements: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1748833"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1748833</a>)<p>It's sad to see in the Who's Hiring post (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1748045"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1748045</a>) that so few employers offer flexible work arrangements.

If there is evil to be found, it will be in what is created with the language, not the language itself.<p>The only exception to this rule is Lisp. It's parentheses all the way down to Hell and back with that one.",1286067859

64,1751801,story,,,17,15,pjmurray,Ask HN: How worthwhile is Startup School?,,Fortunately I was accepted for startup school. As I am based in Australia however it will not be a cheap/quick affair to attend so I am wanting to reassure myself that its a worthwhile expedition.<p>Can those who have been before enlighten me as to what I can expect and whether or not it is worth the trip (approx $3)?<p>My big fear is that I go to find the content is fairly general and  a more encouragement/pep talk style rather than content-rich information that is useful to moving forward. No doubt it will be an awesome event but just a little more detail would help convince me to come! My only hesitation is I may be better saving it and coming over for SXSW instead... or maybe I should just do both. What would your preference between the two be?<p>Also if I do head over I will likely come for just over a week. Any other events on around that time or anyone keen to meet up would be great!,1286067804

But, and I'm not really making any accusations at all, I hope amidst all this praise for what an admirable job he is doing and all the opportunities this affords for underpriviledged people that he stays on top of the quality and accuracy of the material. I just remember there being a few questions about some of his stuff on linear algebra. I also hope he will continue to add more advanced material to the various subjects, but I think that is his plan.",1286067605
