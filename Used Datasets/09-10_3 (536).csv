Why not get an Android or something else?  For that matter, why does Google bother releasing an iPhone app;  why not build the Android into a handset that is tightly coupled/integrated with Google Voice?

Seriously?<p>Neither the courts nor the FCC should be looking at this.  Consumers just need to take their wallet elsewhere.<p>EDIT: I very much concur with the poster above who speculated that AT&T's 3G network doesn't have the bandwidth to handle a large amount of relatively constant (at a certain baseline) voice traffic generated by something as popular as GV.

But in economic parlance, if (let's say) a power company came to be a dominant monopoly in a given area without government support, that would be a natural monopoly.  If the government then stepped in to regulate the power company as a utility and simultaneously excluded competitors by government force, the power company becomes a coercive monopoly.  Is it still a natural monopoly?  It's hard to say, because conditions change, but the government grant of exclusivity remains constant.  Maybe a new technological innovation would have let a competitor emerge, breaking the natural monopoly.

Someone put a lot of capital at risk, and now that their bet has worked out, the regulators want to step in and tell them how to run their business and (in many cases) how much return <i>is fair</i> for them to get from their investment.<p>Regulation of this sort is the same as partial nationalization, and has the same effect to a measured degree.  When people anticipate that the returns on their winning bets will be 'moderated,' or that they will have to set business policies for the 'greater good,' they will in the future make less risky bets or put less capital at risk.",1249088692.0

Further, it <i>has</i> backslided in many cases. In order to increase the number of cores per processor, each core is getting simpler by reducing or eliminating single-threaded optimizations like branch prediction and out-of-order execution.",1249088550.0
