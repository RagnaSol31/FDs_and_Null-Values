About at what point you will abandon your freedom for any other advantage, such as hardware support (proprietary drivers in the linux kernel for instance) or performance (h.264 vs theora in this case).\nSo this more about being willing to sacrifice a little bit of performance for your freedom than looking for best performances at all costs.\nTheora is getting continuously improved and is catching up little by little. They may also be some other company releasing some other codecs under free software-friendly licenses, who knows? But in the mean time, what is more important to you (as a user, in general): performance or freedom?<p>So if you don't care about your freedom, it is understandable you wouldn't care less about theora vs h.264. If you would care a little bit more, you would be ready to compromise on some parts, and if you have a long beard, you wouldn't compromise at all.<p>And I am also wondering, if mozilla starts accepting patented or proprietary technologies, where would you draw the line?

In order for this to occur, virtually all the remaining shareholders would need to reach unanimous agreement against a decision made by Sergey and Larry -- highly improbable, but <i>possible</i>.

He's certainly not opening his own SMS gateway with $500 so he's probably using a service where you get a 5 digit number that customers include in their texts (everyone has seen this I'm sure).\nThe companies that supply this tech usually have a very easily integrated API so hooking it up is no more complex that hooking up to something like Twitter, in fact usually much simpler.

Not counting multiplies, pshufb, and a few other instructions, SSE operations are mostly reasonably performant.<p>The real problems are that the Atom has:<p>1) no out of order execution, which results in an enormous performance penalty on all code.<p>2) very high penalties for many ""transfers"" between operations: for example, the result of an arithmetic op cannot be used for addressing for quite a few clocks.  This penalty is humongous when dealing with pointers-to-pointers in managed code, lookup tables, and so forth.<p>3) a completely un-pipelined multiplication unit that takes 7 cycles, compared to the pipelined 3-cycle Core 2 unit.<p>4) an enormous number of instructions that were microcoded internally (and thus extraordinarily slow) in order to reduce TDP and chip size.<p>5) only two integer ALUs, which can only dual-issue in some specific cases.<p>Overall, a 1.6Ghz Atom is significantly slower than a 1.6Ghz Pentium 4.  A Core 2 is at least twice as fast <i>per clock per core</i> as a Pentium 4.  And a Core i7 is another 40-50% faster per clock per core...<p>If you want something that gets out significantly more performance per watt than a Core 2 or Core i7, look at the ARM Cortex A9.",1264208410.0
