That's just my not-a-lawyer opinion, and I don't know of any precedent for this fair-use-timeshifting-by-proxy defense (do you?) but hey we might actually see a case like this soon. Last season HBO was monitoring the True Blood torrents and sending out C&D's to the ISPs of all peers with US IP addresses, if the Pirate Bay comments were to be believed.<p>Anyway, here's my not-a-lawyer reasoning: copyright law grants all rights of copying and distribution to the originator of the work and these are only transferred to a second party by written contract, EXCEPT for fair use (and first sale and other exceptions like that.) According to Wikipedia, fair use is a nebulous thing and varies from case to case but from what I can see it only gives you the right to copy for personal use (Tivo good) and never distribution (torrents bad). In fact Joel Tenenbaum and Jaimie Thomas both tried and failed to use fair-use as a defense for filesharing. So in order for hypothetical HBO v. Tptacek to not be summarily ruled in favor of the plaintiff, tptacek would have to show that his subscription to HBO constituted a contract which granted him the right to acquire and distribute HBO recordings. AND his torrent peers would all have to be HBO subscribers too. I doubt you'll find any language like that on his cable bill.<p>But what do I know.",1262051734.0

Maybe I should just check the site once in the evenings or something.<p>What do you guys think?",1262048748.0

The HORROR!<p>Seriously dude they didn't shut you down overnight like craigslist constantly does, they didn't suddenly start charging you for the API...all they did was write in a few extra clauses into their ToS. Nothing actually changed for you.<p>These things are always in the terms, they are just put there by lawyers, so that they have some options 20 years from now when they might need it against a real culprit.<p>And as far as your API provider/user relationship based on respect, that's a load of bull. As far as I can see the only thing Google is ""guilty"" of is changing a few lines in their ToS, which is entirely in their right. You on the other hand are guilty of attacking them over something that they haven't even done yet. Smearing them with what ifs about events that didn't even happen yet.<p>If Google shuts you down, then you can bitch and moan. But until they do, what exactly are you complaining about? Hell it's already been 6 months since they changed the ToS, if the ToS specifically targeted you(like you imply), you'd have been banned already.",1262048513.0
