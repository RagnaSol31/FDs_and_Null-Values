Normally, I love the idea of private companies funding research, but Microsoft has a habit of not using its research for anything commercial. Instead, they file for thousands of patents and just sit on them.<p>I feel the same way about Google - by spending their vast profits on hiring more smart people than they need (instead of say, giving a dividend out to shareholders), they do a disservice to the entire industry. Smart engineers and researchers are relatively rare, and shouldn't be sitting in some research building writing up papers that will never produce a dollar - that's what Universities are for.

So the car has to provide energy to raise the car 9cm for every meter traveled.  That's 1.5m/s vertically.  So for an average car of 2000kg, we have to provide 2000x9.8x1.5 J per second, which is ~29KW.  (That's gravitational potential energy mass x grav. x h)<p>Wow, so maybe it's right.

Still... maybe we already have micropayments, but they aren't evenly distributed yet.<p>The current generation of gaming consoles does something close to micropayments and scrip at the same time, through their online shopping points. They solve the transaction cost problem by making you buy $20 worth of points at a time (I bought 15 Nintendo points for World of Goo, and then blew the change on an impulse buy - a copy of Opera). Points also solve the resistance problem, by having a captive audience of users who want what they offer.<p>The next step might be to allow game review sites to accept Nintendo/Sony/XBox points for access to content, demos, trailers, etc. At the same time, that would tie them more closely to the console manufacturers.

Depending on the size and scale of the problem you are trying to suggest and the time line required for delivery you may need a larger team.<p>When you begin to take that into account you realize you have to find ways for the larger team to work together and still produce a quality product.
