The answer is CNN's.

String processing is one of those types of problems that just benefit from a little thought and 10 seconds of planning.<p>C itself is bogged down by its own horrible string representation, the nul termination, where most operations need to traverse the string up to the terminator before they know where it ends.

Having to use a library to do regex is not going to be the difference maker in productivity for your app.<p>Besides, while I love regex, I still use them as a last resort. You're going to want to use a real parser for  reliable structured text processing.<p>Generally, erlang programmers keep strings in binaries, which are compact. Most modules for handling string type tasks allow you to do this, e.g., the re module understands a unicode_binary type.<p>In 6 months of programming erlang professionally, in a domain dominated by scripting languages like python and ruby, I've certainly never been tempted to bolt over string handling issues. Erlang's flexible distribution, concurrency, and reliability model is just too compelling.<p>To get competitive performance in a reasonable amount of programmer time for concurrent applications in other languages you're limited to the subset of tasks that, say, twisted or tornado makes easy. The program I'm writing now couldn't have been done with either of them.<p>Frankly, if it's the choice between built-in support for regex and built-in primitives for distribution, concurrency, and fault tolerance, there's no question in my mind which is more important.",1259372522.0

Openness with one's data is a good scientific approach, but it will not in any way reduce or minimize the faith-based attacks of the climate change deniers.  (Rather, they'll be heartened because you took an action in response to their attacks.)  Those attacks are not coming because Joe Redneck in the Bible Belt undertook a scientific inquiry into climate change and felt that the data wasn't open enough.  You could hand-deliver 4000 pages of climate change datasets personally to the house of each and every person who said they don't believe in climate change; not one of them would change their mind.<p>If you don't understand the actual reasons that the deniers exist, which have absolutely nothing to do with your approach to the science, then you haven't got a hope of actually dealing with them.",1259370179.0
