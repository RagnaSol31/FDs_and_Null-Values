12,511110,comment,510872.0,511034.0,0,0,discojesus,,,"Apparently someone likes to downvote posts they disagree with without replying, so allow me to elaborate:<p>The prefrontal cortex is the section of the brain responsible for executive function, impulse control, and long-term decision making. Essentially, a fully-developed prefrontal cortex is what makes an adult an adult. The prefrontal cortex doesn't fully come online until your early to mid-twenties (this is why all of these rights are generally around the same age, 18-21...unless one wants to suggest that we picked those ages out of a hat).<p>Most children do not have a fully-developed prefrontal cortex. Therefore it is in their and society's best interest to prohibit them from making long-term decisions, since they really don't have the equipment to make lucid choices about the distant future.<p>So if you're looking for a criterion for voter eligibility, it should be the presence of a developed prefrontal cortex, not age, and certainly not a goddamn civics test (at 17, I would have gotten a hardon at the idea of being legally able to drink if I only had to pass a written exam testing my knowledge of alcohol). Since AFAIK we don't have any real, cost-effective test for whether a person has a prefrontal cortex, chronological age is a passable approximation.<p>I'm all for classical liberalism, but let's not be naive and throw common sense out the window - anyone who thinks 12-14 year olds should have the right to vote doesn't remember what it was like to be 12-14 years old. Christ, every single person who I respect and consider intelligent and knew when they were 12-14 would have voted for any candidate who promised that we would see boobies during their term in office.",1236736098

They prominently display the video now, probably because YouTube was not too pleased. \nI think it's pretty awesome that a 15 year old made this and is getting coverage for it, but the website is a way too noisy for me.",1236733832

That would be insanity and would lead to a very dysfunctional company.  No one would wish that management structure upon their worst competitor.  But if you wouldn't run a company that way, why would you run a country that way?",1236733539

If transferring money from fb into an fb app were painless and had cheap txn costs, two things would happen. 1) More people would spend! Frictionless, and with the authority of Facebook, an integrated payment solution would help separate people from their money and 2) a LOT more developers would get in on the action.<p>PayMo charges 5% for cellphone txns, but the carriers charge up to 50%.  That is totally outrageous.  Games are some of the biggest apps on Facebook, and this would be a good way for facebook to make money, and encourage/help their platform developers.<p>Disclaimer: These are my opinions and not those of my employer, FooMojo, Inc (creators of FooPets on Facebook.)",1236733451

It's slightly painful (I came from Python, and I still end up typing $objectname.methodname() and then going back and putting in '->'), but not nearly so much as I used to think before I had to work with PHP every day. :)",1236733426

This prevented me from having a bank account in my own name.  I was old enough to work, but not old enough to own the money I earned.  (At least not in non-cash form.)  I also couldn't spend my own earned money on any products requiring a contract be signed.  So old enough to work, but not old enough to spend or save the proceeds.",1236733353
