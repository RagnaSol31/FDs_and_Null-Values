This is true almost 100% of the time when you are ""hiring"" someone to work for you.  In any transaction you should do some research yourself, get some references, and so on.<p>When buying properties, my wife and I have always used the agent as a sort of voice-command Googlebot.  Tell her (it's been in a her in all of our cases) what we want, what our budget is (usually holding back about 10% of what we really want to spend), and then go over the listings we're sent.  We'll often do a quick drive-by and scout the neighborhood first and then use the agent to make the appointments and shuttle us around, and then finally handle any paperwork.<p>I always get a home inspection, and I go around with the inspector as he is going through the house.  I also escort the inspector when he is going over properties I've sold (one inspector shorted out the fuse panel (yeah, fuses) when doing an inspection for a buyer on my first house.  He was ham-handed when removing the fuse box cover, touched a fuse and made sparks.  He tried to cite that on his report as a faulty fuse box and I called him on it and made him account for his own error).<p>I also tend to make it pretty clear, in plain English, up front that I like to find realtors, lawyers, accountants, etc that I can work with over many years.  Attempt to screw me now and you'll lose a significant amount of future/repeat business, plus referrals.<p>Most people can spot a sucker, and can also spot someone who is knowledgeable.

19,619689,comment,619110.0,619397.0,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Regarding your reply, there are two things to address. First is that of economic mobility, which I referenced casually with ""meritocratic sentiment."" I'm not ready to say anything conclusive, but as other posters have pointed out, there is reason to disbelieve the popular belief.<p>In the very page you link to: ""While there is some economic mobility between generations in the United States, it is still difficult to move up one or more quintiles in regard to one’s income.""<p>But again, I am not one to make conclusions about this topic; I merely express skepticism and disagree with those who hold strong opinions one way or another, because either borders on irrational conviction.<p>The second point, which you don't address, is the effect of generational wealth on offspring. The effect is subtle and easy to overlook, but is as important as wealth itself. Why do the rich stay rich, and the poor stay poor? It's not as simple as saying the system is or isn't in favor of mobility. You must also consider the possibility that rich offspring have become inherently stronger, smarter, and prettier than the poor -- and they are. There has been research on this topic, but it is intuitively obvious: a desperate person is not attractive, is brash, and is weaker against temptation.<p>The symptom is one: wealth disparity is increasing; but the disease is manyfold. That's my ""theory"". The problem here, is that somebody will write an article illuminating one facet of the problem, just like somebody takes a magnifying glass to examine a rash. Then somebody reads it and says, ""let's apply Cortisone!"" But it's actually an allergic reaction to an ingested substance.<p>The skin-deep understanding of society helps perpetuate this ""credit hog"" mentality. And that in my opinion is among the foremost barriers to equity.",1242870056.0

The soil cladding is going to help a lot; I'm used to the high winds we get in England (I'm sure they're comparable) and I'm used to the tiles being ripped off the roof, so from that perspective it could well be better than traditional building in the UK.<p>Earthquakes aren't too much of a concern in the UK, however being in the ground can help with this. Also the major damage in earthquakes is to rigid structures (primarily concrete, then brick) that cannot flex, there's been lots of designs to deal with all these problems, but the simple matter is that the lower a building is to the ground and the more flexible construction material is you're better off. However, you never know until you try.<p>As for fire retardation it's possibly a lot worse than your average house in the UK, I don't think I've ever been in a non-brick home in the UK. I bet it will possibly be more damaging to the structure, however the bigger concern is that is it more likely to cause a fire? If you're following proper electrical designs then probably not. However, if he used exclusively 12V then I severely doubt he'd ever have a fire through the electrical system, and thats my opinion having worked as an electrician. When my parents bought a 200+ year old house in France, the building had very old school wiring, it was coated like a sock and the house had never had a fire. So with modern materials you're probably safe.<p>In case a fire actually started; as with a lot someone fell a sleep smoking for instance. Well you'd be surprised huge hunks of wood really hate setting on fire, so I doubt the structural supports would go up before you could get out. Also if the insulation is behind a good coating of plaster, it's fire proof. I've used scrap drywall quite frequently as a backer for a paper incinerator and it usually lasts for about 30 minutes despite very hot flames (paper gets air faster and thus burns hotter). I'd say if you put the amount of plaster you're supposed to when manually rendering a wall, I'd give it an equal time before it started giving away.<p>All in all, from the experience I've had I'd say it would be reasonably safe. You've also got to consider, living in a city you're more likely to die through other means than you are in the country.<p>Personally, I'd have misgivings living in it. All my knowledge tells me that a huge oak beam holding up the floor has more structural support than the floor I'm currently sat on. However, it would still creep me out. My biggest concern is, how do you keep track of wood rotting when you don't have access to a large area of the building.<p>If all exterior walls were constructed of brick, and I'd built the supports (I'd definitely use brick for a lot of the load bearing structure) then I'd definitely sleep in one.",1242869178.0

One of the few bright points in this economy is that many of the most corrupt agents have left the industry since it is no longer ""easy money.""  Of course, there are still plenty of crooks left to go around, and some are more desperate than ever to make payroll.  I also agree that the incentives in the industry are massively misaligned, and I'm definitely not here to defend the industry.  As I said in another post, I'm actually trying to change the industry from the inside.<p>One thing that many people don't realize is that if they \ndon't have an agent representing their interests as a buyer of an MLS-listed property, it usually just means the listing agent gets a double commission.  The fact that there is not a buyer's agent doesn't lower the price for the buyer at all.  The listing agent just does a ""notice of no agency"" and pockets both commissions.  FSBOs (and some REO properties) are pretty much the only exceptions, because they don't go through the MLS, which has its own arcane rules.  So, if you're going to pay the money anyway, you should try to get representation.  Just educate yourself about the process, stand strong about what you want, and try to find one of those two or three honest agents ;-)  Or pay for a RE attorney.<p>FSBOs are usually overpriced, especially during market corrections like we're in now.  I admire your honesty in listing YOUR property but, unfortunately, not all sellers are as honest.  Agents have more accountability, legally speaking, than a random dude on CraigsList. You have more avenues open to you if an agent screws you over than if a private seller screws you over.  In fact, you should report your bad agents to your state licensing agency.  Many state agencies use 'mystery shoppers' to check out agents when they've been reported a few times.  The fewer bad agents out there, the better for everyone.",1242868916.0
