8,812381,comment,811433.0,811433.0,0,0,netsp,,,"I agree with only some of the points in this essay. I think that the assumption of efficiency is overstretched. I think that the demonstration that wealth is created is overstretched.<p>The reaction between these imperfections (people who have become very rich by participating in imperfect markets) creates a hole. It is this hole that people react to. Even if markets were perfect, wealth creation is not often dependant to factor that people can control. A factory worker in Japan is more productive then one in Burma for reasons completely outside his sphere of influence. Similarly a 8th century peasant's wealth was generated by him from the land. But, the great variations in wealth of peasants probably had more to do with how much & how good the land was then how hard or how skilfully they worked. Wealth generation does not mean a meritocracy.<p>On the other hand, wealth <i>is</i> something that is created. That <i>is</i> something not enough people grasp. This essay actually got me thinking at the very start in the comment about children.<p><i>Likewise, it doesn't occur to most kids that wealth is something that has to be generated. It seems to be something that flows from parents.</i><p>That is something that many parents would react to. ""Children need to be taught the value of money. They need to learn that money must be earned."" They then set up chores or encourage kids to work and <i>earn</i> money. This is to set them straight. That is a fundamental mistake. It leaves out wealth generation. It encourage them to think that they are <i>entitled</i> to their <i>share</i> if...",1252461189.0

I find that precursors to motivation, for me, are be happy and get a good nights sleep.<p>[EDIT] let me add more to the ""be happy"" issue.  It doesn't well describe things.  Software is never ""finished"".  One technique I have learned to coupe with this un-motivating feel of something never being done is to find simple things that give me pleasure that have a fixed ending.  For dinner tonight I made a tasty hand crafted sandwich.  It took 10 minutes to make and 10 to eat.  I enjoyed it and felt satisfaction for a job well done.

We generally A/B test versions that are similar enough that we'd be comfortable rolling out the winner to the whole site without warning.  As a result they tend to be fairly small changes, which goes a long way to solving the inconsistent/volatile issue.  Furthermore you associate users with an A/B test slice so while different users get different experiences, a single user's experience should be consistent across their experience with the site.  As a result of these two factors the impact of A/B testing is very small.<p>The second is magnitude of reward.  Most websites that do not currently do A/B testing can find site improvements which will give business improvements of 20% or more.  That's a pretty clear financial incentive to put up with unhappy users.  But in fact many of those improvements made your users happier.  So the ""construction in progress"" is far, far outweighed by the rewards.<p>This is why companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon use and strongly advocate A/B testing.  Google has created free tools to help people A/B test websites.  I know that Microsoft has an internal version of that, and suspect that they intend to open access at some point as well.<p>If you want to learn more about how to build an A/B testing framework you could do worse than to go through my OSCON tutorial I did last year.  My slides are at <a href=""http://elem.com/~btilly/effective-ab-testing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elem.com/~btilly/effective-ab-testing/</a>.  Or you can go to <a href=""http://www.google.co/websiteoptimizer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.co/websiteoptimizer</a> and use theirs.  Theirs has some drawbacks over building your own.  Their approach can't A/B test email programs, and is somewhat tricky to do with dynamic content.  (Not impossible, but you have to rewrite pages in JavaScript.)  When I last looked at it they also don't allow you to track multiple statistics in an A/B test, and can't let you analyze combinations of tests after the fact.  OTOH theirs is already built and is easy to use. :-)",1252458126.0

It's something that takes practice and occasionally even the ability to infer what the word ought to be.<p>If I had to work with and encounter Russian handwriting on a more regular basis I'm sure I'd be better at it, but as is, with me only needing to try to decipher things once a month, I find myself struggling. If I were just learning the language I would hate to be subjected to that.",1252458118.0

What he's advocating is that people be aware of the nature of the underlying system and stop fooling ourselves into thinking that it's ""gaussian + weird things that are obvious in retrospect.""",1252458116.0

I am going through something somewhat similar, although my problem, as it were, is entirely in my head I think:<p>I absolutely despise my job, although I don't know why entirely... the best I can come up with that would change the situation for me is if my company paid engineers overtime. I am feeling somewhat guilty of ""lacking a sense of urgency"", as I was told; I think my problem is not being able to care, or fake caring, in situations where I am told to do something I consider stupid and/or futile.<p>Like you, I started ""running away"" by declaring I will work only forty hours a week, which has started the inexorable path towards my being fired.<p>However, I do not see what I can do to tell my superior about my problems or fill out forms: any suggestions there?",1252458058.0
