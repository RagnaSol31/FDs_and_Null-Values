Don't dismiss the old-timers.  Some of the most interesting people I've ever known have been a lot older than me.  In fact, actually, most of the truly interesting folks I've know have been older than me--they've just had more time to acquire crazy and funny stories.  I took a job at an independent television station when I was in college, and that was a great experience (it got acquired by the WB, now CW, while I was there, and the character of the station changed and most of the old-timers left).  Several of the folks I worked with had been involved in <i>building</i> the tower and broadcast station back in the sixties.  Those old guys (and one gal) had some fantastic stories about the birth and growth (and changing mores, like the fact that smoking pot in master control on the night shift was accepted practice in the 70's) of the station, and had a lot of interesting insight into technology and changes; they'd seen the station go from film to analog video of multiple types to digital video, along with the introduction of satellites and other wonders of modern technology.<p>Work past the awkward, be friendly and interested in their stories (fake it till you make it), and you'll probably learn something about making friends with folks who <i>aren't</i> exactly like you.  Older folks are also more likely to be able and willing to make up for your lack of social graces.  Generally, the older you get, the less clique-oriented you become...you might get more set in your ways in a lot of regards, but older folks tend to be happier to talk to new and different people, especially if the new people are truly interested in what they have to say.<p>Another interesting old-timer story: A friend of mine worked with a lady who was maybe 10-15 years older than her.  They became friends, because they were both vegetarian, and had a few other things in common.  Turns out the lady was Jimmy Dale Gilmore's (probably best known as Smokey from The Big Lebowski outside of Texas, but he's a famous Grammy-wielding country musician) wife.  You want interesting stories?  Ask an old music star.  Point is, you never know who you're going to find when you actually get to know someone.<p>Anyway, the old-timers aren't generally going to be your best friends, of course.  But, socializing merely for the sake of socializing is good for you.",1232157317
9,437632,comment,437527.0,437527.0,0,0,answerly,,,"I used to run a big affiliate network and have about 10 years experience in lead generation.<p>Can't think of any great published resources off the top of my head, but here is some general advice:<p>1) Make contact with a real person at the networks you source your lead generation offers from (you mentioned network in your post, so I assume that is your plan).  Many people just sign up for a commission junction, linkshare, etc. account and never actually talk or exchange emails with a real person.  The benefit of contacting someone is that they can typically pay you more right out of the gate if you ask.  Also, these network reps are used to seeing very low quality sites.  So, if you have a high quality web app they will typically get excited about the opportunity to partner with you.  This is obviously good for your revenue prospects.  Bypassing the networks altogether and trying to go advertiser direct is even better, since you are cutting out the middle man in most cases.  But, this isn't always possible with limited resources, etc.<p>2) Lead gen works best when it is heavily integrated and niche focused.  Try to find offers that solve a problem related to why people use your web app in the first place.<p>3) Let the metrics be your guide.  Test lots of different lead gen offers, offer placement in your app flow etc.<p>Feel free to contact me if you have any specific questions I can help out with.  My email is in my profile.",1232157196

From what I can tell Democrats are more focused on actually reducing government spending than Republicans.  As to the effects of ""large government"" look at how many freedoms each side wants to remove and Democrats win again.  Limiting how old you need to be to buy video games pales in comparison to the loss of due process etc.<p>National Heath care might seem like bad voodoo, but the government is already pay for over 1/2 of all medical spending in the US yet medical bills are still the leading cause of bankruptcy in the US.  Most countries with a national heath care system spend less money per person and relative to their GDP than we do now and we still have a crappy patchwork.

They are ""dirty""? Sure they are, but they are far more selective too.<p>I really can't accept the justification for such a massive retaliation that's bound to have a huge cost in terms of civilian lives. This is no longer collateral damage - it's not like casualities are mostly Hamas combatants. Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas in the planet and for evey Hamas militant they hit, they will also kill at least a dozen of civilians that, until now, didn't represent any threat to Israel.<p>As for the Israelis, they will have to endure the consequences of electing such a reckless government.<p>When someone spends the last decade firing rockets at you that kill, on average about five people per year, it's very clear they are not really good at that.

PHP is a kludge made of all sort of functions cluttering the only namespace there is. While K&R clearly understood the value of separating language from library, PHP deliberately ignores this lesson. I heard the most recent version (or the next, maybe) will support namespaces. It started as a quick-and-dirty solution for writing dynamic pages and, sadly, it shows.<p>I somewhat fail to see the power of a language as something derived from lack of fancy constructs or high-level abstractions. And, BTW, C has a lot of fancy constructs and high-level abstractions: you just have to point the right libraries to the compiler/linker.<p>I am sorry to tell you, but the main reasons PHP is so popular are the low cost of labor and the lack of interest by a large group of self-appointed programmers in learning anything, as you say, fancy.",1232154228

FX wanted the show off, so they basically had to take the show off.The only bad point was originally they would have lost credibilty as a reliable place to watch shows, but the notice and addition of the show for another two weeks show they are taking this seriously. Hulu has earned some of my respect, I'm impressed.",1232154036

All sorts of quantum effects and chaos affect individual particles. But, on average, we can predict the net outcome with fairly good results using very naive models (laws of thermodynamics, ideal gas law, etc).<p>And you're absolutely right about profit. Standard economic theory predicts that, in a free market that is at a stable equilibrium, each firm won't earn any profits exceeding the marginal cost of production (economists say that a firm is earning ""Normal profits""). But, obviously, no markets (that I can think of) are perfectly free or in perfect equilibrium (and economists know this, and have far more complex models for real world situations).<p>Although, if memory serves, this hypothesis has been empirically verified by many almost-free markets (i.e., commoditized goods sold to intelligent/large consumers). You have a bunch of sellers doing business, barely making ends meet, until something happens that disrupts equilibrium (new technology, another company's bankruptcy, sudden changes in demand, etc), where they can hope to earn supernormal profits in the short term, before the market returns to equilibrium.",1232154031
