Like the author said, if they want to have a chance at beating Facebook in the social realm, they really need a ""social network"", not a random smattering of social features tacked on to already existing Google features.  There needs to be a single URL you can type to easily access this social network and easily navigate to every feature from it, and it needs to have a common, clean UI like Facebook does.<p>And moreover, it needs to have a big, well-planned release.  I didn't even know Google Profiles existed until a couple weeks ago.  If Google were to release an entire social network on a single day with an Apple-esque release press conference, there's a chance it might get enough people interested to have an actual impact.  Doing things like a limited beta release is a horrible idea when it comes to social features, and arguably a major part of why Wave failed so spectacularly.<p>Everything they've tried up to this point has been completely disjoint and confusing.",1302400700.0

The market for air travel is dominated by frequent one-off transactions (with consumers often using multiple airlines for a single trip), and boasts several good ways to compare availability and cost. A new entrant can start off with a few routes, build a good reputation, and grow out from there.<p>New entrants in the telecom market are considerably disadvantaged by comparison. Consumers in this market make long-term purchasing decisions, often driven by contract pricing,and there remain no good, well known ways of comparing providers. The situation is even worse if you're a new wireless carrier, since coverage is crucial and the market is pointlessly segmented by phone tech.<p>I'm not saying we couldn't benefit from deregulation in some aspects of this market, but the devil is very much in the details, and simply pointing out that ""deregulation"" helped improve a market with high capital requirements for entry isn't saying much.",1302400036.0

Once setup the only time I ever have to do anything special is when there's a conflict since it won't destroy a file that I've altered on both sides before a sync has happened.  This happens rarely (usually to a configuration file for some software I've put in the directory for syncing) and is the behavior that I want, e.g. don't destroy local changes automatically let me decide what to do about it so that there's no unintentional data loss.  And while there is a conflict it will continue to happily sync everything else happily ignoring the conflicts.<p>Edit: I should also say that I'm not using lsyncd or anything like that to manage it, just cron on the laptop.  I initiate it one way at a regular time.  Though using lsycnd does sound interesting.  I also didn't use autossh and instead opted for OpenVPN since I knew I was going to want the other benefits of having a VPN at the time (being able to tunnel traffic easily for the most part)",1302399066.0

(I have heard that two thirds of folks who win the lottery are bankrupt within five years and some of them have bad things happen because they are suddenly rich.)  But I and my oldest son have a medical condition that can cost millions over the course of one's life and we have basically gotten well at a fraction of the price it usually costs to keep people like us limping along.  So I suspect that once all the fall out from that is  fully resolved, I may have the potential to make millions.<p>My concern isn't so much how much wealth I have (after achieving a certain level of security), but making sure it doesn't screw up my life.  I think at times about the American fantasy of winning the lottery and I suspect that would wreak havoc with my life whereas earning it shouldn't have the same kind of impact.  One problem with winning it is that it suddenly and irrevocably cuts a lot of your social ties -- for example, people typically leave their jobs promptly and often don't have any real plans other than to party hardy with their newfound wealth.  But earning it usually involves building solid social ties: Relationships to the business community, to your customers, to your employees/coworkers/cofounders, and so on.  I think when people have too much aimless time on their hands and too little in the way of healthy social ties, it tends to lead to bad things.  A lot of people seem to desperately want to win money because they have unhealthy/unhappy social ties they wish they could escape (like their job) but the reality is that money by itself doesn't usually resolve personal problems.  So being able to show up at work one day and tell your boss ""Fuck you"" to his/her face doesn't necessarily lead to the freedom and peacefulness that such people likely are envisioning.",1302398630.0
