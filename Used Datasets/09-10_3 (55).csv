6,595153,comment,594569.0,595022.0,0,0,10ren,,,"By this definition of ""shallow drivel"", any summary is useless. They are providing an introduction - which is easier to read than the article. I think that's valuable. (BTW: I didn't realize you meant the online article - I thought you meant the actual research paper - my mistake).<p>The <i>title</i> is potentially misleading when taken out of context - but the text of the article doesn't distort the original article. It fact, it quotes heavily from it. So, possibly the <i>title</i> is disingenuous - but to say the entire article that 37Signals wrote is <i>completely disingenuous</i> is not accurate. At any rate, their title is substring of the linked article's title.<p>Judging an article by its headline and final line is similar to judging a book by its cover.  It's possible to interpret the last line as you have - but only by ignoring the rest of the text. The line is a play on words ""plan on improving"" as an expression usually means just to decide to improve; but in the context of the article, it also means to have some strategy for improving. It's true that 37Signals advocates just moving in a direction; whereas the linked to article talks about written plans for gathering information. So I can sympathize with your point of view. There is still a lot of common ground between them, and both parties acknowledge the same reality, and the same kind of approach to a solution - but the details of the solutions differ.<p>For reference, here's the 37Signal article: <a href=""http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1707-the-only-plan-is-to-learn-as-you-go"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1707-the-only-plan-is-to-...</a><p><i>EDIT</i> reading the linked to article (I was relying on their academic paper before), I see what you mean in that they gloss over the details, which I'd summarise with this quote: <i>I document all the assumptions that I'm making. And then I test these assumptions. I plan to test these assumptions at checkpoints.</i> 37Signals is ignoring the details, but keeping the philosophy, which is <i>If I'm likely to be wrong, then how do I plan in such a way that the cost of being wrong is as low as possible?</i> Being extremely agile is a way to do that.<p>37Signals is not so much distorting the article, as summarizing its basic idea. The full article is linked to for further reading (as you have done).<p>BTW: I actually disagree with MacMillan's reverse income statement, for startups. Although it's sensible, it would have prevented Xerox from starting (IBM's consultants measured the price and potential market share, and concluded - accurately - that it wasn't worth pursuing <i>given reality as it existed at that time</i>). Of course, IBM was huge corporation even then, and had a different attitude to risk than startups do - and should have.<p>Anyway, thanks for explaining your point of view, it makes it possible to have an interesting discussion, especially with someone who disagrees with you - often the most fruitful kind.",1241581698

Even in 1996, an indie ISP was hard to differentiate from the majors and incumbents.
