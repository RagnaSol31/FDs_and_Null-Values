1,757074,comment,756846.0,756868.0,0,0,locopati,,,"That's all well and good. There are a lot of internal corporate applications that were developed on IE6. Knowing that IE6 required workarounds that would break in IE7/IE8/FF3/etc, it would be irresponsible of Microsoft to force upgrades to IE7 or IE8. Meanwhile, corporations are not likely to revisit working apps and upgrade them to IE7 or IE8 - there are better things to do with people's time. So, the sad truth is that IE6 is going to live on as a legacy application, but not one that necessarily must be supported by present and future applications. There are plenty of alternative browsers that can play alongside IE6 in corporate environments and allow web development to progress.<p>This reply is a bit blunt, but if you're outside a big corporation, it's easy to say 'bad developers, get with the program', which is an overly simple answer that ignores the reality of most big businesses. They want to get things done, and that doesn't always mean doing things 'correctly'.",1250042287.0

I respectfully but completely disagree.<p>I also don't think your analogy is very applicable, since domain names are just floating in the ether, not sitting in physical proximity of one another. Ads plastered on one will not drive down the values of the others — the complete opposite, in fact. Furthermore, no one would buy prime commercial real estate, do nothing with it, and then be able to cover their costs with some ads on it — whoever bought it would go bankrupt. Ignoring all that, however, I really feel that if someone wanted to do so, the city council should not be able to levy fines on them for letting their property go into disrepair. Would I want to live next to such a property? No, definitely not. But it's their property and I respect their rights to do as they wish with it. I don't feel the ends justify the means in this case.",1250039420.0

I don't think MRI images of modern day teens is really enough to base a conclusion on. It may be true that teens today show less development but the reason for that is not a foregone conclusion.<p>I think what the author is trying to say in his article is that teens are capable of much more than they are allowed to do. And that very fact may be what causes the results in the research you linked above.,1250039338.0

Doctors blamed my condition on my genes.  I figured there had to be more to it than that.<p>How: I have a small website that attempts to answer that question:  <a href=""http://www.healthgazelle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.healthgazelle.com</a><p>To sum up my point of view:  White people are more vulnerable to sunburn than darker-skinned people but ""pale skin disorder"" does not doom you to be chronically sunburned to the point of peeling and does not doom you to die at an early age of skin cancer.  Similarly, cystic fibrosis makes one more vulnerable to infection, but one does not have to accept being sick all the time as their only fate. It takes both pale skin and sunlight to cause sunburn.  It takes both CF and germs to make one deathly ill.  The environmental and lifestyle part is what we can control.  So far, so good.",1250039143.0

But after Thorp demonstrated it was beatable there was a surge in demand for blackjack. Turns out, nearly all those new blackjack players weren't really very good at counting and lost money hand over fist. Thorp's work (among others) led to increased casino profits and lent an air of legitimacy to gambling; it wasn't just luck anymore, if you ""worked"" at it you could profit.
