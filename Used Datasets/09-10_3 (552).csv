Unless you by native speaker mean native Vietnamese speaker, that could be an awesome advantage -- wages are for workers in the outsourcing industry is, among other things, determined by english speaking ability. When it comes to getting first world salaries where you do contracting work is probably often irrelevant -- and could also be hard to tell (depending on need for communication making time differences or unstable internet connections problematic etc.). I have been wondering about the possibility of being a sort of salesman/manager/quality controller for contracting work with Filipinos doing the grunt work.

You are correct that overloaded function calls are resolved at compile-time while multi-method calls are resolved at runtime, but if you want to make a C++ analogy, you'd better compare them to virtual methods.  Multi-methods work almost like virtual methods, with two exceptions:<p>1) multi-methods are declared outside the class definitions; it is important since it allows you to extend a class without directly modifying its definition or implementation.<p>2) virtual functions do dispatch by one argument (`this` in C++) while multi-methods could perform dispatch by an arbitrary number of arguments.<p>That said, I don't like this implementation that much since it does not respect class inheritance.  Suppose you defined a MultiMethod with two registered implementations, for class A and class B, where B is inherited from A.  Then the result of the multi-method call with an object of type B is undefined.  A proper multi-method would call the most specific implementation in this case.",1277601951.0

When you are buying toothpaste or cola, there is not that much difference from one brand to the next, so having the lower price can help make the sale.<p>For tech work, the difference in skill among programmers can be an order of magnitude.

If you are a highly skilled programmer but charge low, you may be sending a signal that you are a novice programmer.<p>Furthermore, if you charge too low you may attract clients from hell.  These are clients that don't know much about programming and think that it's easier than it is (which is why they are looking for below market rates).<p>So don't charge less in order to attract clients.

But, that means you have to know that 'print' is a statement and not an expression, and that the right-hand side of the print statement is in fact an expression.<p>In ruby, actions like prints and assignments are side-effects and always evaluated as expressions.

When you own a house you have to pay taxes around what you would pay to rent the house. So when you don't have a mortgage on the house you pay twice. Once the ""rent"" plus the normal property tax.\nThe smart thing to do is to get a mortgage, so you don't have to pay the property tax. The interest to pay will be far less than the property tax.",1277600580.0

Scaling is a problem when you have bitmap images and try to scale from - say - an iPhone to an iPad.  But on desktops, monitors aren't growing in size by a factor of ~2.77.<p>If you leave the screen size the same but increase the DPI, bitmaps will look exactly the same.  They might seem visually out-of-place next to crisper UI elements.  Is that what you mean?",1277600532.0

The idea is to give people who have emailed and asked a chance to sign up before I open ordering to the general public.<p>Obviously, the link remains the same, so there's nothing stopping someone from signing up for a bunch of domains I don't have available, or cutting in front of other people in line, but so far it hasn't been a problem;  people on the waiting list get a day or two to sign up before I open up the main waiting list.<p>but, then you were asking why I treat ordering for large domains differently from small domains.  When I open up orders for large domains, I sell out like /that/ - It doesn't take very many 4GiB sign ups to fill up a 32GiB server. I mean, I can handle a few right now,  or, at least I could at that point, but I want to severely rate limit those until I have satisfied the demand for small servers and have a bit of extra capacity.<p>Right now, I'm on the edge of opening orders for large domains.  (I've got a 16 core, 64GiB ram, 8 disk monster at the co-lo I'm configuring that will host only 1024MiB and up domains.)   and I've got most of two 32GiB, 4 disk, 8 core boxes either online or in burn in ready for smaller domains.<p>I prioritize the small domains over the large domains for two reasons.<p>1. the small domains are more profitable per amount of hardware I buy ($4 per account plus $1 for every 64MiB ram.) and right now my bottleneck is capital for new hardware, so I'll serve the less capital intensive customers first.<p>2. I am still focused on the hobby user.   At the moment, I think I can serve the needs of the enthusiast market better than the 'serious business' market.  I'm trying to change that, but I'm not there yet.  I do want to get there, so I do like some of the more adventurous businesses trying me out and giving me feedback, but I want to make sure that I don't serve the business market at the expense of my current enthusiast market.  I want to keep that base.",1277600447.0
