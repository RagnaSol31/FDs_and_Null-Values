If you could engineer your probe/launch vehicle to withstand 20 Gs, for example, a linear acceleration at that level would get you to Mach 1.2ish in 400 meters or so. You come out of the barrel cleanly in ramjet territory and, what's better past the point where your shock wave angles are highly dependent on Mach number. You could start out in subcritical mode for the engine and progress through critical and supercritical, buying hardware simplicity with some loss of efficiency. You might even be able to shed some of the diffuser cowling in stages at the lip for a Q&D variable geometry engine. By the tme you hit M = 5-7, you'd probably be out of the atmosphere and would have to switch to rocket mode anyhow. Your mass fraction for the booster stage would be pretty amazing because you'd shaved 2000-2500 m/s off your delta-V with the gun/air-breathing phase. (That matters a lot to the rocket equation. I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to work out the actual benefit.)<p>The limiting factors here are obtaining a guidance and control system that is small enough to fit down your (admittedly large bore) low-pressure launch gun. Also, your gun would have to be pretty dang straight or your vehicle would have to be wrapped in a vibration-absorbing sabot.<p>The benefits are: 1) Once you have the gun, you can launch as many as you like; 2) Mass fraction as mentioned above; 3)The possibility of production-lining launch vehicle construction.<p>Not that I've given this any thought.<p>BTW, Bruckner et. al. at the University of Washington have been working on a ram accelerator, a type of launch gun, for years. The only thing slowing them is funding. They omit an airbreathing stage in favor of obtaining all the Delta-V in one shot, subjecting the payload to 700-1e3 Gs.",1232502298

I worked a bit with Oracle Siebel, its a customer relations management software and the company decided to use it for its system. The database is just this giant juggernaut with thousands of tables generated automatically, if you look closely there is redundancy everywhere, which I assume is for performance enhancement, but even then it is horribly slow.<p>Its absolutely drives you nuts because everything, from business information, to server configuration, and even even the interface - menu items, buttons, page layout, links, is stored in the database. Now this may make the software less 'bug free' and thus make less trouble for Oracle, but it is an absolute nightmare for the developer because everything has to be changed through the IDE, which is basically a retarded version of a database browser without the ability to run SQL update command, and only allows you to change one row at a time, you might as well as be a monkey.

On <a href=""http://store.wonderwarp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.wonderwarp.com</a> you link to <a href=""https://store.wonderwarp.com/mint/?js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://store.wonderwarp.com/mint/?js</a> which does not exist and wastes valuable processing time only to error out.<p>- Pack and minimize your CSS/JS files, even just temporarily. If you are dead sure this is going to be a lot of people, every small bit of saved bytes helps!<p>That's all I can think of since you've already moved the downloads to S3. Your site is mostly heavy on the static content anyways so not much you can do unless you stripped it down, but I would say keep it as it is because it looks great.<p>Regardless, if your site does go down think of it as a victory. You got so much traffic (and probably sales) to knock you down that you can only become better for the next time you get press. If it's a good product, it will happen again and again :)",1232500429

One link will point to a Coral Cache(<a href=""http://www.coralcdn.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coralcdn.org/</a>) and the other to your regular page. That should enable you to handle the load you are expecting.",1232500039

Thus, neither of them qualified to become Acting President under the Presidential Succession Act. Plus, interbranch appointments might be unconstitutional anyhow. See Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram David Amar, Is the Presidential Succession Law Constitutional?, 48 Stan. L. Rev. 113 (1995); but see Howard Wasserman, Structural Principles and Presidential Succession, 90 Ky. L.J. 345 (2002).</i><p>furthermore, to the parent comment:<p><i>I suppose the obvious counterargument is that Secretary Rice also never took the Oath prescribed in Art. II, Sec. 1, cl. 8, and thus was no more qualified than Barack Obama or Joe Biden to act as President at 12:00 noon. But if Secretary Rice was not President from noon to 12:01, then who was?</i><p>Verdict: today is an interesting meatspace reminder to check your edge cases.",1232499939

It took nearly 7 weeks for our bank contracts to get approved, and we used a major int`l bank - Wells Fargo.

In a typical operation, the biggest costs are industrial ones: around 25%-35% for paper and printing; another 30%-40% for distribution; around 18-25% for editorial; the remaining 10-15% are for administrative and marketing expenditures. It varies from country to country but we can safely assert most of the costs â€” at least 60% â€” are industrial in nature. Evidently, that part disappears when going online.</i>",1232499850
