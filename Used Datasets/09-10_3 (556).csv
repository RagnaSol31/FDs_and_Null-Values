The only reason why that 3k is not 30k, or 75k per month is because of my laziness.<p>I have a list of 50+ things that need to be done with the site, changes, additions, writing etc... and I just can't seem to focus on getting them done.<p>I have people contact me to advertise all the time and I just tell them we are not accepting new advertisers right now, because I am too lazy to deal with yet another contact, and going back and forth with my tech people to get the ads implemented.<p>I have absolutely no technical skills and I outsource all of the work on the tech side overseas. The trouble is that I hate being a project manager and walking people through my vision.Also, good help is hard to find.<p>I also have a well-paying full time job and a growing family and I cannot devote myself to the site wholeheartedly until the revenue allows me to quit my job.<p>Some of my options as I currently see them are:<p>1. Sell the site. I have been approached several times by very good and well known acquirers about selling to them. I said no because I know there is so much revenue to be unlocked with a little bit of work that I just can't let it go at a much lower valuation.<p>2. I could just continue along as I have been, making minor improvements very slowly and just leave some money on the table.<p>3.

It was a great and challenging position, not just due to its content (how do you deal with running tens of thousands of nodes in clusters distributed throughout the world?) but the people and the environment (it was one of the few places where you could find people in an operations team hacking OCaml).<p>Ultimately, I was found by a start-up and left, seeing greater responsibility and compensation. Six month in, I started looking around. The lack of mental stimulation scared and de-motivated me. I switched jobs to a non-web-centric software engineering role. It felt ""scary"" (""job hopping"" as the country headed into the recession?), but it was the right choice.<p>The risk is thus: if you're bright, it's very easy to become good at most anything. Some fields (systems administration, web development) can be fun (given the right environment, e.g. the operations team I've described) and are <i>always</i> in high demand. None the less, if you become good at something you <i>don't</i> ultimately find challenging and worth-while it can be a risk further down on.<p>Have you consider going into scientific software development? Both your web development background (the web <i>is</i> the user interface these days) and your scientific education will be of help. You might take a paycut, you may not have the flexible hours, but the job might provide both the content and the environment (i.e. the people) that will keep you sharp.",1250472823.0

I think the solution is clear: tags.  Tags will let each reader more easily focus on what they find interesting, no matter how ""impure"" the site gets.

Journalists are actually quite cheap, so a few hundred interested parties could fund a weeklong investigation by a professional journalist. You could also solicit leads and research assistance from the readers.<p>Then, once the story is published you still get any ad revenue, which could be targeted to the audience that you serve. Journalists could liveblog updates as they investigate, encouraging supporters to give additional funds to help them through the search. The editorial staff could float suggestions for stories and let users vote with their wallets on what they want investigated.<p>In this way users could also directly support the journalists who do good work, and the organization would scale by the level of interest.<p>Probably not what pg had in mind, but it doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility.",1250471106.0

It's about respect and personal space more than anything else.<p>Consider this: I'm more comfortable without pants on.  When I work from home, in my own space, I'm usually not wearing pants.  But when I come into the office, I put on pants, because I have some modicum of respect for the people I work with, and I know that pantslessness is going to make people uncomfortable.<p>Your behavior doesn't bother <i>you</i>, but ignoring the fact that it bothers <i>others</i> is the very definition of rudeness.

If you're into comp sci, don't just read comp sci papers. Try some humanities or even art from time to time. The most unique ideas seem, to me, to come from taking knowledge from one field and adapting it into another. I've learned so much by taking a casual interest in fields unrelated to what I do and certainly feel ""sharp"" when I see connections between things I'd be otherwise ignorant of if I were a ""specialist.""",1250470914.0

The filter on output method that most Rails programmers use involves setting it up on an output-by-output method. I like the input technique because it only needs to be configured once.<p>I think the risk of new techniques getting by this filter are low (although the risk of the filter having bugs is high, as judged by the number of bugs that popup in more critical software). In XSS there are only a limited set of attack vectors (iframe, javascript, flash), and those get filtered completely. The underlying filter is based on whitelisting, so it's not like new additions to the HTML spec are going to open security holes before we have a chance to close them (it's the opposite, new, safe HTML additions will need to be explicitly allowed before they can be used).",1250470890.0

One co-founder means you get a bigger slice of the pie, but also means that there's no mediator if the two of you can't agree. And take it from me, there will be many times when you don't agree. That's why I prefer two co-founders, because when two people take a side they're often able to convince the third member.",1250470873.0
