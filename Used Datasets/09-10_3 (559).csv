He provided the justification that it would improve performance.<p>Unable to think of anything else to say, I replied and told him it was a good idea (without committing to make the change). In reality, making the suggested change the right way would require at least two hours of refactoring and testing. While the change would cause an improvement in performance, it was my judgment that the benefits of the change did not justify its costs given the number of visits the web page receives and other project priorities.<p>I realized I've been dealing with this general situation for years with no personal guidelines on how to handle it in the most productive way. I feel such requests are disrespectful because they imply that the requestor's time is more important than the requestee's.

While the general alignment of the person may be conservative, aren't the ideas still considered libertarian?<p>I've been considering a lot how to adjust use of words to make it clearer when I'm talking about ideas, since after all it's the ideas that matter if ideas are what we're discussing in the moment. Party alignments in non-election debate just muddy whatever the individual ideas are representing with preconceptions and even unrelated concepts, and it's harder to see where individuals cross-align, making negotiations and debates even harder than they already would be.",1268702001.0

How about Gmail Labs, which didn't exist 2 years ago, but now lets you skin Gmail, use keyboard shortcuts, embed youtube videos, etc. etc.? Calendar integration, a better text editor, embedded photos, multiple simultaneous attachment uploads w/ progress bars, better filters, incrementally better spam protection, plus the fact that I now have 7.5 gigs of space in my inbox, all while fending off attacks from Chinese hackers?<p>I think you grossly underestimate the amount of things they've accomplished in the past year, and the number of people it takes to run a service this popular. Facebook releases with grandiose redesigns, prompting temporary revolts among their users. Gmail improves incrementally, so much so that I can't imagine living without it as my primary e-mail client, but the sense of novelty that comes with a massive redesign is lost.

So freaking what?<p>""Evidence"" that flimsy wouldn't stand up in a local bar  argument, much less a court of law. The records are still completely and totally anonymous.

79,1194619,comment,1193401.0,1193996.0,0,0,mlinsey,,,"""3GS or better required"" is much more understandable than ""1Ghz Snapdragon or better required"", since the package the customer buys says ""3GS"" prominently  - it's even in the name of the device.  In fact, customers already are faced with the decision of ""3G"" vs ""3GS"" when they buy an iPhone.<p>What this suggests is that the solution for Android will be to have some easily-understandable number or naming scheme to roughly classify the power of the phone, so apps don't have to list compatible phones en masse.   For desktop software, most people basically used the required and recommended CPU speed as such a number. Even though it didn't really capture the full nuances of whether an app required more RAM or more CPU, it was a good enough rough metric.",1268701349.0
