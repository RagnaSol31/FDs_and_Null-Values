Some viewers with third-party (or all) JavaScript disabled won't be counted, viewers that leave the page open in a tab before they look at it may be over-counted, and readers who legitimately spend more than ten minutes reading a longer page are capped at the ten minute mark.  However, averaging that across thousands of views is a very worthwhile measure of engagement.<p>I had a relevant post about that here recently (which was castigated for semantics more than it was actually discussed, unfortunately): <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1294969"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1294969</a><p>The Clicky pinging data was invaluable then too. HN visitors to that post show an abysmal 95% bounce rate and an average 14s time-on-site in Google Analytics. Meanwhile, Clicky shows those same HN visitors spending an average of 3m29s time-on-site and truly bouncing from the page only 12.9% of the time.  Even if you assume Clicky's numbers are wildly optimistic, it's nice to have that alternate insight.",1282701375

14,1631751,comment,1631682.0,1631721.0,0,0,Locke1689,,,"<i>As technology improves we should expect costs to decline.</i><p>Only if you assume labour isn't the prime mover. Assuming that technology improvements help education at all (I'm skeptical -- I learned more about logarithms in math by using an abacus than I did using a calculator), we would ideally want education quality to increase, not decrease. Therefore, we should probably assume costs will stay approximately the same percentage over the years.<p>One thing I've been thinking about lately is education as related to teacher salaries. In general teacher salaries are pretty poor, but they've always been pretty crappy. However, the civil rights movement has had a big impact since the 50's and there's a big difference. Teaching was and is a female dominated profession -- what's interesting are the opportunities for women since the civil rights act. Now, instead of teaching, the brightest women are more likely to hold more prestigious, higher paying jobs that were previously reserved for white men. In effect, it's as though we were placing a restriction on women that said ""If you're smart you can work -- but you can only work as a teacher."" I'm not sure how much of a difference this makes, but it seems like it could make quite a bit.",1282700857
