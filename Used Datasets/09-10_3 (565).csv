Research continually shows that people do make decisions that are not supported by rational thinking. Bubbles arise in very simple trading games, even when there is an objective maximum to the item traded that falls well below the traded value, for example. There are countless other examples and a rich and growing literature on the subject. Thus, your first statement seems actually to be true, even if it was offered with sarcastic disdain.<p><i>The government knows better.</i><p>Again, neither your sarcastic disdain nor your parroting of a right-wing canard make this statement any less true as it pertains to this article. Given that the percentage of people making a given choice can be skewed by how the choice is offered, it seems a reasonable course of action to make the offer in such a way as to achieve the desired result.

Energy drives modern technology, from your desk to your home to your doctor's office. Sure, if you don't care about quality of life, then energy use is unnecessary.</i><p>Really? This is your complaint? By 'unnecessary,' we can reasonably presume that the author means 'needlessly inefficient.' That much is evident to any sincere reader of the article who cares enough about the pursuit of knowledge to abide by the principle of charity: Put the best face on the argument before you refute it, otherwise you are not contributing.<p>The straw-man argument, ""Sure, if you don't care about quality of life, then energy use is unnecessary,"" is wholly beside the point.<p><i>And while most scientists think our emissions are going to cause an increase in mean global temperatures over the next few centuries, ""boiling the planet"" is a long way off.</i><p>Again, this cannot be a serious complaint. The phrase 'boiling the planet' is clearly a metaphor. A surface reading would be that we're just raising the temperature of the planet to an unhealthy extreme. A more nuanced reading reveals that the author means that we are raising the temperature of the planet to such a high temperature that we are going to cause irreversible change, such as when one boils food and finds that no amount of refrigeration will bring it back to it's former state. More simply, we are doing something analogous to sterilizing the planet, though to a lesser degree, in that many species may ultimately be made extinct.<p><i>That's not entirely a rhetorical question, I honestly don't follow dead tree media and never got into it much as a kid.</i><p>This is evident from the shallowness of your misguided critique.

31,550067,comment,549291.0,549801.0,0,0,blahblahblah,,,"I'm curious.  Did you ever try hiring someone who was an occasional gamer (the Wii and Bejeweled gamer) and they didn't work out or did you just assume that they wouldn't be a valuable addition to your team and automatically exclude them?  The reason I ask is because I wonder if having some diversity in the level of gameplay ability in your staff might actually produce better games (i.e. ones that mere mortals can play).  Of course, I have no idea what your target market is, but its pretty clear to me that occasional gamers are a largely untapped market that the large game companies are mostly ignoring.  There's no doubt that Halo, Call of Duty, WoW, etc. sell a lot of units, but there are also a lot of people (I am one of them) who have absolutely no interest in playing those kinds of games for the very simple reason that we have other things to do with our lives.  We still play games, but we avoid games that require a significant time investment in order to achieve competency at gameplay.  For example, I do not play first-person shooter games at all - the user interfaces are too complex to learn when you're the sort of person who only plays games for a couple of hours on Saturdays and may go for a month or more between sessions of playing any particular game.  Battle for Middle Earth II is at the upper limit of interface complexity that I am willing to tolerate before I give up on a game because it seems like I'm spending more time trying to remember the mechanics of the controls than I am just having fun playing.  I tend to gravitate towards simple turn-based or mouse-click slash & hack RPGs (Pool of Radiance, Dungeon Siege, Diablo II), sim games (Sid Meier's Civilization, Masters of Orion II, The Sims), and simple arcade or puzzle games (Dig Dug, Arkanoid, Minesweeper).  If it takes more than a minute to relearn the controls of a game when a month has passed since the last time I played it, odds are that I'll get frustrated and stop playing that game and avoid others like it.  Similarly, if the default game AI is tuned to perform at the level of a hardcore gamer and there's no way to turn it down to a level that a perpetual n00b like me can compete with, I'll ditch the game and never buy another one like it (many real-time strategy games are guilty of this offense).",1239067842.0

Physical withdrawl symptoms ensue.<p>It's not just a behavioral thing. The brain physically adapts to maintain equilibrium in the recurring presence of caffeine. I don't think there are permanent changes, but the adjustment cycle lasts days. The half-life of caffeine is 6-8 hours (on average), meaning, at that point, <i>half</i> of it has been metabolized.<p>Anecdotally, a reasonably small amount daily is stable.

There's a lot going into the determination of which codec to use if more than one might be appropriate.  As wmf mentioned about - DRM and dynamic streaming, I'm wondering the same but I think that can be handled by appropriate codecs.  (Which may be just moving the plug-in issue to be one involving codecs, but let's hope popular browsers will ship with sufficiently useful ones.)<p>The whatwg draft is really quite interesting...<p><a href=""http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/",

Given the fact that coding leads to watching the sun rise from your desk chair, the hope that this particular algorithm saves the world, and a disturbing reliance on Totino's pizza rolls as sustenance, I would say yes, the connection between mental health and code is not a coincidence.",1239066651.0

That being said, just on a quick once-over for aesthetics I'm not left thinking ""Ahh, modern Perl sure looks less painful than modern Ruby or modern Python.""<p>I don't even write Python, but looking at it has never given me a seizure.  Not that your code is seizure-inducing, mind you.",1239066486.0

I can see how this is already a useful service. Forgive my ignorance, Are you the first mover in this space or are others already doing recipe search by ingredients? I was a little frustrated with the search result display: I had to scroll down a page or two of whitespace but I assume you'll work on that in good time. I'm also feeling unloved by the way each search result appears because the list of external links makes me feel like I'm on a parked site. My frustration was that for every recipe I still needed to visit the grocery store to get more ingredients - that said it may be because my cupboard is too bare. I wonder if for the paid service it might work a bit better if you approached the whole site from an ad-free perspective. What if the search results didn't drive away traffic to the source sites but revealed the full recipes on your site? Only your paying customers would get to see the entire recipe while freeloaders could see just the list of ingredients? Or you could give away some recipes in their entirety for free while making a percentage of the search results opaque to all but your customers. If you're wanting to flip this maybe you could sell or license to a foodie site. I don't know what restrictions the sites you're getting these recipes from place on their APIs (which is I assume how you're getting the data) but these are my initial thoughts based on a cursory visit. Good v1, I think you should keep working on it. And don't listen to me too much, you might well have an ad model that works.",1239066323.0
