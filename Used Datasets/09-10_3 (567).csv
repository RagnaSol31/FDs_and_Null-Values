Its only flaw, however, is in the assertion that both meditation and psychedelic experience arrive at the same mental state. Minus that, likening meditation to progressive, incremental bicycle trips into the forest is accurate and sets a person up wonderfully to begin the discipline.<p>Psychedelic drugs provide an experience of absorption like a trance. When one is absorbed in such a state, it's the first direct experience of a sense of self that is immaterial (but finite). Buddhist meditation (samadhi or ""right concentration"" in the Noble Eightfold Path) goes very far beyond that and into very different states of consciousness.<p>Gil Fronsdal is a Stanford Ph.D who teaches clearly, logically, and in stepwise progression.

Luckily, creating confidence is easy, you just fake it until it catches on. Sure, you can read more in-depth articles about ""finding things you like about yourself"" and ""positive mantras"", but if you just go out intending to appear confident, you will in fact become confident. I pay a lot of attention to the way that people speak.

It was clear to me from the start that MM (now Adobe) had made a bad move with Flex because all the examples reimplemented basic HTML form + JS functionality in Flash, with a bonus ""Loading"" window at the start.<p>I know a lot of otherwise bright devs that were drawn to Flex by the MVC paradigms that littered the tutorials.

(Relatedly, it may not be the book the original poster is looking for.)<p>Way back when I read it, I hadn't given thought to all the issues it addresses and it really opened my eyes.  Maybe you can spot people that try to apply it as a tool ""from a mile away"" - however, I suspect it is a best seller because it has helped nudge lots of people towards having more positive interactions with others.

In other words, re-implementing an inverted index in SQL is waste of time when you can use tools like Sphinx and Lucene - which are highly optimized to do inverted indexes and that can easily handle 2 billion words. The same can be said about FlockDB - it's possible to emulate a graph database, but is the effort really worth it when there are such tools like Redis and neo4j which seem to be optimized for graph like structures.",1271120850.0
