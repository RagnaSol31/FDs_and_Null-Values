2,555554,comment,554940.0,554940.0,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I'd consider the issue of latency to be a switching cost vs. lock-in.  You could move all your stuff over to the new, shiny cloud.  Of course, if Cloud A is good for some stuff and Cloud B is good for other stuff, then you're stuck in the middle (without low-latency peering as some commenters have mentioned).<p>In general, I don't see why people are scared of Amazon EC2 lock-in.  You're still writing a regular 'ol app that runs on RedHat (or whatever).  How does switching over to your own datacenter require any re-writes (other than config changes, etc.)?<p>I understand the S3 issue, but you ought to be abstracting away the S3 details anyway with a code layer.  So, you could implement some sort of hybrid scheme (S3 + new way abstracted away) easily enough if you must avoid downtime  Or, if you don't have that much data, just write a script to move it all over.<p>Queuing: If you're relying on some specific feature of SQS, you're doing it wrong.<p>Payments: Ok, this gets interesting.  But, it's low volume compared to most computing activity, so you can afford the latency.  It's not like your DB is at Amazon and your app servers are somewhere else.<p>I'm more sympathetic to Google AppEngine lock-in.  However, I don't think it's too hard for someone to implement the limited set of interfaces provided by the cloud (at least in the Java case -- I haven't examined the Python one), so it's easily broken.<p>As Clouds become more abstracted away from hardware and the current ways of doing things, I think lock-in will become a real concern.  But, it doesn't matter right now.",1239328646.0

17,555538,comment,555136.0,555400.0,0,0,netcan,,,"I would like to hear a great public speaker put that in to the right words.<p>It seems perfectly natural to hear currently successful people recall the learning experience of running a business early in life. It's seems perfectly natural that if you meet a 21 year old that has been running a business for some time, you will expect future success from them. This is obviously due to the (a)educational value of these activities & (b) what personality traits these suggest (It is usually not because this business is especially successful). You can speculate about which one is dominant, but (a) is unlikely to be insignificant. Already this sounds like a discussion about the value of going to a top Uni.<p>Like I said, I think a good speaker could take a friendly audience through something like this thought process & come to the conclusions that spending time & money running a business early on is valuable.<p>But if it comes to making a practical decision based on the above it quickly starts to feel radical. A proactical decision could be to take the time & money it takes to attend University & spend it creating a business. If the educational & associated benefits are similar to a University education, there are two outcomes. (1) The business fails - Education is acquired (2) The business succeeds - Education is acquired + the business can be sold or operated.<p>The risk doesn't seem <i>that</i> big.<p>Where I live (Australia) International Undergraduates typical need  are: 20k-30k USD * 3-5 years. Students are often from Malaysia, Indonesia, China & India.<p>60k - 150k buys you a fairly substantial education business experience in these countries. But even some place like England, it is substantial.<p>In essays, PG implies ""risking"" about a year and little or nothing out-of-pocket. That is an order of magnitude less ""risky"" then University typically is.<p>The logical case is there. What's needed is the emotional resonance. I don't think it applies only to startups in the YC sense.",1239328013.0

Responding like this can be difficult, but it's very effective - and good for the soul.<p>A weakness of HN is that intelligent, articulate writing is sometimes used with harsh attitude and connotations.

25,555528,comment,555374.0,555374.0,0,0,ivankirigin,,,This came up in a poker game yesterday. I pointed out to someone who thought Twitter peaked:\n  - They grew close to 100% last month\n  - I've gotten more business contacts over twitter than LinkedIn & Facebook combined\n  - Twitter is much more conversational than Facebook when between strangers. That makes the business & celeb side of it stronger.<p>I expect Facebook to do more to let companies better engage with their users. One problem is the privacy. Facebook conversations are largely hidden from the public eye. How will my wall-to-wall comment about shitty Comcast service get picked up by them?<p>I do think the celeb hype around twitter is just insane.

An example of this is being captive to customers, as in the innovator's dilemma. Listening to the wrong group of users can lead you in the wrong direction. Sometimes you have to select who to listen to - something that users can't tell you.<p>Of course, who cares if it's ""the truth"" or not? Users are users, and approximate feedback is better than none, even if it is not precisely ""true"".",1239326190.0

It just <i>looks</i> like it's barely restrained, waiting to leap forward: a kind of ""visual onomatopoeia"" I guess.
