Temperature and pressure are obviously closely related; by messing with pressure, you can distill flavored alcohols at much lower temperatures, which greatly intensifies flavor.<p>This article, by the Dir/Technology at the French Culinary Institute, gets results that are often comparable to what people are getting with $2k-$5k vac machines --- using a cheap ISI cream whipper you can get off Amazon (or, I guess, at Williams-Sonoma) for $60. <i>In one minute.</i><p>So for instance, if you wanted to make a mojito, you could infuse rum with lime zest and mint and start the cocktail with an intensely flavored perfectly clear liquid.<p>It apparently works with other (non-alcoholic) liquids too. I can't wait to try this. (Erin wants an ISI whipper anyways, to make aerated chocolate).<p>There's apparently even <i>science</i> involved! ---<p><i>Well done! You’ve rediscovered nitrogen cavitation and put it to novel use. Cavitation is used in cell biology labs to gently disrupt cells in a vessel ominously called a “nitrogen bomb” (as the gas here is nitrogen). The usual explanation is close to what you surmised: under pressure, gas penetrates the cells, then forms bubbles to disrupt the cells when the pressure is suddenly released. Your use of the technique looks a lot more interesting than my experiences with it in a lab.</i>",1282958354

For instance:<p>I was the lead architect at Quickoffice for several years... at one point we were preparing for a big release. THE big release. It contained our first go at full editing/round-tripping for Word/Excel files. This was a big deal for our company as we moved from very hacky desktop-syncing solutions to full on-device mobile editing.<p>Our big competitor was behind and I'm pretty sure they knew it. We had been competing for some big business so we had some idea what the other was up to. About a month before our release, they issued a press release clearly laying out their roadmap... including their plans for full document round-tripping.<p>It was a genius move. It had a tremendous delaying effect among our shared customers (big phone OEM's primarily). They instantly negated our advantage as the decision makers and end-users both decided to take a wait and see approach rather than put their money into our software. It also took some steam away from our feature-set as people seemed to credit them with arriving at it first even if we were the first to actually deliver it.<p>I've seen this work in other cases. A competitor outlines their roadmap which forces their competitors to spin cycles trying to respond to it. It makes the product conversation about how they stack up against your hypothetical product, not what you're actually delivering today.<p>As with all things strategic, it's all about timing.

That morning was quite clearly a ""come work for us, it'll be fun"" invitation and I appreciated it.<p>Now that I'm in the position to do hiring, I try to have the same attitude.",1282957925

It seems one could justify almost any result with the right argument. To say that evolutionary psychology is ever anything more than an explanation (not an excuse) seems patently ridiculous -- humans have evolved higher brain function to override decisions previously based on instinct.<p>Then again, I don't have a lot of confidence in the field of psychology in the broad sense anyway. The experimentalists and those leaning towards neurobiology are probably on the right track, but the Freudian mentality still seems to shine through in some sub-disciplines.",1282957787
