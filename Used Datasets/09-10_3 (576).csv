The flip side is that OpenSSO uses in-built Kerberos encryption, and generates token-based session headers that contain zero sensitive information.<p>Honestly, you may well have a point, in that the customer may well have only been receptive to the chosen solution because it was custom-developed, but I was mostly balking at the developer's initial reaction of 'impossible'.  Not only is it not impossible, it isn't hard to do, and certainly didn't require reinventing the wheel when a perfectly adequate solution exists that would not only have worked well, but worked for de-passwordifying OTHER web services as well (potentially).",1268183893.0
