From externally observable evidence they're probably better at it than WoW and WoW is large enough to be its own national economy.  (Zynga is a lot like IMVU or for that matter Toyota: I don't care if you have no interest in their product, their <i>processes</i> are worthy of study.)<p>They aren't just throwing dung at the wall and seeing what sticks: they're very, very good at what they do.  For every FarmVille there are tens of thousands of games which you have never heard of: their viral growth coefficient was .95 instead of 1.05, kaboom, that is all you need to fail.  The platform is getting harder to develop for, as early entrants used techniques which were what SEOs might call ""a wee bit grey"" to gain traction, and these are either impossible now or will result in a new entrant getting hit with the banhammer.  (For example, early social games maximized their viral coefficient by adopting a spam-early spam-often policy to user notifications, which ticked off a lot of Facebook users, causing Facebook to take a number of countermeasures.  Ask somebody who builds for it to describe the specifics, but there are now throttles and some sort of system where you earn the right to use the viral channels.)",1267149599.0

There are non-games industry and games industry creators. Those from the games industry obviously needed to work on some game before going Indie. They get experience, connections, and money from working on games just like farmville - without that industry start, who can say if we would have ever received World of Goo or others.<p>Likewise, those not from the games industry needed to know videogames exist. Maybe farmville will start a teen on the path to becoming someone on the caliber of Cactus.<p>What goes on in pop culture influences Indies, but it definitely doesn't control nor destroy them. Does it get more people exposed to videogames? Then I can't see it hurting the Indie scene. Note: it may ""damage"" mainstream games to some, but that is what you should complain about.",1267149566.0

There are a ton of email servers that are not configured properly or are configured in complex ways. The worst case I saw was with a large corporate email system. They used some kind of round robin/load balaner. Incoming mail went through one mailserver, outgoing through multiple (different) mailservers. The greylisting would therefore always get caught in an infinite loop. Here's a rough example:<p>1) The greylisting would initially reject the mail from bigcorp.com.\n2) Bigcorp.com would get the rejection, but the re-send would come from a different mail server: mailserver1.bigcorp.com.\n3) Since this is a new IP address, the greylisting would bounce the new email.\n4) Bigcorp.com would re-send, but this time from mailserver8.bigcorp.com.\n5) rinse and repeat<p>Now, you can say that the guys at bigcorp.com are boneheads and they should hide these details from the outside world.

80,1152076,comment,1151477.0,1151575.0,0,0,stevenbedrick,,,"Personally, I've always interpreted the word ""appropriate"" to be aimed at correcting other first-worlders with (often dangerous) misconceptions about how development works. Case in point: your water system example.<p>Let's say you're an organization interested in improving the water situation in a rural village in Kenya. Which of these two options makes more sense?<p>1. A well that the village residents can build and maintain themselves with relatively small amounts of initial and ongoing costs, and that doesn't require specialized knowledge to keep running...<p>2. OR, a modern chlorinated water system, which depends on tons of pipes, valves, pumps, etc., and will require a massive construction effort to build, and will also need a steady supply of chlorine, and somebody who can fix all the pumps when they break, and somebody who knows enough about water treatment to keep the the water system from accidentally giving everybody cholera, and a steady supply of spare parts, etc. etc. etc.<p>I mean, yeah, in the best case, a modern chlorinated water system is a great thing... but you have to look at the whole picture and at the long term. A simple solution like a good well can have a real impact on a lot of people's lives, and unlike a proper water system has fewer expensive and dangerous failure modes. Oh, and by the way, the well solution was cheap enough that you've got enough money left over to go and build a well in the neighboring village, as well. Woohoo!<p>I agree that the term ""appropriate technology"" <i>can</i> be used in the matter in which you describe; however, to me it seems pretty obvious to say that technology is not a one-size-fits-all thing. There's no point in (for example) shipping a bunch of MRI machines or surgical robots to a rural clinic somewhere when what the clinic really needs is more rubber gloves, syringes, and malaria medication. In my mind, <i>that's</i> what the phrase ""appropriate technology"" is <i>supposed</i> to mean. Here's Steve's three-step process to a successful technological development intervention:<p>1. Actually learn about the people you're trying to help, preferably by living with them for a period of time. Learn about what resources (physical, educational, human, etc.) they have access to, and what resources they don't have. Learn about the problems they're facing in their day-to-day lives, and find out if the things you thought were problems going in actually are perceived as such by the people living with them.<p>2. Together with your new neighbors and friends, decide on a problem to try and address with a technical solution.<p>3. Decide on a technological solution that takes into account all of the stuff you learned in step 1 about what resources your population does and does not have access to.<p>The biggest and most common mistake that people working in development can make is to blindly throw technology at a problem, pat themselves on the back, and go home feeling good.",1267146219.0
