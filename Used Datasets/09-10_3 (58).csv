They can likely get memory management, and other crazy things, to fall through to the host OS.<p>I hope, though, that they're not trying to make XP applications as secure and trustworthy as W7 applications by wrapping them in a slow software condom; that, instead, they're just trying to ensure backwards-compatibility to the utmost extent possible. If something could crash XP, it should be able to crash W7 transparently through VXPâ€”that's the level of entanglement where you start to see real performance. The users who need the old applications, that ran on XP but don't run on Vista, know what the bugs are; they'd rather have the <i>same</i> bugs, with the same symptoms, than <i>new</i> bugs. They know what they're getting into when they install something in XP-virtualization mode, so we don't have to <i>improve</i> the experience beyond what it was like in XP just for them.

How does one tell?<p>I was under the impression Amazon had warehouses that end up delivering in most states, since I (thought I) pay tax on purchases in my state. The point is, it's not just Amazon. Amazon is a minor part of it. They're talking about causing anyone who advertises on a California website to be a California taxpayer.<p>That's ridiculous. I'm sure I must be considered as one of the top few percent of people who pay attention to news. What happens with advertisers who are less in-tune with intra-state events? What happens with people who buy ads through an ad agency who puts their ads on California websites?

It's not quite as clear as saying ""the US govt has power to tax interstate commerce,"" but anyone I've known as a constitutional ""scholar"" agrees with that:<p>The original constitution- article 1, section 8, says the US Congress has the duty and right:<p>""To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes; ""<p>Then later they mention that ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.""<p>Most people forget about that 10th amendment (and the 9th as well!)<p>You see, the power of regulating commerce among the several states was delegated by the Constitution to the United States. It's not up to California.<p>""Really, this needs a national solution...""<p>No, it doesn't. California charges an income AND sales tax. Plenty of states do fine without an income tax.

Just reading thru a tutorial totally different from doing it and getting first-hand experience, especially if you are going to work with Python and Ruby for webapps.<p>I had a odd but great experience when I first learnt PHP, that was around 4yrs ago. Every time I did something, I found there was a better way to do it and the PHP documentation on the website is great (and the comments for every page on the docs)<p>And also learn Object Oriented stuff in PHP. Learn to use classes and objects. This opens up a whoile new shelf of resources for you. Coz then you can start using classes that others have created for specific tasks. phpclasses.org has a pretty huge database of classes. Also as you go, just get started with using an MVC. Use CakePHP (I use it and its good) or CodeIgniter or Kohana (as many here suggest often).<p>I suggested PHP coz it also saves you the pain of learning how to deploy your app. For PHP it's pretty straight forward, just upload the files and it works. Good for starters.<p>P.S: Don't listen to me. Just do it your own way. Coz that's what you'll do anyway. It's never possible to follow suggestions/rules, like a sworn monk.
