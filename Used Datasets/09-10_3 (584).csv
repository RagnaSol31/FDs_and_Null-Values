Both parties take pride in being completely separate from one another. This has to end, and that is a cultural change, something that is completely within the realm of doing in less than 10 years.<p>As for the relevancy of licensing, I think there is a certain degree to which one could start certifying software engineers on a project management perspective, because the principals of how one approaches a project and brings it to completion aren't that different from any other project in any other industry. If you're running your project correctly, programming is maybe 10% of the project. That other 90% has a lot to learn from the rest of the industrial fields to catch up and start adopting standard practices.<p>A user's requirements are going to be the same no matter what programming language you use. The way you test the software is going to be the same no matter what programming language you use. Within a specific programming paradigm, how you build the software is a shear matter of syntax, all the parts are going to have to be the same. Just as you can have a suspension bridge versus a stone bridge, I think you could study object oriented programming versus functional programming, and I don't see any reason why we shouldn't expect professional, licensed software developers to know both.<p>COBOL, C, C",

""I know I’ve gotten behind this phase, but I’m going to turn things around. Would it be OK if I finished all your uncompleted requirements by Monday?""<p>I sat silent for a moment. ""Yes. But it’s important that you catch up completely this weekend, so that you’re not just perpetually behind.""<p>A few weeks later, I would conduct a nearly identical conversation with two other vendors. And, again, there would be no tangible result: No make-up software. No change in effort. No improvement in time management.<p>By the time entrepreneurs are in the marketplace, habits can be tough to change. If you’re used to playing video games like ""Modern Warfare"" or ""Halo"" all night, how do you fit in four hours of customer revisions? Or rest up for a demo?<p>Building start-ups in this market, especially one with a large international population, has given me a stark - and unwelcome - illustration of how Americans’ work ethic often pales in comparison with their peers from overseas.<p>My failing entrepreneurs this semester are almost exclusively American, while my entrepreneurs from India, China, and Latin America have - despite language barriers - generally written solid software, excelled on prototypes, and become valuable business partners.<p>One woman from Shanghai became a fixture at Super Happy Dev House, embraced our coworking center, and incessantly e-mailed me questions about her evolving website. Her javascript is still mediocre: she frequently puts "";"" everywhere (as in ""x = y;y = z;z = a;"") and confuses global variables with local variables.  But that didn’t stop her from doing rewrite after rewrite, tirelessly trying to improve both syntax and performance.<p>Chinese entrepreneurs have consistently impressed me with their work ethic, though I have seen similar habits in entrepreneurs from India, Thailand, Brazil, and Venezuela. Often, they’ve done little server-side coding in their home companies, and they frequently struggle to understand my specifications. But their respect for customers - and for business itself - is palpable. The entrepreneurs listen intently to everything I say, whether on-line or at code reviews, and try to engage in the process.<p>Too many 18-year-old American entrepreneurs, meanwhile, text one another under their workstations (certain they are sly enough to go unnoticed), check e-mail, decline to take notes, and appear tired and disengaged.<p>Of course, it would be wrong to suggest that all American entrepreneurs are the same. I’ve engaged many who were hardworking, talented, and deeply impressive. They listened intently, engaged customer dialogues, and never shied away from code rewrites. At their best, American entrepreneurs marry knowledge and innovation, resulting in some astoundingly creative web apps.<p>But creativity without knowledge - a common phenomenon - is just not enough.<p>Too many American entrepreneurs simply lack the basics. In 2002, an O'Reilly survey found that most 18- to 24-year-olds could not find regular expressions, data base access, or sorting algorithms in a PDF document, ranking them behind counterparts in Sweden, Great Britain, Canada, Italy, Japan, France, and Germany. And in 2007 the American Institutes for Research reported that eighth graders in even our best-performing states - like Massachusetts - scored below peers in Singapore, South Korea, and Japan, while entrepreneurs in our worst-performing states - like Mississippi - were on par with eighth graders in Slovakia, Romania, and Russia.<p>We’ve got a knowledge gap, spurred by a work-ethic gap.<p>Which brings me to another code-challenged entrepreneur, who once sprinted across the office to talk to me.<p>""I’m really sorry I missed your targets,"" he said. ""Do you have time to talk?""<p>""I have a meeting in a couple of minutes,"" I said. ""But you can walk with me.""<p>""OK,"" he said. ""I really enjoy your challenge, and I think I can do better. How can I improve my site?""<p>I looked at him sideways. ""Well, you might start with writing some code.""<p>""Yeah,"" he grinned, looking at his shoes. ""Sorry about that. There’s always stuff going on in my office late in the day. I have to learn to be better about time management.""<p>Of course, he had it exactly right. Success is all about time management, and in a globalizing economy, Americans’ inability to stay focused and work hard could prove to be a serious problem.<p>Nowhere, sadly, is this clearer than in the marketplace.</i>",1261530973.0

Use Werkzeug or something. You are completely right that there are costs and benefits on both sides.<p>However, I think something is missing from the discussion: You don’t have to go all or nothing with any of the components you choose to use.<p>We use SQLAlchemy, Django’s ORM, and an in house CouchDB library at WWU Housing. We can still use django pluggable applications, we have the power of SQLAlchemy for mapping objects to the atrocious tables in Banner, and we have the flexibility of a schema free document database with CouchDB.

One that is not bigoted at all, and applies equally well to a subset of north american students.<p>Some cultures, India, China, perhaps others, currently place  immense value on education. This brings with it immense pressure. While that can lead to a good work ethic, perhaps the immense pressure can also lead to a higher likelihood of cheating. It's not that these students underestimate the risk of getting caught, but more that they may be <i>more</i> afraid of the reaction of their family or peers back home if they fail.<p>Getting good grades is not exclusively a result of hard work. Often it can be genuinely challenging. For some international students, failing can mean a loss of scholar ship and thus having to leave back home. For students in China, for example, this may mean a loss of freedom, and certainly a big loss of social rank back home.<p>North American students studying here may occasionally have a lot of pressure from home, but they never risk being denied citizenship, or being relegated to low paying jobs for the rest of their life with no chance of improving.<p>In some graduate programs, this fact is occasionally taken advantage of by unethical professors, who can get away with treating their international students poorly.",1261530360.0

The people who work for those organizations tend to continue to represent the platform on which the organization was founded, regardless of whether or not the objectives were achieved. All three of those organizations are great examples: NOW was founded to bring equality to women, the AMA was originally formed to ensure adequate licensure restrictions to drive out quacks, and the UAW was founded to ensure adequate protections for workers.<p>Now women are essentially more than equal and men are requiring help. Now the supply of American medical training is so restrictive that we have created a whole work-around degree program (the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine), and we consume a disproportionate number of foreign medical graduates, draining other countries of their doctors. American auto workers are now so more than equal that the corporations are bankrupt under the burden of medical bills accumulated by retirees.<p>NOW is still advocating for more special consideration for women, the AMA is still concerned about the quality of american doctors (raling against foreign medical grads, etc), and UAW is still advocating for better compensation for auto workers.<p>The lobbies exist to support their platforms. They will continue their original platforms because those people want to keep their jobs.",1261530205.0

For instance he raises the issue of licensing people to practice computer science.  However as he acknowledges that it is difficult to even identify who should be in charge of deciding what should be <i>tested</i> for such a license.<p>And that is a big issue.  A license created to meet the needs of business 40 years ago would certainly have required learning COBOL.  A license created 20 years ago would have no relevance to web development.  One created today would likely be geared towards the needs of large organizations with large code bases - which would put most agile development techniques, languages, and practices off the table.<p>For better or worse the programming world has diverse communities with rapidly changing, diverse needs, and no possible solution has any hope of fitting all of them.",1261530025.0
