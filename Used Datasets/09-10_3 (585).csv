25,3006978,comment,3005831.0,3006890.0,3,0,jodoherty,,,"How do you see it as a form of hinting unless we have different definitions of what hinting is?<p>As I would define it, hinting is the modification of the appearance of the font at smaller sizes, usually away from the actual outline design of the font and the original spacing, in order to make it fit into pixel boundaries for the purpose of clarity and readability. Used with subpixel rendering, you can get sharp, punchy text that is even more readable, but I wouldn't consider subpixel rendering by itself to be hinting.<p>If anything, unhinted subpixel rendering (where any auto-hinting has been disabled and all font hints are ignored) allows the font to look more like the intended outline design in spite of being rendered at a small size on a low resolution screen by boosting the horizontal resolution and interpolating the values between points where the outline crosses partial pixel boundaries. That is, it allows all the glyph metrics to remain intact at smaller sizes while improving readability, whereas the very notion of hinting implies that those properties have been intentionally modified for the purpose of readability.",1316224130.0

Let the user provide some kind of identifying token, say an email address or Facebook ID token, and a pledge amount. Tie it to whatever client data is offered (e.g ip address or cookie). At some later date authentication and collection takes place. A database in a cloud somewhere tracks all these pledges, their IDs, and when and if they get authenticated and paid. The exact mechanism is left as an exercise to the entrepreneur.<p>The key would be complete revocability. This would be necessary due to the ease with which imposters could, for example, put your email address in a form or spoof an ip address.

An idea that popped into my mind was a blog of some sort, but looking back that's not a very good solution. For  problem 5, I felt as if though having a onepagerapp.com for those professionals would make sense. To me, teaching kids to code in school isn't really a niche market. Not every school would recognize the value of having students well-versed with programming/computer science, but I feel like having this course as a way to incorporate web development into the curriculum without having to hire too many teachers makes sense.

But a thought and something that school districts should test and maybe address. There is ratemyteachers.com which does this to an extent.<p>Problem 2, (Motivate students with motivational material): Don't really understand this one? I'm sure there's lots of blogs out there with tips for students to stay motivated and lots of tips from teachers about this.<p>Problem 3, (Students can't code): I'd love for every student (including me) to have had the opportunity to learn to code in school. It may be too much of a niche, I don't know but I do know that at least HTML is taught in the UK. Which isn't much of a start. Not sure how a startup could fit into this equation. Maybe a campaign to push this.<p>Also I don't think most students have the $100 to spend on such courses. At least the students I know. But you're right, more startups like Codecademy should help people learn to code.<p>Problem 4, Twitter Analytics: Only Twitter could much of what you talk about (where people find you), I suppose Bit.ly already do this to an extent if you use Bit.ly. There's also Crowdboost an awesome YC startup which does a load of Twitter analytics.<p>Problem 5, Website creation with Google Integration: You could do all of this with tools from Google in Google sites. Although you're right that having a well designed site is important. I guess things like ThemeForest or hiring a freelancer (can be expensive) help. Even using Wordpress which is pretty flexible for those on a budget.",1316221769.0
