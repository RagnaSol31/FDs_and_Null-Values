With complete transparency, I would be fully behind this idea.<p>However, the suggestions of subsidies that some news organizations are beginning to float really boil down to ""we're losing money in todays market, and we don't like it."". Aside from keeping their profit margins, it would be business as usual.",1279072759

A portion of people take time off to restore an old car, teach themselves art, music, woodworking, go back to school for something unrelated, build a house by hand and a multitude of other things, but eventual a good portion finally return to some form of work. Sometimes a new interest turns into a business venture or an interesting idea peeks their interest and they build a business around it, but if you are young chances are you will return to work at some point. To me this is the greatest advantage of FU money, it gives you the time to recharge your battery and really contribute something to a project instead of just slinging code to ensure that you family is fed. It allows you work to have a greater purpose, if not to society in general then at least to yourself.",1279072669

Getting ZFS to work with the bootloader is kind of a pain (should be fixed in FreeBSD-9, I'm hoping) but otherwise I was blown away by just how intuitive ZFS is to use and how ridiculously powerful. ZFS was introduced in 2005(!) and I'm <i>still</i> amazed by how far ahead of the pack it is. It's really a damn shame that we can't get ZFS into the Linux kernel because of licensing.",1279072533

41,1513301,comment,1512321.0,1512321.0,0,0,nostrademons,,,"OKCupid's usually pretty good about data, but they blew it on a couple of these.  For example:<p>Their method of controlling for income only takes into account zip code.  There's another obvious source of bias: the fact that these people are on an online dating site probably indicates that they are time-poor, have decent computer skills, and are in professions that value introverts.  Many of these jobs are in high-paying fields, eg. software.  People who work 9-5 in blue collar jobs often go out to bars to pick up women instead.  It's no big surprise that the average OKCupid user makes more money than the average person in general.<p>Side note: there're a couple interesting things in the raw data for income.  One is the big dip in response rates for 23-24 year olds that say they make $100K+.  The other is the same dip in response rates for 29 year olds.  I wonder if those are people <i>assuming</i> that the other person is lying.<p>The bisexual angle is also easily explained by looking at the profiles of the people you're aggregating.  Many girls say, as the top line of their profile ""NO MEN!  I'm married, but looking for a bi or lesbian girl to have fun with on the side.""  They are bisexual, but they found the partner they want for one gender already, and are only looking for someone of the opposite gender.<p>The height stuff was interesting though, particularly since I listed myself as 5'11"" despite thinking that I'm only 5'9"".

Sometimes selling is not the right option. The downside is that you have to maintain your assets, but in my case that is probably less work than it would be to maintain a pile of money.<p>Also, the single stream of revenues is the one associated with one website, in one corporation. I own three of those and quite a large number of websites and have a stake in a few others as well as some investments in reasonably successful startups.<p>On another note, I mentioned my divorce in passing, FYI, I left all the easily liquidated assets (two debt free houses and a bunch of money) with my ex wife (voluntarily) because I think my income potential is higher than hers if it should come to that. Our son lives with her, I figure if it makes his and her life more secure that's the right thing to do. So I already was out of debt and chose to go back in to it out of my own free will in the fairly sure knowledge that it would be a temporary situation.<p>Recently I bought back the half of the company that she got as part of the settlement as well so now the situation has slightly changed from the way it was before and I still need to work out all the implications of the change.",1279070133

Subsidized press will just encourage more conflicts of interest in coverage of politics, will waste taxpayer money, and is unlikely to result in better journalism.<p>About newspapers losing money, I suspect the main reason for this, and the reason nobody mentions is that newspapers and media companies in general borrowed through the nose to buy out other papers to reduce competition. It is the interest payments for all that borrowing that is causing most problems in the top papers.<p>Otherwise a paper that gets large viewer ship online should not have any problems funding news gathering.<p>But nevertheless, it is disturbing to see this in the WSJ.

In fact, if you are not careful, you may end up with your family controlling more of your time than you want.<p>You also go through a bit of an identity crisis.  So much of your identity is tied up in what you do.  All of a sudden when you are at your kids soccer game, casual conversation becomes more awkward as people inevitably ask ""what do you do?"".<p>Put these together and you clearly need to come up with your next purpose because otherwise you will have a heck of a time deciding how to spend your time.<p>In the process of figuring out the planning and investing piece I became a CFP and registered investment advisor (more of a multi-family office).  I have now seen a number of others go through the transition and can offer the following observations for different levels of FU money.<p>< $10 million -- The focus stays mostly on the individual and family with the money supporting their pursuits.<p>$10 - $50 million -- At this level there starts to be a strong pull between wanting to support the family and wanting to create a lasting legacy.  The pull from these two directions can create a lot of stress depending on the person's values and the values of the rest of their family (mainly spouse).<p>$50 million+ -- At this level the legacy becomes the focus.  The responsibility of making that money improve the world becomes paramount.  You don't see someone with this kind of money deciding to become a math teacher.  In this sense, someone with this much money is less free than someone with only $10 million who wont feel as strong an obligation to ensure their money gets put to good use improving the world.",1279069778
