7,3116310,comment,3113263.0,3115923.0,1,0,dpatru,,,"The point of trade is to allow <i>each</i> party to get what they want at less cost than they would be able to get independently. If one party wants to sell, but the other party doesn't want to buy, then trade does not happen. This is not bad thing. In fact, per Micah, it's even idyllic: ""every man sitting under his vine and under his fig tree."" That is, every man having his own food supply so that he is not dependent on someone else.<p>Defining supply to require a corresponding demand makes this explicit. An entrepreneur can't just start producing stuff that nobody wants and then complain that there is no demand for his supply. He's not entitled to force a trade.<p>Examples make this clear. The auto industry has the capacity to produce many more cars than they do. But they will not be heard to complain that people should be forced to buy more cars so that they can produce more. Likewise movie theaters with empty seats are not allowed to force people to buy tickets.<p>By the way, there are industries that partner with government in order to be able to  force trade. The money industry is the biggest one. See G. Edward Griffin's presentation of The Creature from Jekyll Island (<a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6507136891691870450"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6507136891691870450</a>).",1318730294.0

But finding a job is ridiculously more complex and old-school (dependent on who you know, etc.) than finding a restaurant or a vendor for a replacement part. If that friction weren't so high, the market for recruiters would dry up as everyone did it themselves.<p>Now the question to ask is why that friction is so high. It's not a law of nature. It's not because of the perfidy of the government. It sure isn't because job seekers want it increased. But it might just have to do with the interest employers have in maintaining leverage over employees; the same reason job interviews are usually demeaning.",1318730139.0

53,3116264,comment,3114859.0,3115909.0,-1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"""nuh-uh, it's super hard to get funding"".<p>I never suggested any such thing.  But I WAS being critical:  PG's description amounted to saying that VCs want to get on the plane only after it has already left the runway.  Although I didn't say it, I suspect that, then, what PG is saying is not all that close to how VC funding works.  I wasn't being critical about it being ""super hard"" to get funding but just about the apparent contradiction in what PG wrote.<p>The VCs can do what they want.  As Mark Suster has illustrated with some graphs and data, over the past 10 years the VCs have been doing poorly, and about half the partners are 'unemployed' as VCs.<p>So, I can't 'look up' to the VCs as business experts.  They have MBAs; pseudo-great, I've been an MBA prof.  Some VCs have had some startup experience, maybe in 'biz dev'.  Pseudo-great;  I helped start one of the most successful VC funded companies in history.  And as IT experts, I have to look down on nearly all of VCs (although YC is an exception) so far I'd need a Hubble telescope to tell them apart.  I've taught computing in two research universities, published peer-reviewed original research in computer science, mathematical statistics, applied mathematics, and artificial intelligence, and helped ship two commercial products from Yorktown Heights.<p>Any way it goes, I have to build a successful business.  So does every entrepreneur on Main Street who opens a pizza shop, auto body shop, grass mowing service, etc.<p>So, as you wrote, by the time I've built a successful business, say not an ""unproven"" business, I would be able to sell a fraction to a VC.  Okay.  Just why I'd want to do that escapes me.<p>Or, the day before I take a VC check I have a 'proven' business, say, half filling 15 Mbps upload bandwidth with revenue close to $300 K a month and own 100% of it.  The day after I take a VC seed check, I have $100 K -- $500 K more cash in the bank, that is, revenue from 1-2 months, where it took me much longer than 2 months to get the seed check, own none of my company, have to get my fraction of 'my' company back on a four year 'vesting' schedule, and can be fired by the Board at any time.  Bummer.<p>My point is not that it's tough to get VC funding.  Indeed, I MUST build a successful business, VC funding or bootstrapped.  It's plenty clear, from what PG wrote and more, that once I've built a successful business, say, $300 K a month in revenue growing quickly, then I could get a VC check.  And PG is saying that much before then, I can't get a VC check.  Okay.  Thems are the rules.  Good to know the rules.<p>So, what was my point?  Just that the rules as PG wrote them don't make much sense.  I doubt that what he wrote is very close to the truth.<p>As an entrepreneur, I have to evaluate the potential of my business early on.  Nowhere did PG mention that a VC will review that evaluation.  Here he is mostly correct:  One could count with shoes on all the VCs in the country who could evaluate or even direct the evaluation of the crucial, core 'secret sauce' in an IT business plan.<p>People have mentioned a similar point before:  If VCs want to wait until there is significant traction growing quickly, now they risk waiting too long.  That is, it used to be that, to get the traction, the company needed funding to write the software.  Surprise:  At least from Microsoft, once one understands the relevant parts of .NET, essentially all the code for a Web site, indeed, for much of commercial software, is already written, and all that's needed it a little, simple glue to join the .NET code.<p>Next, surprise:  If usage grows, then can call up, say, Tiger Direct, get some parts, and plug together one heck of a 64 bit server for less than $1000.  We're talking what, 4 AMD cores at 3.0 GHz for $100?  A motherboard for $100?  Main memory at $10 per GB?  2 TB hard drives for $100 each?  A high end Antec power supply for $100?  A case for $50?  Some fans for $2 or so each?  What'd I leave out?<p>Next, surprise:  If usage is significant, just $1 CPM will throw off enough cash to buy servers enough to double capacity in less than two weeks.  So, that's exponential growth.  Bandwidth used to be really expensive.  Surprise:  Now where I live $15 Mbps upload with a static IP address costs $65 a month, and CAN use it for a Web site.<p>Fred Wilson has written on his blog that these changes are good for VCs.  Maybe.  And I continue to see the major successes taking VC funding and don't have a good list of successful bootstrapped companies.<p>Still, from what PG wrote, basically I've got to have, say, $300 K a month in revenue, growing quickly, to qualify for a Series A.  But, in my case, that's just me and my team, two of whom have four legs, long tails, and long whiskers, and myself and I and a server at my left knee in my living room.  For the server, I have one in a box in the next room.  I also have an offer of a loan of one with 32 cores and 2 TB of main memory -- that used to be a lot of disk; now it's main memory!  BELEIVE me, a 32 core server could send well over 35 pages a second from my Web site software!  For the Microsoft software, their BizSpark program will let me, or essentially any IT startup, have the copies of Windows Server and SQL Server for free for a while.<p>Again, I'm not complaining that getting a VC check is too hard.  Indeed, again, I need to build a successful business, say, $300 K a month growing quickly by myself.  And, apparently PG would agree that with such a business I could get a VC check.  Okay.  But why then would I want to take a VC check?<p>Net, if I can ramp up to $300 K a month in revenue, I won't need a VC check.  If I can't, I can't get a VC check.  So, either way, there's no VC check.  So, my point is, with PGs description, of what use are the VCs?  Understand now?",1318728627.0

Then the glass is cut by scoring it with carbide cutting wheels and then snapping it over a roller which acts like a fulcrum. Mainline scoring equipment consists of slit cutters which score the ribbon of glass in the direction of the flow and cross-cutters score it across the flow. After scoring the glass, a continuous ribbon of glass comes to the mainline snap-rolls where cross-cutter scores are open.",1318728111.0

82,3116233,comment,3115035.0,3115832.0,23,0,ahoyhere,,,"Lots of people have died from drinking sea water. It's still a Very Bad Idea. Your argument is along the lines of ""They got technical details wrong; salt water is sometimes important; therefore the whole thing is wrong."" But that is like saying the advice to ""Do not handle rattlesnakes"" doesn't apply because some folks get a great deal out of handling rattlesnakes. The fact is, people who don't know what they're doing shouldn't handle rattlesnakes or drink sea water.<p>Now let's talk about oral rehydration salts -- the non-fancy name for the salt water and ""glucose transporters"" you described.<p>The salinity of Oral Rehydration Salts/Solution is nowhere near as high as sea water -- and without the sugar, saltwater doesn't rehydrate. The formula for making it yourself is about 1/2 tsp salt in a liter of water, plus 6 tsp of sugar. That's a lot of sugar to balance out just a little salt: 1:12 ratio.<p>A quick Google suggests that 35g of salt is what one would expect in a liter of sea water (on average). A tsp of salt weighs 5.7 g. Therefore, the concentration of salt in sea water is 6 teaspoons vs 1/2 tsp in ORS, or 12x the concentration of salt.<p>And no sugar.<p>I drink ORS on a regular basis to deal with one of the side effects of chronic fatigue syndrome: an imbalance of hormones in the body which leads to insufficient electrolytes which leads to POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), dizziness, muscle cramps & twitches, brain fog/inability to think straight, and inability to drink adequate water.<p>ORS has been a total life changer for me -- before, doctors just said I was ""too out of shape"" when sitting up/standing led to a doubled heart rate, dizziness, the feeling that ""the bottom dropped out of my head"", near fainting, etc. Because that's a valid explanation when a 27-year-old nearly passes out from standing up. (Not.)<p>Drinking a little salty-sugary solution solves my symptoms in 20 minutes.<p>But I sure as hell wouldn't drink sea water.",1318726813.0
