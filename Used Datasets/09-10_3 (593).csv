At the highschool closest to where I live, teachers are <i>NOT ALLOWED</i> to give a midterm grade lower than 60. The student can literally do nothing and get a 60 on the midterm. Then it only takes like a 75 on the second half of the class to pass. So overall, it's something like 37 percent of the points the student actually has to earn to pass. Even if 100% of kids passed that wouldn't be a sign of the kids doing well. It would be a sign of a stupid system.",1257285557.0

When you have a 1000-mile line through the middle of nowhere, it's probably better to bring the power-plant with the train, instead of having 1000 miles of wire and electrical substations sitting idle most of the time.  (Overhead wires also interfere with tall railcars, like double-stack container trains.)<p>For commuter trains, though, I am not sure why we use diesel.   Lower upfront cost is my guess, which is kind of  a shame.  (The US has big problems with buying proper infrastructure.  Much better to spend $100 million over 10 years and provide mediocre service than to spend $50 million in one year and provide excellent service for 10 years.  Funding anything other than roads is politically unpopular; trains are ""noisy"" and we don't want more of them.  Yeah... some day I will move to Europe or Japan...)",1257284793.0

Since Carol is reading David's posts, Albert can get them from Carol.<p>I've read that one of the issues with amateur web comics is that good ones become popular and the artist suddenly finds himself with bandwith bills to pay. A peer to peer implementation of Outer Circle could cause this problem if an author becomes popular by millions of fans putting him on their direct lists, but I think that the common case is that  a popular author reaches a large audience because he has been picked up by a hundred influention Circlers who are read at two removes by the Outer Circle.

Coming at this as a computer engineer, I'm astounded by the theoretically capabilities of this chip and the opportunities it opens.<p>With any true massively multi-core solution (greater than, shall we say, 16 cores), it's no longer efficient to get more ""bang for the buck"" by simply threading or running multiple processes.<p>Tilera is forcing the developer to truly begin architecturing the software stack at the hardware level. You have a complex ""hive"" of processing units specifically designed to carry out particular highly-complex tasks in addition to a huge array of ""general purpose"" (and I use that term lightly) cores that can be configured to do pretty much whatever you need them to.<p>What's brilliant here is the on-core ""packages"" and what they do. This Tilera really is amazing in that everything is there, and it doesn't <i>look</i> like they're compromising on performance in order to get the kitchen sink in there too.<p>With the Gx, you can basically string together the available specific-purpose processing units with blocks of the general-purpose processing units - each block configured to run a particular task - and sort of chain the commands through. Of course it does require writing special software, but developing for such hardware seems to be quite enjoyable! All it would require to become downright mainstream would be for Tilera to ship with a decent compiler/API that lets developers easily choose what the general-purpose processing units will be doing and string together the blocks in an easy and logical way, and I think they may have a real winner on their hands.<p>One sentence summary: imagine the Tilera Gx as a hardware implementation of just about any software solution of your choice.

Maybe if developers could work long hours without making stupid mistakes that would be true.  But software developers are human and need to limit themselves.  It <i>is</i> possible to do negative work (ie screw stuff up that has to be fixed later) after all.,1257283356.0

Without being a city planner I'm not really qualified to say why, but I have some pet theories:<p>- Seattle's transit sucks. It's one of the worst in any city I've ever lived in. This plus the lack of any natural borders around the city (mountains, large bodies of water, etc) has resulted in massive suburban sprawl, leaving downtown to rot. Unlike most cities, downtown is not a hub nor a destination.<p>- As a result of this, there's very little in the way of commercial development that you would see in most cities. Where you would see the hip shopping district in most cities, bustling with people day and night, downtown Seattle is mainly office buildings, and thus completely deserted at night. There is no such thing as the restaurant/hangout district that I've seen in just about every other city I've been to.<p>- Lack of social programs and policing have resulted in major arterial streets being taken over by aggressive panhandlers and drug dealers/users at night. People stay home as a result - I know many people who admit to staying home at night because of sketchy characters milling about. This adds to the desertedness, which further harms potential commercial development.<p>Seattle as a city is perhaps 30 years behind in its civic development. Even with the new light rail system there is still no effective way for most people to get downtown - the entire city reeks of crime, poverty, and dirtiness. Walking downtown you don't get the impression of a bustling, growing city - you see a city in slow decay, desperately trying to hold onto the image of better times.",1257282005.0
