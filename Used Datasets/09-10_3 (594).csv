To throw away one is to lose an advantage.<p>The point of doing the expansion of (x+1)^8 (to continue the example) is not to get the answer, but to see the patterns building.  You say you can do it easily enough by using Pascal's triangle, but finding that insight alone is worth the time.<p>Just last week I saw someone differentiate x^(1/2) by using a calculator to convert 1/2 to a decimal, putting it at the front, then carefulyl subtracting 1 from it, and getting 0.5 x^(-0.5). Right answer.  Then they did the same for x^(1/3) and got 0.334 x^(-0.667) and got full marks.  Follow the process by rote, and don't think.<p>I know I'm fighting a losing battle, because ""Get the computer to do it"" is too easy.

I'd like to respectfully disagree.<p>Ruby is my primary programming language, but I've also built apps and scripts in Python, C, C++, Objective-C, PHP, and Scala.<p>I'm a firm believer that exposure to a wide variety of programming languages is a great way to experience new constructs, paradigms, and approaches to computer programming, which is why I've spent the past few years branching out.  During this process, I've worked with a few languages built atop the JVM (Scala and JRuby), and thus learned a bit of Java, basic language structure / primitives, and some underpinnings of the JVM.  I believe that making an effort to understand and employ these various platforms has helped me to become a better programmer.<p>It sounds as if you're coming from the perspective of an academic advisor.  This surprises me, as your question is primarily career-focused.  Had Java been forced on me in University, I would have left disappointed by my education and mentally prepared for five years as a junior developer in a cube farm working on obscure, broken internal HR software.  Instead, exposure to this variety of languages, architectures, and concomitant development methodologies has taught me a lot about programming / software engineering, and opened my eyes to careers I might not have imagined otherwise.<p>Circling back to the original question, I can tell you that I live a happy, productive, fulfilling life as a software developer at a great company doing what I love without ""knowing Java.""",1256939222.0

They also care about alienating customers who are told, ""We don't have any free reservations available, but some are available for an extra charge.""  Very likely, if they found out what you were doing, they would put you out of business whether you were hurting them or not, just to prevent their patrons from ever facing that choice.<p>Like I said, the greatest proof that restaurants don't want their patrons paying for reservations is that they don't do it.  They already have what they need:  a way of recording reservations and a maitre d' with knowledge of their business and a triple-digit IQ.  They know there's demand:  many people already try to get a table on a busy night by slipping the maitre d' some cash.  If they wanted in on it, they'd already be in on it, and you'd be stuck trying to convince a restaurant to hand over control of a simple, vital, near-zero-cost part of their business to a third party for no gain.

What I am surprised, is that so many people did not seem to expect it.<p>What people are forgetting is that this system is a closed proprietary system, unlike GMail. \nYes, invites to GMail were scarce, and if I remember correctly even sold for hundreds of dollars on ebay. The difference between GMail and Google Wave (GWave? yes/no? ;) is that when you were invited to gmail, you were invited to use a new ""interface"" of an existing and mature protocol - email. You didn't have to wait to ""show off"" your gmail account to your friends, you simply had to send them an email.<p>Google Wave requires mass adoption of something that is inherently closed (unless they open this protocol to other companies) and so will suffer from a slower adoption rate, and as a consequence, a lower utility rate, even if the invite system ceases to exist at all.<p>To be honest, I'm not sure if this is an issue. Many of my friends who got invites seem to think that Google Wave is going to revolutionize _chat_, but I don't think this was ever the claim. It may yet revolutionize collaboration, but in order to collaborate effectively you don't need to just sit there and wait for people to log on -- start a wave, invite some friends, and watch it evolve.<p>edit: to follow up on my 'non issue' comment. My point is that for Google Wave to be useful, only those who wish to collaborate together will really need to adopt it, not your entire google contact list. If a company signs up their domain for google wave, you can be almost certain that they will make much better use of it than I will with my group of friends on an individual level",1256938071.0

The laws against paying for donor organs are in place because the market for donor organs is <i>worlds different</i> from the market for restaurant seats: You can't open up new sources of donor organs the way you open up a new restaurant [3], and the difference between the best chef and the second-best chef is smaller (in quantity and in kind) than the difference between one kidney and zero kidneys. Nobody dies if they don't get a seat at their favorite restaurant and have to eat at -- gasp! -- the International House of Pancakes down the street.<p>---<p>[1] We don't really have another name for this, do we? I've been burned by this hole in our lexicon before. Me: ""Do you take reservations?"" Restaurant: ""Yes."" Me: ""Can I make a reservation?"" Restaurant: ""No, we don't take them over the phone. We give them out as you arrive.""<p>[2] I can't believe I just wrote that, either.<p>[3] Well, not unless you're Sweeney Todd. In which case you can do both at once!",1256937946.0
