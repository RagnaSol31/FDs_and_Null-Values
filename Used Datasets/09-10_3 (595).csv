An 'image' is a saved dump of this memory.<p>Typically you can start Lisp and just reload the memory from the heap dump (the image) on disk and do some automatic re-initialisations (for example reopen windows, reconnect to files and databases, restart processes, ...). All the code and data will be restored. You are back, where you saved the image before.<p>Imagine you would dump the memory of your JVM to disk and restart it later.<p>The Lisp vendor will provide you with an 'image' that contains the base language, some extensions, graphics, networking, editor, debugger, inspector, gui designer, etc.. You can then write a program, load all the program files, load all the data and configuration files and save an image. When you restart the image later, all your application code and data is back. This can save a lot of time during development.",1263506182.0

5,1053680,comment,1052858.0,1053370.0,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"30% is an understatement. Think of the productivity gain when you go from assembly to C. Now, consider the fact (I do mean <i>fact</i>) that the jump from assembly to C and the jump from C to LISP are comparable.<p>The choice of abstraction <i>do</i> matter. If you use weak ones, your productivity is taking a serious hit: your program will be bigger, more complex, and have more errors (squared).<p>C++ abstractions, for instance, are incredibly weak. Take the function abstraction, which isn't even complete: you have no way to write anonymous functions the way you write literal integers[1]. Higher level concepts, as you call them, aren't more complicated than the ""simple"" ones. Often, they are just less familiar and more consistent.<p>[1]: Anonymous functions should actually be called ""literal functions"":<p><pre><code>    (fun x -> 7 x + 42) -- a literal function\n    357                 -- a literal integer\n    2 + 3               -- expression which yields a integer\n    f . g               -- expression which yields a function\n</code></pre>\nNothing ""high order"" about that.

7,1053678,comment,1052858.0,1052962.0,0,0,chipsy,,,"I am starting to arrive at my own conclusion to language power which is that if you already know the ""$1,000,000 concepts"" embedded in the language, the only things the language itself offers above that are dev environment and ecosystem improvements - better debugging features and tools, more libraries, more solutions to corner case problems, platform deployment options, etc.<p>So features that are mostly implementation-dependent, like incremental development, static type checking, contracts, CPAN/gem/easy_install type code repositories, reference books and mailing list discussions, etc. are the things that give a language value. Exposing powerful key concepts(like common data structures, garbage collection, reflection, macro systems...) directly through the language is also a win but not something impossible to work around.<p>To paraphrase a oft-abused quote, ""every sufficiently complex program contains a Lisp."" But that doesn't mean the conclusion is ""start with Lisp, since you'll end up with one anyway."" It may be that Ruby (for example) has a really cool library you want to use for a core part of your app, so you start writing the code in Ruby, and things are good and you make progress....and once you come across a problem requiring Lisp-type power, just by knowing how the solution would work in Lisp, you can usually devise a worse-is-better 80% solution that is right for your specific application. The final result may not be beautiful or pure, but it lets you do things incrementally without the up-front misgivings of ""it would have saved so much time to start in Ruby...""<p>tl;dr: Learn languages to learn concepts, but build applications in an ""environmentally-friendly"" way. Perceived ""potential power"" is not a good reason to sweat and strain to build apps in your favorite language when you could go over to the current ""industry standard"" and save yourself months of effort.<p>On the other hand, nobody has an omniscient view of all languages and environments, hence people tend to stick with what they know....",1263505985.0

12,1053673,comment,1052858.0,1053053.0,0,0,gchpaco,,,"a) C and C++.  Oh, but they're not modern, you say; balls, I say.  Both standards were revised very recently and C++ is changing quite a bit.<p>b) SLIME and SBCL (to pick freebies) crush any of those under their collective boot.  Eclipse tries real hard but is let down in a number of ways by Java (instability, the fact that the environment is opaque to the user instead of malleable, etc).  LispWorks's GUI is very good, at least as good as Eclipse at the things Eclipse is good at.<p>c) You would be shocked at how bad things are.  GCC, to pick on a weak and somewhat helpless example, tries really hard to optimize C code but is generally content to merely compile C++ code.  XCode with its gcc backend does relatively little real optimization of Objective C, certainly nothing compared to what you expect from a modern JIT in Java.  Not familiar enough with Delphi or MSVS to pick those apart but I doubt it's that much different.<p>d) Ditto.  Eclipse crashes at least once a day for me during heavy use and suffers bizarre and inexplicable errors even more frequently (fun experiment: create a file Foo.java.  Rename it to Bar.java.  Try to create Foo.java again.  The editor cannot be convinced to read the new Foo.java off disk without a restart).  Errors in the native code are not infrequent (I have a bunch of logs here from older Javas where the GC (I think) got confused in the middle of GCing and dumped core), although they seem to be better with Java 6.<p>e) A comp.lang.lisp audience knows about macros and why they're nice.  Other language zealots cannot have their minds made up by a simple reiteration of the benefits of code as data (which I agree are considerable).  The other points are somewhat more relevant inasmuch as they challenge generally accepted but really wrong concepts.<p>And re: memory footprint: be wary of comparing apples to rutabegas.  Remember that every C program benefits from libc and its ancillary stuff; on this here Ubuntu system the system libraries required to bring the system up from a dead stop (not any of this /usr/lib detritus) is already 2.5 MB on disk.  Also remember that the 50 MB program footprint likely includes the runtime compiler system (so you can hot swap code; very useful) which is something like 42 MB for gcc 4.4 alone (again, disk; memory usage is enormous).  I would expect that the amount of code that needs to stay in the CPU cache is equivalent.",1263505818.0

It makes it harder to create client libraries that handle the mundane aspects of communicating with these APIs.<p>Projects like httparty and rest-client do help somewhat, but they end up injecting their opinion of what the ""correct"" way to do REST is.<p>So my question is: has there been any effort to codify REST API best practices into a lightweight REST ""protocol"", such that it would be easy to write generic client libraries, yet still obey the principles of REST?",1263505182.0

63,1053618,comment,1052926.0,1052926.0,0,0,akeefer,,,"I'm not much of a fan of the bloat that SOAP has acquired, but to me the point of something XML-based isn't so much the transport side but instead the API-publishing side.  The point of a WSDL or similar descriptor is to define what's available:  what methods you can call, what types of data they take, and what sorts of data they return.  Generally, you can query the server for the WSDL in addition to actually executing the calls.  To me that's the primary advantage, and the reason why a lot of clients prefer SOAP (or some other XML-RPC approach):  it's because it provides a clear, published API that you can hand off to someone and have them program against, and there are tools for basically every language that can interpret that API.  For statically-typed languages, those tools can also help make sure that your calls are at least syntactically valid, i.e. you're not making calls to methods that don't exist, or passing Strings in for integer parameters, or referencing fields off the result object that aren't there, etc.  That might not seem like a big deal, but when you're calling a totally unfamiliar API, it can help you get up to speed much faster, and when you have clients that rely on that API, it really helps everyone's peace of mind when they can be 100% sure that API isn't changing on them.<p>I'm not aware of an similar, standardized, machine-readable equivalent for REST service documentation, though I'd certainly love to know about it if there is one.",1263503904.0

Bulls are slow when they're not upset, and they were having some fun with one of the bulls, jumping from their horses, onto the bull's back, and back again.  (Probably held on to their saddles, just in case the bull took exception, they could pull themselves back on the horse)<p>Anyway, one of the bulls got tired of it, and gored the horse, spilling intestines out.  Not sure how far they protruded, I wasn't there.  The cowboys stuffed the intestines back into the horse, and used their pocket knives to poke little holes into the horses skin along the edge of the wound, and then pulled hair from the horses tail and threaded it through the holes, holding everything together.<p>My dad being the closest vet, our ranch is where they ended up.

They hit her husband over the head with a bottle and tied him and her up in the living room. After awhile they untied her and made her walk into each room. (She wasn't raped, but apparently the gauged her reactions to each room to figure out if she had hidden anything of value in said room.) Before they left the house that defecated and urinated on the living room carpet.<p>* A friend's parent's owns a hotel - He went to the bank to draw wages for his workers (Most are paid in cash, because they don't have bank accounts.) He was followed from the bank and 2 guys criminals entered his property with 9mm hand guns - He gave them his entire staff's wages.<p>To get a first hand account of some of the things that go on here I would recommend watching a documentary about the South African Special Task Force.
