I think Google is becoming less and less effective as more and more people use the internet and you get name collisions. It becomes harder to tell if the person whose name you googled is the actual person being referenced or not. At one point I knew all the links on the first page of Google were me - now it's about half. The less you use your real name the more that helps as well as the other people who share your name float to the top.,1268776298.0

I'd see tweets or blog posts about interesting design panels and new technologies or startups being announced and talked about in Austin.

I don't doubt that there were some decent panels, but no one seems to have cared about them.<p>Why? It's become a place to party among the twitterati and ""elite"" of the startup and web world.
