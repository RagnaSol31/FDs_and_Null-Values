Unconsciously, he had been trying to create a neat, square field like those common in other parts of the Kanto Plain, but this was not what the terrain called for.

""I tried to to make the water flow where I thought it ought to be. But it didn't work. How could it? Water's water, dirt's dirt. I can't change their nature.

Interesting, but excessively verbose.<p>I'll attempt a summary:<p>Larger (~1500 bytes gross) IPv6 datagrams are currently not being routed correctly over certain networks. The author has deduced that a combination of multiple factors is to blame:<p>- IPv6 fragmentation happens at the source, if a packet attempts to cross a link with an MTU that is too small, an ICMPv6 packet informs the sender.<p>- IPv4 fragmentation typically happens on the way, as necessary. TCP supports an optional IPv6-like source fragmentation mode which isn't widely used as ICMPv4 packets are often filtered by firewalls, etc.<p>- IPv6 coverage isn't perfect yet, so there are IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnels in place in many cases. Tunneling adds size to a packet.<p>- Some tunnels refuse to do IPv4-based fragmentation for performance reasons. Because of the extra bytes, most packets would have to be fragmented. Instead, they use the TCP/IPv4 source fragmentation mode, but the relevant ICMP packets get lost along the way, so the tunnel can't operate correctly. Packets are eaten.<p>I hope I've understood & summarised it correctly. If anyone with more patience or understanding of these things could correct me, that'd be great.",1230585514.0
