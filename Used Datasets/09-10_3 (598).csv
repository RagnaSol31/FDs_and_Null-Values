It's wholly unfunctional. A rotating cube does not make something pretty, it makes it resource-intensive. Wobbly windows are not functional and they serve no purpose.<p>Pretty is something that looks good WHILE having a definitive meaning. The ""genie"" effect, for instance: it shows me exactly where I have to go if I need to restore a window. Or Expose: seeing my windows fly out and reveal themselves. Or stacks in Leopard, giving me one-click access to whatever I want one-click access to.<p>Pretty is trying to do something and realizing you can. It's my being in iTunes, talking to a friend about a song that came on, and realizing I could just drag the song out of iTunes to send a copy to him. That's not an advertised feature of iTunes. It's just something that you can't do in Windows Media Player or Amarok. It's something that made my life a wee bit simpler.<p>Pretty is my searching Help for something, being given a menu item instead of just a result, and having that item highlighted with a spinning arrow to point out the result.<p>Pretty is spring-loaded tabs. It's picking a color and being given a set of crayons as a visual metaphor. It's opening TextEdit for the first time and realizing that it's not just Notepad, it's a fully-featured visual text editor that can produce pretty beautiful results.<p>Pretty is CMD-Space-s-a-enter opening up a web browser, or CMD-Space-s-h-e-space-l-enter opening up a song. Out of the box. Without any fiddling, having an ultrafast system for opening files.<p>When we Mac users talk about pretty, we don't mean the fact that our windows look beautiful, although let's be honest, they do: they're minimal, they look very pretty even though they're gray, and I love how menu options appear as part of the chrome instead of having two distinct dividers apart from content (not to start talking about the lozenge button or the top menu). Pretty is how things just work. It's things making perfect logical sense as you do them. It's about whenever you wonder if you can do X, you find that you CAN do X.<p>Linux is not pretty. It's not it's not it's not. It takes a good screenshot nowadays, and that's more than it used to be able to do. But that doesn't make something pretty. That makes something PRETEND to be pretty. It's what's on the inside that counts, not what's on the outside.<p>I'm not anti-Linux. I ran Ubuntu for a year before I got OS X. I like it more than Windows, when it works, when my audio and graphics don't get messed up (and they ALWAYS do, of course). It is not pretty, though. It's pretty on the surface, pretty before you realize just how incapable it is of doing some things easily. And some Linux users are honest. My friend says that he cares only about if Linux does what he wants at no price. That I can respect. But don't say that your wobbly cubes make your OS pretty. That's like saying Vista is pretty because of Aero.<p>tl;dr: OS X is much, MUCH prettier than Linux. Period.",1222988073

I'm saying there's a better way to handle it than suing your customers.  Simple bans would work.<p>My post also is looking at a correlating problem in terms of ""non-official"" servers if you will.  WoWGlider while in itself ruined the game experience when you were a player vs a player who used it.

Possible, but it's up in the air. More developers? I would doubt it.<p>What Android offers in flexibility, it lacks in simplicity and availability. Most people on the planet don't know that Android exists. They wouldn't recognize it if they saw it. Compare that to the App Store, which got pushed out to every iTunes on the planet, and the iPhone, which is kind of a big deal news-wise. (I remember seeing it on the front page of the local paper. That's big considering it was just a tech announcement.)<p>The iPhone has things to offer developers that Android doesn't. For one thing, it offers slickness: the same slickness that Apple offers with most of its stuff. The ability to easily code apps that feel lickable. It's got the ""high quality"" name behind it. A lot of developers follow things like that. I'm thinking primarily of Instapaper - Marco has said before that he does not look at Android with any sort of eagerness, and that he doesn't think a Google OS is worth it. And I think Instapaper is by far the best and most useful application I've seen.<p>No, the iPhone can't pull off Locale. I disagree with your thinking that Apple WILL implement it. Locale seems nifty, but it's not a gamechanging app or anything. I personally LIKE that my apps can't run in the background. Obviously, other people are going to disagree. But you can't look at this and say ""Oh, look, Android is going to cream Apple,"" because it's not, because the two attract entirely different sorts of developers, and because I think Google and Apple both REALIZE that they aren't directly competing here.",1222986661
