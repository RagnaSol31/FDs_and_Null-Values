To some degree, it offers a way around these limitations. (See Greenspun's Tenth Rule.)<p>Object-oriented programming is popular in big companies, because it suits the way they write software. At big companies, software tends to be written by large (and frequently changing) teams of mediocre programmers. Object-oriented programming imposes a discipline on these programmers that prevents any one of them from doing too much damage. The price is that the resulting code is bloated with protocols and full of duplication. This is not too high a price for big companies, because their software is probably going to be bloated and full of duplication anyway.<p>Object-oriented programming generates a lot of what looks like work. Back in the days of fanfold, there was a type of programmer who would only put five or ten lines of code on a page, preceded by twenty lines of elaborately formatted comments. Object-oriented programming is like crack for these people: it lets you incorporate all this scaffolding right into your source code. Something that a Lisp hacker might handle by pushing a symbol onto a list becomes a whole file of classes and methods.

The difference between $10.7 and $10 million isn't all that worrisome.<p>I don't see much of a reason to worry about that in the YC case.  I'm not worried about them trying to take over the board or block an exit or forcibly change a product strategy.,1253052869.0
