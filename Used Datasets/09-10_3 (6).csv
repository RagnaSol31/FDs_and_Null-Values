I realize, that american culture as a whole is (and has always been) somewhat infantile, but, still let's say, Terminator and Back to the Future were excellent movies. The more country get deindustrialized, the more people move to ""service economy and real estate"" the more they become disconnected from reality, and less you need to entertain their minds.<p>My major concern with Avatar - why in the hell everybody are american in this movie? Does Cameron beleive that USA will still be the ""power"" in 100 years? Or without stripe/stars flags everywhere nobody would watch  the movie?",1268283577

The majority of students don't pay anywhere near full price at expensive private colleges.

I worked hard, got a bunch of outside scholarships, and then landed a TA job my final year which paid for my final year of school. I graduated with around $40k in debt, which I've barely made a dent in two years later, but it's obviously the best money I've ever spent.<p>For one, I met my cofounders there, and started a company that I love working at.

This is a little slower than a direct include() because of the table look up first.<p>This could be causing it to render slow if you use 'require_once' a lot for the processing of your page. In your example, the lookups could cause your page to load slower. Note that if you type in your javascript via HTML no other processing is done as its treated as part of a text block.<p>Now with some context, to speed up the load of the page you should use include() instead of require_once. You must insure that this has only happened once per file during the processing of the request, or it will include that code again. This could cause a class redefinition error or bootstrap code to be run more than once.<p>If keeping track of that stuff gets tricky - its a sign that your PHP program is not structured enough to determine request-flow.

So I took Mechanical Engineering. It is far harder than CS and will certainly give you a challenge. There are complimentary majors (econ, bio, finance, chem E, electrical E, physics, math) you could choose from. Either way you will come out knowing far more math and science that will allow you to do some really cool CS stuff after if thats what you want to do.<p>I minored in CS and so just took some of the more advanced classes, a graduate class on computer graphics, a grad class on computer vision, one on mechatronics, one on Lisp. I don't think I would have been able to learn that stuff as rigorously without a professor. The other courses I would recommend - Operating Systems and Compilers will teach you a LOT. I passed on them but I know people who took them and got a lot out of them.<p>Also about your free time, I know it seems like you are pressed for it right now but college is only 4 years. You wil graduate at 22 and have 43+ years of a career. I work 60-80 hours a week on school stuff and find plenty of time for my own side projects, partying, I was even on a sports team for 3 years. You can do it (you don't sleep much though unlike in the movies where everyone sleeps until 3pm). After graduation I'm going to be working exactly 40, max 50, with a 5 minute commute. Thats it. I'm going to have so much free time to do my side projects that I don't mind missing out on them for the last 4 years when I learned so many other things.",1268281752

Even if you are able to secure loans to cover tuition and all living expenses, this would easily run 100k at a public university.  I'm at a bit of a loss regarding your attitude towards the price of attending college...could you please elaborate?",1268280205

You may also have a couple professors that inspire you in some way.<p>But the other 80% of it is a waste of time.<p>It's like a job; you could learn things on your own much faster but you're forced to go slower because of the way things are set up.<p>If I could advise my 18 year old self, I would probably take a couple part time courses that seem interesting (and attend some extracurricular activities around campus, and go to parties as well) and then spend the rest of my time writing software and reading books on my own.",1268280140

I don't see ""go to definition"" or ""find all references."" Frankly, although cc-mode is fantastic for indentation and stuff, it offers a small fraction of the features of Eclipse or NetBeans.<p>Yes, I've used ctags and I've used etags. They tend to be interesting approximations but are never 100% reliable. They don't do a deep sematic analysis of my program. (For example, they don't understand C macros.) They don't update as I type.<p>The closest I've ever seen has been the ""Semantic Bovinator"" thingy. I have never managed to get it to run, nor has anybody I've seen try.
