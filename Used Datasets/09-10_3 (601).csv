I'd suggest the remedy is to follow something like the NetFlix model of showing choices IN THE EMAIL. Something like, ""pick your card below, or click <i>here</i> for more choices.""<p>And, of course, you're going to want to categorize by style and aesthetic so that your user gets a fairly personalized recommendation. I always buy my cards at a local paper shop because they get brilliant, beautiful small-run cards. I won't buy Halmark. If you suggest it, I'll pass.

I'll try and answer from my perspective. Sorry this post got long: I'm a big fan of editors, and I really think this multiple-cursor thing is one of the most important new things to happen in text-editing recently.<p>I used vim for a solid few months (not that much, I know) and emacs for a while before that. I used both to create macros, but I found one problem: I almost never managed to make the macro work exactly right the first time. This is probably something that gets better with practice, but every time I set out to create a macro, it took some thought into making sure I always remember to start at the beginning of the line, always use searches to find the next piece, etc.<p>None of this is a reason not to use macros: they still save time when dealing with a lot of text. But this overhead, both the debugging overhead and the ""mental"" overhead of thinking all these details through, definitely stopped me from using them for macros I'd only use once.<p>On the other hand, in Sublime, let's say I have two similar ""if""s. I select the first ""if"", hit ""ctrl+d"" and it selects the second ""if"", and then I can just start editing. I move the cursor down, move it to the place I want to edit, edit away, all the while not having to think explicitly about this, since I can <i>see everything that happens as it's happening</i>. This is just much more intuitive, and not just for me: other programmers who don't have the same ""love of editors"" I have watch me do this, and actually <i>ask how to do it too</i>. These are people who wouldn't ever think of using a macro.<p>I hope that explains why I much prefer it. I really think this is the biggest ""revolution"" in text editing that's happened in the last few years, and I <i>really</i> recommend you at least try it a bit. I promise I'll blog about this on www.loopycode.com sometime soon, with actual screencasts and some better examples.",1282516801

(under the assumption that svg/canvas is one way. like only draw and not refer to the elements and edit props)<p>Not sure about svg, but you're right that canvas doesn't support that sort of thing natively. It's one of the main things canvas-based game engines encapsulate, though. While the canvas loses all your higher-level object information once you write it (it's just a bunch of pixels), the engines keep track of object locations separately, and then map clicks on canvas (x,y) coordinates to the objects that were clicked on, which can then trigger a callback (sometimes with some additional features supported beyond the direct click-to-object mapping).",1282516528

37,1625411,comment,1625257.0,1625257.0,0,0,Ixiaus,,,"Meditation (lucubration, introspection, ""going into the silence"", reverie, etc...) is a highly subjective and personal experience - the primary goal of which is to reach an expanded or better aligned state of being. Some will argue that you can meditate on many topics that aren't related to the Self, like, meditating on the meaning of the word ""ease"" or focusing on the void - I argue that because you are deliberately focusing your mind you are focusing the Self (no matter what the topic), so no matter what you choose to focus on you are focusing Self and the act of deliberate focus is the endogenous inspiration that evolves the being as a whole.<p>I generally meditate on something pleasing, or of good report; things that make me feel good, no matter what they are. Sometimes I'll do a no-mind meditation (focus on the void) and sometimes I'll do a psychic meditation in which I focus on the energy centers and ""consoles"" of my body (and mind) and fine-tune or tweak them.<p>I try to meditate everyday, sometimes I get too wrapped up in what I'm doing though and have to sit in silence or go on a nice walk for a few minutes to make up for it. Benefits have been many things. Clarity on personal issues, increased happiness, apperceptive awareness, sensitivity to what makes me feel good and what makes me feel bad (most people don't realize how critical this sensitivity is, if a thought doesn't feel good, it is not serving you). I attribute much of my personal success, character, intelligence, and awareness to my path through self-reflection, introspection, and meditation; it's an ongoing journey too.<p>My day, after meditating, is more productive and things just ""go well"" for me; my body and mind feel healthier and more vibrant than when I don't and my self-esteem seems to drop too when I don't meditate consistently (which hasn't been for a long time).<p>There are no energy requirements, if you do it right, you should feel an increase in energy, vitality, happiness, and clarity. Is it worth the time? Meditation comes first before physical sustenance for me - it is that important.<p>If you do try meditation, realize that it takes about a week of consistent practice before you start to fall into synch with yourself on it. The first few times you will sit there with your mind racing and your body antsy; after about a week it gets easier and you will feel relaxed through the whole thing. When starting out just stick with ten minutes per session, as you get further along, you will begin to feel an urge to stay in meditation each session even though the ten minutes is up - when you feel this urge stay in meditation until you feel the urge to come out of it. I generally do my meditations that way now, some will last two hours and some will only last ten minutes.<p>Also, there is no need to do it with your legs crossed, just sit in a comfy chair that supports your spine in as much of a vertical line as possible with no socks on and your feet firmly planted on the floor and with your hands resting on your thighs facing toward the sky. Meditation is best earliest in the morning when light is breaking, the energy is ""newest born"" in the morning, it is the freshest it will be (there's also no one awake early so it is less disturbing!).",1282516384

It ignores the solutions that exist and work in favor of new solutions that exclusively use Microsoft build tools and create more work for cross platform developers.<p>I must still be missing something because it looks like I'll have to maintain another configuration for coapp while still supporting gnu make (including mingwXX-make for other windows developers). Is there any reason that they are ignoring gnu tools? It's almost like they don't want to make the easy decision to just bring gnu to windows. You know... ./configure & make & make install. Windows users could just use bash.<p>The project style looks like classic Microsoft. I guess that bothers me because he claims independence. XML all over the place. New syntax and new ways of doing things that already work in * nix. A lot of magic and little explanation of the limits that will be placed on these builds.<p>I support a build system that works on windows. I just don't support some rigid new build system that kicks out pre-built microsoft binaries and requires me to maintain additional build configurations as a cross platform developer. Especially if that means I have to use a completely different development tool chain.<p>Ideally if I could maintain and update my *nix gnu tools and python using coapp I would use it. But I'm uncomfortable with a build system that isn't flexible. I've run into enough problems building on windows. I don't need another complication to add to the process.,1282516017
