The way it was solved was to keep a copy of every DLL ever released on your system--I don't exactly call that solved; it's more like treating a cold with medicine that stops you from coughing (you're no longer coughing, but you're still sick). You can't really expect to use that solution for all possible situations.<p>It's absolutely unacceptable to keep around support for every version of HTML and JavaScript and CSS ever, especially when some of the versions are contradictory. The real solution is to make a clean break, learn from your mistakes, and do it better the second time around. Unfortunately, that means losing a lot of content if you can't automatically update it to new formats.<p>As for being a solved problem on one specific and unchanging platform, that's like saying networking is a solved problem so long as you stick to TCP/IPv4 and never have more nodes than you can have addresses. That's not a solution, it's a cop-out. Requirements change, specifications change, and most certainly, performance characteristics change.<p>As for being a solved problem on windows, the solution is just as bad as the problem--the difference is where the pain point lies. On my w7x64 machine, the windows folder takes up somewhere around 15gb of space (I don't have it handy to check the exact amount). That is absolutely unacceptable for an OS <i>without</i> any applications installed.<p>As for being a ""monthly"" issue for browsers, how frequently do you think it was an issue for major OS vendors until the specifications were finally more-or-less set in stone? Because I assure you, it did not happen overnight.",1329865145.0

7,3618401,comment,3616529.0,3618121.0,2,0,peterwwillis,,,"Assuming that it'd perform that way in the real world, you are right that my solution would have no significant performance increase over the sscanf you use. But I don't totally agree with some of your supporting arguments.<p>The wire protocol you're talking about is a heartbeat protocol. This doesn't need to be human-readable because there is no input from a human, nor is it intended for a human to read. Debugging it would be as complicated as a ""printf"". Oh the horror. We wouldn't want to add debugging to our application - better make people read the raw data with a packet sniffer (which you can't run unless you have root, so good luck getting your application debugged quickly, developers).<p>Adding an extra argument would require appending an extra field and incrementing the version. Oh noes the mess! Since both solutions are versioned, forward compatibility is just updating code in the server, and if you're going to change things you have to update code anyway, so this doesn't sound like a good reason to oppose it.<p>Realistically, will more than a handful of shops have a big enough cluster for any of this to matter? No. But even your example of using sscanf is faster than Apache's code (<a href=""http://pastie.org/3430085"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastie.org/3430085</a>) while being 100% compatible with the rest of the code, and still goes to show that doing it right the first time is better than just slapping something together and waiting until you have to optimize.<p>So do we <i>need</i> to use an unreadable, simpler solution? No. But it would work just as well as anything else and take just as much time to write - if not less.",1329864926.0

What Flickr is really missing in 2012 are more advanced community features: Its user base is brimming with talented photographers, but the dusty old pool system doesn't encourage the kind of individual curatorial approach that has propelled the likes of Tumblr, Pinterest, and Instagram to their present heights.<p>Pools are big buckets that anyone can throw a photo into. They can be moderated, but rarely are, and so tend to be a broad cross-section of a theme rather than a gallery of excellence. I rarely use them; most of my viewing on Flickr is browsing the photostreams of contacts I've added because I like their tastes.<p>Flickr could actually go a long way toward fixing this with a fairly simple addition: Give me a feed of favorites by my contacts. Flickr has individual curation; it's just hidden in dark corners of the UI.",1329864731.0

Big stories stay in the top 5 for 20+ hours.<p>Here's what I do: If I only have time to look at 5 stories per day, I visit once per day at any point in time and look at the first 5 stories. If I have time to look at 20, look at the first 20.<p>Set yourself a timeout, start reading at the top, stop when the time is up, repeat after 12 or 24 hours. Works very well for me, I get the best stories, and feel pretty well informed.",1329861942.0
