Decide you don't like a file and move it out of your main folder, or have to rerip an album for a reason? You now have to manually move the old files out from iTunes, one by one. I might be able to do better if I let iTunes manage my library, but given how much I prefer other software for playing off the PC rather than the iPod, that wasn't something I was prepared to do and it should be able to handle it better than this.\n* Very basic duplicate files finding, which interacts with the above. Does such a simplistic match that it grabs huge numbers of false positives, making it unneccessarily difficult to find where you've actually got duplicates. You then can't see what the file path is or sort by the missing file marker so it's a real pain to remove the old version and leave behind only the new. Back to removing them one by one.\n* I've no idea what it's doing, but it multiplies artists and albums all over the place. Other music library programs I've used were bright enough to tell that BEATLES, Beatles and The Beatles were all the same band. ITunes isn't, including giving some multiples that appear identical in the interface. It periodically does the same with albums too, making album playlists vastly less useful because rather than one seven track album you have seven, identically named, one-track albums with ascending track numbers.\n* Play me my top rated songs within a genre. Can't do. Show me my top rated songs by a particular band or even within an individual album. Can't do. \n* Podcasts resume part-way through if you jumped out into another part of the software; 'Songs' don't - why? That's annoying with some long classical or prog track, doubly so with a podcast I simply decided not to manage with ITunes (because, frankly, I didn't find its podcast software any better than the rest of it).<p>I could go on... It's one of the worst music managers / MP3 players I've used.<p>ITunes is pretty and relatively easy to use (for simple tasks - anything out of the ordinary is a real pain IMHO) but that's as far as I'd go in its praise. For me they've created an MP3 player which is designed to handle tens of thousands of songs but lumbered it with the software to do a few hundred and left it. That's not good enough. It might have been barely adequate in 2001 (I'm not convinced frankly) but it's an embarrassment by now.",1293146967.0

No one is recording, so there is no fixation.<p>2. Someone else hears your poem, goes home, and writes it down from memory. That's not fixation, since 17 USC 101 defines one of the elements of fixation as being by or under the authority of the author. So, the work is still not fixed, so copyright has not yet attached.<p>3. That person starts making and selling copies of your poem.<p>4. You finally write down your poem. It's now fixed, and copyright attaches.<p>I would presume that you can now stop that other person, via copyright law, from making any more copies.

The 'placebo' was cellulose (dietary fibre) in a gelatine capsule, and apparently fibre is the standard treatment for irritable bowel syndrome.<p>Thirdly, showing that open label placebos might be better than controls is not enough to justify using an open label placebo in a clinical; instead, they would need to have compared an open to a closed label placebo. If a closed label placebo works better than an open label one, then a drug which is not efficacious could be accepted by a clinical trial because it was an unintentional closed label placebo and did better than the intentional open label placebo. In addition, closed label placebos are not just for the patient - they also play a role in double blind clinical trials of keeping the doctors dealing with the patient / assessing results from knowing.",1293146338.0
