People certainly spend more on housing, but they also get more.  Houses are bigger now, and have more amenities; for example, in 1960, about 80% of houses had flush toilets, today close to 100% do. I really doubt that health care <i>available in 1960</i> is that much more expensive, though you can certainly spend a lot on medical treatments that didn't exist back then.<p>Elizabeth Warren's book, ""The Two Income Trap"" compares a median family of 1970 to one of 2000.
