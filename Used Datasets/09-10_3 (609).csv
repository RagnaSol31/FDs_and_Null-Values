Nokia is already a major player, they won't let Apple take the market easily and cheaply. They'll do marketing, new phones and crazy things to preserve their position.<p>That said, as competition is getting though, Apple has got to spend more on marketing and improving their products (taking down their profit, even if their sales are up, because they are spending more).

There is some structure to the current trend, and it seems worthwhile to try to explain it (though the OP fails, IMO).<p>Now, that doesn't mean that the threshold for human embarrassment has been static since before the industrial revolution; looking at history, it has certainly varied dramatically across time and space.  It's probably not random, so tracing it's cause would be interesting.<p>Further, I don't think many people are going to go to the extreme relativist standpoint and say that all thresholds for embarrassment are equally (un-)valuable.  It's not hard to make arguments for why it's a good thing people are too embarrassed to have sex in public (though I'm sure there are a few extreme bullet-biters).

Under the hood, it's a similar cloud approach, but more economical for those with volumes or steady encoding work.  Customers--or their end users--can upload at any rate (volumes of upload sessions at once through gateways located around the country for low latency), or ship drives. The queues process at a steady predictable rate, delivering content directly to the network.<p>In the course of processing countless libraries for clients, we've found they tend to have such unique ideas about the end result that a ""one size fits all"" web service often doesn't meet their needs out of the box.<p>So, we also offer Windows Media (WMV), Silverlight (VC-1), Ogg Theora, and cross-player H.264 encoding, adaptive bitrate encoding for Apple devices, iPhone video rotation, automatic thumbnails, web postbacks so you don't have to poll, incoming files of up to 4.7GB in size, and arbitrarily complex encoding requirements.<p>To your point about images + sound, for example, some clients supply metadata as XML, and using the metadata we generate pre-roll and post-roll video footage that stitches onto the transcoded video.<p>(We also have a consumer service that bundles both encoding and storage into a single ""per minute"" price.

There is no need to introduce an expensive new technology stack for an already solved problem.<p>On efficiency, heh.  Hundreds of thousands of items had been given arbitrary tags (on average over a dozen per item, and the same tag could be given repeatedly), and the question was to identify for each item the other items which were ""most closely related"" based on shared tags.<p>The fundamental problem with doing this in any kind of a database is that the fastest access path for a given fact is a lookup in an index.  Which means a binary search through a data structure to find out the page and row number the data was on, followed by parsing that page in memory to locate the row, and extract the wanted information from that row.  This is absolutely the fastest form of lookup available.<p>The equivalent operation in C++ is access an array by index and pull an element out of a struct.

A narrow class of cases come before the federal courts that deal with straight state law issues, and they are decided in federal court only because there is a diversity of citizenship between the parties (i.e., the parties are citizens of different states).
