I'm not sure what was used for their latest work, Invaders Must Die, but it's likely similar software given their live setups for the last few years have been powered by several Macbook Pro's (along with other equipment).<p>Truly a master at his craft though.  Here's a hacker who started making professional electronic music mostly the old way in the early 1990's, and has successfully transitioned into the digital age.  If you've listened to Prodigy long enough, you end up coming across music they sampled in the most unlikely of places.  It's like an endless easter egg hunt.  I can't even begin to imagine how dynamic Liam's record library is.<p>BTW, if you've never seen them live before, you don't know what you're missing.  Seen them three times already and they easily outshine NIN, Manson, and Rob Zombie in terms of live energy.  The type of crowd they attract is energetic and intense.

Like I said, I'm not an expert but rave culture arguably got going in 89 with the rising popularity of house and then techno (this still sounds fresh from 89 <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6musPMSe24Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6musPMSe24Q</a>)<p>Around 90 and 91 it moved to a focus on more hardcore techno and breakbeat.

Prodigy were part of a much wider scene but had the talent and music to go mainstream.<p>Apologies to anyone if I've got this wrong.

I didn't realize you could do one-line method definitions, and that the whitespace only kicks in when you write a multi-line block.<p>Here's a question for you. In Python, if you have a couple of nested lambdas with multiline bodies, getting passed into each other as arguments, do you have to write the closing parenthesis on the correctly-indented line on the other side, or can it be tucked against the inner lambda?<p>In a hypothetical significant-whitespace CoffeeScript, I'm thinking of this:<p><pre><code>    elements.each(el =>\n      el.click(event =>\n        el.show()))\n</code></pre>\nVersus this:<p><pre><code>    elements.each(el =>\n      el.click(event =>\n        el.show()\n      )\n    )\n</code></pre>\nIs the second form required to make Python-style whitespace work?",1261687694.0

It seems to me the best thing you can do is allow yourself to be drawn further down that path.<p>What you wrote strikes a chord with me. I grew up frequently being told how smart I was. Since this was most of the positive feedback I received, my concept of myself was heavily biased that way. But life intervened and I was forced to change. Among the conclusions I drew is that knowledge is no basis for identity.<p>For me the shift came from seeing that the cognitive intellect is not as important as it thinks it is. (I love Emo Phillips' line, ""I used to think that the brain was the most wonderful organ in my body. Then I realized who was telling me this."") It wants to live in a world where it's at the center, figuring things out and making decisions, but this is largely a fiction. In recent years there have been a host of experimental results demonstrating this, but wise people have said it forever and I think many people feel it instinctively. To those of us who have grown up identifying most with the cognitive mind, this is a challenge.<p>The reason relationships suffer if you place too high an emphasis on being smart is that you're paying attention to only one channel and are closed to other ones (emotion, intuition, etc.) that have a greater role to play. You can easily be ""right"" in everything you say and do, yet end up in a colossally wrong and pathetic position, unable to understand why people react to you the way they do. Meanwhile those other people are wondering how you could be so oblivious.<p>The issue here is not how smart one is, but rather the <i>need</i> to be smart, which is ultimately the need to be <i>seen</i> as being smart. That is not a cognitive need, but an ego defense. It gives you something to be; it tells you who you are; it assigns you (the smart one) a high status. But it's grounded in fear: if I'm not smart, what am I? who am I? what value do I have? (The fear being, I'm nothing, I'm worthless.) This is a weak position to live from. Maybe you can get by, but reality has a way of contradicting it, such as when other people don't conform to the script.<p>The best way out of this that I've found is simply to learn to be ok with not knowing. When you switch your default position from ""I know"" to ""I don't know"", a lot of things follow. It's a tradeoff: you don't get to feel particularly smart or special any more, but in exchange, a lot of the hitherto frustrating and impenetrable aspects of life start to go better. Basically, you stop optimizing for a local maximum and get pulled into the main current.<p>Edit: it's good for creativity too, because you stop fighting for <i>your</i> ideas and become open to more and better possibilities.",1261686968.0

61,1014321,comment,1013627.0,1014300.0,0,0,TriinT,,,"I strongly disagree. This has <i>very</i> little to do with Excel Solver. This seems to be Microsoft's take at large-scale, real-world optimization problems, possibly with millions of variables and constraints. Can you do that with Excel? I doubt it. This <i>Solver Foundation</i> framework can do Constraint Programming, Quadratic Programming, and Mixed-Integer Programming. This is serious optimization, not the kiddie stuff Excel users deal with. SF seems to be based on commercial C++ solvers such as MOSEK.<p>I would say that open-source is not of great interest in optimization software. The idea is to write as little code as possible, and to trust that everything performance-critical has been optimized. Even speed is not the main issue for me. I want something that is flexible. I want to write little code because the less I write the less bugs there are. Correctness trumps everything else.<p>If I am using SF to allocate investments, I want to make sure an optimal solution is found, even if it takes a little longer. Computer time is cheap. Buy a bigger computer. Developer time is more precious. There are only 24 hours in a day.<p>You want to change the source code? With all due respect, but I would speculate that 99,9999% of HN users are not qualified to write numerical optimization code. Looking at it is of little use unless you have a PhD in Applied Math and years and years of experience.<p>Of limited use to HN readers? To those writing web-apps, perhaps. Those doing Machine Learning will probably be ecstatic to find this.",1261685617.0

Continue moving one coin at a time while asking if you have completed the task.  You will have to move at most eighty coins after the initial ten.

Indeed, the savings accelerate <i>more quickly</i> over the long run—CBO calculates² that reform will save on the order of a trillion dollars in its second ten years.”<p>Chait also notes that the bill contains a number of experiments in cost control which the CBO does <i>not</i> credit with any savings in its budget estimates, because we don’t really know yet how effective those experiments will be.<p>¹ <a href=""http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/just-noise?page=0,2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/just-noise?page=0,2</a>\n² [link currently broken] <a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10868/12-19-Reid_Letter_Managers.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10868/12-19-Reid_Letter_...</a>",1261685399.0
