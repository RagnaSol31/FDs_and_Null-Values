For example: 6502 Assembly -> C -> Java -> Python. Each step is exactly about that: Letting you focus on the interesting parts, and thus produce more value with less human effort. This <i>is</i> automation, we just call it abstraction or whatever. We didn't see a drop in the job market as result, since the demand for software had been rising even faster. The question is whether this will remain the case.",1247252330.0

Advertisers would (and already do) pay through the nose for that.  I think ad revenue is generally an awful money source for a web app, but Facebook is big and addictive enough to command some crazy rates.<p>And that makes me scratch my head when they talk about ""building the userbase"" and ""not focusing on revenue yet""  Maybe I'm just short sighted, but I think it's time for FB to start cashing in.  Just like anything else, it's best to launch your revenue model early and iterate, rather than waiting until the timing is perfect.",1247252289.0

You can do ALL the things you need from the middle of Iowa, and still kill it.  Here's what you're NOT given in Iowa?  All the opportunities and resources you COULD have.  By being in Silicon Valley, you have the maximum amount of opportunity and resources to succeed.  Think of it like playing a video game: sure you could win with the basic pistol they give you, but it's probably best to face the game boss with a rocket launcher.<p>The other main question is scaling a company.  If you're doing the typical venture back startup thing, then scaling is a huge issue.  You need access to capital and talent to the point you can grow the company from 3=>30=>300 people.  That's hard to do, especially on the engineering side outside of most startup hotbeds.  If you're in a crappy city for a startup, think right now if you could go recruit 50 of the brightest engineers in the next 18 months there.<p>So in short a) you don't need to be in the valley to succeed, at least in the short term b)  the valley can give you the maximum opportunities c) think about how the current city you're in can help you scale the startup when (or if) it needs to grow heavily, but don't think about it too soon.",1247249886.0

When it's free, you capture a part of the market that most wants anonymity and no recourse for their bad, possibly illegal, behavior.  12-18 year olds exchanging sexually explicit pictures via your service is a problem of epic proportions.  Stopping it could very easily become your full-time job (and the full-time job of a dozen more people).<p>I know you've said you've already halted free distribution.
