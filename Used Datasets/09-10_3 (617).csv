(Even the notion of humans being just ""animals"" is about as young.)  For most of human history, there has been an underlying impulse for humans to distance themselves from each other for periods of time.  (Monasticism, colonization, and rural farming were the majority lifestyles until recently.)  The only reason the contemplative lifestyle is being looked down upon nowadays is that we've simply run out of enough land to give everyone enough room to be so at the same time.  Until we develop some means of overcoming the space distance barrier, we're stuck with each other.",1242673096.0

Fund a company that pays for and uses products from other companies you fund and do this over and over to build up the pyramid of investing.<p>I have to admit that I am not that savvy here, so perhaps that is why it doesn't make sense to me, but my personal anecdotal experience indicates that these types of investments are becoming more and more common and I am highly skeptical of their validity in the marketplace.<p>There is a lot of skepticism about whether or not Twitter can be monetized, so shouldn't there be even more difficulty monetizing a service built entirely on top of a difficult to monetize service?  Are tweets going to have a little embedded ad from twitter and from stocktwits?<p>Plus, the investors are increasing their risk by investing in a company that uses a service that may itself cease to exist.
