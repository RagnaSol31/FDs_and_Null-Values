Nokia was insistent, a few years ago, on showing the world's real webpages on a pocket device -- they were the first to want to do desktop-style browsers and plugins, rather than Flash applications or native UIs on mobile. I didn't believe it could be done, but I did use an N700 when it became available.<p>From what I understand, Nokia adapted an older Adobe Linux codebase to the smaller device, and implemented it as a plugin to their browser. Nokia is currently a major partner in the Open Screen Project, and is poised to take advantage of the mobile optimizations in the upcoming Player 10.1 release.<p>So, oddly, I'd tend to agree with the earlier poster, than we haven't seen fruits of Mobile Flash work recently. But now in Jan10, it's almost showtime.... ;-)",1264964364.0

Software estimation is very hard; I'm no good at it, but when I've been close to the mark, it's been because I broke down the tasks into 1- or 2-day chunks.<p>If I were to work on it, I would start by reading their wireframes and building a mental model -- at a high level, how the app must work. Then, if applicable, I would search for libraries which will save lots of time; the presence of an important library may pull me strongly towards certain languages, platforms, or architectures.<p>Once I had decided on platform and architecture (not in stone), I would start writing out the details of the tech into a document. I would put in all the technical stuff I thought I might need at first, because it's more for me to build my model right now than to give to the client. I'd spend two or three days on this, focusing on identifying the risks. If the risk is huge or easy to research, I would research it at this time and see how to mitigate it. I would also not be shy about calling them up if I think I might have a misunderstanding, as a few minutes on the phone might save hours or days.<p>Anyway, the last step is to distill the document for the audience. At this point I should have all the information to produce a document that includes an estimate, risk analysis and implementation plan.<p>[Edit: I probably sound obnoxious by using ""I would"" everywhere rather than ""you should"".

They are small because they have to be consistent or investors freak out, so the actual earnings aren't distributed anyway. I'd personally rather not have dividends for several reasons:<p>1. the stock price should accurately reflect the earnings of the firm. When a dividend is announced, the price of the stock decreases by the amount of the dividend. If you want some of those earnings, then sell a share. There's no need for the company to issue a dividend. This is a common misconception most people have.<p>2. You're taxed on the dividend payments (exceptions tax deferred retirement accounts). This is annoying, especially if you don't want them now and would rather have them just reinvested. Ignoring taxes, the value to the shareholder is the same regardless of whether dividends are paid or not.<p>My professors in finance all go on long rants against paying dividends, and it really does seem that they're antiquated.  Most newer firms just don't pay dividends, and tech companies just happen to be newer firms usually. It's not necessary a property of just tech companies.",1264963584.0

As an avid reader, I am not sure I want one company to be in control of ""my drug"".<p>Not saying the publishers are necessarily the good guys (probably aren't). But this isn't about loving books, this is about market dominance and control. Not exacty the thing that inspires me to write a love letter to Amazon (though I usually buy from them and I like their service).<p>Ultimately, do we really need Amazon for a proper ebooks distribution? It seems to me in theory every author could put their books on a web site right now, using whatever payment system he likes. The Kindle seems more like a Trojan horse to me - we let it into our lives, and then we can't get rid of it anymore, unless we are willing to let go of the 1000 books we bought, too.<p>I, as a reader, don't want to be held hostage, neither by Amazon nor by book publishers.",1264962095.0

It's what Walmart does. The resulting type of product is generally known as <i>junk</i>.<p>Is it good for consumers? Probably, because low prices are good, and if you don't want junk, you can go elsewhere. If the same thing eventually happens for books, then Amazon will be selling mostly cheap and trashy stuff, while other, more expensive, online bookstores will show up and get exclusive deals with better authors.<p>In such a scenario, Patrick's comment:<p><i>I will buy books from authors willing to sell them to me.  I might get a little depressed over not being able to read my favorites, but if you haven’t noticed, I read a lot faster than you can possibly write and that makes me promiscuous by nature.</i><p>strikes me as wrong.
