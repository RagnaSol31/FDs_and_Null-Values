Not only I live in an area with a lot of microweather (it can be pouring at my house and sunny at work, but both work and home are covered by the same weather station and are 15 miles apart); but also we have vog emissions (think like smog, but with natural causes) whose concentrations are highly variable.

It makes for a pretty popular punching bag, but I don't think it's fair to dismiss it as a non-issue.  The ISPs have to manage oversubscription rates.  It's a real problem.  Total throughput is fixed at various points along the network, and there are going to be times when the demand outstrips the available capacity.<p>So what should the ISPs do?  Time Warner's recent foray into metered billing was obviously moronic.  Customers shouldn't be penalized beyond their monthly payment for usage.  Their plan also didn't do anything to reduce congestion during peak traffic hours.<p>I think the onus should be on the ISP to make sure that they can actually deliver the rates that they are advertising, which are clearly far too high.  The customer shouldn't get screwed just because the ISP can't manage the oversubscription rate that it wishfully dreamt up.<p>In this scenario, advertised rates would have to drop substantially, but it means that the customer, not the big media partner, decides on his own quality of service.<p>This is basically how it has worked for business class circuits for all of eternity.

I am totally fine with making that argument, in a statistical sense. There are plenty of exceptions, but there's a kind of critical mass effect. New York is expensive, so you probably can't live here comfortably unless you're in the top n%, so members of the top n% move here, pushing up prices (and also hanging out with other top n%ers, and coming up with new ways to make money).
