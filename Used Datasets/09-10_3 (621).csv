5,535641,comment,534865.0,535199.0,0,0,jerf,,,"That ""functional programming"" someone was me.<p>And you missed my point entirely about mathematics, I think. ""Fancy math"" here is not calculus or fancy topology or graph theory. ""Fancy math"" here is that you need to <i>build</i> a new fancy math that works with your temporal engine. You can't just sit down and hack shit out, or you will die under the combinatorial explosion of temporal possibilities. You need to build yourself a system of primitives that are time-safe under the temporal transformations you wish to run, and make sure that as you add actions they are also time-safe.<p>Or you will be crushed by the complexity. Standard OO will not help. You don't need ""a functional language"", but you damn well need functional style. You'll end up reinventing it even if you didn't know about it advance, with rigid, explicit control over side effects.<p>If you set out to implement this, you will find the standard Action/Command pattern to be not very helpful. This game has a much richer timeline than the usual Command pattern is designed to handle.<p>""All you have to do is support multiple time-shifted simulations in parallel, and you are mostly there.""<p>No, that will be inadequate. That doesn't get you to backing up to arbitrary points in the timeline, and since the simulations are <i>not</i> independent, you're going to have a hell of a time expressing all the dependencies in standard OO.<p>(Note that you could easily do functional-style OO. No problem. But it's not just standard imperative OO, such as might work with Starcraft. This takes more.)<p>If you don't believe me, try implementing it in a model system.

If you hid the name of the country and just showed them the numbers, there is no doubt what old IMF hands would say: nationalize troubled banks and break them up as necessary.<p>Nationalization would not imply permanent state ownership. The IMF’s advice would be, essentially: scale up the standard Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation process. An FDIC intervention is basically a government-managed bankruptcy procedure for banks. It would allow the government to wipe out bank shareholders, replace failed management, clean up the balance sheets, and then sell the banks back to the private sector.

In my experience, sometimes the camps of 'business' and 'development' find themselves unable to have a conversation <i>on common ground</i>, and that makes the ""passion+curiosity"" test difficult to do. This often exhibits itself through language (one or both uses words the other cant understand), which maybe a symptom of <i>domain protection</i>.<p>My advice to someone who is trying to find someone who has a different skill set to theirs: find a way of talking about your domain in a way that can be understood by a bright lay-person. Then encourage them to do the same with their domain. If they can't / won't do that, then move on. If they can do it, then you can have meaningful conversations in which you can figure whether your goals are aligned, and how you can each help reach those goals.

There is really no evidence that IMF has ever helped anyone.<p>I am less sure about your point that the US not failing for typical reasons. The finance industry has influence policy to excessive degree over the last ten years and the resulting deregulation played a part in the bubble and the collapse. It is hardly the only factor but it was a factor. It's different from Third World cronyism but the article has a point that it might be considered just a variation on theme.<p>So I'd challenge the statement that the US did not fail in a typical fashion. The thing that's A-typical is the US wasn't just rolling out wasteful production and unjustified debt but that it has been driving the world's economy over the last twenty years while doing this.<p>I'd agree that IMF doesn't have any track record of helping countries - it's just a bureaucracy which has more or less required belt tightening thus forcing countries to become export oriented.<p>The ironic thing is that as many nations have belt-tightened and become export oriented over the last twenty years, they came to rely on the debt-rolling US to buy their products. So the final failure of the US bubble may result in world where no one drives demand, where ""beggar thy neighbor"" through competative devalue is the only tool left to the exporting nations which every nation will be forced to be.<p>Neither the IMF nor the free market would be able to get us out of that one.",1238182104.0

Games almost always present an interface to an underlying system. Many games have an underlying system that is not particularly simple or intuitive and take significant effort to learn. And, because unlike tools, they do not offer to assist the user in doing something that she already knows she wants to do, we often provide many more incentives along the way, as struggling with a system is often not amusing, and amusement is usually the goal.<p>This is all to say that the UI is very important, but to consider games as <i>chiefly</i> UI is to fundamentally misunderstand what games are and how we interact with them.",1238180617.0
