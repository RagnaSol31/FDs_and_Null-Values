(I'm using the LocalServer API for the application I'm writing at work.)<p>LocalServer saves a set of static files (e.g. HTML, JavaScript, CSS, images) from the web.  When the browser requests those files later, they will be served from the LocalServer disk cache instead of the remote server.  So the pages will load faster and can be available offline (if the pages are designed to run without accessing any other network resources).  It's like a browser cache on steroids.  For an example application, see the latest version of WordPress, which has an option to load the admin UI into a LocalServer cache.<p>LocalServer lets you serve requests from disk to browser on a single computer, while Unite lets you serve requests from one computer to another over the internet.  LocalServer is useful for offline work, while Unite is useful for communicating on a network.<p>If you used Unite for a single-user application (where the client and server are all on one machine) then it might provide some of the functionality of Gears LocalServer.  But I suspect that the use of a central proxy server in Unite would eliminate both the performance benefits and offline features for this scenario.",1245182302

I don't know why that is. It could be explained by the natural tendency for the body to return to equilibrium, it could be that they just found a placebo they could believe in, but the bottom line is that they are now fully healthy, the treatment had no side effects and it was relatively inexpensive. On the other hand, the harm from traditional medicine was extraordinary.",1245182130

Linode is older, but they were using User Mode Linux (not nearly as good as Xen) for a long time.  Slicehost got the mindshare by getting to Xen hosting first.<p>Slicehost is local to all their data centers.  Whether in St Louis or Dallas/Ft Worth, their employees actually work there.  Linode's employees all work in South Jersey, 2 hours from their Newark data center and inaccessible to their other data centers.  Kinda indicates that they have other people setting up a lot of their stuff.<p>Linode is often out of stock or having limited stock.  This might just be that Slicehost doesn't tell us how the sausage is made and Linode does.<p>Linode tops out at 2880MB.  Slicehost offers instances going up to 15.5GB.  That's a major difference if you want to try scaling up easily and there is a huge difference between trying to get your site to handle traffic on a 3GB server and a 15GB server.<p>Backups are a nice touch.<p>The Rackspace name lends a ""they're the big game in town"" to their service.<p>They aren't that much more expensive.  Linode charges a constant $0.0555. . . per MB of RAM.  At the 2GB level, Slicehost is charging $0.634 per MB of RAM.  That means that if you were to get 2GB servers from each, the Slicehost would cost you $130 and the Linode would cost you $114.  It is cheaper, but it isn't so significantly cheaper.<p>Slicehost can more easily upgrade your plan.  Linode has to switch your box should you want to move plans.  Often Slicehost can move plans while keeping you on the same box.<p>--<p>Now, none of that may matter to you.  It doesn't to me and that's why I'm a Linode customer.  However, for many these are considerations.  If you're running a business, having instances top out at 3GB is a concern.  Would you pay a 13% premium for Slicehost just for the knowledge that you can upgrade beyond 3GB of RAM should the need arise?  If I had a person project where downtime for migration would be embarrassing, I would.<p>Likewise, some might care that the Slicehost people actually work in the area rather than colo-ing boxes with places like The Planet.<p>I'm very happy with Linode, but I can see why many would choose Slicehost.",1245182084

33,660757,story,,,3,1,ms,Ask HN: last.fm for classical fans?,,"As a fan of both last.fm and classical music I've found that the two really don't mix well. There can be far too much relevant metadata about a given classical track (performer(s), composer, work, movement, conductor, recording date, etc.) to fit into last.fm's Artist/Album/Title system and the various attempts to reconcile the two leave a lot to be desired.

Right off the top of my head I see two distinct paths by which one might drive adoption:<p>1) There are a variety of smaller sites that utilize reputation type systems.  For examples, take a look at all those tech help sites (one called it exchange comes to mind).  These all fit into the Question/Answer model.  I think there is some merit to exploring blogging as a second option.  Specifically blogs can use reputation threshholds for posting, filtering, and comment prioritizing (putting the good ones at the top). Basically those are the primary areas where I'd like to look to start building a user base, but I think there are many more out there.<p>2) As one commenter recommended, the service could be expanded to include more than just simple +/- karma type scores and move to more complex stuff like Kiva loanability etc.  This is pretty self explanatory, add a service that makes life easier for these sites, and they'll ask their users to adopt it.<p>Finally, I realize openid is a different beast but it boils down to similar idea, universalize your identity.  Login and passwords are, of course, prevalent everywhere, so there is a huge market for this type of service and it seems to be picking up some steam.  Our target market is smaller, but if it proves nearly as useful to users within that space, it has a chance of being adopted as well.",1245181231

Solar adoption is currently constrained by manufacturing capacity which is why it can quickly scale.  It's 0.15% of total electric use today. But instilled capacity is doubling every 2 years.<p>The maximum efficiency of PV is far larger than solar thermal systems and they have been improving far more quickly both on cost / watt and peak efficiency.  PV systems are easier to install and maintain than solar thermal systems.<p>PS: Looking the cost / adoption curves PV is only looking more attractive each year.  But, suggesting there is no long term energy crisis does not generate a lot of publicity.  Also there is a perception that PV is magic and hard to understand even though manufacturing it is a well understood process.<p>Edit: If you have a more secefic issue with PV I would gladly address it, but it looks like PV is going to provide atleast 10% of our electricity needs within 20 years.",1245179779

If it's possible to appear to reproduce a demo without doing the hard parts, then maybe the demo wasn't actually <i>demonstrating</i> the hard parts. In that case a better demo would be a good idea.
