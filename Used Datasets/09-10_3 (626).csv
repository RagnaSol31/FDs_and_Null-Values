Off topic: at least in my country this is a special exception to the general ""author"" legislation, which says for example a painting you make for a buyer will forever be ""by you"", and even after selling it you still retain some rights. In software, what you write belongs to the company, period.<p>Now depending on the specific wording of the law and in your employment contract you may or may not be able to work on something related on your own. The only solution I can think of which would not require a lawyer and/or reading a lot of legalese is making a piece of paper in which you grant the company the right to use your software and the company agrees it's yours, and get your boss to put the company's stamp on it.

Then I did it, and it was true for about 8 years. Now the internet has all the TV I'd ever want to watch in an immediately summonable window right next to all the other info-crack which had taken the place of television. I'm thinking dropping the internet is going to be the next big life changer. I went on a laptop free vacation a couple months ago and felt like I had 6-8 hours of extra time per day.

4,612536,comment,612221.0,612221.0,0,0,jonnytran,,,"I've thought about this before.  I move fairly often.  But why in the world should I have to update my address with 27 different places every time.  Why can't I simply have a virtual mailing address that I give out to people, and when people mail things there, it gets looked up after it reaches the post office.  And then, when I move I simply update the physical address in one spot.  I do this already when I set a forwarding address with the USPS.<p>In order to increase adoption, I was thinking that in addition to a simple domain name, it would also have a human-readable addr1/addr2/city/state/zip format to be backward compatible with current mailing address forms.  If you're concerned about redundancy, it can go in here.  If the address still can't be read by the post office, it will return to sender or route the same way a dead letter would.<p>I even thought about making a startup out of this by implementing this routing myself using the post office as a service.  In other words, people could register a virtual address with my company, and when giving out their address, give out my company's address where the address-line-2 indicates their ""domain"".  When my company receives the mail, it does a lookup on the virtual address and remails the letter/package to the physical address registered.  Since this is a convenience for the owner of the virtual address, they can pay my company per thing routed, so they only ever pay when it actually gets used.  But this easily allows my company to pass the remailing postal charge on to my customers.  I think remailing would be acceptable to me as a user, b/c 95% of all the mail I get, it wouldn't matter if it took twice as long to get to me.  For things that required speed of delivery, I would probably make sure something special happened anyway, like priority mail or fedex.  Of course, people are then going to want to do things like get an email about something they received before paying for the routing, which I think would be cool as a user anyway.<p>Using DNS for routing is a good idea though.  It's already redundant and reliable.  It also avoids concerns of criminals using this as a way to hide their address, since anyone can just do a WHOIS on it.<p>I didn't pursue this idea because I figured reading hand-written addresses was a hard problem, and it would make more sense to simply be implemented by the postal service itself to avoid remailing.  But how in the world do we convince the postal service to add this feature?",1242503780.0

Mrs Browl works for an electronic discovery company, whose service is to organize huge volumes of documents for legal cases, and it happens that many of these are related to IT patents. For obvious reasons I can't discuss any specifics, but even casual shoulder-surfing has resulted in a great many eyerolls.<p>To me, a major part of the problem is that while the profession of law purports to be based on reason, it lacks a proper axiomatic framework and success frequently depends on the exploitation of ambiguity...and sadly, many lack the critical thinking skills to deconstruct arguments made this way.

And certainly Vipassana seems to be as methodical and systematic an approach as can be possible, when it comes to learning(and seeing results of) meditation. However, as in programming, it is important to go beyond the tool/s. And the same is true about this peace thing. There is a similar path (non-dual advaita based on self inquiry), where in addition to meditation, emphasis is given on the root of the problem(or identifying and fixing the root of the problem, which they identify as ""I"" or mind). In fact, it is very similar to Zen Budhism, in the sense it is very direct, but is geared more more towards knowledge-based /intellectual bend of mind.
