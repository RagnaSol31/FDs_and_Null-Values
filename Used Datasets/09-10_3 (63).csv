Economics won't be obsolete anytime soon.<p>Robots might build a dyson's sphere on every star, but economics will still matter.<p>Also, Anybots is all about tele-operated robots. They're smart, and punting on the hard AI problem. It becomes a control problem of having someone in a 3rd world country act like my butler.<p>The point is that they can succeed without significant developments in robotic perception, planning, and understanding.",1203652403

Humor is tough to do in written form)<p>I would add that there is a step 0 which is ""you may be right, although I do not understand how..."" which is how, if you think about it, you talk to people you deeply respect.

Broad exposure to a particular subject, if anything, hones your intuition about it, such that even if you make ""blind guesses"" about solutions, they are better suited than those without the education.<p>At the very least, you will know the names of things and where to start looking, which prevents you from reinventing the wheel. This difference, in my experience, is significant.<p>Don't overstate the importance of a degree, but don't understate the value of knowledge from school; it's knowledge, after all.",1203650320
15,121033,comment,120927.0,120927.0,0,0,henning,,,"It's easy to dismiss this as so far off that it's not worth thinking about, but there are plenty of brilliant people with PhDs who think robots with sufficient capabilities to resemble strong AI in domain-specific ways (human-competitive in limited specific tasks) will come in the next few decades.<p>It would be impossible to overstate the magnitude of the consequences of such developments.<p>A few years ago Prof. Robert Hecht-Nielsen, director of research at the Fair Isaac Corp (they created the FICO credit score) and the confabulation lab at the University of California San Diego, gave a talk to my neural networks class about his very firm belief that real strong AI would come in < 30 years. He didn't convince me that it would happen, but he correctly pointed out that were it to come it would make economics obsolete and could lead to some kind of grand utopia if we don't fuck it up.",1203650197

Since, presumably, you don't want to have to babysit the thing yourself all the time forever, that means picking a handful of people and 'blessing' them to do it for you.<p>So! Here's one way that might work -- though there're gonna be some objections to it:<p>Pick a dozen or twenty users that you think really 'get' what you want the site to be about. Set a special flag on them in your database. When they upvote a submission, it counts for a little extra, say 1.5 points; likewise if they downvote a submission. Then, you need to make sure that as people come and go, you still have this active core group of people tuning your site for you. So, if an 'unblessed' user gets habitually upmodded in their comments, or their submissions, by members of your blessed group, over a period of time that unblessed user gets automatically blessed, and their votes count for a little extra too.<p>This still leaves the door open for debates and arguments, while -- I think -- helping the site to stay on-subject without your active participation all the time.",1203649905
