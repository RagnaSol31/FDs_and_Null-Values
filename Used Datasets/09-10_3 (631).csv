In Sweden I'm on a subcutaneous treatment that greatly improves my quality of life. I can take and do the drugs myself without having to at least get an IV line started like in the US. The subcutaneous treatments are starting in America, but slowly and not as widely as they are relied in Sweden. The benefits are increased independence for patients, safer since it is absorbed through the fat instead of straight into the blood stream, and perhaps most importantly it costs less than half of the IV treatment. This subcutaneous treatment was pioneered, tested and deployed in Europe.<p>That pharmaceuticals in the US are going to stop R&D is BS. I bet there are many 'hacker' scientists that would happily keep doing their job as long as someone employees them. So maybe it won't be Wall St. but there is still money in it, job satisfaction and they aren't going to trade in their lab coats for McDonald's uniforms. Look at stem cell research, private companies could still fund it all they wanted, but once the federal government's teat was shut off research died. Public healthcare wouldn't diminish the government's interest in funding research. Sweden still has many notable things in the field of medical research, and all from a country with a GDP roughly that of North Carolina.",1249674666

Figuring out their expected return from their venture capital investments shouldn't be very difficult because of how long the industry has been around, not to mention that venture capital investments on average are only 1-3% of their portfolios (due to venture capital's lack of liquidity), so the amount of money at risk is insignificant compared to the size of the portfolio.  If losing 1-3% will collapse an investors fund, then they were over-leveraged to begin with, just like Lehman Brothers.<p>If the Treasury Department is worried about how much people are putting into venture capital, then they should make a ceiling of 1-3% of the fund's portfolio being able to be invested in venture capital.

And that is of course until something better comes along. Scientists are notoriously hard to convince of stuff if you don't show the evidence.

I will fully concede that he may know more about ECMAScript than me - but I will happily challenge him on JavaScript + DOM any day :-)<p>Quite seriously though, since jQuery and YUI came out at nearly the same time back in early 2006 - I feel that it has to do with the simplicity of the jQuery API and the active community that's grown around jQuery. YUI has always had better documentation (even though jQuery's has been good), so that can't be it.<p>A couple points:<p>- You can always do more complicated work with simple APIs but it's fundamentally harder to do simple work with more complex APIs.<p>- YUI didn't promote external plugins or development communities. For example the ExtJS library that grew up based upon YUI was left to stagnate and grow on its own rather than become part of YUI itself. If the YUI team worked to bring Jack Slocum on board YUI would be in a much more dominant position than what it is now.<p>- YUI has been closed to outside contributions for most of its life. No bug tracker, no outside patches, etc. It's only recently that they've truly Open Sourced both the code and the process surrounding the library.<p>I do find it to be odd, as well - YUI really should be more popular than it is.
