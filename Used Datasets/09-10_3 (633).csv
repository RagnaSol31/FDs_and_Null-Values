Wow, Safari before the huge JS upgrade beating Chrome on the Windows platform!  The SunSpider suite shows Chrome to be around 40% faster than Safari and 25% faster than Firefox 3, but on par with Safari 4.0 and only a tad faster than Firefox 3.1.<p>In fact, the only thing that shows V8 as being so amazing is Google's own test which is basically a lot of recursion (akin to Microsoft's surveys that show people love Vista).<p>Google has a good product, but it isn't an order of magnitude better than what exists today and is on par with what is coming in the future.
