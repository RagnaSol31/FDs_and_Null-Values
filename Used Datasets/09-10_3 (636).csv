For example, a function with N if statements that are not nested generally needs 2^N testcases to properly exercise it.<p>So having 1000 times more tests than code may not mean that you have complete coverage at all.  It depends on the structure of the tests and the code.",1324753191.0

I'm guessing that you are using genetic algorithms to create populations of lurepets and improve them using users' input.<p>You could build a google app engine web app to do that. Users that will train your genetic algorithms will get discount for their t-shirts. You would use google ""in-app"" purchases API to sell your t-shirts. If you get enough data from users you can try to personalize, e.g. association rules, if someone bought t-shirt A then he is likely to by t-shirt B.<p>Note to self: web app that uses genetic algorithms to improve its product and association rules to sell more is also a data mining web app.",1324753146.0

Luckily a lot were just white noise, but some >100 were definitely valid bugs that had been in the code for quite some time.<p>In order to keep things clean after all that work, I turned on warnings as failures as part of the continuous integration build (which I also set up) so that everyone would get an email each time the build failed. Yea public shaming, heh. The hard part was then training people to pay attention to the emails and not filter them to the trash.<p>As a final step, what I did was built the testing environment into the CI system so that if they wanted to test their code on a virtual machine before getting their branch into the latest iteration, they needed a clean build in order to generate the debian installers. That was the final kicker which really made people start paying attention to this stuff.<p>So, in order to push code to production, which everyone wants to do, you needed a clean build.

For example, the presence of dozens of redundant crappy packages associated to every function, included by default in the distribution (e.g. a dozen word-wrapping packages) means that one is likely to use a substandard tool and have problems.  The fact that all add-ons are treated with equal weight means that the command you are looking for is hidden among thousands of commands, most of which are way outside the scope of what I need.  The proliferation of buffers, leading to the proliferation of  buffer packages used to search through lists of buffers? You have to be kidding me.  The customization system in Emacs is not only a throwback to 1980s UI ""design"" but completely out of control -- all options, no matter how minute, are treated on equal footing even if most of them should be hidden or in subtrees.  Not only this, but the customization options themselves are badly named, using quirky terminology which nobody uses except emacs.<p>In short, emacs is thoroughly polluted and needs an environmental assessment and large-scale cleaning project.  This has nothing to do with newbies, it has to do with oldies whose dusty, dried-up packages need to be swept into the dustbin of history.",1324751316.0

While the language certainly does offer some free choices, more often there are advantages and disadvantages to each, so that in any particular situation, some choices are better than others.  Becoming an expert Lisp programmer requires learning about these tradeoffs, which takes experience and, usually, guidance from existing experts.<p>That's true of any language, of course, but some of the facilities Lisp offers are rare among other languages, so that people coming to Lisp from some other language are unlikely to have experience with them.<p>Oh, one point about macros in particular.  If you have to resort to reading the implementation of a macro to understand what it does, the person who wrote it screwed up.

In fact by it design it favors left brained individuals with analytical minds. Put simply Google filters out the very people that could turn cool tech into cool products.<p>Their is no doubt in my mind that a person like Miyamoto, Land, or Jobs would be filtered out of Google's hiring process by it's very bias towards a particular preconceived notion of brilliance. Put simply it's the hubris of brilliant people making the assumption that the definition of brilliance is the characteristics that make them brilliant. The reality is that yes, there are tough problems to solve, but not every day is filled with complex riddles. Sometimes less tangible brilliance is required and these practices leave a company devoid of those individuals.<p>For me personally I ask two questions when I hire and they have served me well, I ask show me something that you have built and show me the routine that you are most proud of in that code base.

There's more going on than SOPA, such as the economy, wars, etc.<p>- Most lobbying is ineffectual on behalf of the corporation.<p>Back in the late nineties, during the DOJ trial with Microsoft, a few news outlets made a big deal about the millions of dollars that Microsoft had made in campaign contributions to various candidates and politicians. The anti-MS crowd, Sun chief among them, made a huge deal out of it (as they did with anything they could latch onto from an anti-MS stance). On further review of campaign contributions, it was discovered that Microsoft's political contributions paled in comparison to those of Oracle, IBM, Sun, Intel, and several others with large government contracts.
