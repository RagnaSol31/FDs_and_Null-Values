(it only misses the problem of integrating vim with external commands)<p>But then I found a really nice piece of software - Yi. It's a vim/emacs type (yes - both!) type editor. It's written and extendable in haskell. The keymap is implemented as a parser on user input, so keymap modules include vim (with modes / simple ex mode), emacs and others. The code is very easy to understand (I actually learnt haskell while patching it for my needs) and includes most standard features - tabs, buffers, editing, some syntax files... even basic ghci shell :)<p>It's not ""ready"" yet, but I would say it can be described as a ""usable beta"". If someone really likes the vim idea of editing with modes and is disappointed by vim's plugin model, then Yi is definitely worth a try.",1239130741.0

I was a run of the mill PC tech who got paid hardly anything at the time (had two kids & wife to support as well) and I never felt I was having a hard time ""making it"", dare I say, I was happy.<p>I worked hard, picked up programming, and spent nights/spare time working on a program for our branch office, with the intention that I wanted to move up to corporate and be a full time programmer.<p>I busted my tail working, stayed motivated, gained experience, and when the app I wrote for our branch made it into the right hands (this was also planned, just had to wait for the timing to be right) they 'apprenticed me' into a .NET position, on the notion that I showed the right character to be a good employee and worked hard. That was several raises ago, and I'm still moving and improving, and getting serious real world experience in the field I want to make a career out of.<p>I grew up watching my Dad work 10-12 hour days at a company we owned, I was fortunate enough to have parents who always pushed us to achieve anything we wanted (and modest enough to never make us feel like we were anything more than middle class, there was money there, but instead of taking it for our pleasure, my father would reward employees and let it stay as profits for the business).<p>When I left the nest, I severed all financial ties with them to make it on my own, with my own independence. So I wasn't driving a car paid by them, or using a cell phone paid by them, or any of that.<p>The reason I got the first PC tech job even though I had a recreational tech history of computers and 5+ years of graphic/web design experience? Because I interviewed well and my former boss saw potential.<p>The world is full of opportunities for everyone, just look at the examples here. Such a wide range of people with different stories and experiences.<p>College is great, but I don't regret not going. I learned growing up how to teach myself through reading, research and practice, and I learn things faster that way.",1239130649.0

Microsoft is the only one that is questionable here.<p>So I say if you want to see the future of cross-platofrm mobile development take a look at HTML5 and the WebKit (the latest and greatest is in iPhone OS 3.0) The javascript speed is improving rapidly, CSS animations are built-in and you can store both code and data locally.

I dropped out after my freshman year, worked as a restaurant cashier and temp for about six months, then managed to land an entry-level media production job at a startup. Since then, I've slowly clawed my way up to a decent development gig at a major systems player in Silicon Valley, all without the benefit of a college degree, or any major financial support other than my own earnings.<p>Even several years after I first ""broke in"" to the industry, however, I've had entire years where I made only a few thousand dollars. If you're willing to live in shared housing, eat a lot of cheap stir-fry and soup, and occasionally suck it up and ask a friend or family member for a couple of hundred bucks to make rent that month, you can weather some pretty drastic changes in your income.<p>Regardless, after a decade or so of working as a developer, I've found that the lack of a college degree matters less and less.

Sure there is no CPAN, but still there are a lot of very good CL libraries around, and they are not really hard to install.<p>But:<p>1. The language is sophisticated. This is a ""problem"", in the sense that such a language takes time to study. It will never be popular. The Condition system and CLOS, for example, are way more complex and versatile than, say, the equivalent areas of Java. And then there are macros. Common Lisp has not been designed as a mainstream language for mainstream programmers. It is, I fear, an elite tool.<p>2. Certain kind of operations are inconvenient. Maybe when CL was designed, sockets, multithreading, text processing etc were not so popular. But now, it feels like CL has not really adapted well to the modern world. Having to install a compatibility library for using sockets is reminiscent of things like ""trumpet winsock"". Does not feel very cutting edge.<p>3. The literature is lacking. ""Practical Common Lisp"" is very good, but one book is not enough. For example, what are the best practices to organize large CL programs? No book tells it (maybe some obscure out-of-print text that I have not yet tracked?). What about programming idioms, or patterns as you prefer? Apart from an ancient presentation by peter norvig, nothing exist. And so on.<p>4. The ANSI standard is a big blessing and a big curse. It is a well-written and smart opus. But nowadays no one has the resources for a new standard; both in terms of money and focus. This means that ANSI CL seems an ancient pinnacle of beauty which will never be equalled and certainly can not be improved. (the perfection of ancient architecture, as seen by renaissance architects, comes to mind). This makes CL a splendid but dying civilization.<p>5. I have a feeling that the community is slowly dying as well. While in recent years many CL sites and blogs have appeared, comp.lang.lisp has lost many important contributors. Nor I can really blame them: while still a wonderful language, CL is nonetheless petrified, and I suppose one may became slightly bored after a decade or two of discussing the finer points of the Standard.",1239127352.0
