Or maybe it was the corporate toxic wasted dumped in the river upstream from your small town, while the corporate CEO lived on the other side of the country in a mansion and couldn't care less about the environment in your small town?<p>Don't get me wrong, I agree with you too. But you are only half right.",1211169246

We're launching a new service with lots of aliases to essentially the same site (sub domains for different users), but on our server it's just one physical site handling it all.  Would that be considered multiple sites in your system?  If so, that may not work out (we'd quickly exhaust the 20 in your mega plan), but if not then we may be able use it.  Thanks for the link!<p>PS. Looking at your Roxr page, sounds like you guys are doing pretty well with Clicky -- right on! :)",1211169214

They're almost a match for the things Woopra is showing off in their current beta. Your prices sound awesome, so we may give you a shot, too, especially when the free beta ends.<p>I'll be watching to see what next features you guys add. I'm a huge fan of real-time visitor analysis and you look promising. Good luck!",1211169184

Every night I would think of ~5 things, 'goals' maybe, that I wanted to do for the next day.  Maybe they're school related, work related, or related to something else, social perhaps, whatever.  If there was something bugging me that I had been putting it off, I would plan out a timeline or schedule, and come up with a reasonable 'goal' for what I thought I could - should - accomplish the next day.<p>Then, the next night, I would review my day and 'check off' what I had done, maybe write down comments to myself or revise my plan if I needed.  But I would either feel <i>happy</i> and pleased with myself if I had done what I thought I needed to do, or I would feel <i>disappointed</i> and frustrated with myself if I hadn't.<p>Of course, everyone is different, but this worked for me.  I don't like the idea of setting up firefox tools, different computers, whatever, to try to trick myself or punish myself or block myself from the Internet or some other 'time sink'.  It seems too easy to simply flip a switch, turn that all off, and slip back into a bad habit.<p>Instead of even thinking about wasting time online, in front of the TV, whatever it is you waste time on - stop yourself and save it for later.  <i>Just do it</i>.  As it happens, for me anyway, if I can do this, then by the end of the day I don't really even care too much for those time wasting activities - they really aren't all that entertaining.

What I was trying to say wasn't really anything more than most people who work for ANY corporation (not just advertising) probably can't reflect and say they lived idealistically in regards to morals.<p>Also I was trying to say exactly that: I want to do all I can regardless of what I am doing or where I am working.<p>Current stress is crushing my writing skills, especially coding.",1211168054

Also, check out 37signals and techcrunch for their job feeds which are often pretty sweet and pretty targeted.  Not sure if you're looking strictly for tech startups.
