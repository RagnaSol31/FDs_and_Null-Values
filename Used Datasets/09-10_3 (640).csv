And this is one case where there is absolutely no need to brand the sites using the Stack Overflow name - doing so would be like branding it the same way as the supermarket own brand of a top class store. i.e. the store is quality, the goods are quality, but the brand name makes it look cheap :)",1279011527.0

To display stereo images, you not only need a 120hz display device, you also need a way to synchronize the glasses with the image. There are some methods that patch into the video stream and use the vsync there, there are some that plug into the television itself and are triggered by actual frame changes. Note that progressive scan LCDs tend to be terrible for stereo, because not all of the image updates at once, and thus each eye sees some of the image meant for the other eye (and you get blurring and the stereo illusion breaks).",1279009202.0

Then go read the Cassandra code for the actual implementation (pretty much, in terms of the big ideas, at least as it was back in 2008).<p>As with any learning it's very hard to truly grok the importance of loose coupling, service oriented architecture, embedding statelessness in the architecture etc., unless you try to build something, get it wrong and then fix it.

In fact, they often are (in WPF, XAML is used as a GUI definition DSL; Ant is a domain-specific language for building applications, so is Make).<p>The great advantages of the likes of Ruby, however, is that you can build DSLs in the language itself (you don't have to build your own compiler and translator from DSL to language), which rids you of most of the complexity and limitations of usual DSLs, and lets power users realize that there is a full-blown general-purpose language under the DSL (and use that power when they need it).",1279008374.0
