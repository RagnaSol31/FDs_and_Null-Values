Filburn (1942) [1] that the US government can regulate the act of a farmer growing wheat to feed his own chickens on the grounds that had the farmer <i>not</i> grown that wheat, he would have then participated in the national wheat market that Congress could regulate, that his failure to purchase wheat on this market therefore affected the market by his absence, and thereby Congress can regulate his action in accordance with the Commerce Clause.<p>Again, I mention this without endorsement of either side; I mention this just because I only recently learned about this myself.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn</a>",1293328779.0

They're cynical and shortsighted.<p>The premise of such posts is that if people were aware of who was getting a tax cut they would be against it. Put another way: the premise is that everyone is purely motivated by self-interest.<p>There are two immediate problems with this line of thinking.<p>The first is tha it ignores how aspirational people are.i remember a survey from the 2000 election when Gore made the mistake of demonizing the top 1% repeatedly. The survey show something like 19% of people thought the were the top 1% and another 20% thought they would be someday.<p>The second problem is the whole ""money for rich people = bad"" argument. Some may ascribe to Reagenesque trickle down economics. Others may see that overtaxing the rich is ultimately shortsighted. Yet others may not get hung upon percentages and look at the absolute tax burden (iirc the top 1% pay ~40% of the tax burden).<p>Personally I just object to the tone of the rhetoric where politicians talk about ""affording"" or ""paying for"" a tax cut like they're giving away money. The reality is just that they're taking less money. Bit of a difference.<p>All of this is just ""policy theatre"" however. What the US (and most of the West for that matter) is facing a far bigger problem that the current systemis unsustainable and no politician wants to be at the helm when the music stop (to mix metaphors) with declining birth rates and increasing life expectancy.",1293328572.0

For example, if you gave a person a choice of two mutual funds, a low risk and a high risk, most people would put 50% in one and 50% in the other regardless of the actual distribution of risk over the two funds.<p>So if you gave the average person 5 groups of people and told them to ideally distribute the wealth between them, they would probably exhibit this same equality bias on average.<p>As for the estimated case, I'm sure you'd get similarly wrong responses asking the average person basic questions about U.S. history. Or algebra, chemistry, or pretty much any other academic subject.<p>EDIT: Dan Ariely and others frequently cite this kind of bias in the books and talks I've seen.

I have to collect and manage a queue myself so that I don't run out of material. \nI have two queues. One are actual physical books at home (shipped three at a time for free shipping, 3-6 books total).\nThe other queue are bookmarks in my browser(3-10).

Message passing as a paradigm is in my somewhat-experienced opinion really neutered when there's still only one thread of control.<p>The following won't produce a <i>perfect</i> Erlang design, but it's a start:<p>1. Create your traditional OO design.<p>2. Anything that isn't obviously a collection or glorified struct, instantiate as a process and write them as gen_servers (or relevant other OTP process instead).<p>3. Anything that is obviously a collection, use one of the language's collections instead; if you <i>really</i> need typing on those, layer it on top with a tuple. Anything that is obviously a glorified struct is a record with a central module representing the ""methods"" as functions on the record.<p>Like I said, this won't out-of-the-box produce a great design, but the mapping will actually get someone used to OO but not used to Erlang at least started understanding how it works in practice. You've got several million-ish processes to play with, and in most programs you will not need to exceed that; that is the idea behind the comments I made about ""collections"" and ""structs"", because while it's easy to have millions or yet more of bits of data you can write a lot of programs with even ""a few hundred"" serves floating around.<p>You get polymorpismish by passing PIDs around as objects and implementing interfaces, only this time it's literal server interfaces instead of syntactic sugar. You get encapsulation by the fact that processes simply can not peek in on each other; this is actually even more rigid than most OO languages, no friends, no public, no sharing. Inheritance is pretty manual. So, two of the three usual OO characteristics are there.<p>I find my designs end up in a way that I'm not comfortable calling strictly OO, but if you used OO terminology and an OO diagramming language to show, everybody would understand what you meant. Given the way inheritance has been getting downplayed in the OO community anyhow, well, I wouldn't call Erlang an OO language by any means but I use a lot more of the ""OO mental machinery"" when I'm programming in Erlang than I do when I'm programming in Haskell. It's not as foreign as you might think at first, there's a lot of crossover there. Arguably it's a better OO language than the languages that wrote inheritance into their syntax and runtime too hard, and arguably it's not, but it's an interesting argument.",1293325366.0
