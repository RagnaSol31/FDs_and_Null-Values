Just because you can make websites pretty doesn't mean you're an interface designer. There's a difference between graphic design (an appeal to emotion and aesthetics) and interactive design (the science of making interfaces easy and enjoyable to use).,1291773499

The connection is that absented of the ""openness"" we were really looking for, we sought documentation to describe what's going on. That said...<p>CoreLocation is a good abstraction. However, its primitives for specifying what trade-offs you are willing to make in acquiring a location are, well, primitive.<p>A couple of random examples:<p>- CoreLocation doesn't tell you the source of the location sample (GPS, WiFi, etc). It gives you an estimate of accuracy. Of note, it doesn't give you a measure of the accuracy of the accuracy. This is of import as we have seen examples where the data is off by a whole hemisphere -- I'm not kidding! I understand that exposing these details is kind of ""ugly"", but obscuring it is removing signals that we could use to figure out the reliability of the data, and what techniques we might be able to use to ""clean"" the data. I am willing to concede that CL is a good API for general use, but when you're building consumer products, that doesn't cut it. The guy in New York who was reported as being in Antarctica (again, seriously), doesn't really care that the iPhone doesn't provide us the tools to fix that, he just wants it to work (and he's no longer a user).<p>- Related to the first point, but separate: the implementation of the algorithm for seeking to the desired accuracy is a black box. This makes it really easy to use for basic stuff, but you really don't have any way of knowing the result, in milliwatts, of passing in a given value to that argument. There are ways to mitigate this (which we've had to explore), and we can experiment to learn what the drain is, approximately, but hiding that information has obstructed our development process. Consider also that CL doesn't allow me to specify how long I am willing to wait to get the location fix at the desired accuracy. It does not let me set a budget in milliwatts for a location fix. I realise that Android doesn't provide those exact abstractions, but the tools it does provide make it easier (by which I mean ""possible"") for me to build them myself.<p>I also don't think you've successfully made the argument that the OS will know better than us. It's a generic tool, which makes some assumptions. It will have made compromises that don't necessarily work for us. It will not perform optimally for every use case. Going back to something I said before, it seems to optimise for getting to the desired accuracy quickly. For background location tracking apps like ours, that is not a priority. Power is. Neither CoreLocation's abstraction nor documentation provide for this use-case.",1291772815
