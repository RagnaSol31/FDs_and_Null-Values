Here's what we learned:<p>* It is very hard to get funded if you're not all in one place. Also, my previous startup, from '99-'01, relocated everyone as soon as the A round closed.<p>* All-hands company meetings are very hard to do, because they take the form of interminable phone calls instead of lively back-and-forths.<p>* Software design debates rapidly turn into a game of telephone.<p>* It's much harder to guage the mood of the team; we lost 2 people because they were unhappy about stuff that might have been resolved had we caught it earlier.<p>* Solo founders in far-flung branch offices quickly feel out of the loop, which sets up a bunch of vicious cycles involving security, assertiveness, style, and communication.<p>We've made it work by growing through it, painfully; we now have so many people in just two offices that there's a cameraderie and common purpose (I'm dignifying it, yes). It's still more painful than it would be if we were all in one place.

Downtime at AWS has historically been measurable in <i>days</i> per year.  This level of reliability puts it well into the bottom ranks of hosting providers.  We're talking about the dregs of the industry here...the hosts who have a single cheap Cogent pipe running into a single cage of machines with no power backup and no backup pipe or infrastructure redundancy.  This is the sole reason we don't recommend AWS to our customers, and why we don't use it ourselves for any vital services.  We want to like it, and recommend it, and we have quite a bit of software that works with it, that we enjoy selling to people.

It's the reason I posted it. A hard problem at the moment I see at various levels is the <i>""human""</i> matching problem.

Is it because the same thing that makes nerds good at computing also degrade their ability to undertand <i>""human matching""</i>?<p>It's not just dating where solutions to this problem can be applied. It could also be applied to anywhere you have a requirement for recruiting individuals to interact with other people. Part of the reason why the problem domain is not well understood by nerds could also be covered by the <i>""homo-logicus""</i>, <i>""homo-sapiens""</i> divide Alan Cooper describes in ""Inmates are running the Asylum"". Funny enough this idea also partially explains Trolls.

Frankly, I don't see the advantage to being in the same place.<p>Sure, very occasionally there are things that would go faster if I could draw them on an actual whiteboard instead of a virtual one. But these moments are rare.<p>Basically, I think virtual communication is something you learn how to do. Since we're not in the same location, we're very used to using tools and communication styles that provide the same advantage as being in a room together.<p>And there are many, many advantages for us to start an entirely virtual company. Primarily, when we do have to grow our company we're going to be able to hire the best people in the world (as long as they have a good Internet connection.) This seems like a huge advantage over Google, who can only hire the best people within an hour's drive of Mountain View. It opens up an entire new pool of talent for us.<p>Other advantages:<p>1. No rent for office space and no commute. \n2. We can hone our communications techniques so that we're ready to scale when we inevitably need to have people in multiple cities working together.\n3. People get to work in an environment where they're most productive. \n4. We cover more of the world so one of us is usually close to an investor or customer that wants to have an in-person meeting with. \n5. Since we cover more of the world the company as a whole has more perspective.<p>As to arguments on the other side, the only one I can think of is:<p>1. It's easier to communicate, and thus easier to get things done. (But with modern communications devices, e.g. a screen recorder to capture exactly what's going on my system so that the programmer can how I produce the bug, I remain unconvinced that in-person speed of communication is anything more than a slight advantage that is greatly outweighed by the disadvantages of not being an entirely virtual company.)<p>Are there other advantages to in-person interactions that I'm not thinking of?",1216605942.0
