There was nothing (technical) preventing Apple from implementing their libraries/framework/graphical frontend on top of a Linux backend.  Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but this seems more like a business decision (i.e. 'Not invented here' or ""We don't control it"") and/or license issue  (i.e. 'GPL is viral') .

Further, the government works primarily for the benefit of moneyed interests and has been thus since the founding of the republic.<p>These are statements that I think you would agree ""undermine the [US'] leaders.""
