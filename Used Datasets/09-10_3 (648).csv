I know this is high frequency, but like I alluded to, you need to make sure that what you're doing isn't replicating the pnl profile of low frequency strategies.<p>So, how did you perform relative to vol sellers? From the market bottom to the end of 2010, the max daily loss for a vol seller was about 3x average daily pnl, and >80% winners. So your returns do sound better, but not incredibly.<p>But, even if you failed to perform as well as vol selling did over the same period, that doesn't negate the strategy's validity. If returns were not correlated, then it's safe to say that you weren't just inadvertently shorting vol.<p>So, start there, work out a regression comparing your daily returns to someone selling vol. Do the same with moving average strategies. Mocking up a simple market making back test versus an ES beta is hard, but that too would be a something to test against. I don't expect you to do any of this, and I'm not going to bother to either. I'm just saying that a complete discussion of this subject would include that information.",1352254032.0
