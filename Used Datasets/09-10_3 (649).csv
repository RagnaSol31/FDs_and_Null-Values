And so my point is if we define the universe as the world we reside in, and we define God as an entity mutually exclusive of the universe, then based on this definition God cannot be disproven. Assuming I exist because I am writing this right now, then the universe must exist because I must reside in something (and whatever that is is the universe). Now then God, what we have defined to be what is exclusive of this universe, cannot be disproven because we are in the universe.

Not about whether dancers are being exploited.<p>b) Cheerleading is not lap dancing any more than ice skating or swimming is.<p>c) Stop judging entire groups of people based on what you see on MTV.",1256004435

It's certainly is helpful if she does, but it seems silly to say that's a <i>responsibility</i>, just as it isn't the responsibility of an artist to know the laws governing international sales of her artwork.",1256004331

One would assume that industry has found them useful, as they continue to hire them.<p>Bonus question: if you have a startup and someone applies for a job as a product manager and they have the right background, experience, passion, etc, would the fact that they got an MBA from Harvard or Stanford make you more or less likely to hire them?",1256004303

If there were also male strippers the event would no longer be sexist, only unprofessional.  Would it still deserve moral outrage?  Would it still be counter-productive?<p>I'm just exploring permutations here.  I think half-naked dancing girls would make it hard to get any hacking done.  But that doesn't necessarily make it a bad event (aside from sexism).  A bad event to hack at, maybe.",1256004302

69,891570,comment,891289.0,891342.0,0,0,catch23,,,but sometimes even the really good authentic places do poorly because of location.  I'm not sure how it would apply to internet startups.  I have a friend who owns an authentic chinese restaurant in south beach florida.  He says he makes most of his money selling fried rice by the 5-gallon bucket and lipton hot tea.  There weren't enough residents in the area to appreciate high quality authentic chinese food (they don't normally serve kung pao chicken),1256004168

My oldest son was an extremely poor fit for public school.  I have sometimes said that I homeschooled to prevent ""the next Columbine"".  (He was having fantasies of plowing through the school in a tank and his career-military father had keys to a military motor pool at the time.)  For that and other reasons, I've had lots of opportunity to think about such things.",1256004071
