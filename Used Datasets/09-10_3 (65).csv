Up until now, virtualization--especially x86 server virtualization--has been pushed forward by the huge hardware and operational savings accrued from app server consolidation. Sadly, the consolidation of whole businesses will likely become one of the main drivers of virtualization in the year ahead. For IT managers at acquiring companies, virtualization will become a tool for onboarding IT assets without bringing along old servers, murky networks and a hodgepodge of management tools.",1231819060.0
