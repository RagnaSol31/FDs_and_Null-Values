If you work on this problem you will probably advance our knowledge in some domain and can even apply the results to other problems (such as network routing).  Look at the groups that worked on the Netflix Prize.  Most of the leading teams had academics seriously working on them.<p>With a design competition you are basically doing work for free and the only one that benefits is the one giving the competition.,1290567505.0

The property valuation (and thus the total amount of taxes) could fluctuate of course.  The valuation would be set by a variation of the old two people dividing the pie trick.  One party (perhaps the homeowner) would set a valuation for the house.  The other party (the city) would have the option of buying back the property at that price.<p>The property ownership contract would also guarantee that the provision of vital services (electricity, gas, water, etc) be provided at non-extortionate prices (perhaps the contract would specify that the price could be no greater than cost plus 30%).  Thus city government would be contractually banned from charging $1k a month for water as back door property tax.<p>Since the city is making money off of property values, it has an incentive to provide common services such as roads and parks that increase property prices.<p>A company that screws over its customers or makes promises it then revokes will not be a highly profitable company for long.  For a city to be profitable, and to maintain high property, it must continually attract new residents.  If the city gains a reputation for screwing its residents, demand for property will plummet, property prices will drop, tax revenues will fall, and profits will fall.<p>The more the city government thinks about long term profits rather than short term profits the better life will be for the residents.  Ideally, the corporate charter would have some tweaks to make the corporation even more future oriented than most corporations.  For instance, all stock in the company could be restricted stock that is nontransferable until the owner has owned it for ten years.  Executives would also receive dividend paying, non-transferable stock instead of stock options or a pension.",1290567323.0

There are a bunch of algorithms that are conceptually generic, but get a significant speed-up if type-specialized to certain types, mostly numeric ones. For example, I think STL's type-specializing sort is a pretty reasonable default, while C suffers from having only a non-type-specializing sort built in, which ends up much slower if you're sorting, say, an array of integers. Same with a bunch of machine-learning algorithms that work on generic comparable types, but work much <i>faster</i> if you type-specialize them to <i>integer</i> or <i>double</i>, the way C++ templates would do. That's the main use case I see those terrible C macro approaches used for.
