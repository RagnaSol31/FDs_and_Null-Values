30,769453,comment,768241.0,768241.0,0,0,rdouble,,,"I just did the opposite move, from SF to NYC.<p>The Mexican food in SF is very specific - Burritos. Burritos are as much Californian food as they are Mexican. You'll be hard pressed to get a decent burrito in most of Mexico. You'll also be hard pressed to find a decent burrito outside of SF once you've lived there.<p>The burritos in NYC are a joke.  However, tacos in NYC are fine. The mexican people in California are usually from California... home of the burrito. All the mexicans I've met in NYC are from D.F - where there are no burritos to be found, but there are tacos. You can get nopales with your taco in NYC, it's hard to get them in SF. Zed's right though... in general there's better mexican food in SF. However, NYC definitely is not the worst. Try getting mexican food in Wisconsin, for example.<p>The weather in SF is weird. It's kinda cold most of the time. When I was a kid in the midwest I used to watch skateboard videos featuring SF. I'd mimic the guys who wore a winter hat and a t-shirt. I was determined to be as rad as they were. My head got so hot, I couldn't stand it. I couldn't figure out how those dudes could do it. It all came together when I moved to SF. It's the only place in the world where it makes sense to leave the house in a winter hat and a t-shirt.<p>The weather in NYC is balls this summer, but I kind of like having an excuse to wear shorts for the first time in 5 years.<p>NYC is indeed dirtier overall. However, if Zed really wants to know where the part of San Francisco that makes god weep, it's 6th and Market. Human poo, needles, meth tweakers, etc. The lower tenderloin up the hill from that intersection is a also a horror movie.<p>Regarding sketchiness,  the sketchy parts of SF are actually sketchy. NYC, not so much. I've been mugged twice in SF. Once right in front of my apartment. My roommate was beat up by three dudes for 18 dollars. The hells angels dude got mowed down right over where I used to live. 21st street is the dividing line between the Nortenos and Sorrenos... 2 guys got shot on the street in front of my startup, while I was at work. Note that this was Bryant street and 21st in the Mission... where tons of hipsters and software people live...in 2006. There are constant gunshots in the projects next to Hayes Valley, right up the street from everyone's favorite coffee shop, Blue Bottle.  I moved to a ""nicer"" neighborhood, Cole Valley, and within months my house got broken into and my TV was stolen by a crackhead. Market street after midnight (or after noon, depending on the day) is like 28 days later or similar apocalyptic zombie movie.. and so forth. Don't get me started on Oakland.<p>In contrast,  New York is so safe these days it's a joke. You have to try pretty hard to get to a bad neighborhood in NYC these days. I never thought I'd ""go soft"" by moving to New York, but I'm not looking over my shoulder for tweakers and thugs anywhere in manhattan. I left my bike locked up on the street in Brooklyn and nobody ganked my seat like they did in Berkeley. Etc.<p>Regarding tech, I haven't been here too long. I know Zed hates ruby, but we had a nycrb meetup at work, and it was much better than the ruby meetups I'd been to in SF. The people were really cool. I also thought the ""lame"" project email he received sounded like a fun project, and I work for a fashion company, so maybe I'm not as cool as Zed.  I do miss TechShop in Menlo Park already, as well as all the South Bay weirdos who build robots and actually design circuits and work on network routing protocols and stuff like that. There doesn't seem to be an equivalent to that out here, but maybe I just haven't found it.",1250555298.0

32,769451,comment,768220.0,769257.0,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I see what you're getting at but I would call that unconscious thought. There is a great deal of that going on.<p>When you learn something it is conscious. Every bit of the activity that you are learning is new and requires lots of hard work. But at some points you have 'mastered' the skill, and you can do it 'without thinking', which is really just another way of saying that your unconscious has enough information to do the thinking without direction.<p>For instance, most of the people reading this are probably good typists (to me that's a part of 'hacking', the sound a typewriter keyboard would make when you 'hack' out a piece of text). All of us had to learn that skill at some point, one conscious and slow stroke at the time. But right now I'm typing this just a little slower than I can think it, or maybe even faster in spurts, depending on how frequently I've used those patterns.<p>If I tried to consciously think of every letter that I'm typing immediately I slow down to a crawl.<p>So we're good at parallel thought, no doubt about that, we multitask like we're made for it. But we have but <i>one</i> state of consciousness and we can not fork that even for the simplest of tasks.<p>Take chess players that can play on many boards. That's as close to human 'multitasking' as you can get when making a computer analogy. The state of each board is the thread of execution, the consciousness is doing 'multiple-instruction-single-data' across each board. On a 'task switch' (move to another player) the state gets reloaded and another move is produced.<p>If you could consciously think multiple threads then it should be much easier to play on many boards at the same time.<p>I wonder how well octopuses would perform at that task...",1250555222.0

Surely they ought to have forgone TV, a second pair of pants, and other non-essentials so that they could save up and avoid going hungry should a true hardship strike.<p>What is the formula by which one should decide how much he can spend every year relative to his income and savings?

If he works 8 hours a day, that's about $150 per hour.<p>If someone knows what a hotdog goes for in NYC, we can figure out how many hot dogs he'd have to sell per hour in an 8 hour workday.<p>Below is a link to an article with a bit more detail, that says he sells water for $2 a bottle, so a hotdog isn't going to be much more than that.  If a hotdog costs $4, he'd have to sell 38 of them every hour, which is about 1 hotdog every 2 minutes, given an 8 hour workday, every day for 365 days a year.<p>Keep in mind all this is just to cover rent, cost of labor, and expenses.  Making a profit would require selling even more hotdogs.<p>Also, I just looked at the Met's website, and it says they're closed Mondays, so that only leaves the hotdog vendor with 312 productive days per year.  This alone will push the vendor to have to sell close to a hotdog every minute (0.73451 hotdogs per minute to be exact), just to break even.<p>I've been to the Met, and seen the vendors there, and they're just not that busy.  Sometimes they'd get a family buying a bunch of sodas and maybe some icecream, but most of the time they're just standing around doing nothing, even on busy days.  On ordinary days it's probably much worse.  And in the off-season it's pretty dead (except on weekends).<p>So I have a difficult time believing they make that much money.  But I suppose it's not completely out of the realm of possibility.<p><a href=""http://thebsreport.wordpress.com/2009/08/09/nyc-hot-dog-vendor-evicted-for-being-unable-to-pay-his-54000-a-month-rent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thebsreport.wordpress.com/2009/08/09/nyc-hot-dog-vend...</a>",1250553711.0
