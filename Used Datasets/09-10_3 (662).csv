The implication Sid is the bad guy because he is deflating many careers.<p>It does really suck when you work the hardest you can, fail, and you find out there is someone who is <i>just so much better</i> than you who consistently beats you. It often does create a caustic culture and a risky business environment where the company is overly reliant on one person and has no one else on the bench when the Truck Number gets called in.<p>But, one could easily argue that holding stellar performers back from expressing their talents is worse since they are <i>just so much better</i>.

They never make mistakes: you have to get rid of the subject of the sentence: it's not ""you made mistakes"" it's ""mistakes were made"" Never have a conversation with somebody about what ""they"" did. But always have conversations about ""what happened"" This is another point that if you don't get, be silent.<p>Finally, go with principles and data, not personalities and opinions. If you admit you might be wrong, and perhaps mistakes were made, the logical next step is to ask to collect data on a couple of theories. Who knows what the data might show? The real question is not who is right or wrong, it's whether you want to collect more data from a different hypothesis. After all, we're all open-minded, right?",1259021443.0

Bountii is all about helping price-conscious consumers get the deals most people don't find. Good for them for raising awareness of this new kind of price discrimination.,1259021248.0

The article explicitly mentions ""rich"", and you should feel comfortable assuming that ""rich"" does not mean ""middle-class"". Failing that definition, consider ""able"" to be taken from ""luxuries"", rather than ""necessities"". You don't need to bring India into it.
