So many people talk about CAP as if the SQL database was itself an impossibility, much less Oracle's scalable offering - but you can pick up the phone and an Oracle salesperson will sell you the physical device that you're implying can't exist.<p>So, if somebody misquotes the CAP theorem, it's an indication to me that perhaps the thread isn't going to go anywhere.  I'll point them to the place where they can read about it (the proof was where the CAP theorem was formalized, not Eric Brewer's original presentation), and move on.  In this case, that wasn't fair to btilly, who just made a typo.<p>So, as I said in the presentation and elsewhere here, if you have a hair-on-fire problem with scaling your database, and are willing to be an early customer of our new database, and would make a good reference customer in a few months, we'd love to work with you today.

Basically, you write down your AI problem in a ""forward"" direction, suggesting how the data came to be. You then ""fix"" the outputs.

For example, I'm making pipelines for bioinformatics analyses, which we want to be maintainable, self-documenting, reproducible, and easy for end-users to run.  These would run a large number of different programs and scripts on some input data, potentially with different permutations of parameters.<p>Some of the kinds of features that would be nice are:\n* Running jobs multiple times with different parameter settings\n* Branches, so that later parts of a pipeline can be run with different parameters while sharing results from an earlier stage, or running the same analysis on inputs generated using different methods\n* Running jobs on a cluster / integration with LSF\n* Logging runs and keeping track of results \n* Keeping track of default/standard parameters and recording documentation of options\n* Tracking success of stages and automatically re-running if necessary \n* Tracking program/data dependencies and versions\n* Control / reporting through a web interface as well as the command line<p>Obviously all of this can be done with shell/perl/python/etc. scripts, and with make/Ant (although I think that there is more to this than managing dependencies in the manner that make is usually used).   However, there's a tradeoff between the simplicity of a static script vs. flexibility, and it seems like writing a generic system with such features is not an entirely trivial exercise.  Making specialized scripts for each pipeline is an option, but risks degenerating into a mess of special cases and gets harder to document and control.<p>One very lightweight tool I came across that looks interesting and seems to have some of this functionality is ruffus http://code.google.com/p/ruffus/  I'm surprised that there haven't been more efforts like that.<p>What other approaches and tools do you like to use?",1269993664
