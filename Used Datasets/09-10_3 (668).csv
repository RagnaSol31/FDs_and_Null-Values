For many, $72/mo plus bandwidth might be a bit much for what they're doing if it can work on a 512MB Xen instance for under $40 with a few hundred gigs of transfer included.<p>Beyond that, drive snapshots aren't the easiest things to do.  I know that Right Scale tells their customers to freeze the drive so that no changes can occur until the backup is complete.  With S3 performance around 20MBytes/sec, to backup 1GB would take around a minute.  That's not bad and only doing deltas it's unlikely you're going to have a huge amount to backup at any given time, but it isn't exactly good either.  With file-level backup, you can do a mysqldump and then just back up that file.  Eh, maybe I'm just preferring the devil I know in this situation.<p>It's a little more complex to set up (doing file-level backups), but if you're going the volume route, you need to make sure you don't leave the drive in an inconsistent state.<p>All that said, EBS is awesome.
