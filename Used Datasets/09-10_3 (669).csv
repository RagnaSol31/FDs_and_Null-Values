It varies across the country, but local teachers are paid half the salary of managers and software developers after receiving the same amount of education, yet they're expected to spend every waking hour dealing with students.  Here are some concrete numbers for a junior high teacher:<p>7 classes per term, average of 40 students per class = 280 students total.  There are 7 classes per day of 45 minutes each, with 5 minutes between classes and a 30 minute lunch.  Teachers have to meet with students before and/or after school and monitor students between classes, so they're typically at school and busy for 8 hours or more per day with no breaks except <i>maybe</i> lunch.  You try locking yourself in a building with 1000 or more shouting young teenagers for 8 hours straight without so much as a bathroom break.<p>If a teacher assigns a homework assignment every day and spends three hours per day (at home) grading assignments, then <i>each student gets less than one minute of attention per assignment</i>.  Every student has his or her own points of confusion on the subject matter, which cannot be addressed in just one minute per day, and using class time to broadly address the questions of a few students slows down the students who don't have the same questions.<p>Notice I didn't include any time for designing lesson plans and presentations, writing grant proposals, creating assignments, or meeting with parents, let alone spending time with their families (which often enough just doesn't happen).<p>Regarding ""furniture problems:"" desks are a fixed size, they have to be spaced apart enough for students and teachers to reach them without tripping, and the classroom also needs presentation space at the front, a teacher's desk, and storage space.  Fire codes specify maximum occupancy limits for rooms.  There's only so much room available for desks.<p>Maybe you have to see the combined exasperation and exhaustion of an overworked and underpaid teacher to appreciate the level of decay present in our public school systems.  This is an area where averages and statistics are misleading.",1305507521.0

Don't waste loyalty on someone who isn't loyal back.  There's literally <i>nothing</i> in it for you; it will only bring you pain, frustration and health problems.<p>Sure, I have no problem working for an illoyal employer, and most of us do.

But, they can not expect any loyalty if things go bad.<p>If my employer refuses to compensate when people run off from the family dinner to help out during emergencies, that is acceptable.  The contract only says they are required to pay for my 8 hours per day.  But, then they should not expect me to answer the phone outside working hours; I don't care if there's a crisis at Important Customer's site.  The contract only says I have to work for 8 hours per day.<p>If my employer has a tendency to lay off people to meet arbitrary profit goals, that is also acceptable.

These commands are already useful, they can do stuff like replace strings in lines that are N lines above or below lines holding another string, and they can be leveraged further via scripting.<p>For example, a search and replace across files under the working directory:<p>tgt_string=$1<p>repl_string=$2<p>for file_name in $(grep -rl ""$tgt_str"")<p><pre><code>   do\n</code></pre>\nex - $file_name << END_HERE_SCRIPT<p>%s/$tgt_string/$repl_string/g<p>wq<p>END_HERE_SCRIPT<p><pre><code>    done\n</code></pre>\nYes, the indentation of the ""here"" script is ugly, white space before line texts can bork execution.<p>Yes, sed or awk can do very similar things, maybe better.

Hopefully my experience can help you a bit.<p>I am the lead/senior web developer at my company (a very small startup thats been around a couple of years). I am paid ridiculously little for the kind of work I do with NO benefits. I didn't realize this at first because I was so naive fresh out of college, and I didn't know that the normal entry level salary for my position was much higher. I do have a good relationship with my boss, and I've managed to talk him into nudging up my pay a little bit. However its become very clear that it will take forever (and maybe never) to finally get closer to what I deserve, not to mention standard benefits. And check this out, after over a year of working there, I'm still a contractor! (AKA, more taxes for me because he isn't willing to pay his share by putting me on payroll)<p>Your main question is about loyalty. Well, I feel the same as you. My company is so dependent on me that it really would hurt it badly if I left. And to make matters worse, I actually LOVE the work that I do. One side of me feels awful- like adopting an animal from a shelter and taking it back because I can't afford it. The other side wants proper compensation, gosh darn-it.<p>I did recently make the decision to leave, however, and it took me months to accept that I needed to. (I am currently having interviews for new jobs right now). I talked to my boss to let him know that I am leaving (and why), and I can tell he is pretty upset because he put all of his eggs in one basket with me and is going to have a really tough time replacing me. However, since we have a good relationship, he will work with me to have a good transition out of the company (and give me good reviews!).<p>I would suggest, like everyone else here has already, that you send out your resume immediately (after making sure to update it, of course). Because you do have a job and won't have to worry about money, you can really take the time to make yourself look awesome and land a great job. Look at it this way: you may feel bad about leaving because they are so dependent on you, but hopefully this experience will make them realize that they need to value and take care of their employees more.",1305506466.0

Have you been reading those, or just blog posts?<p>Blog posts are by nature superficial, and more importantly, if you're reading blog posts by people in the tech world about marketing, you're probably picking the wrong teachers to learn from.<p>As a biz book nerd, who reads probably 30 biz books a year (for the last 12 years), I've never found one or even two resources that are end-to-end adequate. What I've learned, I've pieced together from hundreds of sources, including some meant for enterprise (and adapted for my needs), like _Pricing with Confidence_, and taking vague hand-wavy inspiration (_Purple Cow_) and looking for specific, real-world actions to make it concrete.<p>That's why I created my ""30x500"" course: to be a super-concise, super-specific crash course for nerd types (like me) who want to create their first product and want to do it with as little risk of failure as possible. I teach systems. I'm not gonna really pitch it here, cuz it's neither the time nor the place, but to say that I know what you're talking about -- and the stuff IS out there.<p>It either takes digging and work to piece it together into a strategy, or a willingness to shell out for something accelerated. My course is not the only one where you can learn how to do market research -- but you're going to be hard pressed to find it in one book, or two books, or 10 books, because the strategies and techniques to reduce risk are very valuable. And they take a LOT of work to create I've spent hundreds of hours on building my course, doing research, tweaking the teaching methods & order, the metaphors, the workbooks, the homework, the supporting materials.<p>You'll rarely find that level of energy and diligence put into a business book, unless it's a byproduct of ""workshopping"" (like the GTD system was a workshop long before it was a book). Teaching workshops is vastly more profitable, and in a lot of ways more emotionally rewarding, than selling a book. So as blog posts are to books, books are to live classes & workshops. There's no equivalent reward for selling a $20 - $30 book with that kind of information in it... unless you can turn around and sell something more expensive, and leverage fame, like David Allen did.<p>That aside, there are courses & workshops where you can learn a lot more about step ",

Things you will need to do to advance your career, happiness, and earnings are often not in alignment with what your employer needs. They are not your Mom, and are only thinking of you as a resource or factor of production. Some employers are very thoughtful and truly do watch out for their employees. Many do not. Its not hard to tell the difference between the two groups as the way they do some things is the way they do everything. Things like no equity, no benefits, empty promises, no business exposure do not bode well.<p>Second, you get what you negotiate. Over time you will learn that you have more control over your 'rate' than you realize (pay, equity, etc), it's based on what you accept, not what you are offered. Also at the early part of your career you need to balance experience and exposure to things you enjoy vs maximizing compensation.
