That’s right, he didn’t have a single line of code to offer up on the chopping block. This feat lead to one of the greatest wealths in history.</i><p>This is totally wrong. This is the part taken from ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"", that movie was a work of fiction. IBM always knew Gates was buying QDOS from Tim Patterson of Seattle Computers. It is just that IBM couldn't strike a deal with Tim Patterson for QDOS or Gary Kildall for CP/M. Gates comes into picture, assures IBM that he would buy the OS from Seattle Computers, improve it and license it to IBM for a low fees. IBM didn't have any problems with that, as they never saw software as an integral part of a computer (They were all hardware companies).",1229745436

Auto-indentation based on language syntax. Auto-completion of symbols based on the contents of open files (if you've defined a constant ""MECHFISH"" in a file, and you type ""MEC"" in another file and press a keystroke, the system fills in ""MECHFISH"". Press the keystroke multiple times to scroll through multiple possibilities.) Snippets (type ""func"" and press Tab; your editor inserts the skeleton of a function definition for you). Integration with your version control system (git, in my case). Navigate from one of two dozen open files to another without moving your hands from the keyboard. Browse directory trees in panes, picking out files for editing -- or run a shell command across a bunch of selected files. Search-and-replace using regular expressions. Recursive grep through directory trees (I use emacs igrep-mode for this.)<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list. So suffice it to say that if you can't get more than a 10% ""productivity"" improvement by swapping emacs for Excel, you must be one hell of an Excel power user!<p>Incidentally, don't spend too much time bouncing from vim to emacs to TextMate. These editors take time to learn. Pick one and focus on it. Read some blogs and some wikis. Get really good at your editor of choice.",1229744745

The distance between any two separate nodes (""people"") is much lower on average than you'd think, mostly because of ""shortcuts"" or giant hubs in the network to which two distant regions can both connect. This is a huge advantage, because the increased information throughput becomes so much greater, bringing great opportunities.
