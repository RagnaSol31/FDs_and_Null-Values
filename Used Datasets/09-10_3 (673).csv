However, strong family structures tend to discourage illegal or risky behaviors like drug dealing or drug use, leading me to believe that something else must have happened to weaken them before large numbers of black men would end up in prison for drug offenses.  Furthermore, I doubt if there is much overlap between the set of ""guys who would deal illegal drugs for a living"" and the set of ""guys who would settle down with the girls they impregnated and be good fathers, if only they weren't in prison.""
