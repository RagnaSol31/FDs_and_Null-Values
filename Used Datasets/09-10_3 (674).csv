Unless Twitter does something drastic, they will end up a footnote of what not to do with a start-up. I know that PG has said before not to worry about revenue, but this is what happens. It also relies too heavily on the database, which means any time they tank the db, they have to bring the whole thing back up. Last week I was one of their biggest defenders. This week I'm pretty sure they have no interest in actually fixing the problem and running it like a business. Fail.",1211335193.0

2,195570,comment,195160.0,195160.0,0,0,trekker7,,,"Is there really anything that is truly random? I've always wondered about this. If you define random as meaning ""when rand() is called many times in a row, you will most probably get a different number each time"" then both the Perl function and random.org are random, but to different extents.<p>But if you define random to mean something like ""caused by unexplained or mysterious forces"" or ""non-deterministic"", then how can anything in the universe be truly random? Even atmospheric noise is created by a sequence of deterministic events, right?<p>A dice roll is too (brain fires synapse, I move my hand forward and release the dice, dice interact with air in certain way, dice hit table and F=ma predicts their movements, etc...). Maybe since we don't have the facilities yet to watch a person throw some dice and predict what the outcome will be, this process is non-deterministic simply because we lack the technology to sketch it out. But with sufficient technology to scan the situation and chart the end result of the dice roll based on the initial conditions, doesn't the process become completely deterministic, and not random?<p>But maybe I'm just stretching the definition of random to mean something that it was never meant to mean.",1211335140.0

Plaxo has signed a definitive agreement<i></i> to be acquired by Comcast, the nation's leading provider of entertainment, information and communications products and services. We've got at least a few months to go before the acquisition is completed, but we wanted to send you this note to let you know what's coming up and how it affects you and your account.\nPlaxo will remain an independent brand, organization and entity. We've been busy at work on our networked address book service and our next-generation social network, Pulse (if it's been a while, please come back and check out all the new features). And, through additional projects with Comcast, we'll be able to take these services to a lot more users and places than we could on our own... including the TV, phone and more.\nIf you'd like to read more about some of the great new things we're planning, please read our official announcement.\nSo, what does this mean for current Plaxo members like you? The services you know and enjoy from Plaxo will not only continue to exist, but will also continue to evolve and improve. We will continue to make our basic services free, and we will continue to serve customers in multiple languages across the world. But, we'll now be able to invest even more in our services, and we will enhance them with more users and more content available across a wider array of devices.\nWe will also continue to protect your privacy and give you control of your information. We will continue to protect your data with one of the strongest privacy policies, which will remain in effect even after the transition. And, we'll continue to be a strong advocate for the open social web.\nWe've put together a quick Q&A about your privacy, account and your data.\nLast, we'd like to extend an enormous thank you. Whether you've been a Plaxo user for a long time or just recently joined Pulse, we'd like to thank you for making Plaxo a vibrant network. We are excited to open a new chapter today and look forward to helping you keep in touch with the people you care about.<p>Sincerely,<p>Ben Golub, Chief Executive Officer\nCameron Ring, Founder and Chief Architect\nTodd Masonis, Founder and Vice President of Products",1211333068.0

There are a number of hands that are very close to 0 in EV that become positive EV with no rake. Not that many though, especially in low limits.<p>I'm sure the bot would be modified accordingly. My guess is it would add a couple percent more hands in. I'd further suspect that the increase in postflop play would then lower the bot's expectation (bot's are incredibly well suited for pre-flop play, not so much after) so though it would still do better than at a raked table it wouldn't be the 3x you'd expect.<p>It would do better though. The skill differential would be nowhere near large enough to overcome adding a hundred or more dollars per hour to the table.
