9,355330,comment,354802.0,355229.0,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Here's an analogy that may be worthwhile. We do not understand the physics of fluids very well. We are not even sure if their standard mathematical representation has general exact solutions. We don't understand the microscopic interactions of turbulence, and in many cases the system has a chaotic dependence on tiny fluctuations in the initial conditions.<p>However, we do know that in the case of most fluids, with flows of a low Mach number, gases are largely incompressible. There, Bernoulli's equation holds, 1/2 density v^2 + density * g * height + pressure = constant. It might not be perfectly accurate, but it will lift airplanes into the sky!<p>Bernoulli's equation doesn't work so well at boundary layers, such as those that form on the edges of wings. It doesn't work so well in regimes with a high Mach number, and therefore the air is compressed, such as on the edge of a propeller, or during supersonic flight. It doesn't operate so well under viscous flow. And it can't predict the turbulence which will alter the pressure and density, jostling passengers up and down in the air under rough winds.<p>Yet none of those things have affected the overall direction of the results. Planes have lift. We do not claim that airplane designers do not understand this. We just say that there are gaps in the understanding. It is not known in detail.<p>Similarly, greenhouse gas theory was only approximate. Throughout the study of climate science, people continue to add more and more to the simple physical theory, modifying the predictions in small ways. But throughout, some things have been constant. Climate change is driven by energy transfer. Energy comes from the sun, and is radiated back out by the earth. Greenhouse gases make that radiation by the earth less effective. This much isn't contested: the only question the <i>magnitudes</i>.<p>And yet, people say that 'I don't believe in the CO2 theory' or that 'humans are not contributing significantly to global warming.' This is like people saying that kinetic energy isn't proportional to the square of the velocity, and therefore ignore those insolent 'physicists'. Of course, it isn't proportional to the square of the velocity, exactly. But it isn't far off, and it's a good enough approximation unless we have reason to believe otherwise. How much reason do we have to say that the standard climate models are erroneously showing a significant temperature delta due to CO2?  Does anyone anywhere have a reasonable physical or ecological model that could saturate its effect? That could reverse its direction? The most intriguing was variations in the sun's luminosity, but that doesn't account for nearly enough.",1225942978

Saying that you might be wrong by several orders of magnitude implies that you do know quite a bit about the range of the variable.<p>By definition most judgements are based on incomplete information. Otherwise no judgement is needed. So the argument that an action should or should not be taken because the evidence is not 100% complete is spurious.",1225942959

Give them free copies of the final pro. Thats the best you can thank them. That's a lot better than paying every beta tester $50 and of a lot more value and respect to them. If its a good product they would be more than happy to get a free copy.,1225942511

23,355315,comment,355257.0,355257.0,0,0,MikeW,,,"Long answer to a short question: (It depends.)<p>Some things I've picked up from being a beta tester, to running betas, and working at a company that did betas from tens of beta testers to many thousands of beta testers:<p>- There are groups of people who jump from beta to beta, trying to get a free ride without having to pay for the software (always jumping to the next beta because it's ""good enough"" if it doesn't meet a high quality bar)<p>- There are those who go well beyond the extra mile and help shape the products giving insights we never thought of. Those people were worth far more than $25.<p>One of the teams decided they would give the final version of software worth hundreds of dollars to any tester who submitted one or more pieces of feedback. This worked to:\n  - Help links between the testers and the company long term.\n  - Was a fair way of rewarding anyone who at least found an issue or design flaw.<p>Managing a good beta community takes a LOT of time and resources. At the start of the beta I spent more time engaging with users though the bugtracker/email (which ended up establishing norms) than actual deving, but when I ended up with 3 or 4 testers who understood what I was trying to achieve and try out what I wanted - they were brilliant. So perhaps instead of trying to figure out who should get pro versions and who should not:<p>- Give anyone who gave you valuable feedback/real bugs the pro product since it's so cheap - but be transparent. Loads of testers feel involved (and feel they have the right) to something so if you are transparent about the criteria then they can be applied to everyone rather than ""top"" people. Beta tester revolts get ugly and cost so much time and goodwill.\n - Find some way of rewarding the top few testers who you have a good relationship with and <i>help</i> your development and product evolution.<p>Although just about every project has had completely different expectations, motivations and feedback loops so chop and change any advice to suit you. However in every project I was involved with: the testers felt part of a community so don't ruin that.",1225941557

27,355311,comment,354802.0,355222.0,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I have no idea why any climatologist would try to dismiss the theory that CO2 acts as a greenhouse gas. There's been nothing even resembling a physical theory floated that would contradict CO2 lowering Earth's thermal radiation to space.<p>As far as I have seen, all serious challenges to the standard climate models status quo either challenge that CO2 is an important greenhouse gas (as physics goes, the evidence for this is remarkably solid) or invoke questions of completeness: things like, have we modeled the effects of water vapor and cloud albedo well enough (we have tried to model the effects, but there are many assumptions on cloud cover that are probably inaccurate), have we modeled how the biosphere reacts properly (probably not, as it is so complicated, and new species would thrive under new environmental conditions), have we modeled the effects of lowered icecap albedo (yes, though we don't have good models for the glacial rate of decay, it's pretty universally true that as the icecaps melt, the solar thermal incidence increases), etc. None of these contest whether or not CO2 is an influence. The question is whether the other factors regulate the earth's temperature sufficiently to cause the CO2's influence to saturate out.<p>(As far as I know, the climatologist apparently commenting here was actually just quoted person from an article.)<p>Here's another example: Crichton asks rhetorically 'Look: If I was selling stock in a company that I told you would be profitable in 2100, would you buy it? Or would you think the idea was so crazy that it must be a scam?'<p>Maybe it would be foolish to buy any particular stock. But the climate isn't a good analogy: it is macroscopic, long-term, average behavior we are interested in. One can instead buy stock in something much larger, the assumption being that it will be worth more in a long time. These are called national bonds.",1225941355
