If they effect a blanket short sell ban, you're going to see quite a number of business going bust. The ETF business will be derailed. So will the options business. Companies shut down. People get laid off.<p>If they really want to stop the carnage inflicted on the financials, the should just ban short sells on the financial sector alone.",1221796748.0

Apple can point at Microsoft because they are the challenger.<p>For an established dominant player like Microsoft to directly reference Apple, then it can backfire - it's giving Apple credibility and legitimacy to Microsoft's own customers. e.g. ""If Microsoft want to respond to Apple, then Apple must be threatening them - maybe Apple is doing something right?"".<p>So whilst these ads seem ok, there might be more subtle implications.",1221796492.0

The lack of a Windows development environment doesn't seem to be costing them any serious developers for now, at least.<p>So that reason doesn't seem very speculative to me.<p>Personally, I think it's one of their core strengths that they stay focussed on what they do well (development under Mac OS X), and not try to spread out too thinly when they don't have to (clearly, they had to for iTunes; Safari's a longer shot). It might look like arrogance to you, but it might just be good sense given limited manpower.<p>And I don't think it's speculation to say that $2K invested in a blazing fast development machine like a 24"" iMac (you could also do it for less than $1K with a Mac Mini, which works just fine) is easily recouped, if you're serious about shipping an app. Even a decent $5 app that's not a flashlight should be able to sell more than 400 copies in a market of 10MM right now, moving quickly to 25MM and up.",1221794927.0

In the vote, which has a full change history, <i>nobody</i> spoke up for PeanutButter Wiki, nor were any of the sources mentioned in the comments here present in the original article. This was a totally normal, in-process deletion.<p>Should the closing admin have glanced at Google News? Probably. Note that one of the AfD votes here makes indirect references to external sources, implying that they only peripherally cover PBWiki as ""just another wiki farm"". Maybe that's fair, maybe not, but you can see why in a ""debate"" with no dissenters, this just got closed quickly.<p>The fix for this is trivial. Take the original content of the PBWiki Wikipedia article --- it's still around --- and paste it back into the article.
