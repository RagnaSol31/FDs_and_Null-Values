I mean, the most incentivized and most malevolent of people can already buy my information - and they will continue to figure out how to buy more of it as it becomes available.<p>The important thing to me personally, is that if a company has data about me, they will let me see what it is, and then allow me to correct and (in some cases) redact this information.<p>I guess what I am saying - put that database in the sky so we can all see it.  Then once the info gets tracked back to my identity, have it subject to some kind of regulation so that I can reasonably control what is available.  The database should not have any trouble finding my contact information to tell me that it knows something about me.",1253677349

Ex: I don't have to literally put out fires if one breaks out in the server room.<p>App Engine's management service by contrast is very tightly bundled to the hosting services... so tightly in fact that the cost of the management service they provide is exactly proportional to the cost of the resources I consume. It's a great deal. But we are getting off into the weeds here.<p>App Engine simplifies server admin for me. I have never had to personally 'bounce' anything for any reason. I don't worry about running out of disk space. I don't have to worry about sweeping out the sessions (on disk or db). I don't have to setup database replication.

Beyond Heritability: Twin Studies in Behavioral Research. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 18, 4. 217-220.<p>here:<p><a href=""http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/cd/18_4_inpress/Johnson_final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/cd/18_4_inpress...</a><p>The article, by some of the leading researchers on behavioral genetics, corrects common misconceptions about what ""heritability"" means. Contrary to much opinion of persons who have not studied genetics, heritability has nothing to do with what Sandra Scarr or William Angoff called ""malleability,"" how much a trait can be influenced by environmental factors:<p>""Moreover, even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability. For example, height is on the order of 90% heritable, yet North and South Koreans, who come from the same genetic background, presently differ in average height by a full 6 inches (Pak, 2004; Schwekendiek, 2008).""<p>Using twin studies to look for discordant traits between monozygotic twins provides some surprising controls on assumptions of genetic determinism in human behavior:<p>""In a related vein, intelligence and education are often associated with healthier lifestyle choices (Deary, Whalley, Batty, & Starr, 2006; Gottfredson, 2004). Controlling for genetic and shared-environmental influences, however, Johnson, Hicks, McGue, & Iacono (in press) found that both higher IQ and greater education were associated with more alcohol and nicotine use in both sexes at age 24. This suggests that the generally lower substance use among brighter and better-educated young adults results from selection on genetic and family influences contributing to an environment emphasizing both educational attainment and reduced substance use, rather than from direct application of intelligence and/or education in substance-use choices.""",1253675709

South bay is a string of ok small towns with little to no decent nightlife.<p>I've met many fine engineers, plenty of talented and smart people no doubt, but to be honest it's not that there aren't equally smart and talented people elsewhere. I consider some of the people I work with to be world class... but not better than other world class people I've had the pleasure to deal with. Many of whom are hungrier for it. More wild west.<p>The valley seems like a middle aged club with lots of sycophant youngsters willing to work themselves to death to get in. Plenty of startups rehashing ideas with the occasional, undervalued imho, gem. I think it's easy to argue that the valley is the center of the universe given the incumbent position of privilege it has. There'll be plenty more money made here and plenty more resulting mutual masturbation.<p>Maybe it was different in past years.<p>But I can't help but feel that the smartest money looking to build long term world-changing companies might be wondering.. and starting to look elsewhere for the next revolution.

Especially given that they have Flash running in the browser.<p>If I were YouTube, I would start by automatically ranking the videos by the percentage of times it was completely played but discounting times it was played completely and the page was just left open with no activity (to counteract the people who opened the page and ignored it afterwards, or left their machines idle). Discard the 5% outliers on either end of the spectrum and you should have a pretty decent idea of which videos are popular and which ones are boring.<p>After all, don't they care mostly about whether the videos are engaging?<p>It seems like there should be a ton of techniques that they should have already been using to supplement the star ratings in order to fine tune any algorithms they wanted to play with.",1253675433
