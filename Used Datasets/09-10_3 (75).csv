I would replace them with a set of photographs that are obviously related. Tell a small story. A lot of work, sure, but its your home page, make them good, even if they are a tiny part of a screen shot. This is where you get people's attention. You have the Eiffel Tower, what about other scenes from Paris or Europe as if the person was traveling? After all, people will identify with travel photographs, and hence identify with you (its one of the psychological points of selling, make yourself seem similar to the customer).",1215748367

The title here makes it sound like a business article, but it doesn't really strike me as such.<p>At the heart of the article is the philosophic question:  Do animals think in the way humans do?  Do they feel not only fear but anxiety?  Do they reason?  Or, are they thoughtless automatons, acting on instincts and learned behavior alone?<p>Turns out a lot of big pharma companies are developing doggy equivalents of a lot of human drugs like prozac and friends.  Vets are prescribing medications for separation anxiety and other behavioral problems that were once addressed soley with training (or euthanasia).<p>If human drugs work the same way in animals, what does that say out about an animal's capacity to think and feel?<p>Or, turn it on it's head:  If unwanted behavior is seen more often in animals that are in ""unnatural"" environments (for example, a horse left in a tiny stall all day, as opposed to horses in the wild), and we ""fix"" those animals with the same drugs we prescribe humans, what does that say about us?<p>Do we need drugs strictly because we lead unhealthy lifestyles?",1215748023

Why not join a startup (or technical company) now and start doing the things you want full-time instead of fitting them in around a job you don't value? You can learn <i>a lot</i> getting hands-on at the ground level, and if you want a mix of tech skills <i>and</i> business savvy then why not work at several startups (over time) and help grow them - you may get to do everything and anything from software/service design to marketing and PR. It is probably the best experience you can get if your aim is to start your own startup and will also equip you well for applying to places like Google.<p>If you really have to stay at the job for some reason, then I'd say in your spare time practice programming and building web apps around what <i>you</i> are interested and that solve problems <i>you</i> face. Launch them and see what happens. You may suck/fail at first, but over time you will definitely learn a lot, and will get better with each iteration you take - you never know one of them may really take off. You can practice business skills in growing your apps and once you have done it a few times, try doing it for other businesses (ideally in other fields too for some diversity to other markets). There are many courses/books that can teach you the skills, but if possible, find someone whose expertise you respect to mentor you.<p>Many successful businesses were, and still are, started by people in the same boat so please don't let worries about lack of skill/experience stop you from starting.",1215747373

That is <i>a lot</i> of traffic, particularly if you're good at regular old SQL performance tuning, which is what you should learn first.<p>Anyway, I haven't studied sharding too closely myself because... IAGNI IAGNI IAGNI. But here's what I remember from spying on smarter people in hallways at conferences: Pro: You get to spread your database writes over multiple machines. Con: making an RDBMS do an efficient JOIN across machines, or enforce constraints across machines, or (god help us) execute an efficient atomic transaction across machines ranges from ""annoying"" to ""<i>incredibly effing</i> difficult"", which erodes much of the advantage of your RDBMS in the first place and causes people to start muttering about alternatives.",1215747023
