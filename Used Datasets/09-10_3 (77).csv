5,202952,comment,202918.0,202918.0,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"The most entertaining and useful biographies are of people whose most interesting features are flaws. You could read about JFK winning elections despite his crippling levels of charm, and the fact that his dad was one of the richest people in the world; or you can read about Mao, who (according to the last biography I read) was disgusting and dull, but still managed to rule a large country despite the threat of coups. For similar reasons, Shockley is probably more interesting than Noyce, Jobs more fun than Woz, etc. But that depends. After thinking about the question for a little while, I realized that I don't notice that much variation in biography quality. It's there, but I'm mostly using the book to visit a historical period in the company of some interesting characters, so the author/tourguide is not such a big deal.",1212032886.0

7,202950,comment,202342.0,202586.0,0,0,cjoh,,,"Yeah-- I gotta disagree here too. As a guy who weighed 300 lbs and smoked two packs a day two years ago, and a guy who weighs 220 and runs marathons now, I spend more time (and money) paying for my healthcare now than I ever did when I was living a far less healthy lifestyle.<p>I just broke my fibula and dislocated my ankle in an accident. Fortunately I have health insurance, fortunately I have sick days at work, and fortunately I have enough money where I can pay the $3000 out of pocket it's going to cost me, even with the insurance, for the surgery I can have to walk (and hopefully run) again.<p>But somebody without insurance, making it so that they could get back into stable condition could lead them into bankruptcy and making them a burden on society. Quite frankly, I'd rather be paying to the burden of keeping that person well and making sure they can stay in the workforce than I am paying for their unemployment and bankruptcy because they can't get well because they can't afford to.<p>Universal Healthcare just makes sense and it is embarrassing that we're the only western country without it.",1212032842.0

The problem started when they went to the thick unrounded two-tone cases with silver on top (at least in the Inspiron line).  A friend ordered one of their newer ones (with the led backlight, core 2 duo, etc.) and in spite of its > $2K pricetag it has terrible build quality and flexes and groans when picked up.  It feels like a toy.<p>I am not totally writing off Dell, but it's going to take a lot to win me back as a customer.  To make matters worse, a few years ago I ordered a bunch of servers from their small business division and the way they do sales is totally annoying.  The only person you can talk to is your own rep and if he's on the phone or out of the office you get voicemail.  Also, if you don't negotiate hard (or buy small business stuff online) you get ripped by about 20% -- why can't they just publish a good price on the web and let people order it w/o having to talk to someone 3 times just so they take off that 20% markup?<p>Back to laptops -- I got a high end Toshiba and it's been great.... surprisingly, far better (battery life, heat dissipation, build quality) than any of the Dells I've had.",1212032166.0
