Seems like this was submitted in  response to the dead post calling out Atwood.<p>The two months since Github forked Markdown suggests to me Markdown isn't at critical mass, ergo Atwood's stewardship criticism seems misplaced. If he argued it could become _something_ beyond a better humane markup than those in the know, then he has a more valid criticism, and picking a fight. Seems underhanded to me.<p>Best I know, Gruber didn't intend for it to become something. It has only because it is more humane than most, and yet, it is pales in adoption compared the dearth of Word toolbar knockoffs.",1262230716.0

Everything I know about him is what I've read -- waxing poetic on software development/engineering.<p>I visited his site after seeing this post, then gleaned what might be the ""story"". This post picks a fight.<p>Atwood has a beef with Markdown and its stewardship. This has little to do with his open source contributions.<p>I'm a Basecamp, Stack Overflow, Metafilter, news.yc, Facebook, /b, Evernote and Google Docs user. Only one uses Markdown. It's the best kind of markup, agreed. I don't use Markdown in any desktop apps except Scrivener via MultiMarkDown.<p>It's under the BSD license. Atwood can fix what he feels is a poor implementation and it's going to affect his community, little else. If people feel it is better, it'll gain life and traction. He just can't call it Markdown or call on Gruber.<p>I don't agree with this post, nor do I agree with Atwood. Stewardship != license. Gruber scratched his itch. He gave other people other itches.<p>Seems pretty grand to me.",1262229718.0

So all their product development was bent in that direction, causing some otherwise good ideas to miss hitting the customer need because there always had to be a tie-in to selling more licenses.  Seems to explain a lot of the failures that are outlined in this piece.<p>OTOH, any company the size of Microsoft has a lot of failed ideas, or poorly executed ones.

I was exactly the same way at 24, a nerd who couldn't hold a conversation with the opposite sex, had rejection after rejection, and was pretty depressed about it too.<p>I consciously decided to ""improve"" myself. Here are things I did:<p>1. Improved my wardrobe. Believe me, it makes a difference.\n2. Consciously taught myself to listen, and ask questions that will lead to more conversation.\n3. Consciously taught myself to gauge the level of interest of the other person. Move on if the other person isn't interested - as they say, there is always more fish in the ocean.\n4. Push the envelope a little bit ... the man has to push - you have to ask for the phone number! And it is a good way to gauge interest. \n5. Don't forget that some level of IQ compatibility is critical. Just as ""they"" don't want the nerd in you, may be some of the ""airhead"" types aren't great to be around for you either.<p>Let me just say that I hit success after consciously doing it. It is like doing a start-up. Know your strengths and know how to compensate for your weaknesses - a superior IQ can help you figure out how to compensate :-)",1262229259.0

They asked me, a fellow student, questions like ""Why would you ever use pointers?""  The thing was, I think my lack of ""jargon"" made me explain the answer better than the professor did.  Hence the other students asked me, not the professor.<p>It seems to me that fancy terminology such as ""referencing"" and ""dereferencing"" is not only not common sense, but it also makes it harder to understand things when you are starting out.  Perhaps as professional programmers it makes it easier to talk about algorithms between each other, but jargon is generally for the sake of exclusivity, not for the sake of convenience.  I would even go so far as to suggest that anything that can be said with jargon can probably be said better with simple language.<p>What beginning programmers are learning these days is jargon, and the definition of jargon terms, but they aren't learning what the meaning of those terms is.<p>There is a big difference between learning the definition of something and learning its meaning.",1262228555.0
