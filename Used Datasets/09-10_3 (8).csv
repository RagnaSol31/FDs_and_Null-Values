This might lead people to believe that deep nets are working so well because they are more fundamentally capable of representing the solutions to problems that people care about in a terse way.<p>But this work proves (at least for this audio task), that there are solutions as good in the solution space spanned by shallow nets with memory usage that we can afford, we just didn&",
