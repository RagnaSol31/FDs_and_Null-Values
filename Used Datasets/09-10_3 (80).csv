6,748948,comment,748102.0,748255.0,0,0,bavcyc,,,"""(in fact, we invented the insulin injection) on government funds.""<p>Easily found on the internet:  Insulin injections developed in the 1920's, socialization of Canadian medicine began in the 1950's.  No link between the two events, not clear in your post if you are arguing this or not.<p>According to:  <a href=""http://www.canadianaconnection.com/cca/banting.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.canadianaconnection.com/cca/banting.htm</a>, funding during the summer of 1921 was from his family.  Not sure as to the accuracy of this website nor do I know of other sources as to funds for the research.<p>If you would like to supply references as to the funding of the insulin research and development being government funded then please do so.  Just because research is performed at a university does not mean the funds are from the government.<p>Your point and others in this forum is that socialism is better, Kamen and others disagree.<p>Personally I think US Medicare is a good example of why government programs are not the best.  Doctors do not want to accept new Medicare patients due to lack of money, one article I recently read had a doctor state the cost for one supply was as much as could be billed by the doctor.<p>The US system is quasi-socialism at the very least.  Since government is partially controlling costs via one program (if you consider Medicare and Medicaid the same) and access via other programs/legislation including the tax laws.<p>One item to consider in this debate is that in the US at least since Hamilton, influence has enabled legislation to be enacted to favor your point of view, aka a mercantile economy.  Such that you can not in the least bit consider the US Health system as non-government influenced.<p>The only expensive medical procedure I've undergone was paid by the insurance company at around $.50 to the dollar amount billed by the doctor and hospital.  I paid around $.10 to the dollar.  This raises the question as to how much of the cost is actually price inflation by the medical establishment to ensure they can pay their actual costs.  Some items when price compared to the local pharmacy had a mark up of 200-500%, this was only for a couple of items I remembered while waiting for an order to be filled and is not a rigorous assertion on my part.<p><a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/17/1/225.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/17/1/225.pdf</a> has some interesting data regarding Canadians visiting the US medical system.  The point I saw is that when the northern system reduced the amount paid in Oct 91 (page 226 of the article) the subsequent amount spent was significantly less, chart on page 229.  Not sure the data would allow analysis as to how much voluntary/elective payments were reduced as my quick read suggest some of this was transferred to private insurance.  And this particular study indicates only 3% of expenditures in the Canadian system are to out of province providers.<p>Highly recommend that you read 'The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism' if for no other reason than you know what you are arguing against.  Free Enterprise is the best solution to any problem unfortunately like pure communism, it is not found in its pure form due to human nature.",1249703438

23,748931,comment,747748.0,748568.0,0,0,moe,,,I just looked at couchdb-lounge because I'm very interested in partitioning and hadn't heard about it.<p>The wiki unfortunately left the important questions unanswered. Does lounge handle the rebalancing when new shards are added/removed?  Do I have to take the cluster offline to add new nodes? What are the failure modes (e.g. a node failing and coming back)? How is a replacement node bootstrapped?<p>Since none of that is mentioned I have my doubts that lounge is handling it adequately. But I'd be glad to hear otherwise!,1249701748

28,748926,comment,748824.0,748909.0,0,0,dehowell,,,"Z bosons decay into a lepton (electron, muon, or tau particle) and its anti-particle. Those decay products pass through a magnetic field and eventually collide with a material that absorbs all of their energy. Measuring the path of the leptons (in particular, the deflection caused by the magnetic field) allows you to determine their momentum. The intensity of the collision with the stopping material is used to determine the energy.<p>Knowing the energy and momentum allows one to calculate the path. Gravitational forces are also acting on those particles, and any changes in their paths caused will change the final calculated mass.",1249701605
