Two years that you spend working on your startup is two years of lost income (~$200K+ for decent software devs), or two years that could've been spent getting an MBA or grad degree, or two years when you're not partying and getting laid.<p>As for actual monetary costs - paying people to do things is the main one.  Legal fees can rack up quickly if you want an actual corporation - easily a couple K for a barebones S-corp if you do it with decent lawyers.  If you have employees - well, you know how much you could get paid, then increase that by 50-100% for overhead.<p>Software and hosting costs were essentially zero - for basically any web stuff, you want to be using free software anyway, and you can get cheap hosting for like $10/month ($80/month if you're doing something weird and need a dedicated server) that's perfectly adequate for trying ideas out.  S3/EC2 also can result in really cheap hosting if you're not using much capacity.  If you need to scale it'll cost you, but if you get that far you're doing so much better than 99% of startups that you'll welcome it.<p>Biggest unexpected costs for us, by far, were founder buyouts.  My remaining cofounder and I each dropped a grand to buy out cofounders that weren't pulling their weight - and while it was totally the right choice from the POV of preserving the relationships (one of those bought out later led to 2 job leads for me when the startup folded), it would've been even better to not bring them on board to begin with.  Be very careful who you start a company with, and make sure you each have the same level of commitment and goals for the company.  Buyouts can be as expensive as divorce, and usually lead to the death of the company.",1238729873.0

If you're short and fat, you won't be one, no matter how much you practice.  Michael Jordan was an incredible natural athlete.  It's true that he's more than that: there are lots of incredible natural athletes who end up working at gas stations, and maybe some of them would have made the NBA if they had been as willing to fail as MJ.  But if you're not naturally athletic (or extremely tall), you will never be a great basketball player.  Period.<p>The second problem is that the fear of failure is, in the right context, fantastic motivation.  You will never do anything well if you don't care about it, and if you genuinely care about something, you will come to hate failing at it.  I've never met a good chess player who took losses well.<p>My suspicion is that it's important to do a lot of practice where failure is cheap and a lot of practice where failure hurts.  But I'm not a very successful person, so I have no idea.",1238729050.0

I didn't realize they were doing that as well.<p>This is very disappointing.<p>I run a niche social news site, so I've spent hours and hours comparing and studying what's out there.<p>Most social news sites are, spammy SERP factories.  They lift other people's content in the hope of getting enough Google mojo that their site will outrank the original source of the content in SERPS.  That's the business model.<p>For a long time, the easiest way to tell the difference between a legit aggregator and a crummy one was to see where their headlines pointed.<p>If you go to a crummy aggregator like Mixx.com, the headlines on the front page don't point you to the site whose content they're lifting, they point you to a Mixx summary page where there's just a single blue link that will lead you to the source of the information.<p>Obviously this is done to boost pageviews and to keep the user on the site, rather than letting them get to the information they're looking for.<p>This always seemed like the obvious way to do things.  Lame, too.<p>And yet Digg and Reddit's headlines have always sent you to the actual sites.  And I really, really respected them for this.  Whenever I'd see a new social news site doing something sketchy, I'd take comfort in the fact that the two biggest players were also the ones taking the most generous, ""good"" approaches.<p>I guess it was only a matter of time before one of them gave in and did something that's actually worse in some respects than directing to a summary page: hijacking the brand, URL, and advertising of the sites that it links to.<p>Digg is a very influential site.  As disappointed as I am in the company for doing this, I'm even more worried about other sites looking at this and saying ""fuck it, we're doing it too, now.""<p>Imagine if every link on CNN, NYTimes, MSNBC, WashingtonPost.com led to framed pages.<p>We all complain about mainstream news never linking to the sites it covers.
