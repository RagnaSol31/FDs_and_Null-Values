3,790698,comment,790671.0,790671.0,0,0,zck,,,"The comparison to homeschoolers seems a bit off. First, there are very few other students in a homeschooled kid's class. It makes sense that a kid will do better in a class of two or three, rather than eighteen or twenty. Additionally, kids with involved parents do better in school, and parents who homeschool their kids usually are quite involved.<p>It seems obvious that it's better to group kids by ability rather than age. Of course, that can lead to forcing kids into unchangable ""tracks"", where little Jimmy can never get back to where the ""advanced"" kids of his age are, but that shouldn't be as much of a problem if the classes are mixed-age.",1251431364

6,790694,comment,789517.0,790511.0,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Well my experience with doctors was, at around 7 I was diagnosed with eczema due to clusters around my elbows. At around 10 a doctor performed a scraping, which produced pin-prick bleeding that is Auspitz's sign, so pretty much guaranteed psoriasis. At around 17/18, after having had psoriasis for 10 years I went to the doctor because the large patches (some were as large as the palm of my hand) had turned smooth and slightly yellow in the middle, but still appeared to be psoriasis on the outside. He said I'd 'obviously' been misdiagnosed as it was clearly ringworm and he started me on a broadspectrum antifungal.<p>The antifungal barely worked, but UV is known to be a treatment for both fungal infections <i>and</i> psoriasis. After my first round of antifungals I had a vacation scheduled for the south of France, the infections got better, but when I returned to the UK and by the time I'd got another appointment it'd flared up again. This occurred several times, after my third round I had basically a 2 month vacation in France and no medication. By 6 weeks the ringworm had cleared up and when I returned to the UK my doctor confirmed I was clear.<p>I visited my regular doctor again (not the one I'd dealt with the ringworm with as he was more specialist, plus on vacation) and she was amazed at my lack of psoriasis, except she confirmed (with a Auspitz's sign) that I <i>still</i> have psoriasis of the scalp.<p>I've always visited the south of France and Spain and a lot of other mediterranean destinations and none of them ever cleared up my psoriasis, it often went into remission but the scaling remained. So this makes me believe the ringworm (due to it removing a lot of the plaques) allowed the psoriasis to go into complete remission, which removed the food for the ringworm (it had only infected my existing psoriasis and not the rest of my body).<p>The ringworm left me with discoloration for about a year and I was fortunate enough not to get psoriasis nor ringworm on my nails (they can turn them into claw-like things). I wouldn't advocate it, but 25% of psoriasis patients get a fungal infection, so many might get lucky enough to have it happen to them too. It certainly didn't outright cure it, but I believe it acted as a catalyst of sorts that helped to remove it (I still have psoriasis, but it no longer covers 20% of my body, in fact it only occurs on my scalp, where the ringworm fortunately didn't spread to).<p>I have, however, read of tape worms being used for the treatment of a few other diseases, including Asthma and IBS (Crohn's specifically IIRC). Incidentally 50% of children with Asthma and eczema/psoriasis have the same defective gene (for filaggrin production), it's also believed Crohn's and hayfever (a condition I also have, but has severely diminished since my psoriasis has cleared from my skin) share the same gene. For asthma and crohn's there is already 'Helminthic therapy' (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helminthic_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helminthic_therapy</a>), which typically uses pig whipworm, which is only transitory in humans (IE it only lives a short time). Not only does it have higher success rates than medicines, but it also has less severe side effects (hookworm I believe has higher success rates, but causes more people to have side effects and carries slightly worse side effects).<p>Perhaps in time helminthic therapy will spread to psoriasis treatment, as in theory it should work with any autoimmune disease. Hope this gave you some more info, personally I'd vote for helminthic therapy over ringworm for treating psoriasis, as the side effects of ringworm (whilst generally benign) can be very visual; the discoloration only stayed for about a year with me, but can apparently last considerably longer. I'm sure many women would prefer stomach cramps than potentially life-long discoloration of the skin (at the beginning it seriously looked jaundice in places).",1251431191

I've also had data in custom formats that is naturally graph-like, and it was trivial to produce visualizers by writing scripts to convert the custom format into ""dot"" syntax.<p>One idea I have is to use ""dot"" to give auto-layout capabilities to a GUI that has a simple canvas.  Right now, any data set that wasn't created by a GUI user (e.g. automatically generated) looks ugly, because it has no useful layout information.  Since ""dot"" knows how to do layout, it would seem possible to run it in the background, parse the results, and use the node positions to make the default canvas look much more intelligent.",1251430281

26,790673,comment,790036.0,790538.0,0,0,tel,,,"Biochemists use easily hundreds of different techniques to elucidate, logically or probabilistically, details about cellular processes. They take serious advantage of techniques like optical properties of solutions and selective targeting of fluorescent tags to visualize effects. Moreover, they tend to abuse the very nanomachine proteins they're trying to study in order to study them further.<p>A simple example (the names are removed to make this easier to digest, but if you're curious it's the action of Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase in glycolysis) involves a protein which is known to play a part in the breakdown of glucose. This protein catalyzes the addition of a ""high energy"" phosphate to our compound so we can break it down further while also pulling off a reactive hydrogen (and adding it to NAD+ to make NADH) so the cell can use that later (another kind of energy like ATP).<p>Biochemists, assuming they can already purify the compound and know the overall reaction, investigated the action of the enzyme by mixing in a highly reactive fluorescent-tagged molecule that looks similar to the product of the reaction. This molecule bound permanently to the inside of the enzyme which was then denatured and sequenced, looking for whatever amino acid showed the fluorescent tag (cysteine). Then the inserted modified reagents which contained radioactive hydrogen and phosphate to figure out where exactly those molecules ended up. In this way they learned where the enzyme added the phosphate to the product and exactly which hydrogen was removed from the initial compound to make that NADH.<p>Biochemistry is a really fascinating story of minute triumphs of discovery. Unfortunately, like any part of science like that, it means that the day-to-day life of a biochemist is backbreaking and tedious. Regardless, if you're interesting, there is a lot of fun stuff to study.",1251429544
