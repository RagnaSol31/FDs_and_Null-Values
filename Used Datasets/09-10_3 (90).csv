Without that guarantee, there's nothing to prevent you from closing down tomorrow and taking your investor's money (less 10%). With my first startup, my partner quit after 24 months, and walked away with all his stock, despite the fact that it took two more years before we (I) sold the company.<p>Common Stock - Just because they're asking for common stock, doesn't mean they can't build additional terms into the investment agreement. The fact that they're asking for a board seat means they want rights beyond what common stock would normally grant them.<p>Conclusion - Irregardless of whether the ownership percentage is fair, $25k shouldn't be worth your time. Take the two months you'll burn getting this deal done and put it into developing your product. Also, just the least bit of legal shenanigans (and if it's a VC, there will be shenanigans), and you'll have to hire a lawyer which will eat into the $25k.<p>Now stop screwing around on Hacker News and build your product. ;)  Wait until you have a working beta, with users and some press, then go get yourselves a real deal.",1211428701.0

Proper intuition is your mind giving you hints based on the patterns of past experience. It's knee-jerk wisdom.<p>If your mind isn't giving you any hints, you probably need more experience. There are many stories of mathematicians and theoretical physicists that steep themselves in theorems and test results and then, during a break, a eureka moment happens and they cross the inductive gap. But it couldn't have happened without the massive amount of mental preparation.<p>Another example is what Go players do: they don't just guess at the right move, they have a feeling about the right move based on vast experience of many patterns. Then they back up their intuition with reading (for the non-Go realm, research and evidence).<p>I guess with startups, the thing to do is just keep at it, try to make the right decisions and reflect on their effectiveness as you go along. Eventually your intuition and judgment will start to become more reliable.<p>I realize you asked about instinct, not intuition, but they're related. Instinct I think is more reactive and less reflective than intuition. You're probably looking to improve the latter.",1211428626.0

They needed it for credibility and marketing in the past but at this point the GTAIV marketing machine did just fine without Samuel J Jackson or Ray Liotta doing voices.

But if you're multiplying 2 numbers together 10 times instead of 5, is it really significantly more efficient to use map? I suppose map/filter vs. list comprehensions/generator functions is really a matter of personal taste.</i><p>I don't understand what you mean here. No matter how many numbers you're multiplying, the result is that you're doing twice as many as necessary. Now, with list comprehensions (and a generator for efficiency), it could have been written<p><pre><code>  squares_under_10 = [sq for sq in (n*n for n in numbers)\n                      if sq < 10]\n</code></pre>\nThat is the best of both worlds if you are against the use of map and filter.<p><i>And 'Test is False' doesn't have to evaluate to True... if it is false, it is still the value returned by the entire expression.
