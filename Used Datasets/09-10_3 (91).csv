This is why DB consultants charge $200+ an hour.  It's pretty arcane knowledge, and for a business of any size, the database quickly becomes the lifeblood of the organization.<p>This is also the reason that databases like Couch DB or Amazon Simple DB or Google's App Engine are so appealing.  They all have the promise of reducing db management headaches, at the cost of sacrificing features.",1235879303.0

For instance, you mention that these minorities are under represented in certain colleges to begin with - a place where a lot of startups begin.  Perhaps there is less internet exposure too, or at least to the startup community blogs etc..  And maybe it just comes down to a perpetuating loop situation.  In any case, and I don't really know US attitudes, but I would doubt in this day and age there is a conscious effort among hackers, who are generally more liberty and equality focused anyway, to exclude people based on anything other than merit.",1235878856.0

What I am hearing is that lots of hackers have issue with moving to ATL due to perceptions with tolerance.  Fair enough.<p>Now if we ever started writing $1 million checks it would be interesting to see how people would vote with their feet.  In my day job I get inquires from all over the world from people that would move to Georgia for a little help.<p>Thanks for the article that inspired me and the spirited discussion.,1235878578.0

12,498741,comment,497951.0,498682.0,0,0,tom4370,,,"As a MS grad of the UNC CS department who has spent time working with researchers at both Duke and NC State, it's interesting to me to think about why we don't have a thriving startup culture.  I certainly know people who have gone through those programs, stayed in the area, and are interested in startups (as both founders and places to work).<p>My perspective (which clearly can't cover all the students in those programs or hackers in the area) is that a small number of successful (ie, more profitable for the founders than taking a job with IBM, Fidelity - before the layoffs, NVidia, SRA, SAS, or one of the other, non-tech focused companies in the area that suck up tech grads) would go an extremely long way in jump-starting a startup culture.<p>Heck, I wonder if semi-decent mentorship  for founders from people who actually got something out-the-door would be more helpful than just having some VC opening the checkbook.  I always think of SV as kind of nirvana, where joining a startup with some decent chance of being successful is much more a normal story than it would be here in RTP.  I think a big part of the lack of a startup culture here is that people create interesting software, but then kind of sputter out on getting it in front of people.  Maybe RTP has the tech talent to be a startup hub, but lacks a local and cutting edge,technically-driven customer base?  Or the critical mass of like-minded founders is what we desperately need as pg speculates in his essay?  Certainly the focus at the big three universities isn't on startups . . .<p>All that said, in my peer group, several people have gone on to work at small, startup type companies in RTP.  But it seems like the common story here for hackers who ""make"" it are ones that seem to involve consulting for one of the bigger companies in the area or maybe less commonly developing software in 1 or 2 man shops on a custom basis (ie, roll-your-own ERPs and whatnot) for comfortable income.<p>I think RTP is getting closer to being more startup-oriented, but we (the area and hackers in it) need to be more driven in becoming entrepreneurs.  But I don't hear hackers in RTP say anything about being satisfied with a nice beach house . . . I'm not defending the RTP hackers too strongly here because I do think we are missing some critical piece of what a startup culture needs but I'm not sure we can chalk it up to ""passivity, complacency, and parochialism.""<p>I would love to hear other thoughts from HN readers in RTP or with connections to it (ie, did you do school here and head to SV?).",1235878073.0
13,498740,comment,498647.0,498647.0,0,0,DenisM,,,"Try a commerical database, such as Microsoft SQL Server (FD: I work there as a developer). To bring up a recent example, it can build indexes without locking the whole table so you wouldn't need to jump throught the hoops like the FriendFeed guys just did with MySQL. Unless your time is free it will cost you less to buy SQL Server than to write your own ""online index thingie"" on top of MySQL.<p>And if your time <i>is</i> free, then you are probably a startup and you can get SQL Server and bunch of other MS tools for free via <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/BizSpark/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/BizSpark/</a><p>MySpace runs on SQL Server: <a href=""http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/steve_jones/archive/2009/02/18/myspace.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/steve_jones/archive/20...</a> and if it's good enough for them it will likely be good enough for your site as well. I'm not sure if the scale-out story is any good (there are ""partitioned views"" which are basically ""sharding"" but I never used those), but scale-up story is as good as they come - it can efficiently utilize 64-cores of the HP superdome.<p>I don't know much about Oracle and IBM DB2, but I know that the latter has a free version without too many restrictions on it, so give them a spin as well. If ease of use is importnat to you, common wisdom has it that Microsoft's is the easiest to use among the top commercial vendors. NB: I did not verify the common wisdom, YMMV :-)",1235877902.0

26,498727,comment,498431.0,498431.0,0,0,decius,,,"I've lived in both cities. A few points:<p>1. Quality of life in Atlanta is good enough that smart people could be convinced to move here. Its warm, there are good restaurants, there is good shopping, there are funky neighborhoods and bars, its a short drive down to nice beaches where the water is actually warm enough to swim in. Hell, I've been snowboarding 4 weekends so far this season within a few hours of town. It does not have a national reputation for being ultra-hip, but as I said in the other thread, I don't think that matters. In fact, around the turn of the century (am I allowed to say that yet) neighborhoods in SF that were hip and trendy and neighborhoods in SF that were dripping in startup money were mutually exclusive, and being anyway associated with the tech industry was just about the most uncool thing you could possible be there even though everybody was.<p>2. There are some people who wouldn't move to Atlanta, for reasons that are both reasonable and unreasonable. However, the same thing can be said about San Francisco. Some people will not move there because they don't like the culture or they are worried that they are going to die in an Earthquake. Atlanta does have an undercurrent of racism and that does bare repeating. But its not a death knell for the city as a center for innovation. We have a very diverse community here who can work together and produce great companies.<p>3. Atlanta has a vibrant, multifaceted nerd scene with various strong universities, technical user groups, cons, parties, mailing lists, web sites, facebook groups, etc. In fact I find it far easier to get networked in with other nerds here than in San Francisco, where scenes tend to be a bit more snobbish, exclusive, and corrupted by the presence of wealth. There are some things I wish were going on here that aren't, such as a genuine hacker space, but in general the ""scene"" here is strong and growing stronger at a regular pace.<p>4. In addition to the aforementioned nerd scene, I think the things that matter are the right legal framework for innovation (which I explained in the other thread, and I do not agree that the differences are trivial particularly with regard to intellectual property laws), and a supportive environment of investors and incubators. The later seems to be improving, but unfortunately the stock market crash has made everything more difficult.<p>5. I strongly agree with jhaynie that Atlanta has got to look at its individual technical strengths. There are certain technical communities that are particularly strong here. Innovation is not about copying San Francisco - its about leading, on the world stage, in terms of the direction we need to take technology. For example, this is a time when every business in world is asking itself how it can reduce its costs. Our concentration of industrial engineers may have new answers to that question that you aren't going to get out of Palo Alto.",1235876656.0
