Those companies require 6 to 10 hours of grueling interviews and the real questions are <i>much</i> more difficult than the ones listed in the previous Business Insider article on the topic (at least for programmers). They couldn't list typical technical questions in that article because 99% of their readership wouldn't even understand them.<p>I've never been a fan of this kind of blind arrogance in the finance industry.

If the mother makes a considerable amount more than the father, the logical step is for the father to take the maternity leave meaning the household has a greater net income when it has greater expenses. There's no sense struggling to make bill payments, and increase stress on a relationship over money issues.",1259379986

The coordinated aspect of their fraud -- exemplified in the leaked emails -- adds a damning, worrisome aspect to the whole affair.<p>On a sociological level, this is a very dangerous situation. The impact of human endeavor and pollution on global climate is almost impossible to judge on a local personal level, so the public must have faith in the scientists we elect to study this problem.<p>Criminal charges would send a strong, immediate signal to scientists in all areas of research: check your personal opinions at the door when processing data. We are all human but if we allow this kind of thing to creep into all areas of research we risk undermining the very scientific underpinnings of our modern secular approach to public policy and, ultimately, the governance of our natural resources.<p>Scientific research must remain balanced.<p>As an aside: the people behind the economic crisis are not in jail, but they should be. Just because they have so far escaped the reach of justice doesn't mean we should lower our standards for other blatant crimes just because they are of the white collar variety.",1259379600

14,964766,comment,964697.0,964748.0,0,0,zck,,,"A good answer is something that gets you to the right order of magnitude that would be absolutely correct if your assumptions are correct. For example, the number of piano tuners in New York:<p>So there are eight million people in NYC. Let's say that each household is two people, on average. So four million households. Because NYC is crowded, not many people have pianos in their homes -- let's say one in fifty. So 80,000 pianos. Let's double that to account for the schools and concert halls, so 160,000 pianos. On average, let's say a piano is tuned once every other year. So each year, there are 80,000 tunings.<p>A piano has 88 strings, and let's say a trained tuner could tune about two per minute, so a piano takes forty-five minutes to tune. If the piano tuner knows where he's going, and makes appointments accordingly, let's say it takes another forty-five minutes to get from one appointment to the next. So ninety minutes is one piano tuning. One tuner works 50 weeks a year, 40 hours a week, so 2000 hours, or 1333 tunings. So 80,000 tunings / 1333 tunings per tuner = 60 tuners in NYC.<p>Of course, that assumes each tuner works full-time. If we assume there are part-time tuners, that number only goes up. I'd round to 100.<p>You see, the point isn't to get the exact number; the point is to show that you can figure out impossible problems.",1259378996

25,964754,comment,964613.0,964713.0,0,0,niels_olson,,,"A few details are a little off, but mostly correct. Excess consumption of carbohydrates does not cause a sympathetic stress response. Cortisol (the primary adrenal stess hormone) is actually stimulated by <i>hypo</i>-glycemia.<p>The carbs do account for metabolic syndrome (a somewhat out-of-fashion term for the prelude to type 2 diabetes mellitus). The carbs do account for excess body fat. There are a lot of causes of fatty liver. Fructose is a particular problem because it bypasses the pancreas's natural insulin response, which collaborates with grehlin and other hormones to induce satiety. Better to simply say fructose, more than other carbs, contributes to the obesity problem.<p>As for the addiction issue . . . there's some evidence that carbs actually lower serum dopamine concentration, though regional concentrations in the brain may vary differently, and are likely more important. Dopamine usually spikes after satisfying and addictive urge. So addiction is probably not the right analogy.<p>I alluded to what I believe is a better model in the first paragraph: fructose eludes the satiety response. So you become hungry at the sight of food (the cephalic phase of gustation), and even though you eventually become satieted, the calories derived from fructose didn't contribute to the natural negative feedback relationship.<p>Here's a somewhat simplified feedback diagram I made on the issue, which reflects the review and feedback of Dr Todd Berstain at University of Iowa\n<a href=""http://nielsolson.us/Haversian/2006/12/nutritional_model.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nielsolson.us/Haversian/2006/12/nutritional_model.htm...</a><p>The movie King Corn does a good job of explaining the economics (<a href=""http://www.kingcorn.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kingcorn.net/</a>), and it just so happens that the corn breeds we have lead to a <i>lot</i> of fructose.<p>If you plot obesity rate over time from 1900 to now, I think you'll see a significant change in the US obesity curve around the time Earl Butz, Nixon's Secretary of Agriculture, changed the focus of farm policy toward corporate monoculture.",1259378142

So if climate changers couch their arguments as ""Pay attention or the human species will go extinct!"" it's really a non-starter.  If you really care to start a discussion, try instead: ""Pay attention or the entire Eastern seaboard will be flooded in 2020!"", or, better yet, what I say (as a Christian myself), ""We are commanded to be good stewards of God's creation, which means not polluting/raping/short-term-thinking.""<p>To be very specific, I think one major obstacle is that many Christians consider God's promise to never flood the Earth again (Genesis flood, Noah) as a guarantee that God will not allow a sea-level rise to wipe out a ""significant"" percentage of humankind.  That's a misconception that's significant to the debate but rarely addressed by either side.",1259377849
