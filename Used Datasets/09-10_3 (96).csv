2,428766,comment,427292.0,428237.0,0,0,mhartl,,,"The Federal Fair Housing Act (which you linked to) isn't meant to force bad loans, but that is an inevitable consequence.  Briefly, the Act has provisions such as the following (<a href=""http://www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/lending/index.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/lending/index.cfm</a>):<p><i>The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to engage in the following practices based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or handicap (disability):<p><pre><code>    - Refuse to make a mortgage loan\n    - Refuse to provide information regarding loans\n    - Impose different terms or conditions on a loan, such as different interest rates, points, or fees\n    - Discriminate in appraising property\n    - Refuse to purchase a loan or set different terms or conditions for purchasing a loan</code></pre>\n</i><p>The problem is that creditworthiness is correlated with some of the forbidden factors.  For example, a bank denying loans to applicants with low incomes will, as a side-effect, disproportionately deny loans to African-American applicants, simply because African Americans have lower incomes on average than other ethnic groups.  In order to avoid penalties for discrimination, banks must therefore lend to people whose credit doesn't justify the loan.  (Of course, this was never the intent of the Act, but it's called the Law of <i>Unintended</i> Consequences for a reason.)",1231646317.0

16,428751,comment,428489.0,428709.0,0,0,shimon,,,"I'm not interested in ""learning how to beat the test"".  I'm interested in understanding the experience of an interrogation, from both the perspective of the interrogator and the person being questioned.  And I'm wondering if a form of role play would be a feasible way of exploring that experience, without going to the trouble or risk of committing a crime or becoming a police detective.<p>There are clearly lots of aspects of interrogation that are difficult in uninteresting ways, like sitting still for many hours.  But the reason TV/movie interrogations are so intriguing to watch (and, I imagine, to act) is that they represent an unusual and intense interaction between people.  People who are trying to manipulate each other in real time in pursuit of some valuable information, and willing to break a lot of normal social boundaries in that pursuit.<p><i>That</i> certainly sounds like it entails some interesting psychological challenges.  If I think I'm secure, relatively free of anxiety, and willing to engage in those challenges, maybe it would be a revealing and worthwhile endeavor?",1231645651.0
