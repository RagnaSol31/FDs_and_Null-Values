Seems like the same sorts of tendencies that make nerds responsive to caffeine probably apply to stimulants in general, especially noting the long-held poetic association between creative, focus-based tasks and tobacco. I also know more than my fair share of ADD types (in a noticeably classical kind of way) who sincerely regard it as a form of viable self-medication.",1252382214.0

That's a good article and sums up some of the major debates around latin american microfinance.<p>The problem with for-profit microfinance is that, as a general rule, financial performance increases with loan size, and that's why commercialization is a cause for concern, along with a lot of the other baggage that comes with commercialization like pressure to increase profits and employee incentive programs that negatively impact service toward small clients.<p>Compartamos accounts for the problems of the small loan market (notably the inability to determine which borrows are good or not) the same way moneylenders needed to before them, by charging very high interest rates. But this ends up screening out lower end borrowers, hence the discussion of ""mission drift.""<p>Commercial banks have long dabbled in elements of microfinance, but there are fairly concrete obstacles, mostly operational and information-related issues, that make it tough to be profitable, and even tougher to approach it as strictly for-profit while continuing to be actual microfinance.",1252381001.0
