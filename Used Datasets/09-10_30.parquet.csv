It could still happen, and it does happen all the time.  These are not risk-free activities, even when performed with all reasonable care.  Of course, there are more and less extreme ways to engage in these activities, just as there are more and less extreme ways to use drugs.<p>You could, for instance, drive really recklessly, speed, or drive drunk.  You're exposing yourself to more risk this way.  Likewise, you could dive in more dangerous waters, and expose yourself to more risk.  There are also known dangerous drug combinations, like mixing opiates and alcohol and going swimming.  (In fact, mixing most any drug with alcohol is probably a bad idea, but there are some that are more dangerous than others.)  And just as there are safer ways to drive or scuba dive, there are safer ways to use drugs.<p>Saying ""we don't know what the fuck this thing does"" is not really true for most drugs.  Most drugs do have rather well defined effects.  Of course, when you're dealing with black market drugs, the risk is greater that you won't get the drug you're expecting, or that it'll be cut with some other drug you weren't expecting, or that the dose will be different from what you expected, but there are ways to mitigate these risks.  And not all illegal drugs need come from the black market.  There are legal sources of illegal drugs, paradoxical though it may sound.<p>The other interesting thing is that not all drugs that are illegal in one place are illegal in all other places (or times, for that matter).  And there are plenty of legal and yet quite dangerous drugs (like alcohol and nicotine, not to mention a plethora of prescription and even over-the-counter drugs).  So the legality or illegality of a given drug need not have much to do with the its danger.  In fact, the scheduling (ie. ""illegalization"") of some drugs has often driven people to use more dangerous legal drugs.",1308477084.0

The code to do this was in a loop that executed twice. A CPU register set to zero the first time round and set to 0xffffffff the second time round, to use as a mask.<p>All control register changes were then performed in the loop, with changes to the control registers masked by the mask register so that no changes were actually made the first time round the loop, but all code was loaded into the CPU cache, then the second time round the loop changes were made and the memory+CPU put to sleep.<p>The MIPS CPU was quite nice, because when it woke up after this all state was preserved, so it just carried on as if nothing had happened. And memory contents were preserved through standby as well, so it was all fairly simple.<p>This is in contrast to some ARM CPUs I've used where when they wake up after sleep, they jump to the reset address, so the boot code has to be aware of sleep/wake operations, which was a bit of a pain.",1308475253.0

Having failed twice by lack of funding I learned to do without and what people want.<p>Free anonymous internet you want to pay for: Ambient Connectivity. \nAfter 20 years of hard work I am about to roll out a much more ambitious approach:<p>(1) free gsm for mobile phones in a square mile. (2) free Wifi for smartphones/tablets/laptops. (3) 'campus' network with your neigbours with 1 - 10 Gb/s ethernet links over optical fiber or UTP cable. (4) free shared storage of tv, movies, music. (5) end-to-end encryption and anonymity in the clients, not the network, no logon. (6) users buy the routers $100 ($1000 rural) and the 2-4 cables.(7) Open ISP sells 1000 Mb/s traffic at to pay for the backbone and the free traffic (1 Mb/s per user). (8) Open ISP can not control anything and proves this by allowing the community to audit their routers<p>A first-mile network with free mobile and wifi traffic on top of a 1-10 Gbps optical fiber (and UTP) last mile with an non-profit ISP behind it. Crucial is the $100 mesh router I designed, a 10 GBps optical 8 core router with wifi and picocell built in, capable of software radio with. We also use off the shelf DD-WRT and PicoBSD based $50 routers.\nWithout the cheap 10 Gb/s the community network will be too slow. We must compete with FTTH and the telco's. Stringing optical fiber over private property (farms, backyards, roofs, between appartements) is key to the freedom part. \nThis will be my fourth commercial internet provider, one is now big. merik@eigenglasvezel.net Co-fonders wanted.",1308474204.0

But for the worst case, consider keeping all of your records. Just be true to yourself what you have seen and say them to solve it. If you know how to solve, possibly, you can ask them some money saying you can fix it.",1308474110.0
