What's useful or not changes in times, you cannot necessarily know what's useful to you when you're 15, and you could argue that one of the role of education is to teach you things you will never see otherwise (to expand your horizon).",1302343013

It could have been any one of: RTTI, nested classes, smart pointers, the rules of inheritance and access control, friends, exceptions, operator overloading, streams and so on. All of this is well described but in about 1000 pages in Stroustrup's book.<p>> At the beginning we created a coding guidelines/standards document that outlines what is acceptable to use in the project. Problem solved.<p>Well that was actually one of my points. If you need a 50 page language style guide, then I would argue there is something wrong with the language. The whole K&R book is just a couple of hundred pages.<p>That is why I would believe someone who says ""I know C"" vs someone who says ""I know C++"".<p>I guess I just don't see the advantage of learning the ""++"" part of C++ vis-a-vis the resulting increase in readability/productivity.<p>> Ok, we can compare Python + C++ with Python + C, but C++ wins there too. e.g: PyQt/PySide.<p>Well, maybe. Most Python extensions are still written in C. Python itself has a native C API. There is the ctypes library. For every Python & C++ library integration there are hundreds of Python modules with their performance critical parts written in C. The reason PySide is so nice is because they were able to hide the C++ part very well behind Python.  It is certainly a development success story, but what I had in mind was the process of implementing the prototype in Python, then finding the performance critical parts and re-writing them in C.",1302342976

Almost certainly in the case of the second graph, because Apple has a higher marketshare and the same mathmatical trick that makes them look good against the Samsung who sell 1 in 4 phones, would make them look bad against the samsung that used to have 5% of the smartphone market but are catching up to and probably overtaking Apple soon.",1302340737
