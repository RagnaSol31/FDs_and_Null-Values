That includes any type of hardware hacking, full-stack networked distributed apps, mobile apps, gaming platforms, experimenting on new OSes, etc.<p>Common Lisp is better on maturer platforms, while Scheme is like a little wedge that you can slip into cracks to open it wider, before you sneak in more and more Lisp. See how Kawa does Java applets while Common Lisp does the web server, etc.<p>Common Lisp is the 1-wood/driver, Scheme is the putter. To use a golf analogy.

11,2087981,comment,2086738.0,2087021.0,0,0,jcr,,,"Other than EVDO (""3G""), my only other connection options at my home are\nsatellite (which sucks) and dialup. Ironically, I live on the hill above\nthe most connected place on earth, the silicon valley. On the bright\nside, it's very beautiful up here.<p>When I was healthy enough to tinker and test on my OS, the vast majority\nof my network transfers were due to downloading OpenBSD snapshots to\ntest, binary packages, and updating CVS. Each snapshot is about ~280MB\nand depending on the arch/platform, they get rolled a couple times a\nweek. I have a lot of different archs and I (used to) test on as many as\ntime/health/bandwidth allowed. Unlike other open source projects,\ntesting snapshots in OpenBSD is an important and continual process. Even\nwhen you're testing patches (i.e. compiling), the expectation is\neverything else should be at the current snapshot. The snapshots are\nessentially the baseline maintained so the patches/development are your\nonly delta.<p>BTW, the open source stuff is mostly FTP/HTTP transfers.<p>Though I do have a bittorrent client installed, it maybe gets used two\nor three times a year, only for small files, and without upload\nreciprocity due to the caps.<p>There's also very simple web browsing (without scripting by default).\nThese days, most all of my time is spent reading, and a lot of the\nreading I do is keeping up with tech developments on the web. Once or\ntwice a week, I might indulge in a conference/talk video, but if the\nfile is too large, I won't bother. Also, about once a week I'll pull a\n(legal) anime video that's about 250MB.<p>My total network transfer ranged between 5 and 8 GBytes a month when I\nwas doing active testing, so by comparison to other home users, it's not\nthat much.<p>I seriously doubt I need to remind you but for the non-network folks, file sizes do not accurately reflect total network transfer sizes due to protocol overhead. The Verizon bandwidth caps are based on total network transfer.<p>The most interesting, and sometimes frustrating, thing about the Verizon\ncellular network is the filtering. They do some fairly brutal things to\nreduce bandwidth usage and prevent ""abuse"" as per their unstated\ndefinition. For example, if too much ICMP traffic originates from your\nsystem to a particular host, it is silently blocked by their filters.\nAnother example would be their handling of POP3/SMTP protocols. In\nminimal usage (i.e. checking mail six to twelve times a day), the\nVerizon filters insert delays. If mail is checked ""too often"" (i.e.\nidiots who configure their phones to check mail every 10 seconds), the\ndestination address is blocked completely. Some of the things Verizon\ndoes in PPP are also wonky, but more or less it works well enough.<p>The ""excessive use"" throttle (filter) on old ""unlimited"" accounts like\nmine only kicks in when a rolling average (three months I think) of\nusage continually exceeds the 5GByte cap. I haven't seen it happen in\nmonths but if memory serves, it gets limited to 128Kbit/s and only lasts\nuntil the end of the monthly billing cycle.<p>Needless to say, Verizon refuses to divulge any information about their\nfiltering rules/triggers but even a novice at network monitoring can see\nthe results in action.<p>The latency can be annoying on EVDO (""3G""). Part of it is caused by the\nnature of wireless/cellular communications crossing the distance, but\nthe other part is caused by spectrum resource limits of the towers and\nthe corresponding on/off dance the radio in the modem does. A good way\nto grasp the problem is, you use a lot more spectrum when you're talking\non your cell phone than when it is sitting idle in standby mode. It's an\nunderstandable limit of the engineering/design; Cellular data networks\nare simply not designed for ""always on"" operation.",1294652653

Base rate neglect is due to an inability to calculate a conditional probability properly - assuming P(A given B) = P(B given A). In a similar type of fallacy, looking at the joint probability of 95% or whatever of businesses failing and saying you only have 5% chance to succeed is nonsense.<p>First this frequentist approach is inapplicable to the real world (Taleb's thesis actually) and secondly you have to look at it as your degree of belief of success given: team, communication ability, industry, environment, economic state, competition, potential usefulness, market saturation, skill, climate, education, timing, confidence, willingness and dozens of other variables. This will , can only be a rough estimate. So don't just look at arbitrary success stories but don't just look at arbitrary failures either. Pick a set of criteria and look at all those most similar to you, whether they be analogues or dopplegangers.

Their main function is to nag authors to get their work done.<p>I've heard ""[book] publishing is broken"" over and again, and it's true. Tech publishers only pay peanuts, so authors get pushed to finish the book quickly (if they start at all), so the quality isn't very good, so people don't buy many books, so tech publishers can only afford to pay peanuts...<p>Sadly, not much has changed for the major tech publishers since the late 90s at least, when Philip Greenspun wrote about his experience in 1997: <a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/dead-trees/story"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/dead-trees/story</a><p>That said, there are publishers which give their authors a better deal -- Pragmatic Programmers for one (which Peter Cooper discusses -- see link in his comment), who pay 50% as discussed here: <a href=""http://pragdave.blogs.pragprog.com/pragdave/2009/10/pragmatic-bookshelf-royalty-rates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragdave.blogs.pragprog.com/pragdave/2009/10/pragmati...</a> .
