Cultivating that idea in the public mind is the aim of that mistranslation, because the false idea of a genocidal Iran garners more worldwide support for the Israeli Government.<p>> That doesn't mean Ahmadinejad isn't a threat to Israel.<p>The only people threatened in any serious way by the Iranian regime are the Iranian people themselves. The idea that Iran poses a threat to Israel or the West is merely the public story to garner support for any military action.<p>Iran is surrounded by the largest military super-power in history, and has a hostile and aggressive neighbour who is armed with a significant number of nuclear weapons. Iran's military posture is defensive, and all serious military analysis does not regard Iran as a threat. A politician talking things up for a domestic audience does not qualify as a serious threat, but it certainly helps feed into a narrative for Western audiences.<p>The nuclear ambitions of Iran are also clearly defensive. North Korea remains untouched where Iran's neighbour Iraq is completely overrun. Obtaining nuclear-power status delivers much more political leverage, but that's it. Iran's leaders know any move to aggression would quickly result in military annhilation by Israel / US.",1334310975.0

On the other hand I'm trying to use `wemux rogue` but I get the following:<p><pre><code>  wemux rogue\n  unknown command: rogue\n  To see a list of wemux commands enter 'wemux help'...\n</code></pre>\nAnd wemux help does not list `wemux rogue` as one of the options. I installed it by following the `brew install` process in the README.,1334308485.0

A lot of end users go to sites for flash content, I don't see how this ""rodent"" category gets to be made up, is that ads you are referencing in a specific way or do you have a visceral reaction to adobe flash ?

For example, if you are in the UK and want to sail to the caribbean you should sail down the portuguese coast, then sail to the Madeira archipelago, wait there for the trade winds to start (sometime in October or November) and only then cross the atlantic (there are variations on this theme but you get the idea). This is because it is much harder and unconfortable to sail close to the wind (that is at a small angle to the wind, say 45 degrees) than it is to sail downwind (with the wind behind you) or reaching (with the wind from the side of the boat). This is still true to this day and it is interesting to see that we still do the same routes today.",1334308007.0
