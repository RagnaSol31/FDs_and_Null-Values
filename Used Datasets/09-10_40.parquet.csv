I certainly had no idea what I wanted to do coming out of high school. I wanted to be a veterinarian, but didn't get the marks to get into that degree programme, so I ended up doing bioinformatics, and then eventually wound up doing a computer science degree double major with history and philosophy of science. And I love my job now, working as an academic in technology ethics. But if you'd asked the straight-outta-highschool me about what I'd be doing in 10 years time, she would have had no idea I'd be where I am now. Going to university helped me to work out which path I wanted to take. Granted, I didn't go to an American university, and it somewhat depresses me to hear about how university is pointless etc. because I had some amazingly good courses and learned a lot at my university. But that was back when it was still well funded by the Australian government and less of the corporate entity it's become. So who knows, really?<p>Anyway my point is that university is not just about coming out with a piece of paper, it's about exploring possibilities and different paths. And if you go to a good university that focuses on actually teaching interesting stuff rather than churning out pieces of paper, then you'll actually get something worthwhile.",1298885923.0

You absolutely can do it in one step if you are motivated enough and can sell yourself. With $10k you can expect to live for at least 3-4 months in a cheap fashion(carless, renting with roommates) in the Bay Area. So start by planning for a long vacation out here - get a weekly-rate motel, AirBnB, or go couchsurfing. Go to the local hackerspaces, go to meetups, make some contacts. Get a good demo side project together. Maybe complete the demo, then quit your job and move. If you like the demo as a product, you can try pitching it. You might need funding to take it further, but that route is as possible as a job in the current environment.",1298884124.0

Recently (after Adblock extension for Chrome came), I have noticed a big drop in my Adsense revenue. My pageviews are still the same, but the number of clicks have reduced very much.<p>Has anyone else noticed this or it's just because people are not clicking?<p>Also, on an average, my 60% traffic is from IE, around 20% from Firefox and 10% from Chrome and Safari.<p>So, if Adblock makes its way to IE also, will we see a massive drop in clicks (which means a massive drop in Google revenues)?",1298884111.0
