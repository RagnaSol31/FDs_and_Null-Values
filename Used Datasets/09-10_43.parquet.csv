Every once in a while I'd manage to convince a friend to fly out and tag along for a few weeks, thus putting one of those dreaded dates on the calendar, but in a good way.  Along the way, I picked up a partner who was doing pretty much the same thing.  We've scaled back the traveling a bit recently, but I did manage to drag her around South America for 7 months this year.<p>I'd recommend going by yourself if you have the choice.  You just plain meet more people that way, and you don't run the risk of killing off a perfectly good friendship.  On the road, you'll notice the same pattern a lot of times:  two English girls who have been traveling together for a couple months and have clearly tired of each other's company but are too polite to suggest they go their separate ways.  They're miserable, neither one getting to do what they really want, and forced to eat every meal together even though they've already exhausted all the conversation they could ever come up with.  Sit down at their table and you'll instantly have two new friends.<p>Another benefit of traveling alone is that even as an introvert you'll periodically go into ""emergency survival social mode"" where you realize you haven't spoken to anybody in four days and you need to make some friends Right Now.  And you will.  It's as simple as walking up to any random gringo and asking ""where are you from?""",1286186106.0

When I visited Beijing and area - the multilane roads weren't connected with overpasses and ramps like the American system.  This resulted in incredibly slow traffic.

Just push on with the next thing and really just move forward as fast as you can.  What I find is that I very rarely remember the content of what I learnt before, but I do remember where to find an easily accessible resource that refreshes my memory quickly.<p>The rationale behind this approach is that a) the brain (at least mine) is fantastic at indexing information - but not so great at putting it in its long term memory bank.  And b) that it probably works this way because it doesn't want to store in long term memory stuff that it doesn't have to.  So it takes a note of what it's seen, gives you a little index to let you find it again if you need it - but discards the rest.  It'll store in long term memory the stuff that you come back to over and over again...<p>It's also important to bear in mind that particularly when you are starting out in a learning endeavor you really have no idea what of the basics you're really going to have to have memorized in a rote fashion.  So don't fret it.  Learn it, take a note of it, move on.<p>edit - part of what I hate about schooling in general is that they force you to rote learn heaps of stuff you probably won't ever use.  And the brain hates it.  No wonder kids in general hate school.",1286184873.0

As someone who gets paid to work on a popular open source project full time, I can tell you it's often way harder than it's worth to get involved.<p>You need to download and get the code running on your computer, and configure everything to run correctly.  You need to learn the ins and outs of how everything works.  You need to install and learn about the code the project depends on (and, most projects will have numerous vendor libraries).  You need to get acquainted with the main developers on IRC, so you don't step on any toes.  You have to learn how they do bug ticketing, and you need to find bugs you can do.  And your first code review?  Trust me, it'll be painful.  It's not easy to get started.<p>If I left my job today, would I continue to contribute?  Sure.  But only because I already have a foot in the door, and know my way around.<p>All that being said, I truly believe universities should require students contribute to at least one open source project- it's a great learning experience, and the projects and their users benefit from the volunteer labor.",1286183347.0
