You're happy and rejoice.<p>- The next year, before  you're about to renew the licensing agreement, the procurement departament asks several competing companies (mostly big contractors) for a ""similar"" product (where ""similar"" means, cheaper, with more or less the same functionality).

But I'm not sure if there's any job out there in the internets that can be taught in a short timespan.</i><p>That's a cool idea. On of the easiest that comes to mind would be chopping Photoshop files for Wordpress themes or HTML/CSS templates - it might seem somewhat daunting but if you gave her a starting point she would basically just have to cut and paste into the right parts a lot of the time. Even though there are tons of people already doing it I suspect that finding and partnering with a good designer would still be quite profitable. Depending on her English skills, another option would be getting into SEO - there's still a lot of room for growth in that market and the technical requirements can sometimes be fairly minimal. Copywriting might be an applicable related field, whether in her native language or by offering translation services from English to her native language (obviously depends on her English reading and what her native language is).<p><i>she's a financial director [I dunno what they call this position] in the biggest company in the city</i><p>A more industrious option might be to try leveraging your combined experience. There are endless opportunities for providing very basic and extremely niche enterprise apps which pay pretty nicely. She may have some ideas in this regard related to her job, either for an application that would make a common task easier or that would just compete with a complicated app. One of my favourite models is to compete with a complicated ancient piece of enterprise software by <i>reducing</i> the feature set and offering it for cheaper.
