1,552495,comment,552112.0,552164.0,0,0,matt1,,,"Thanks. You'd be amazed at how quickly the names are going. When I went back right before this launch, I checked a few of the names to see if they were still available and was blown away by how many were registered in such a short period of time. If you're thinking about registering a name on Twitter, you'd be wise not to procrastinate :)",1239184380

Developing economies generally have higher rates of growth than more advanced ones, so the fact that Russia had higher rates of growth than the seven most advanced economies in the world is fairly meaningless. In fact, there was debate at the time about whether the G7 should expand to include Russia, since Russia's profile didn't match the others'.<p>And second, how much of the cumulative growth from 1999-2007 was due to astronomical energy prices? I don't think it's  absurd to point out that for half of the period you mention,  energy prices made Russia's economy appear much stronger than it was in reality. The same happened in the late 1970s and the early 1980s with the USSR. Many attribute the USSR's implosion in large part to the collapse in energy prices in the late 1980s/early 1990s, since the failings of their centrally planned economy couldn't be concealed any longer.",1239184360

Nope, but I'm a realist, so yup.<p>Second page: These machines are basically the same hardware-wise, but lets say their names a few times. Since they're the same hardware-wise, lets discuss things that don't affect the computer, hardware or software wise! Also, be sure to bold their names no more then 3/4 the time though!<p>Third page: Lets reprint the same information from the previous page, again! This time, using ugly colors that don't go well together. Then we discuss what most consumers care about; the price. And recommend other notebooks that we didn't even discuss!",1239184181

If for instance it's a movie DVD using something like CSS (remember DVD Jon?) and you access it's content by breaking the CSS ""protection"" then you're right. Basically if you need specific codecs or circumvent certain ""protection"" layers it would probably be something that you might want to check with a legal expert. In any other case where you want to access a plain DVD, AFAIK this is completely legal anywhere in the world.",1239183366

An adult (or older) male penetrator is not considered homosexual in this culture, nor is an adolescent (or younger) male penetrated.
