Between this and BitTorrent Live, are we going to see something that will blow every model of content distribution, including BitTorrent, out of the water?<p>If nothing else, torrents with version control would frankly be mind-blowing. Think of a single TV show torrent, which could be updated again and again.

It's kind of like asking, ""Which is faster?  A car or a typewriter?""  Well, a decent typist can put out 100 WPM on a typewriter, and a decent car can go 60 m/s.  So it depends on where you are going.  If your goal is an essay, then the typewriter is faster.  If your goal is the other side of town, the car is faster.<p>The big disadvantage of locks is that performance decreases with contention, and performance of a shared-memory system in general degrades as the number of nodes increases.  So every supercomputer in recent history uses a hierarchical approach: a network of multi-core units.  Shared memory and locks for sharing data with cores in the same unit, message passing for sharing data with other units.<p>Just imagine trying to use system-wide locks on the IBM Sequoia.  It has something like a million cores.",1356772132.0

82,4981567,comment,4976923.0,4979979.0,1,0,mpweiher,,,"Suddenly ""Governments"" became ""the US Government"", odd how that happens.<p>First, <i>governments</i> have done so in the past. With this alone your point is trivially false by simple observation.<p>Secondly, the US government, like other governments, can <i>change</i> the law.<p>Thirdly, if you haven't noticed, governments are sort of at the top of the food chain, so they can (and do) not bother changing, but instead simply ignore the law, which they do <i>all</i> the time.  So you have a judgement against a government, how are you going to enforce it?  Ask the same government to send its own police against itself?  Good luck with that.  March on Argentina?  BYOA  -  Bring Your Own Army.<p>Fourth, one thing that countries like the US can do that neither families nor corporations can do is <i>inflate</i> away their debt.  This is of course one of Krugman's criticisms against the Euro:  that countries there have given up this ability, and so the only way to try to get rid of the debt is so-called ""austerity"" measures, which aren't really working in those countries where they are being tried, as GDP drops faster than the debt and therefore the crucial debt-to-GDP ratio gets worse rather than better.  Also: free entertainment in the form of riots in the street.<p>Fifth, as Krugman keeps pointing out, the government is not really some separate entity.  Most of the debt is debt we have against ourselves, within the family, to stick with the analogy, it doesn't actually make the family poorer.  Unlike, say, a mortgage.<p>Sixth, with the power to raise taxes, governments have a pretty secure way of ensuring their earnings base, unlike families or corporations.",1356772037.0
