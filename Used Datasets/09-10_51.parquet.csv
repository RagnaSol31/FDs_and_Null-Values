Over time, we get over it, and learn to see the underlying structure of the code.<p>About the deeper problem of ""thinking in OOP"", I wrote a small tutorial[1] about the first step: avoiding mutable state where you can help it.  The second step is to remove loops (even the recursive loops as well).  Instead, use `map` and `filter` (the bulk of list comprehension) where you can.

He references this to show how even a turing award winner does not like FP.<p>The only thing that I would directly releate to FP was that she: ""I think programms are fundamentally about manipulating state"". Therefore she did not like the FP back in the 70s.<p>So I will try to show that thats a very bad reference.<p>1. Today FP languages are mostly about only using state if there really is state not like in OO where you just use state everywhere.<p>2. Try to be more clear where the sideeffects happen --> dont interleave the sideeffects with the computation. In Haskell you even have to be explicit where you use sideeffects.<p>in imperative (in VB)<p>for i = 1 to 100<p><pre><code>    print computeSomething(i)\n</code></pre>\nnext<p>while in FP you would<p>(print (map computeSomething (range 1 101))<p>(I know that thats not 100% the same output but I hope you get the point)<p>3. She was doing Systems Programming for the last 30 years an yes at that level there is lots of state but at a high level there does not need to be that much state INSIDE the programm.<p>More generally speaking:<p>All the typical OO features FP languages can provied. For example Hierarchy are totally interleaved with the rest of the programm. In Clojure you can use Hierarchy if you really need a kind of animal -> dog Hierarchy-System. Even better because its not interleaved you can have two Hierarchy-System on the same ""object"" without them disturbing each other. The same with Polymorphism.<p><a href=""http://clojure.org/multimethods"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/multimethods</a><p>I don't want to say OO is very bad I like just like the decision CMU takes here.

The best follow-up to that is to ensure you do everything within your power to keep these people working for you. How you do that ultimately defines your companies culture. Listen to your staff.<p>I visit a lot of different companies in my line of work (IT Recruitment Consultant). I deal with small, niche software houses, global telco's, etc. and the atmosphere between companies varies immensely. Some places you will walk in to the floor where the developers are working and you could hear a pin drop, others can be vibrant, energetic and loud.<p>There is too many different schools of thought on what a companies culture 'should be'. The fact is, every company is different. If your staff & clients are happy and your company is making a profit then you are doing well. If you have ticked those boxes and you get really good people approaching you looking for work because they have heard good things about you & the company then you are doing great.",1300698360.0
