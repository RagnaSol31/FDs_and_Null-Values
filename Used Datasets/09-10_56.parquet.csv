Some people at Sun (Oracle) can say it's unfair to take Java language they developed and offer it in Android without paying anything to them. And Steve Jobs can say it's unfair to use ideas from iPhone Apple spent years working on in Android without even asking them.<p>The original post was about MS & Apple being anti-competitive by using patents. To me, using a dominant position in search/ads market to crush competition everywhere else is no better. This is exactly what Google is doing.<p>You should ask yourself a question: will you be better off when Google one day dominates web, search, mobile, browser, possibly even desktop OS markets and desktop software and there will be no Apple or Microsoft and everyone will be forced to play the same game as Google? Will it be better off for everyone to make revenue on ads and pay Google a 50% share?  I don't think it's going to be very good. This is why I would like both Apple and even MS also be players in the mobile if they offer good products. Competition, not domination by a single company is what actually drives innovation. Whose ideas will Google steal next when Apple is out of mobile business?",1312624787.0

It gives one the impression that the author knows what he is talking about.<p>I don't know how motivating this article would be to someone without training in probability theory, though. I mean, it's all well and good to be factually correct, but showering people outside of the field with technical terms and ""weird"" claims can, I think, be very counterproductive.<p>Concerning the theorem itself, no effort was actually made to at least rephrase it in a more friendly way. It's not enough to just poke fun at yourself with ""(trumpets sound here)"". Many people, even with formal mathematical training do not intuitively understand why it is true, and without that, applying it for probability calculations would feel like hollow and mindless mechanical work.<p>To that effect, I also recommend Eliezer's explanation, found at [0]. I must admit that I kind of glossed over it, because I had the correct intuition regardless of not formally knowing the theorem (no idea how to reproduce that, unfortunately, because it would be a pretty good tool), but even so, I found it both funny and informative. And as a bonus, it doesn't assume that you have any rigorous training in mathematics (a common misconception among mathematical explanations).<p>[0] : <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes</a>",1312624778.0

The reason we have social security is because people don't save what they need to.  If you don't have this, most of the population will be in poverty when they retire.

10,2853524,story,,,1,0,onepostaccount,Ask HN: Would giving your homemaker spouse a salary be unethical?,,"I have my own private registered consulting company (just me and my co-founder) and work from home. My wife spends all here time taking care of our kid and the house.<p>My question is would you consider it ethical to give her a salary out of the company? Let's assume that legality is not an issue since I can fool the law by saying she works as a consultant (since she is as qualified as me in the same field). But the fact is that I also bounce of lots of my company related stuff with her.<p>The sole reason to pay her salary is to avoid taxes. My company has accumulated quite large sum of money and if I pay it all to myself, I have to give out 1/3 as tax. I reduce tax by splitting the salary with her. To me, she is as hardworking as I am, makes lots of sacrifices for my company (I have to frequently work overtime). We don't have a maid or a cook and no outside help. She does all things herself. Partly, I am fooling myself into thinking she even deserves a salary :-)<p>So, anyway, what would you hacker news people do in such a situation? Would you consider this ethical (if that's the right word)?",1312624248.0

If you yelled ""f*ck the police"" in the hearing range of an American cop you'd probably be identified and harassed. What's at stake is a social compact that we respect free speech and privacy.  Real name policies violate that from the outset.  Of course, it keeps comment sections civil but you don't go to a random bar with a sticker stating your full name and address.

Twice it has tried and been outbid, not by a single competitor but by a group of them joining together. In fact, that's where, to me, the real antitrust issue surfaces, that by joining together to squeeze Google out of two auctions, Google's competitors appear to have been plotting against it in ways that really must invite scrutiny, which, by all reports is now happening again.""</i><p>I think this is the main point of this story and this whole issue, and that's what Google wanted to show us. If Google can't  even get patents to protect themselves, because all the others keep banding together and not letting them win any auction, then something is very wrong here.<p>You may say, yeah but then why doesn't Android have its own patents? Well, I don't think it would've been possible for them to get that many patents in this short amount of time, and I don't think it would've been possible for Apple either.<p>Look at Apple, they are winning with patents <i>not</i> related to smartphones. If Apple wasn't this 30 year old computer company, their patent chest would've probably been close to zero, and a lot of these companies would've come after them, too.<p>Here's a look at the <i>mobile</i> patents everyone has. You can see Google is not in top 10, but take a closer look - neither is Apple.<p><a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/the-biggest-ip-war-chests-08042011-gfx.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/the-biggest-ip-war-ches...</a><p>So what would've happened if Apple didn't have any of their computers patents from before, and they actually were a new smartphone company? They would've probably gotten sued into oblivion as well, especially since they seem to make a lot of money from iPhones. Their handful of mobile patents would've meant nothing in the face of the mobile patent war chest of Nokia, Samsung, Microsoft, HP(Palm patents) and Motorola.<p>You can't create something as complex as a smartphone and a smartphone OS today, without infringing a <i>ton</i> of patents. So if a new mobile company can be crushed because others have more patents than them, then what does that say about the patent system? It says the patent system does nothing to  protect and encourage innovation, but it lets the big incumbent companies crush the new guys with their large patent war chests. It's bad enough when it's just one of them, it's much worse when they all join together against that company.<p>If you can't build anything complex, without being a 10+ year old company (in <i>that</i> market) and not having thousands of patents - then something is very wrong with the patent system that was supposed to help start-ups and innovation. I think they all know this, but since they know they have the upper hand with current broken system, they will fight to <i>maintain</i> the current system.",1312623394.0

If the government wasn't taking money from people via taxation to pay for pothole fillers, then the taxpayers would have their money to spend on what they really want, which would also maintain the virtuous cycle.  What you see is the pothole fillers spending money, but what you don't see is all the people who had their money taxed spending less.  (If the taxpayers weren't spending their money, it would be in banks being loaned out to other people who would be spending it.)<p>If what you're talking about is Keynesian government stimulating the economy in bad times by going into debt, that could also be accomplished by cutting taxes rather than borrowing to pay pothole fillers.",1312622086.0

62,2853468,comment,2851470.0,2851797.0,3,0,A1kmm,,,"I agree with pg - but for a different reason.<p>In the past, one of the most significant limiting factors on business growth has been the cost of human labour, and technological development has focused on working around this limitation, eliminating manual jobs and creating jobs improving the technology.<p>However, as the world population grows and certain very important finite resources, such as fossil fuels, become severely depleted (especially fossil fuel reserves that can be extracted with less energy than the fossil fuel contains), these resources become a more important limiting factor than human time.<p>I therefore predict that in the future, far more work on technological development will go towards sustainability, and less will go towards minimising human labour. Employment will rise, while the price of anything which is not sustainably produced will rise in real terms relative to the cost of labour.<p>Due to the relatively higher costs of energy intensive transportation, I expect that there will be some degree of reversal of globalisation with respect to physical goods (but not other industries). Technology will probably play a role in allowing one family or small local community to do locally what currently takes a global network of large companies.<p>I think inequality will still be a real risk long term - if we ever reach the point where the food production system can be completely automated, and everyone had at least enough technology / capital to produce what they needed to survive and be healthy, poverty would be eliminated - but if only a few people owned all the capital, and squandered most of it on luxuries while others starved, that would be a significantly worse outcome.",1312621748.0
