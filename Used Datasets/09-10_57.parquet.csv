Do you know enough about accounting, finance, revenue, and cash flow? How much would you benefit from a couple of marketing classes?</i><p>I learned all that from starting a business, though I had an abiding interest in the underlying principles and came into it with a great deal of self-taught theoretical knowledge.  But I agree that if it weren't in my disposition to do so, I'd have been at a huge disadvantage.  It takes a certain kind of person to learn what he needs to know in spite of formal education, otherwise tunnel vision and compartmentalisation become a substantial hindrance.<p>Bottom line: you can compensate for lack of college, but it's not a smooth ride.  It takes real work.  It's mostly a question of cultivating the right kind of habits of mind.<p>Also, I have a hidden advantage not shared by most of my fellow dropouts: I come from a family of academics, and spent most of my childhood and adolescence on or near college campuses.  The imprint left by the organic outcome of chronic exposure to the background radiation of this kind of ethos probably made dropping out more survivable for me than for many people.",1332669552.0

5,3752200,comment,3751893.0,3751893.0,2,0,doug1001,,,"i just had a look at their homepage (in slick 3D). My initial reaction was--ok these guy are attempting what Linden Lab was trying to do with Second Life-in-the-enterprise (a project that LL eliminated about two years ago, but which showed promise for a while as evidenced by IBM's sponsorship); in other words, a virtual workplace rather video-conferencing (eg., gotomeeting.com). But then reading the typically perceptive and relentlessly skeptical comments from the HN community pretty quickly convinced me that my interpretation was a little over-extended to say the least, but as a former Linden, probably inevitable.",1332669463.0
6,3752199,comment,3751926.0,3752158.0,8,0,anonymous5421,,,"No offense but I think your post is wrong in pretty much every respect (and I say this as someone with an ivy league undergraduate degree and nearly done with a Top 10 law degree).<p>You say people are harmed in their careers by lack of a college degree. This may be true in some of the more traditional, salaryman-type career paths.  But there's lots of people who are harmed by college/graduate school! Tons of debt and years wasted on useless degrees are a tremendous drag on people's development and growth in their knowledge and careers. And if one has a positive and open attitude, there's way better opportunities one can find than the traditional salaryman type office jobs.<p>Also, as someone with an Ivy league degree I find your citation to ""doors opening"" and the recent Presidents just kind of amusing. It's true that you can go to an Ivy League school and do well and do things coming out of it. But the people going into an Ivy League school are often either 1) hard-driving people who'd do well in any setting, or 2) connected people whose families are going to make their lives easy no matter what. So it's not the school doing any of the heavy lifting in terms of these people's success. And on the flip side, there's way more Ivy League barristas then Presidents!<p>Finally I've always found the ""well-rounded person"" thing to be a huge myth. I've gotten way more out of the Internet -- reading forums, learning about books, interacting with interesting people, doing online courses etc -- than I ever did in college. And not like 50% more, but orders of magnitude more. The ""well-rounded person"" thing is just some sort of conventional meme/rationalization for school attendance that doesn't have much content. They don't teach quality ideas in the humanities or social sciences (except <i>maybe</i> economics) -- so you don't really become a well-rounded person, and if you're not in some hard sciences or math program you don't really learn anything at all in general (for context, I was a social sciences major). You just become a person who's been exposed to some weird mixture of stuff taught because of Tradition, and whatever faddish developments are going on in your field.<p>And yeah, Jobs took a typography class before dropping out. But if you want to learn stuff, there's way more effective ways than college now.<p>Our culture has a very strong pro-school bias, though that's starting to break down (LSAT takers were down 16% this year!!) People bucking the norm like OP are a big step towards a better and more critical attitude towards education, and one which I think would help lots of people be happier in their lives.",1332669440.0

I'd like to add a couple of thoughts:<p>To all the developers who think they wouldn't learn anything in college - how are your English skills?  Marketing skills?  Do you understand the theories behind price elasticity or scarcity of resources?  Do you know enough about accounting, finance, revenue, and cash flow?  How much would you benefit from a couple of marketing classes?<p>It boils down to this: how much difference would a basic understanding of other subjects (marketing, economics, English, other languages) make on the success of your startup?  What about your career in general?<p>So much of what I learned in school, both undergrad and graduate, came from subjects where I did not already have experience.

38,3752167,comment,3751926.0,3752158.0,1,0,abalashov,,,"All good advice.  I agree that before pursuing this path, one should be reasonably sure (as much as that is possible) that one will never wish to do something in a profoundly credential-driven setting.<p>However, I also would venture a guess that a lot of doors hitherto closed to non-graduates are going to open in the future, as the realisation slowly overtakes the next generation or two that universal four-year education has been greatly oversold relative to its price, at least, to the 90% of undergraduates who are going to university out of the sincere conviction that this is necessary in order to make a career in something decidedly ""vocational"", such as PR, advertising, real estate, insurance, accounting, etc.<p>Markets do have a way of rationalising around these types of inefficiencies eventually, if allowed to do so.<p>Also, if one cannot sustain a great deal of self-motivated, omnidirectional intellectual curiosity and well-roundedness as a matter of disposition, of habits of mind, then this path is probably not the right one.  On the other hand, can college correct these deficiencies?  I have never seen an example of schooling instilling these life-affirming traits in someone who did not already possess them in some measure.  I realise that, pragmatically speaking, incremental improvement is the goal.  However, you and I both know that the overwhelming preponderance of undergraduates shuffle in, through and out of college without experiencing a great deal of this ostensible intellectual growth.",1332667811.0

Now if you're a solo act or working for a small company that isn't an issue -- but in a larger company (you know the ones with benefits!) it becomes a dead end.<p>In fact I'm ashamed to admit it but I now feel at a disadvantage because I lack a postgrad degree; and what makes that depressing is that I'm a creative professional which should in theory be as ""hands on"" as you get in a career. I also had to say that I've watched folks with ivy university degrees have doors open to them which are often closed to others (look at the last four Presidents of the United States).<p>Another thing for techies to think about is the fact that there's a ton of ageism in tech that nobody talks about. So yes if you're a twentysomething who can program you don't have to worry, but twenty years later even if you keep up you may not get hired. And at that point having a college degree can open up doors that might have been closed.<p>But you say that you're the next Zuck: Well one should also keep in mind is that the natural state of startups is to fail. So even if you're brilliant, your company may still fail. In fact even if your company does well there's nothing that says that it can't go south after a few years. And if that is the case having a degree won't hurt you.<p>Lastly I'd leave everyone with this thought: The value of an education isn't a career unless you are studying business. The value of an education should be to make you a better and more rounded person. And knowing more about the world will make you better at everything that you touch.

54,3752151,comment,3751926.0,3751926.0,4,0,abalashov,,,"I was a philosophy major, and dropped out after 2.5 years.  My career had been evolving throughout that entire time, and at some point I had to make a choice.  After my second job, of six or so, nobody was even remotely interested in my education background, to the point where I deleted the entire section out of my resume with no material consequences whatsoever.<p>In this profession (excluding academia and high R&D, or specialisations requiring scientific background, or management layers that are still highly credential-driven) , it's all about what you can do.  It's amazingly democratic. A degree is only used to differentiate a candidate from a random person off the street, and only in the absence of any other information about them, any meaningful experience, etc.  The moment any of that comes into play, the degree becomes vanishingly insignificant.<p>The caveat, of course, is that if your career path takes you in that direction of doing something more than slinging code or running a small company, which gets increasingly likely as you get older, conservatise, want to get married, the works, you will be faced with severe barriers to entry in many places that are highly credential-dependent, if only through sheer institutional inertia, the force of custom, habit, and tradition, etc. While I do find it likely that these barriers are likely to become less durable in the future, in keeping with the general existential crisis of the received universal higher education narrative and the tendency toward greater meritocratic transparency in many professions (assisted by technology-fostered structural changes), there are certain things you will almost certainly never be able to do without the piece of paper, whether or not you'll ever need to use what you learned to get it.",1332667028.0

There were times at which I felt that your writing got in the way of the ideas you were trying to express.\nOne other thing that stuck out to me was that it seems like discouragements from others have really gotten to you despite your insistence that they don't matter. Don't mind the haters and keep on working hard! Good luck.,1332666738.0

Not only you will have haptic feedback mentioned by skeletonjelly, but the battery will last months and, the most important thing, you can wake up the HTPC from sleep (yes, you can use WOL with the Android remote, but it takes too long).<p>Another alternative is to get HDMI CEC-USB adapter and use remote from your telly for control.

It's great to hear a young person taking such a deliberate path and I'm sure it will be valuable to other to hear about. Please keep posting.<p>Slightly tangental, the reason college is/will be so hard to replace is that we are not sure or can't agree what it's even for. If we had a thread about it everyone would have very different opinions. In some sense it feels like trying to replace parents or peers. You can't really break down what they're for and try to replace it.",1332666698.0

I don't believe for a second that college is necessary, so long as you're highly self motivated. For most people edu + job/career is a good choice, I don't think there's much debate about that. It doesn't fit for everybody though.<p>I can relate to your choices. I dropped out of high school when I was a few weeks shy of graduation, in 1999. The dotcom boom was in full swing. When I ran across the Web for the first time in 1995 as a teenager, I immediately knew what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.<p>I think dropping out was a line in the sand for me, by crossing it I knew I would be intentionally making it that much harder to ever have a 'normal' career or job. There was no going back. I never wanted to work for anybody else, I wanted to build Web businesses.<p>At the time, the Web seemed like a piece of technology imported from a century into the future. I was eager to get started. About 99% of the time I haven't regretted my decision. If it's in your blood, it's in your blood, I can't be wired any other way, and I'm sure a lot of other people are the same.",1332666581.0

I enjoyed college times, but there's no way you could con me today into thinking it was at all necessary from an economic perspective. I think of college as a luxury good spot, not as an economic investment. So I kind of agree with you on one hand, even though I have a softspot for college. Point is this: college has positives, but an efficient way to spend 4yrs developing skills is not it.",1332666543.0

I think the lenovo option was something like 400 dollars? Took my 10 minutes to swap it.<p>Compare this to my $600 dollar MSI. Had to send it in 3 times.

Hell, I would be surprised if it turned out that that anywhere near half of software workers in general are women; this would imply that the majority of female software engineers work independently. I find that extremely unlikely, given how few women enroll in computer engineering degrees at universities. My point is that Microsoft, a mature and established software company, has a hard time finding female engineers, and this reflects the state of the industry as a whole.",1332666324.0
