But doing anything with image manipulation and transfer (maybe there's a reason Eye-fi hasn't moved into the DSLR space -- no CF version, only Class 6 speeds) seems like a daunting task for the pi..<p>For those more familiar with the Raspberry Pi, does it actually have enough performance to move big RAW files around? A 5D3 will output ~30MB RAWs and in a shoot you may end up with 500+ of them. Having a Pi transfer/move/adjust them sounds like a slog.",1345367650.0

The blog gets my best content.  But it's not easy to integrate a standalone blog into an existing social graph (social buttons notwithstanding).<p>G+ gets my less well thought out rants - short stuff.  It allows me to cheaply signal to like minded people and hopefully establish new readers/relationships.  I don't care if I  offend people on G+ because I'm there to attract the like minded.  So I say what I think.<p>And facebook is just a socialisation wheel greaser for local friendships.  Here I'm much more guarded.  I use content posted by people as conversation starters for when I see them in real life.  I might have to deal with these people - so I keep it light, fluffy and fun.  I personally don't care if facebook deletes all that content. (I see it as a medium risk since facebook isn't a particularly diversified business)<p>I decided a while ago that I need to engage on all these platforms - because concentrating solely on a blog only increases your overall isolation to your local life - cause it takes an enormous amount of time - and even your closest local friends aren't likely to even read it.<p>It might mean that I'll never put enough time into the blog for it be a standalone success.  But the odds of that ever happening were slim to nil anyway - even if it did get 100 percent of my time.  And there would have been a very high chance that I would have been miserable because such dedication would have led to a high degree of isolation.<p>This is the right balance for me.  I don't expect everyone to have the same view - but then I'm not claiming it's right for everyone.",1345367342.0
