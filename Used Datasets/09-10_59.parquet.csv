And yet it's unquestionably true - running code from the internet be it signed or unsigned is a pretty risky thing to do unless you know what you're doing. His main argument for why you'd want to remove it is that most people ignore your warnings anyway. However true that is, it's certainly not true for everyone.<p>The advice really doesn't seem to fit the real world. Suppose you had a place with a dangerous undertow and a sign to warn people about it. If five people died one year after choosing to ignore the sign few people would agree that a sensible course of action would be to remove it.",1310464701.0

No one has groups called ""Blacks"", ""People who are intolerant of other people's cultures"" or ""the Dutch"" (why would a racist follow people he/she hates anyway?).<p>Circles are for providing context.  Every time I go to facebook I see a post from someone I don't remember knowing.  I look in my list and see that they are apparently a friend of mine, but from where?  In Google+ this problem doesn't exist.  When I add them I put them in the context that I know them by (e.g. ""Close Friend"", ""Family"", ""Photography class"", ""WoW Friends"", etc.).  When I know them in multiple contexts I can put them in each one that applies (e.g. ""Colleague"" and ""Friend"" means they see everything I say to friends and everything I say to colleagues).<p>>It certainly isn't something we openly brag about in the real world<p>You haven't even used the service, have you?  It's not something we <i>brag</i> about because no one knows what circles we have!  All other users see (if we allow them to) is how many people we follow total.  Basically the same info facebook shows.<p>>Personally I only have one circle and everyone goes in.<p>To each their own, but I don't even see how this is possible.  You're going to put people like Robert Scoble (someone you might presumably <i>follow</i> but not post baby pictures to) in the same circle as your grandmother?

While building <a href=""http://keeprecruiting.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keeprecruiting.com</a> we did not obsess over IE. This wasn't planned or anything but we really did not have the time. We ensured that it displays alright and does not break the functionality but we did not bother to make it look pixel perfect. We have built this product for recruiters who are notoriously uninformed about technology. We were helping one of our beta customers and one of the forms in the app was misaligned in IE6. We do not support IE6 but it was the only browser accesible to her at that time (new WinXP image). She immediately closed the browser double clicked on IE again and googled for chrome. This is one of the typical recruiters who does not understand about computers but somebody has told her that if a site looks bad in IE open it in chrome. The machine did not have Chrome so she went ahead and downloaded it after briefly cursing the IT that they do not install Chrome by default and that she had to get it on to her machine.<p>This is probably because google has started advertising big scale in India[1] as a part of the ""Install Speed"" campaign. Given the unbearably slow internet lines in India, highlighting ""speed"" as one of the features is a clever way to market it.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=active&biw=1280&bih=658&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=google+chrome+billboard+india&oq=google+chrome+billboard+india&aq=f&aqi=&aql=undefined&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=25679l27670l0l12l8l0l0l0l0l549l549l5-1l1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=active&",
