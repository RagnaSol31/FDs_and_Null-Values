As a student in Sweden I can explain how our system works.<p>The university is free for swedes and europeans (might only be free for schengen countries). In Sweden we have a government agency that controlls student loans and subsidies (the agency is called CSN, Central Study Board). As a Swedish citizen you have the right to a ~2000 SEK (around 300 USD) per month subsidy. So just by attending university you get 2k SEK each month (this is limited to I think 12 terms in total, i.e 6 years), this is something you don't have you pay back.<p>We then also have the right to a student loan which will push up your monthly ""earnings"" to ~8000 SEK (1200 USD). This loan you obviously have to pay back. The current plan is that every student that took a loan before 2001 have 25 years to repay it.<p>Students that live at home during the duration of their study time can get away with only taking the subsidy. But most student (at least those that I know, including me) have to take the student loan.",1359799075.0

I started this in September 2012. In short, it helps with (chronic) rhinitis management - my sinuses are blocked less often and I am congested less frequently. Even though wheat-based foods aren't inherently much more calorific than others, I have found that my net caloric intake has been reduced by avoiding wheat-based foods. I replaced wheat-based foods with higher quality foods - like brown rice. Using this in conjunction with regular exercise, I have become healthier, more energised and motivated.<p>Starting a cycle of being healthy (exercising, eating correctly) initialises a self-sustaining feedback loop of motivation: once I started to see results (improved body composition, feeling more energetic) I became even more dedicated to this cycle of living healthily. Ceasing to eat gluten-based foods catalysed this for me.",1359798261.0

I've progressed to ""good"", and hoping to get to ""great"" someday. I've picked up this wisdom:<p>1. Learn an IDE <i>and</i> an editor. The IDE is useful for refactoring, for project management, for code completion, and other niceties. Your editor is there to lean on when you have to do some down and dirty editing. For example, today I took a GORM class, copied the contents into vim, and within a few macros and regular expressions I had transformed it into the bones I needed for an HTML table in five minutes, as opposed to a half hour of copying, pasting, adusting, and making sure I didn't make some stupid error. Now, to be fair, for many years I was more comfortable staying in just Vim and can see why someone could just stay there, I think both are necessary. (Now, editors like Sublime in languages like Ruby may be close enough to an IDE that it doesn't matter, but I'll swear up and down that having a tool that contains the kitchen sink makes the 80% much more comfortable to me.<p>But by learning it, I mean really digging down and memorizing the keystrokes and being able to use without thinking. If it takes flash cards and repetition, so be it.<p>2. Great programmers don't have to worry about learning libraries -- they just figure them out. I am not a great programmer. I work to understand an API so that I don't have to think about it when I'm using it.<p>3. Most of our work is fairly repetitive in terms of the patterns we use, so figure out the patterns that work ahead of time and look for ways that you can avoid making decisions. Every time you have to think about something simple because there are two equally-okay ways to do that, you're slowing down.<p>4. In a similar vein, look for ways to write programs to simplify what you do, especially in terms of generating code. In any given project, many of our screens can be the same, especially in enterprise software. Instead of copy-and-modify, write a script that is repeatable. Even with the Don't Repeat Yourself maxim, there are far too many ways in which we may not be repeating the same code, but we're certainly repeating 90% of the same process of getting to a similar end result. If you see an elegant way to abstract that out, all the better, but code generation can be a useful tool.<p>5. Pair program with better programmers. See what kinds of patterns they use. Steal as you can. I had my greatest growth when I was on a project with a programmer I really respected and we paired. I got insight in to how he approached problems that I was able to take with me.",1359797801.0

A startup is a business though, creating a startup is hacking the legal system and abusing the concept of corporation and limited liability, but it is still a business.  Business means 'trying to make money'.  If you don't make a huge multiple of what you would have made elsewhere, Startup is Fail.  Acceptance of this leads to clear thinking, proper prioritization, and a much greater chance of success.<p>Any gambler will tell you that you <i>must</i> take a wager that offers positive expected value.  However, they will also ruthlessly face reality and attempt to figure out what is happening if they keep losing over and over.<p>I guess what I'm saying is, Startup culture is valuable because of the chance of success <i>only</i>, failure is failure.",1359796869.0
