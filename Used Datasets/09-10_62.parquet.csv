My company is mostly ok with voice standups and meetings but from time to time we want to experiment with video ones. We are still not sure about them so we want to play around a little bit before deciding to switch to a video tool.

Is there anything that allows higher number? Or something that can be used once without recurring payments? Must work on mac os, linux and windows.
