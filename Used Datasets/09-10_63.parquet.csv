That would be very bad for cryptography.  Games need unpredictability, but true randomness isn't great.  Music shuffle systems are often made less random to prevent jarring changes.",1356343180.0

After all, if genetic factors should eventually cause people to have more children, then how is it possible for us to have a 55 year trend toward less children (as the article says, since 1957)? If genetics can eventually correct this trend, then why hasn't it already done so? For you to make this argument solidly, you'd have to establish at least 1 of 2 dependent arguments:<p>1.) there is some critical number that triggers a reaction<p>2.) there was, in the past, some force that allowed people to defy the genetic impulse to have children, but whatever that force was, it will no longer have as much power in the future<p>Here on Hacker News I have, several times, seen people invoke the idea that child-raising is a genetic impulse and that therefore the trend toward less children should be self-correcting. The people who advance this idea don't seem to get the irony of the suggestion.<p>Here is a bit of personal history: my great grandmother had 16 children. My mother had 4 children. Of the 4 of us, we are mostly past the age where we would consider having children. The 4 of us have so far had a total of 3 children, and I don't think there will be any more children, so my mom has less grand-children then she had children. This surprises her.<p>There are some powerful forces pushing the trend towards less children. My feeling is that some people are glib in their dismissals of the trend. A poorly thought out genetic argument would fall into my category of glib.",1356342567.0
21,4962392,comment,4961340.0,4962106.0,2,0,gracenotes,,,"About the difference between the signatures. Well, one is in Haskell and one is in an imperative language. I think there's a significant software-engineering-philosophical difference, though. Concatenative programming languages are kinda based on this same philosophy.<p>When you call boo function in Haskell, you have the power to create the ""universe"" which is both necessary and sufficient for the function to perform some self-contained computation. When enough of these computations are composed and nested together, you can really see how data flows through some logical procedure, possibly one with lots of essential complexity. On the other hand, when I look at the same signature translated into Java, for all I know it could be the 4th function call in a stateful 8-function-long set of functions you always have to call in order, except you don't have to call the 6th function if you pass true to the 2nd function. Easy enough, right?<p>The fewer combinations of arbitrary state are allowed to determine the behavior of your program, the fewer unanticipated scenarios arise. I think this is a good software engineering principle. The corollary that I think Haskell really brings home when it comes to designing programs is that it's better to change the way data flows in one small section than to add a little more state somewhere and handwave away state combinations which you think are impossible. This idea applies in both Haskell and Java.",1356342550.0

Quite often they're obvious and simple in hindsight.\nIt's a hard balance to strike, but just giving the option of moving all ""inventions"" to after-hours so that the employee gets all benefits won't cut it either, especially with modern work-time models such as flex-time or home office.
