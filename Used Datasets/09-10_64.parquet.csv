Just because one can binge so much that the difference is irrelevant hardly means that the difference isn't important in general.<p>The study this cites early on suggests that a low-carbohydrate diet with N calories a day is roughly equivalent to a low-fat diet with only 70% of N calories a day.  So a 2000 calorie-a-day low-carbohydrate diet is equivalent to a 1400 calorie-a-day low-fat diet.  That result is <i>huge</i>.

Hailing from a 3rd world country with a master's degree from US, I work here on a H1B visa.<p>In near future, I want to start my own company. Currently, I want to write some mobile apps and sell them online. However, my employer is not very friendly with such policies and having side projects officially may hurt my chances of getting promoted at work.<p>To fix this I came with the following solution:<p>Start a LLC in US under a cousin's name(a homemaker and US citizen) and sell apps under that LLC's name. I will run the company under her name. Once I decide to go full time on the startup, I am planning to have an arrangement so that I can buy back the company for a nominal amount.<p>Is this a good approach? Also is this legal? Are there better approaches?<p>TIA.<p>PS: I hope people will understand the reason for posting this under a throwaway account.",1305882519.0
