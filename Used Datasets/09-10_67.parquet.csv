Amazing success for 4 months work.<p>However, the issue with this is, there is no incentive for the cleaners to stay with the company. My ex was with a company very similar to this one, she signed up, but after she knew the clients for a while, she realised she could cut out the middleman and increase her wages substantially. The company tried to hit her with a 900$ bill for lost profit, their reasoning was ""how can we stay in business if our workers keep running of with the clients?"" (what does that say about the business model?). She convinced her favourite clients to ditch the company, which allowed her to bring in more money and the clients had a cheaper rate. Further clients were found by word of mouth at that point. I think throwing up some ads in the local paper would be cheaper in the long run than lost money from going with a company like this.",1334570276.0

I'm also very interested in making bots to automate various web games, in my case casino games.<p>When I was in college, I came across a gambling strategy for online roulette. I tested it for a few weeks but I gave up on it as it was extremely boring and tedious, even though it seems legitimately profitable. A few years later I heard about bots that automate poker and so on, so I looked at tools that I could use to code up the roulette strategy to play it automatically. I looked into AutoIt and wrote some scripts, but the code ended up being beyond my ability to write, as my knowledge of AutoIt starting out was zero. Even a relatively simple game like roulette (only 37 supposedly random possible outcomes on a European roulette table) ended up having bot logic that was quite complex.<p>However a few weeks ago I came across this excellent article:<p><a href=""http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/workflow/how-to-build-a-python-bot-that-can-play-web-games/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/workflow/how-to-build-a...</a><p>So I looked at re-writing the bot in Python instead. Turns out that writing it in Python is FAR simpler than AutoIt, and the code far simpler to figure out. Even though I had close to zero knowledge of Python starting out (learning Python really quickly by using it to build a real project, rather than learning Python theory first.) Now my bot is about 90% complete, just a couple of steps away from having a working (potentially profitable) bot.<p>Really cool what you can do in a few weeks in Python from a standing start.",1334570247.0
