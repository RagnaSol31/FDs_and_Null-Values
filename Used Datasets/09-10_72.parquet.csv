This means a constant struggle to find a combination of credit card, store with enough content (The US is best) and a local address (virtual and actual) to satisfy arcane internal rules.<p>Please Amazon - please move to one global store where any credit card from any country can purchase any edition of any book. Please Amazon and Apple, let us combine content from multiple stores into one account, and let us have a global price based on the best market. Yo usell more stuff, we but more as well.<p>Meanwhile take the chance to collect, and pay to the local authorities, consumption/sales tax based on the location of the IP address, not the credit card or address of the buyer.

Some people carrying such growths will develop life-threatening cancers, whilst the rest (probably the vast majority) of the population will die of something else at a ripe old age before the growths in question ever become malignant.<p>Once you start screening everyone, suddenly you have this huge population of growths that you have to biopsy in order to determine whether or not they're malignant or not. Your false-positive rate means that you start giving extremely harmful treatments (chemotherapy is itself mutagenic & can cause cancer!) to individuals who if they'd never have been scanned would have remained blissfully unaware of the harmless growth within them & would have had productive, happy lives.<p>Routine scans are not cost free: They put a huge diagnostic burden on the system & they inevitably mean that you deliver invasive, potentially harmful treatments to people that don't need them.",1350897343.0

However, there are principles called respect and ethics.<p>Much like when you go to a party and you see the chips and dips are free. That doesnt mean you can respectfully bring a plastic baggy and Tupperware so you can take a bit of the party home with you for the rest of the week. You cant ethically bring empty gallon jugs for some free punch either....<p>I am tired of seeing a complete ignorant lack of support for linux/bsd when the extra effort is TRIVIAL, despite the fact that these companies are benefiting from open source at a huge profit. It's really shameful in my honest opinion to neglect these operating systems.<p>If valve can port their Window's games over to Linux in a considerably short amount of time, these offenders can take the time necessary to make sure there is windows, bsd/MacOS, and linux support. (plan9 too? :D....keep dreamin)<p>Either support Linux/BSD or dont even attempt to. This isnt about ""market share"". Market share could change tomorrow and the biggest supporters of these operating systems today, will remember who gave us the shaft tomorrow. Just saying, can we be just a bit more ethical.
