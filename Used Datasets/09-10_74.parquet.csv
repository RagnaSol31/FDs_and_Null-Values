They claim that one case in particular, between Notre Dame and the faculty, was a turning point.<p>The story has been related to me like this: Traditionally universities were heavily influenced by the faculty, who had big sway over big decisions. This all came to a head in the 80s when faculty and the administration disagreed over some big issue (like who should be the next president, I believe). The faculty and administration went to court, and the court ruled that the faculty were employees and the administration, essentially, had absolute power and could appoint who they wanted.<p>This precedent drastically changed how universities were run, and since then faculty has basically been eviscerated (both from a power standpoint and a pay standpoint, ala adjuncts) and universities are now run like businesses (top down management vs. a more distributed/democratic form previously).

San Francisco, CA (<a href=""https://www.onecodex.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.onecodex.com</a>).<p>We’re a software and biology start-up building a platform for microbial genomics – an essential piece of infrastructure for a world in which we increasingly understand health, disease, and our environment by transforming biology into data.<p>Our first application area is infectious disease diagnostics – where we’re already working with doctors, epidemiologists, and others at the world’s leading public health and research organizations. We were also awarded a $200,000 prize by the CDC for our work on “strain-typing” pathogenic bacteria, and are backed by some of the best investors in Silicon Valley.<p>We’re looking for talented software engineers to help us build towards our vision for a global genomics data network and enable widespread in silico diagnostics.<p>YOU’RE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You’re a generalist software engineer that loves hard problems<p>- You want to work on a technology product making an important real-world impact<p>- You’re excited about joining a small team and directly impacting the shape of its technology choices, product, and business<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- Pluses (but not requirements): biology/compbio background; experience with Docker in production; prior experience with Flask, React, D3<p>WHY ONE CODEX?<p>- Important problem: We’re not only working to build a better diagnostic test for infectious diseases, but setting the groundwork for entirely entirely new clinical, scientific, and public health applications that will come with an improved, real-time understanding of “microbial space”.<p>- Hard, intellectually interesting challenges: Amongst other things, we are 1) applying and developing cutting-edge bioinformatics algorithms; 2) developing and deploying new data structures (really!); 3) finding better ways to manage messy genomic data; and 4) and running Docker in production. In short, there are plenty of near- and medium-term hard engineering challenges, and there’s more to our technology solution than just a simple CRUD app.<p>- Upside: We offer a competitive salary, meaningful above-market equity, and the chance to be an early employee in a well-positioned startup.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental, and vision coverage<p>- Flexible vacation policy and relocation assistance if moving to the Bay Area<p>- Whatever computing set up you prefer<p>APPLY<p>Please send us a note about your interest and background at careers@onecodex.com or reach out to me directly at nick@onecodex.com.",1428227008.0

32,9323593,comment,9320929.0,9322702.0,0,0,ghuntley,,,"Hi, I am not affiliated with Xamarin but I have been using Xamarin in production for the last two years on many applications and could not imagine doing native development in any other way.<p>Two weeks ago a enterprise company that previously was &quot;iPhone/iPad only&quot; from the top-down by a board level mandate has started seriously considering moving over to Android for purely handset cost reasons. I knew this would eventually happen and deliberately designed/developed the application using the Xamarin platform as a way to reduce risk/hedge bets.<p>If the application was not developed using Xamarin then the enterprise company would be facing a complete rewrite of the application in another language whereby the engineering costs to achieve this outcome would outweigh the savings and re-implementing the functionality would introduce substantial product quality/project risks.<p>Now &quot;all that is required&quot; is to start work on a Android user experience, implement it and then sew it up against the core library. It also means that developers can concurrently patch bugs + ship features to both platforms during the migration phase.<p>Anyway there seems to be a quite of bit of confusion that Xamarin.Forms == Xamarin and this is not the case.<p>Xamarin.Forms is a package that runs on top of the Xamarin platform that provides a DSL to rapidly create CRUD enterprise applications that spits out the equivalent native user interface implementation depending on which platform you run on. It is extendable and becoming highly customizable. Can&",
