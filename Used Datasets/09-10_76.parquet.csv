All furniture was expensive back then but it was amortised long time ago.<p>My point is that IMHO some products are not worth having at all.<p>One time I bought a cheap desk at IKEA, a plain board with stainless steel legs. It soon started bothering me that placing a big pile of books on it would make it bend and I was then afraid to climb on top of it to clean the window, I was not sure it could support my weight. A few months later I had some guests who placed some heavy climbing equipment on it and managed to damage it, now the desk has a 5cm hole in the middle.<p>In retrospect, to me such desk is wasted money even if priced at 5$.<p>I ended up going to a local store and buying a proper desk for 4 times the price. It looks really nice and is very strong and it can be repaired if it ever gets damaged. Now, I could have spent the same money for a better quality desk in IKEA but in this price range there are other stores that can match the quality and even offer better looks (this is subjective - I&",
