You need to learn this area.<p>Owning copyright to a work gives the owner EXCLUSIVE rights to distribution of that work.<p>Therefore, just because you sold a legal copy to a user via Amazon you do not have the right to broadcast the work on your website. Only the copyright owner can do that, because he has exclusive distribution rights. Your broadcast isn't authorized even though you selling DVDs is authorized.<p>Be careful with this stuff. In my opinion you are playing with fire here. The RIAA has no problems with burying people who distribute songs illegally.

When you increase the money supply, somebody <i>is</i> getting ""free money"", even if it's indirectly. The more dollars there are, the less each individual dollar is worth. If everybody got their share of the newly minted money there would be no difference, but in practice just a few institutions will be the direct recipients of the new money. For instance, when the Fed prints money then uses it to buy California-issued bonds, the California government is indirectly getting free money.<p>> <i>Or at least have constant in rate of growth? Yes, of course you would, because that's the only way to actually accommodate more people using it.</i><p>This is an elementary mistake. Bitcoins can be subdivided almost indefinitely. If they go up 1000 times in value, we'd just start using milibitcoins.<p>> <i>As a quick thought experiment, let's say demand for Bitcoin grew as more people found out about them. Well, you'd expect the price of Bitcoin in dollars to grow rapidly. Now assume I own one Bitcoin. I also have a dollar bill. I would like to purchase a Pepsi. Which one of those will I spend? Obviously the devaluing dollar gets spent before the skyrocketing Bitcoin.</i><p>This is nonsense. A transaction takes 2 willing participants. If bitcoin's value is expected to go up, then naturally the merchant will prefer getting paid in bitcoins rather than the dollars.<p>The main problem of Bitcoin is that currencies are like social networks: they're only useful if other people are using it, and often they never achieve the critical mass necessary to be successful. This, and the large risk of being outlawed by governments.",1306402855.0

The app-indicators and control center in Ubuntu are actually easier to use than in OS X. ICS to my Xbox took 10 seconds in Ubuntu. It took 10 minutes of Googling and editting a configuration file to get it in OS X. My phone works out of the box as a router in Ubuntu, it's not detected as an Internet device <i>at ALL</i> in OS X, who knows why. (And those tasks took less than a minute or two to access directly from the app-indicators or control center. (And very excitingly, there is a whole new connection center planned for 11.10 which out to be even cooler/faster).<p>I wish more people would come back and really spend the time to give modern DEs a chance. I personally can't stand KDE even after a lot of customization, but even Qt apps are indiscernable from GTK+ apps in Ubuntu (yes, even file selection dialogs, etc).<p>It's also funny that no one seems to know the history of these UX elements. Spaces have been a *nix feature since the late 80's, early 90's. The Grid plugin existed in Compiz as an unstable plugin for a long time before Windows 7 came out. They simply refined it for Natty.<p>Also, anyone on a MBP should try Unity just to see the power of the uTouch API they've built. Compiz is actually multitouch enabled.

If I understand correctly the reasons for keeping it are:<p>* If documentation isn't generated automatically, where is the incentive to write documentation?<p>* It's useful for newbies because they can start up `gem server` or use `ri`<p>So, incentive. Really? I can tell you that of all the code I've written the number of times I've documented it with YARD or RDoc because of a fear that it would be auto-generated on each client and they'd see that is was found wanting is precisely... zero. I document my projects because I want people to use them, I don't want my inbox filled with questions on how to use it, and so I can link to somewhere like rdoc.info where potential users can read it online. I just don't buy that the auto-generation is working like a big scary stick making developers write docs.<p>As for newbies, I doubt many genuine newbies have any idea of how to use `ri`. Even if they did, you have actually know the class/method you want. At best it's a reference, it's awful for just browsing around trying to piece things together yourself. What I suspect most newbies do is go to Google and enter ""How to open a file in ruby"", they don't `ri File.new`. The latter assumes a reasonable (albeit forgetful) knowledge of the API, you can assume they're more likely to know about --with-ri rather than the newbies knowing about --no-ri.<p>The problem here really is that there is a not-insignificant number of people who have all put this setting into their .gemrc file because they want it as the default behaviour. Is it a representative sample of the community? How can we find out? It certainly feels that rather than find out the support for this addition was deemed a ""circus of +1's"", ignored, and closed.<p>I makes it had for me to feel sympathy towards the project, reluctant to offer any changes I'd throw around for consideration, and grateful to see others take the initiative to actually fix the problem (you with your mediation, and then SlimGems as a possibly viable alternative).",1306402847.0

He supports himself fully as a professional public speaker, at age 19, and he does so without being ""famous"" (movie star, athlete, musician, etc.)<p>Tens of thousands of professional speakers, many into their adulthood, would kill to have the professional life he has. Indeed, as someone who supports himself fully as a freelancer, I'd say that's already a level of success that many adults seeking to strike out on their own dream of.<p>True, he's not a gazillionaire, but I specifically chose to write about him for that reason. Had I written about, say, the usual suspects when giving examples of successful young people without college degrees (Mark Zuckerberg, etc), someone else might have said, ""But they're the outliers! Average kids can't expect to be like them!"" He has reached a level of success which I believe is impressive for his age, and which many adults would envy.<p>BTW, he was just named one of the Thiel Fellows, and was chosen as one of 24, among 800 applicants, to win $100,000.

People in authority act as if the worst-case scenario will happen (regardless of the actual risk of that) because it's self-preservative.<p>We're so focused on always looking for a scapegoat when something goes wrong that the only way to pre-empt potential persecution (either by the mob or the press or the justice system or whoever) is to always cover your ass, regardless of what the actual risk analysis tells you. Warning against events like terrorist attacks and earthquakes is a win/win: if they do occur, you're the heroic prophet who saw it all coming. If they don't, no one will call you out on needlessly spending large amounts of money on their prevention.<p>There is quite a bit of precedent for this kind of reasoning. For examples, see Blair's role in the invasion of Iraq (45 minutes, remember?) and the United States' Homeland Security Advisory System (never lower than ""Elevated""). And did anyone get nailed to the metaphorical cross for the enormous sums of money flushed down the toilet to protect against Y2K?<p>To dismiss this as a uniquely Italian issue, as many of my fellow HN'ers seem to be doing, is a failure to see the wider picture.
