That is, you know what a certain chunk of code is supposed to do, so you might glance over it and not actually read it again.<p>Experienced programmers know this, and constantly re-read their code to make sure it does what they think it does. But I just finished teaching programming to complete beginners, and this was a big hurdle.

The problem is that once you start giving concrete examples -- such as the Civil War continuing to evolve the United States along Hamilton's dreams -- people start getting offended. Many of these great political events and policies already have a narrative in people's minds, and people get touchy when you start redefining their version of history. And that's not even getting into the last hundred years!<p>As far as how it started, here's a great introduction to the Great Debate. It's a description, in the Framer's words, of the issues they saw at the time the Constitution was created. Note that during the Constitutional Debate Jefferson was mostly neutral. Once he started serving in Washington's cabinet, however, it became obvious that these two strains of thought were always going to oppose each other. Jefferson noted that each day he girded himself to prepare for battle. Washington as well tried to stay above it all, and managed to do so during his presidency. Afterwards it became obvious that he was more of a smart-guy-and-structure person, but he managed to keep that mostly under wraps.<p><a href=""http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=4878"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=4878</a>",1278928247

When I worked on it the BBC News Website had 6 month+ type iterations which meant relaunches and redesigns had to be limited to every couple of years.<p>My biggest grip with the design is that there still appears to be fewer news stories (what we called display items internally) on the page than other sites such as CNN.  I am waiting for the site to launch to actually test that.<p>I also am not sure whether squaring off a single playback box for video is the right approach over blending in lots of video stories as equal citizens to text stories through-out the site (something CNN and others do v well).  Again, time will tell once the site launches.<p>Overall, I'm slightly disappointed there is nothing radically new or experimental (and even a little copied from CNN perhaps) but I know that Paul Sissons and the rest of the design team and BBC News have done a fine job and I look forward to using it.",1278927514

We have the following primitive functions:<p>unsigned long getino(char <i>pathname): For a given designated device and path, get the inode number of the designated file. Return 0 (there is no inode number 0) in case of error.<p>MINODE </i> iget(unsigned long ino): For a given designated inode number, return a pointer to a data structure in memory containing the INODE data; allocated if necessary. Return NULL in case of error.<p>You can either test your return values from these functions, in which case you will do this:<p><pre><code>  unsigned long myIno = getino(path);\n  //error check myIno\n  MINODE * myMINODE = iget(myIno);\n  //error check myMINODE\n</code></pre>\nor put some argument checking in iget() and do this:<p><pre><code>  MINODE * myMINODE = iget(getino(path));\n  //error check myMINODE\n</code></pre>\nHow much argument checking has to go into iget()? Exactly this much:<p><pre><code>  if (!ino) return NULL\n</code></pre>\nIt seemed like a neat idea at the time, and considering I called that particular composition of functions a dozen times in that project, there was a lot less repeating myself in teaching my functions to understand error codes.",1278926940

If you want a physical keyboard, either get the Motorola Droid (in the USA)/Milestone (same thing rest of the world), or wait if you're not keen on this device. The keyboard is apparently an either love it or hate it kind of thing so definitely try it before you buy it.<p>There is also the Samsung Galaxy S Pro with a keyboard available on only one US carrier (IIRC, Verizon).<p>Personally, I'm waiting for a better Android with a physical keyboard.<p>2. If you want/don't mind a touch-only experience, then you got plenty of choice. The top end is the HTC Desire, which is very good (a die hard iPhone fan friend of mine is now a convert). HTC do cheaper and lower spec'ed devices too like the Wildfire so have a look at those.<p>If the screen is your top priority, the Samsung Galaxy S is apparently the one to get. But Samsung masacared the Android UI with their own ""improvements"" which you may or may not like. Check it out.<p>Finally, if you want the biggest screen, the Dell Streak clocks in at 5"", which may be a touch too big for your pockets. I have big hands and loved playing with it at the shop but I didn't buy it because it is so darn freaking big. I suspect you'll find it to be too big too.",1278926315

Typical definitions of a welfare program have money going to poor people as a central feature.  That doesn't describe Social Security.<p>Social Security pays a disproportionate amount to those who are well off.  There are two factors.  The amount you get paid out depends on how much you put in, and your life span.  People who are better off generally wind up paying in more, and then live longer to collect benefits.  Overall Social Security represents a wealth transfer from young to old, and from the poor to the top 20% of the population.<p>Oh right, and in recent decades it has been a net source of working revenue for the federal government, through the form of buying Treasury bonds.
