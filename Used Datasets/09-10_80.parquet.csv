For example, adding a necessary air filter and exhaust system will see the efficiency drop drastically as you strangle something that requires a free flow of air. Having a power transfer system to a gearbox or a generator/electric motor will also see a great reduction in efficiency. The speed at which a jet turns necessitates a second turbine as a power take-off and hence more losses to bypass.<p>It's often thrown about that a jet engine is the simplest kind of engine, which is true conceptually, but to get any efficiency, practicality or durability out of it there's a lot of bolt ons that are needed.<p>I could go on but will cut it short(ish).",1361353182

58,5249593,comment,5244619.0,5244619.0,2,0,gordaco,,,"Interestingly, this article told me a LOT of things that I've already discovered on my own, and another few things that make me feel very relieved, since I thought that I was doing it all wrong. It seems that everyone but me is, ha! Ok, just kidding, but not so much. I've realized that I feel a lot better since I stopped doing what everyone does and started doing what my body tells me to do.<p>First of all: I hate sleeping. No, really. Since I was like 9 years old. Sleeping feels good, or more exactly, going to sleep when you're sleepy feels good; but there are so many things to do through the day, that feel much better! Be it reading, studying, watching movies, any kind of game (videogames, board games, sports, you name it), or anything you like. Yeah, I've wished I didn't need to sleep since I was very young. Not too long after, I realized the harsh truth: not getting enough sleep is far worse than ""waste"" many hours in bed. You feel like shit (especially in the morning, just after artificially waking up), you perform worse on everything you do, and there are a few health issues.<p>Of course, for most of my life I've been under the same bane than everyone: school and work create artificial constraints to sleeping schedules, so through all my life I've done very unwise things. I remember a period of several months when I slept twice a day from four to eight: once AM, once PM. It's actually a relatively benign schedule compared to other things I've done.<p>So, I decided to tackle the problem, and now there are several things I do, with good results:<p>1) The article speaks against this, but try to go to sleep at about the same time everyday. What does this mean? Well, if your ""sleeping time"" is near but you don't feel tired at all (or you think you won't feel tired because it hasn't been an intense day), you may want to A) turn off as many lights as possible, and yes, this specifically includes computers, TV and phones (by the way, how many of you don't turn off the phone when you go to sleep? Please, don't do that to yourself!); and B) go for a walk and/or moderate exercise for about 30 minutes to tire you a little. Even walking through the rooms of your house might do the trick, actually.<p>2) In the adjustment phase (the article tells you how to do this; free-running sleep with little to no physical activity during a holiday week does the job for me), try to create a schedule that makes you get up a good 2-3 hours before you have to actually start preparing to go to work. I.e., if you would get up at 7 to immediately have breakfast as fast as possible, then take a shower and go to job with minimal ""waste"" of time, then schedule your sleep so that you get up at 5 or even a little sooner. This has some benefits like giving you quiet time to do whatever you want before work (I usually study); but more importantly, it ensures completely that, if one day you feel like you need a little more sleep, you can stay in bed as long as you want, and you'll be wide awake and energetic through all the day (however, try to increase your exercise that day, so that you'll feel tired and go to bed as soon as possible, thus not breaking your schedule. I've noted than a single day of not getting enough sleep may wreak havoc in your schedule, so this is actually quite important). This means, however, that you must go to bed soon, i.e.: say good-bye to your night life. I understand that this may put off many people, but at least try to think about this trade-off and which are your priorities.\n3) This is my ""secret weapon"" that may also put off many people: no caffeine. Never in my life have I had any significant intake of caffeine, since I don't like coffee and I don't have coke that often. I'm not sure about how might this affect my schedule, but I'm confident that heavy coffee drinkers will have sleep problems despite their tolerance (they may not acknowledge it, since needing an alarm clock is widely not perceived as a huge sleep problem).<p>I used to think that I was a non-24. Not any more! I just had a poor schedule and didn't know how to train my body to shorten a little my circadian rhythm (again, the article speaks about this). I also used to think that I was clearly an owl, but I currently sleep from about 20 to 4, and it's by far the most stable schedule I've ever had. It feels so good to be free from the tyranny of the alarm clock.",1361352023

They annihilate to create a lepton pair. There is no explosion, really. Subatomic physics is much more boring than popular science would have you believe! You must try quite hard to get an explosion - it isn't chemistry, where things explode simply because it's Wednesday. Particles that are their own antimatter are not all that exotic either. Z bosons, gluons and photons are all their own antiparticles too, and perhaps neutrinos.<p>As I understand it (and I am a nuclear physicist, not an astrophysicist) there are few (no?) observed natural interactions known to produce high energy positrons (i.e. with energy >1 GeV). So, if you find one coming from space, it is an indicator that something unexplained has happened. Since we know where there must be clusters of dark matter and WIMPs are theorised to produce such positrons, dark matter decay is the leading candidate for an explanation for a high energy positron coming from such a direction.<p>Or it could be aliens, of course.",1361351790
