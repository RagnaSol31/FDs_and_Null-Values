But in some fields, they are clearly slowing down, and stabilizing. And even when technology can alter our daily lives, introducing new elements to our lives, most changes are introduced as a convenience, or a way to enhance our productivity, but our daily life remains almost the same, in the big scope.<p>Sometimes, a REAL revolutionary element emerges, like the Internet. Computers enhanced the way companies did their work, but the Internet introduced changes much more intensive, enabling new markets, new products, new channels of communication, and above all, changing how we learn, distributing knowledge, and empowering the people to express and divulge their thoughts and opinions.<p>But in the end, the core of our lives remains the same. If we compare the daily life of a middle class man living in 1935 (80 years to the past, not just 40), to the daily life of a middle class man living in 2015, we would find, generally speaking, that they are really similar. The general structure remains the same.
