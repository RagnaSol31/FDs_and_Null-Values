Just because we don't have the means to do the kinds of experiments we want, doesn't mean we get to change the definition of proof. And if you do, you certainly shouldn't call it science. If there was no good way to do a falsifiable experiment in physics we wouldn't say ""oh we have a lot of data though, so i guess we should just look at the correlations and assume causation in this case"". The question would simply remain open, perhaps indefinitely. This is the most frustrating thing about discussing economics with anyone: if you're truly honest, you should admit that you can pluck examples in history to prove just about anything. Each side will say ""oh that's not comparable because ____"". And you know what, they're right! Since no two situations are the same, we rely on our ""gut"" to tell us what variables, despite being different, ""didn't really influence or matter"". The idea that you can for example draw any conclusions about economic policy from the 50s, a ridiculously unique time where all the production of the world except the US was more or less destroyed, is absurd. The idea that you can look at the effect of ONE policy in Germany, a country of different size, culture, laws, and other policies, and say the same would happen here is equally crazy. It's data sure, but not particularly useful data if you are honest about the <i>science</i> of it. Those techniques would get you laughed out of any other scientific field.<p><i>> At this point I have to ask, how is your view of economics different from theology? What is the point of such a useless field of study?</i><p>My view (I am not the op), is that yes, most people who believe in macro economics principles are closer to theologists than scientists. It is indeed quite possibly a useless field of study, given that there are huge disagreements and it doesn't even matter because a politician will usually do something completely based on the next election or special interests anyways, so even if we did know for sure it wouldn't matter. ( a funny article by mr Krugman himself on this: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-affair.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-...</a> )<p>Now, there are alternative forms of establishing knowledge other than science (for example there are no experiments in math, and math <i>isnt</i> science), and you can argue that the position ""I don't know"" can be a very wise one and an economic policy all in itself. But the idea that ""doing x will for sure do y"" is silly, ESPECIALLY since a timeframe is rarely ever attached to it.",1355997073.0

There's the world of 35mm cameras, which is what full frame digital SLRs are (think Canon 1D X and 5D III, and Nikon D4 and D800, having a sensor fo 36x24mm). Many digital SLRs have cropped sensors the Canon 7D, 60D and 600D have a sensor that is 1.6 times smaller than a full frame (22.2x15.8mm). More: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-frame_digital_SLR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-frame_digital_SLR</a><p>The next level of cameras is medium format, which are vastly more expensive and have much larger sensors. They're generally used for studio work, where light isn't a problem. They're popular for fashion and product photography.<p>Then you move up to large format cameras with even larger sensors, although most of these still use film (but digital backs are available, and tend to have hundreds of megapixels).

We're operating a marketplace and Stripe made it really easy for us to charge our customers' credit cards.<p>Until then we had to rely on PayPal and that was quite a pain in the ass. The only thing that was really positive with using PayPal as our CC processor is that they always reimbursed you the fees in case you wanted to refund the payment.<p>We have a 14 day money back guarantee - what it means is that you can request your money back if you have a valid reason and we'll refund you. Since we want to really delight our customers (much like Amazon does) we always accept refund requests and that means we had to cover the costs of the fees paid to stripe. Granted this isn't much compared to our overall gross revenues but I can see how in certain cases for certain individual (selling high value products) that could mean losses.<p>What I'd like to see tho and I haven't seen it yet - is the ability to get the chargeback refunded in case I decide not to fight it. I know this usually involve some work on both sides, however I think this should be automated and the chargeback lifted if I decide to make Stripe's life easier.<p>I also understand this could be potentially abused by potentially allowing every ""fraud"" attempts to pass and not fighting back the chargeback would mean you don't have some skin in the game and not motivated to stop these fraud attempts. Which is why I think these chargebacks should be refunded only if they don't exceed a certain threshold.<p>The biggest problem is for marketplace who are selling intangible goods, whenever we get hit with a chargeback - it doesn't really matter and I usually don't fight it even if I know the customer really paid for it since I know they're doomed to fail. So winning a chargeback is out of question anyway, however I'd love to get my chargebacks covered by Stripe in the event the chargeback was made by either a legit customer (and for some reason didn't ask for a refund) or slipped through my fraud prevention tools but I decide not to fight it back.<p>If a publisher would see too many of these chargebacks (and thus showing he's making no effort to prevent fraudulent charges), I think the chargeback protection should be cancelled and maybe Stripe should charge for these chargebacks retrospectively.<p>Anyway - great news Stripe!",1355994678.0
