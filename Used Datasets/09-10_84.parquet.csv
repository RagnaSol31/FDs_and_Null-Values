It simply means you can not accuse the person performing the search of sexual assault.  Accusing the TSA agent, who was doing their job of searching a passenger with (I'm hoping) no sexual intent, of sexual assault creates a second victim, and is extremely irresponsible and unethical.<p>For the most part, yes, it doesn't matter what the victim thinks when deciding whether to accuse someone of sexual assault.<p>If I throw a wild pitch and hit you in the head, it's different than throwing an accurate pitch at your head, even if you can't tell the difference.

Last year, Randy Bias estimated EC2 was pulling $220M revenue/yr:<p><a href=""http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/amazons-ec2-generating-220m-annually"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/amazons-ec2-gen...</a><p>And he estimated an overly conservative 10-20% annual growth. But given the EC2 buzz this year, and personal anecdotes from my friends and colleagues using it, my gut feeling tells me the 2010 revenues will have increased 50-100% over 2009 revenues.<p>Is EC2 profitable to Amazon? Likely <i>very</i> profitable if you want my opinion. It is well accepted in the industry that the dominant cost in large scale datacenters is power and cooling --not hardware, not human resources-- and I keep running numbers in my head and the hourly prices of all instance types are well above power & cooling.<p>Just as an example, we know that this new GPU instance has two 95W Xeon X5570 and two 247W Tesla M2050; assuming (1) a max TDP of 50W for the motherboard and rest of the server, (2) instances are run under full load 100% of the time and always reach these max TDP numbers (unlikely, but follow me for the sake of the argument), (3) Amazon uses servers with 80PLUS power supplies (80% efficient or more), (4) a rather good datacenter with a PUE of 1.3 (power usage effectiveness, which includes overhead from power distribution and cooling; numbers in the range of 1.2-1.4 are often quoted by James Hamilton from the AWS team: <a href=""http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/</a>), and (5) electricity costs of $0.10/kWh (average in the US, but I know Amazon datacenters are in locations with cheaper electricity), then the hourly power and cooling costs would be:<p><pre><code>  (95*2 + 50 + 247*2) / 0.8 * 1.3 / 1000 * 0.10 = $0.119/hr\n</code></pre>\nAmazon charges 17x this amount for on-demand instances ($2.10/hr), and 6x this amount for reserved instances ($0.74/hr).<p>Given these numbers, Amazon must recoup the initial deployment costs very, very quickly... Which is why I also think EC2 must be very profitable.",1289814836.0

Of course this can be discomforting and invasive, especially if you're caught off guard. And of course such searches are extremely hard to justify and should never be codified into policy. Yes, it can be traumatic and violating, but this is nothing like a rape or ""real"" sexual assault.<p>A few months ago a jogger around here was hit with a cinder block, dragged off the trail, raped several times, beat with said block more, and left for dead in the woods. _That_ is real sexual assault. Such rapes are not really uncommon, though many less violent rapes also occur, and they are also highly traumatic and serious; much more serious than a TSA worker going about their mundane duties, which they are probably not very happy to be forced to perform either.<p>The activity described in the post is unpleasant touching, and I agree that we shouldn't allow it, but these events are not even in the same league as ""real"" sexual abuse or rape.
