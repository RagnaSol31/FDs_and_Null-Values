The only thing Riot should be happy about is that this happened during that time when the MOBA market was limited with few competing titles (It was before DotA 2), as this ISP would have a created an distorted market within their customer base.<p>This ISP was of course not the only customer of the QoS software, but I am rather sure it was the single biggest one.",1445765243.0
