Just look at the iPhone 4 antenna problem. This is the same thing, they lose airports and train stations. Then they tell people to use it so they can find all the problems so they can start fixing it. I don't know about you people but I use the map app but I use it to find locations where I haven't been before. I find the response slightly arrogant to this whole maps deal. It is ""your holding it wrong"" all over again.<p>I have a bunch of Apple devices. But this maps thing and other things like Gatekeeper makes me hesitant to buy a device that is more expensive than the competitors. The thing is that I don't feel that the premium isn't simply worth it anymore.",1348307884.0

And think of the iPhone in relation to the Porsche 911. It's more or less the same car for the past 50 years. Every 2-3 years Porsche makes it better. It works for them, the consumer, the brand and the legacy. I'm not sure why some people were expecting a Phone in the i5 that would make them breakfast but it's a better product than already great product in the 5.<p>That is a great way of saying it... love the Porsche analogy.<p>However, I challenge you on one point. I don't think Apple EVER innovated. Rather, they've iterated. And they did this wonderfully. Apple is notorious for not innovating but rather taking already established ideas and doing them much, much better than even the people who originally did them. That is their secret. They are great and simplifying and making it oh, so pretty.<p>EDIT: I should caveat the above to the modern Apple era. Post 2001 or so.<p>And not to take anything away from this, but when most people say ""innovate"" they typically mean something other than what I say above. In reality, the groundbreaking new features are never from Apple. If you looked at the marketplace, someone, somewhere already had those features. Apple just did it better a year later. That is what they do, no shame in it either...but they are not an innovative company.",1348307813.0

Forstall and the iOS team don't really care to shift much and take risk in exciting new features (after all, why take risk, if it ain't broke, don't fix it). That's why there are barely any new and groundbreaking features in iOS 6 vs. 5 (BS on your ""200 new features"" - nothing but minor tweaks) Do not disturb? Come on. It's nice but not a keynote slide.<p>I LOVE Apple products, I used to destroy my eyes on Apple IIs back in the day and have always loved what they do. I've followed (and had) most every product they've launched. I still have a Newton somewhere and once in a while play Sim City on OS 9 classic like a super-nerd.<p>I also think consumerism expects A LOT from this company. When Steve was on stage announcing products and wowing audiences, there was innovation, risks, big bets were being placed on products - now, the empire just runs, like a conveyor belt. Every year, a minor upgrade. It works. It sells. It's fine. They're not losing their way, they are just becoming a part of the status quo. They're not challenging anything. At least in the last year or so. Leadership is strong but they're going in a straight line. Calculated moves.<p>You can't blame them - this is a massive public company and one mistake will lead to an uproar. The question is - will Apple's biggest mistake be not taking a risk and innovating.<p>Remember, even the Roman Empire fell.",1348307121.0

Normal headers are not large.<p>Compressing headers is not for handling large headers. They are for handling repeated headers.

When a company gets as big as Apple does, you'll always be able to find cracks and missteps.<p>Where I think Apple is failing is filling the gap of Jobs, and I don't mean the man, but the fear. Jobs was notorious for being an asshole and firing whole teams if they didn't deliver to ""his standard"". Without this fear, I wonder if things will begin to come out that would otherwise never have seen the light of day.<p>IMO, the last few products Apple has released have been much worse than the previous few. Lion was a bad release, Mountain Lion was better, but generally not a great release either. The new Nano with the round icons is, well, horrible looking. Would Jobs have let that go out? Would the team release that if Jobs was still alive and in charge?<p>I'm actually a huge fan of individuals being able to make autonomous decisions.

There are people who invest in and work for startups, people who invest in and work for non-startups, people who invest in startups and work for non-startups, and people who invest in non-startups and work for startups. The interplay between time and money and risk and growth with these combinations became clearer to me because of this post.",1348305340.0

Sure, Chrome does that, but not all broswers do, and certainly not simple http clients unless you're spidering.<p>It's pretty easy to not be vulnerable to CRIME, but not when you use SPDY; since SPDY was compressing everything.  The protocol takes away the control that the HTTP 1.1 user had through specifying desired options in headers, such as whether or not to use compression.  And compression was never the default in HTTP/HTTPS.<p>I wish that I liked SPDY.  It's easier to go along with the crowd.  But I just don't.  IMO, it's something that should stay internal to Google and not be pushed on the rest of the web.  Exactly for reasons like this exploit.  It's way too easy to screw this stuff up.",1348305197.0

To be upfront, I am not arguing what the word startup means - the society is free to assign to it any meaning it wants and what Paul describes here is a clear, specific meaning that's as good as any.<p>What makes me uneasy is the model itself and what it implies for the entrepreneur. To me, it makes the most sense for the VCs and other investors who manage a <i>portfolio</i> and can accept to fail in 90%+ of their decisions while still getting massive returns from the remaining 10% that succeed (Maybe I'm even understating the split here). But it's awful for the entrepreneur. They manage portfolios of one and surely, nobody sets out to fail! It's an awful feeling and no matter how much you say ""I've learned a ton!"", you still waste a big part of your life while also surviving under intense stress.<p>There is no one model, no clear right/wrong here and clearly Paul's model does work over large numbers of cases, judging from the Googles, Apples, Dropboxes of the world.<p>I personally favor a more grounded approach where you start with a strong industry background/knowledge or at least a set of skills that make you and your team special. The more diverse your team, the better, as you'll make connections between possible/untapped solutions and your domain's problems. Then you set out to solve a problem you've noticed (with a clear business model and path to initial traction based on your industry intuition and upfront customer discussions) and seek customer interaction <i>as early as possible</i>. If you're in IT, you're in luck as you can often get to your MVP early and you should try to get customers FAST.<p>Doing this with limited exposure to the VC game, in my mind, teaches your company to live within constraints and minimize your burn rate while making the most out of every member of your team. You can also take a little more time evolving your product, devoting your energy to the science (as opposed to fund-raising, etc.) and discovering unique value propositions. You also have the freedom to pivot as you need and perhaps even spend lots of time with your initial clients (and maybe <i>be a consulting firm</i> for a while) to learn. There may then be a point where you are much better informed about your business and want to go the VC route to transition to Paul's growth mindset. Apple started in a garage with family loans (if memory serves right) and got funded <i>after</i> it was already selling its prototypes and had traction. This formula, of course, would never work for a crappy team, but then no formula does.<p>Now if you happen to be working on the next Google, then it really is moot trying to achieve a disciplined organization upfront or taking it slow or spending time with initial clients or [fill in the blanks here]. You've found a gold mine and you're essentially pillaging it - who cares if you're inefficient. But less than 1% of smart entrepreneurs out there will end up finding that gold mine and somehow I would hate to be in the 99%. I would prefer a strategy that increases my chances of initial traction, possibly slows me down a litte, but gives me the mental leeway to discover a true niche and possibly a scalable product later on. The book ""Nail It then Scale It"" comes to mind.<p>Maybe this is what Paul means all along, but I can't help thinking that the ""weekly growth targets"" would paralyze many of the newcomer entrepreneurs out there with its singular mindset and make them blind to the intricacies of the problem they are actually trying to solve.",1348304482.0
