1,4141210,comment,4140015.0,4140334.0,5,0,drostie,,,"One subtle point: there are sometimes legal processes for declaring independence from a host country.<p>The most clear example of this is the Statute of Westminster 1931, which the Parliament of the UK passed in order to create a legal process by which its colonies could file for legal independence.<p>As I understand it, in British law classes, there is often a question asked of students: ""If Parliament repealed the Statute of Westminster today, would we (in principle, legally) get all of those colonies back? Does Parliament have the right to repeal the Statute of Westminster and the grants of independence under it, or were they something otherwise unprecedented in law: a surrender, effective forever, of certain legal powers?"" Etc.<p>So yes, there are sometimes legal processes for starting a country, although the U.S. doesn't really have one. The U.S. <i>does</i> allow you to apply for statehood however, so it might be interesting to immediately declare independence (illegally) and then immediately apply to become a state (legally) to see which imperative wins out.",1340272716.0

The pattys seem like the meat was thoroughly grinded to a smooth paste. The bread doesn't have any flavour, and because it's in a closed package with the rest it becomes soaked and soft from the steam. The worst part is the cheese (if you can call it that -- it doesn't look or taste like cheese at all). The fries are okayish. On the rare occasion that I'm with a group of people who want to eat something at McDonalds, I usually take a salad with the sauce in a separate package, because even the salad sauce doesn't taste good.<p>This was surprising to me. You can make a much better burger than McDonalds in 10 minutes with standard equipment. Just take some minced meat, form it into a flat cylinder, rub some olive oil salt and pepper, cook it in a frying pan, after you turned it around add (real) cheese on top and cook the other side, slice a bread in two and roast it a little in the same pan, and stack up the burger with some lettuce, tomato and some mustard and/or ketchup. Why can't a company whose primary purpose is to make burgers not make a burger half as good? It's not like the ingredients here are more expensive. Or do people really prefer McD's burgers?<p>Don't get me started on restaurants that use canned peppers and mushrooms that make the whole pizza wet and acidic.

44,4141167,comment,4139580.0,4140605.0,5,0,tikhonj,,,"This is actually a rather underrated property of good static type systems. Some types (like (a, b) -> a or a -> b -> a) are actually so constraining, they can only have one valid (e.g. not ) implementation. There is actually a program that, given a type signature, can write the trivial function for you [1]. It's pretty awesome, but admittedly more a curio than anything practical.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1178"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1178</a><p>Happily, there are practical programs that take advantage of the types' expressiveness. My favorite example: Hoogle[2]. It's brilliant: a search engine that given a type signature gives you a list of functions either with that type (modulo renaming) or a similar type. The beauty is that it can work even if the function is more general than what you're looking for and has a weird name (so a normal search would not be very helpful).<p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/</a><p>A perfect example: let's say you're looking for the equivalent of JavaScript's join method. It would have the type [String] -> String -> String. Now, this particular function does not actually exist in Haskell. Instead, there is a more general function called intercalate that works on any list. Moreover, intercalate's arguments are reversed: it's type is actually [a] -> [[a]] -> [a] (or String -> [String] -> String if made specific to String). And yet, if you search for [String] -> String -> String, the second result is intercalate! It's magical.<p>In short: types are basically a form of self-documenting code, so you get a lot of cool stuff for free given a good type system.",1340271523.0
