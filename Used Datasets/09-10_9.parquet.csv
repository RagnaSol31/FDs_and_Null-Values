If your code needs to be cross platform, then OpenGL (or both, but that again is more expensive) is the only way to go.  If cross-platform compatibility would simply be icing on the cake, then you need to weigh the development costs of both approaches.",1262944440

Like ""redesigned shopping cart process, which reduced the number of support calls by XX %""<p>Watch out for ambiguous text: ""the clean UI and weather graphs really made Harvest’s product stand out."" It's better to be able to say something solid like ""new design led to XX % better user retention"" or ""new UI was awarded by XX"".<p>I'd also advice against placing your education with the rest of ""about me"".
