17,4349369,comment,4348976.0,4349145.0,11,0,tikhonj,,,"Obviously it doesn't actually violate the laws of causality. However, it looks like it does.<p>At a high level, I think this is essentially similar to the ""time travel"" you can get with continuations[1]. The first blog post[2] linked in the readme should make things clearer.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://matt.might.net/articles/programming-with-continuations--exceptions-backtracking-search-threads-generators-coroutines/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://matt.might.net/articles/programming-with-continuation...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://lukepalmer.wordpress.com/2008/08/10/mindfuck-the-reverse-state-monad/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lukepalmer.wordpress.com/2008/08/10/mindfuck-the-reve...</a><p>Essentially, a ""stateful value""--that is, a value that could be based on some state coupled with that state--is just a function from the state to the value and the new state. It has the type s  (, s) where s is the type of the state and  is the type of the value. This is the simplest way to represent state in a purely functional way. To actually use it, you have to supply the initial state and you then get the value and the new state.<p>When you actually use it, you plug the state in to get the value and the next state. Then you go to the next function you want to run, plug the new state into that and so on. The whole program looks neat thanks to do-notation:<p><pre><code>    stateful = do currentValue  get\n                  put (currentValue + 1)\n                  return (""x_"" ++ currentValue)\n </code></pre>\nIf the current state is 0, stateful gets 0, increments the state and returns ""x_0"" wrapped in the new state (1). If you sequence two statefuls one after another, you get ""x_0"" followed by ""x_1"".<p>The trick is that each line is actually a function of the type I mentioned before, and is joined with the next line without running it. So the whole stateful ""value"" (a string) has type State Int String which is effectively a function Int  (String, Int). Each line of the do-notation is the connected by taking the current state, plugging it into the Int  (, Int) function and getting the new state and value from that.<p>The reverse state monad works in a very similar way. However, instead of taking the current state and passing it into the new function, it takes the new function's resulting state and passes it into the current function. This is somewhat convoluted, but it works thanks to laziness and the fact that the state is just composing functions at each point. When you actually run it, it all works out.<p>In practice this means that your program's state behaves backwards. Given the same stateful value:<p><pre><code>    stateful = do currentValue  get\n                  put (currentValue + 1)\n                  return (""x_"" ++ currentValue)\n</code></pre>\nit would give you ""x_1"", ""x_2""... starting from an initial state of 0. Contrast this with the normal state monad which would give you ""x_0"", ""x_1""... The state flows from the put to the get even though the put <i>follows</i> the get. In a sense, the put sends changes the state backwards through time.  This isn't what <i>actually</i> happens in the program, of course, but that's what it looks like. What actually happens is that it builds up a big, composed function using the state and then works properly when you run it because of laziness.<p>So you don't get <i>actual</i> time travel (we're programmers, not physicists!) but you do get some really clever control flow that basically maps your out-of-order program into something computable.<p>This particular package just combines both the normal state monad and the reverse state monad into one, letting you make big computations that have state running through in both styles--forwards <i>and</i> backwards.",1344333033.0

This suits the customers as it is free and very quick (usually within seconds), and suits the banks as they don't have to keep all of that pointless paper around, process cheques, verify signatures etc etc.<p>There's talk of getting rid of cheques sometime in the next decade in the UK, because hardly anyone uses them any more, I think the first date proposed was 2018 though they've now put it off for a bit.",1344331421.0

Drug laws are bad in general.<p>Do a little research and you'll find that even for heroin and cocaine the harm done to society by their being illegal far exceeds any conceivable harm done by the drugs themselves. When and where cocaine has been legal, people drank tea from the leaves as a mild stimulant similar to caffeine. When heroin was legal people took it in pill form and addiction was safe and affordable - the main long-term documented negative effect of regular heroin use is constipation. Many people have lived a long and healthy and productive life addicted to these drugs in exactly the same way I've lived one nearly continuously addicted to caffeine (in my case, preferably administered in the form of Diet Coke - your tastes may vary).<p>When alcohol was illegal, whiskey was cheaper than beer and people went blind drinking wood alcohol; when alcohol was legal again the average potency of what was fashionable to drink declined. That same dynamic applies to every other drug - making a drug illegal makes a more potent, more dangerous product available where leaving it legal lets people use it far more safely - an outcome you can only be opposed to if you carry some sort of Victorian anti-fun meme or if you're convinced that everybody in the world is insane, untrustworthy and lacking in judgment <i>except</i> the angels we've found to regulate the rest of us.<p>I recommend the book Licit and Illicit drugs, which you can read for free here:<p><a href=""http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/cu/cumenu.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/cu/cumen...</a><p>You could also just look up any of the drugs you're worried about in an old-fashioned paper encyclopedia.",1344330300.0
