""size-est"" and ""shape"" / ""color"" is easy to rip out, and a basic OCR to detect shapes and sizes and a number is pretty basic.<p>And remember that the site lists Captchas as being OCR-able, and that the question sentence must be readable - quickly - by humans, so it can only be weakly obfuscated, unlike some of the shorter Captchas.  That weakens an already-claimed-as-weak system, so it's easy to assume the instructions can be read.  Detecting a couple key words via a smallish dictionary seems simple at <i>worst</i>.<p>A few mistakes can be ignored, because the server must allow a few - people will make them too.  After all of the above, what's the success rate on a dumb interpreter?  Say, one that can't understand order of words, merely their existence.<p>I'm not seeking to totally shoot this down - I think it's an interesting idea, and with a large number of objects and some visual obfuscation could possibly supersede Captcha.  But it's achieved by <i>adding</i> logical complexity; to retain ease of use, visual complexity / some other form has to be sacrificed, which makes it easier to read by machines.  Or, potentially, making the image quite a bit bigger, so the images / objects used can be made significantly more complex (""click the dog"" when given several images).",1274954022

You could fix it to something / someone else, and have it use its mental power on behalf of someone else. It might not even know it exists.<p>Actually it sounded great at the time but, surely, if it had a balky human it would make a mental model of the difference between what it wanted to do and what it could do, and reach /some/ conclusion. If it knew about people I guess it could make a good guess. Hrm, I guess it'd be like our own ids, like the apostle Paul said - ""I don't do that which I want to do, and do that which I don't want to do"". So the creature would come up with a notion of 'singularity frailty' and 'original ineffectuality', perhaps.",1274952251

Problems such as these does not always require (or have) a solution. The kinds of social engineering that may or may not solve a particular problem often have unpleasant and unexpected results.,1274952194

Humans by nature are subjective, giving into their whims and desire (most of the time wholly contrary to expert advice on what's good for them and what's bad for them).<p>Take homosexuality for example... as recent as a few decades back, it was an abhorrent crime, hated by society, hated by government. A few years later, it's celebrated, with countless open air marches and festivals around the world. God's position on this hasn't changed - peoples has!<p>Take dress code as another item.... the definition of 'modesty' holds a whole different connotation almost year on year. What's acceptable in terms of women dress wear, magazines, films, is slipping bit by bit, year on year. Again, another human whim.<p>The harmful nature of swine has been studied and documented to the nth degree. The bacteria it contains, and the susceptibility of the meat to transmit viruses is well known within certain research communities (do google search).<p>""Religion alone has caused more suffering in history than any other idea, and has lead to wars, deaths, torture, discrimination, intolerance, sexual repression, sexist discrimination to women, and a slowdown for science, culture and knowledge.""<p>On the contrary. Human beings have killed people. Religion hasn't. All the 3 major religions are against innocent loss of life. The death toll in Iraq has gone off the scale. The death toll in Afghanistan has reached into it's hundreds of thousands. These are Atheist wars! In modern history, Atheism has killed more people than centuries of religiously motivated killings.<p>Religion has brought, not only moral truth, but also has cultivated the soil for humanity to be scientifically and technologically where it is at now. The Islamic Golden Age (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age</a>) has contributed an invaluable amount to almost every aspect of our existence today (from universities, to contracts, to music...).

It's obvious he's been over all of this hundreds of times.<p>- Figure out great analogies and other aids. Part 3: 5:20 he makes an analogy out of multiplying bacteria in a bottle that fill it in an hour to show us at what point of the exponential function you notice your in one. It's got two parts and is very effective. It allows him to say things like ""5 minutes before the bottle is full.""<p>- Introduce your aids gradually and keep using them. Make clever decisions about your aids and make sure they accumulate to a powerful toolset. After that analogy which all the time he introduces the analogy above he has:<p><pre><code>  - A trick for calculating doubling time 70/annual growth in %\n  - A graph\n  - A table \n  - An example (Boulder) that he keeps running scenarios on. \n  - The bacteria analogy \n  </code></pre>\nBy the time he's 20-30 minutes into a lecture, this guy has a very powerful vocabulary built up. He can take something like oil consumption and examine it with you very quickly using these tools. The bacteria in a bottle analogy is a great example of this. Once he's explained it (kind of hard) and practised it once or twice, he can say <i>""What time is it?""</i> and immediately have his audience understand something relatively complex. .",1274951746
