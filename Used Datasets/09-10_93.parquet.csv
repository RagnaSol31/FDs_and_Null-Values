If you quit or are fired, you rightfully only get the ones that have vested, that's the whole reason they gradually vest - so that neither party is completely bilked if you leave after a year and a half. They're not handing over that percentage of the company on the day you join. That would be silly.<p>It's disturbing that Zynga is doing this, and it's a shitty thing to reneg on salary promises, but that's basically what vesting options are - uncertain salary promises. What they're doing is saying ""We promised you a salary based on company worth, but we're now growing so fast in value that there's no way you're worth this much to us, so take a pay cut from now on, or we're firing you"". If those people have been there for three years, they should already have 3/4 of their stock vested, assuming they're following the typical valley vesting schedule.<p>I think the main reason people are so vocal about this is because there's generally an implicit understanding that options are different from salary, more set in stone.
