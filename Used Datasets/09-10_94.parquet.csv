Elite university graduates also got some implicit training in the social norms of the upper classes, and by virtue of the intense competition to get in you can be sure anyone who graduated from them is smart. More accurately, anyone they accepted, the dropout rate for top tier US universities is very low (except for Caltech).<p>And yes, people with degrees do think people without are dumber, and employers likewise, because its true.

Just a pragmatic move while they get the pro features into FCPX.<p>I guess if there is any hidden message it might be that they are wanting to keep the pro's onside - which might be good news for the direction of FCP and Logic.<p>(also to note that there is nothing actually wrong with FCPX - I'm using it everyday working on some marketing materials right now.
