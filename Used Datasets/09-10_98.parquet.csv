I fully believe incentives affect us much more than most people appear to think.<p>However -- So I understand that when the system encourages certain behavior, that certain behavior is very likely to arise regardless of how logical, ethical, or correct the behavior seems. For example, many students have a very unhealthy focus on grades and living up to expectations, teachers on evaluations, and administrators on high enrollment numbers, etc.<p>However, this doesn't mean that the incentives can't and shouldn't be circumvented. For example, if one is put in a place where performance-goals are encouraged (a focus on grades), I sincerely believe part of the teacher's role is to do their best to encourage a learning-focus and discourage performance-goals.<p>So this applies equally to a teacher's behaviors -- when a teacher is encouraged one way or another based on evaluations, it is the job of the administrators to either destroy whatever causes that encouragement, or in some way encourage a learning-outcome focus instead. I wonder, do you feel anything is in place to do that? And what could be?",1310983146.0

Every machine I have was updated from v4 to v5 manually, because it didn't happen automatically.<p>> Mozilla also has a script that scans extensions on AMO and auto updates the versions they support if they don't detect any issues. For the majority of extensions they should keep working unless they do wired hacky things or use more advanced extension APIs.<p>That unfortunately characterizes many Firefox extensions. I also feel that you are downplaying the issue, I have had simple plugins have their toolbar buttons break between minor updates. The current Firefox extension system just isn't right for the times.<p>> Mozilla has also been downplaying the version numbers in recent announcements for Firefox updates.<p>> Mozilla has also overhauled the extension system with the introduction of the Add-on SDK.<p>That is good to hear, I wasn't aware of that. I still would have preferred it if they had dealt with these issues before switching schedules, it's not like they came out of the blue. Now we have this drawn out transition period that could have been shorter. It also remains to be seen if they'll be aggressive about migrating to this new extensions system.",1310982718.0

46,2775645,comment,2774254.0,2774254.0,0,0,pseingatl,,,"What bothers me about this episode is that it highlights what is wrong with education in America and confirms what many think about academia as being too insular. What is the cheating that Professor Panos complains of? In many of the cases the cheating was not the mindless copying of math problems from someone seated nearby. Instead, the professor asked questions which the students were to research and submit an answer in the form of an essay. The class was a class in real-world business, not an exercise in rhetoric. Presumably, essay writing skills, to the extent that they are needed at all, are taught elsewhere. The job of the students is to perform research and find the answer or answers to the question. Professor Panos complains that the cheating students methodology was, research, copy, paste. There is no comment as to whether the cheating students submitted correct answers. The failure to document sources is considered plagiarism in academia, journalism and other fields. Not so much in business. In business, what is important is the answer. If McKinsey has done a study for company X on an issue and company Y has now commissioned McKinsey for the same study, does Professor Panos believe that McKinsey wont use the earlier studyor any other study done by someone else which they can get their hands onto answer the question? Im not picking on McKinseyall consultants work this way. There is nothing wrong with it, and not having to reinvent the wheel is a clear benefit to the client. If I have a question to answer and a colleague has already comprehensively answered it, whether he be Korean, a fraternity brother or a sorority sisterwhere is the harm in saying, I am indebted to my colleague who has answered this. The fact that I serendipitously found an answer is not a negative in the business world. Not giving credit to a colleague is a whole other issue. The Internet is a research tool and there is nothing wrong with using it wisely. Whats moreand since this is not about writing essaysis the goal here to have twenty-something business students give their personal opinions, opinions that the business world tends to discount greatly; or is the goal to have them find useful answers and compile the same appropriately? Having been asked numerous times in real life, where did you get this from? being able to say, someone has already looked at this and this is the conclusion they came up with has always been helpful. On more than one occasion, it saved the day.<p>These were not math or language tests. The Spanish word for test is examen but if all I have done is copied the answer from my neighbor during a test I will not have made any progress in learning the language. Cheating is penalized because the student is cheating himself out of the opportunity to learn. I do not see how students who do research on the Internet and compile that research in answering a question have cheated. If you want to demand more rigorous citations from your students, demand them. If a fraternity brother has answered the question, give him credit. Improve on his work if you can. These are real world skills, and to the extent that business school insists on archaic essay writing the students are being done a disservice.",1310981294.0

Every time they close down a path for contact export, spread FUD (e.g. Zuckerberg leaving Google+ for ""privacy"" reasons) and so on they make it very, very clear that they're terrified of Google+'s potential and they're going to do everything they can to stop it.<p>The problem is that Facebook isn't the late-90s Microsoft. They don't have the raw monopoly power to stop people from leaving for Google+, they need to persuade them. And every move they make to try and force people to stay (instead of enticing them) makes more people want to leave.<p>Perhaps the Ad ban story isn't what it seems, I'll reserve judgement on that. But it certainly fits the Facebook's overall Google+ pattern.<p>Contrast this with Twitter's reaction. Google+ circles can be used asymmetrically, so they're equally in danger. However, unlike Facebook, they've ignored Google+, at least AFAICT. When Google+ was announced I actually thought Twitter was in the weaker position, but I'm starting to think I was wrong.",1310980310.0
