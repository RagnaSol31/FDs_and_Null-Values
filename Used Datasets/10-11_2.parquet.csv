1,2886269,comment,2886187.0,2886187.0,14,0,TeMPOraL,,,"Wow.<p>That actually resonates with me much better than anything I've read on procrastination so far. I am burning lot of my mental cycles on thinking about my own procrastination, and it crossed my mind that when I start to do things that I'm (in broad sense) forced to - by my boss, lecturer or even myself, I feel like loosing some kind of self-awareness, control of my life... I never pin-pointed the feeling exactly, but it resonates closely with what you wrote.<p>Also, I'm so used to my personal GTD-like productivity management methods that I sometimes feel I'm not able to think or work without using pen & paper or Emacs for organizing my thoughts. Now, the thing I'm worried about is that it doesn't really feel like I have 'boosted my cognitive skills' or whatever - it feels like I'm so handicaped that I can't think without help of external tools. I look around and see people (that look) smarter and more successful than me, and they don't seem to be using <i>any</i> productivity tricks at all. Maybe it's [something]-bias [1], but it gets me really worried. Anyone on HN felt something similar?<p>[1] - need to catch up with LessWrong on that ;).",1313405980.0

Having said this, your suggested solution is incredibly hard to put into practice for many procrastinators out there.<p>I have bills to pay and a family to support, and working for the Man seems like the only option, at the moment, to meet my financial obligations. I don't particularly enjoy my day job, and I wouldn't do it if I didn't have to. To maintain an illusion that I am not just a slave tied to a very short leash, I procrastinate. Ignoring my email inbox full of pending tasks and spending the day outside in the sunshine instead can feel very liberating, but obviously it doesn't solve anything, and doesn't get me a step closer to greater freedom.<p><i>""life as a sequence of awesomely fun and exciting things""</i> sounds great, but the reality is that only a very small percentage of people are lucky enough to lead this kind of life.",1313405919.0

Did not want to do homework? no problem.<p>From all those years growing up I can remember only one occasion at which my mother tried to force me to do something.

I postpone all of this stuff all the time not because I am afraid i could not do them or because they are pushed on me from the outside.

One can gain knowledge about the world via statistics, not merely personal acquaintance, and statistics also tend to be more useful.<p>However, to answer your question, yes. I know poor people. I've lived most of my adult life in poor neighborhoods. My experiences tend to agree with what the official statistics say - most poor people eat enough or perhaps too much (virtually none are underfed), don't work much and do not live in overcrowded homes.<p>These are the specific points on which I disagreed with Scalzi. I cited statistics which back up my position.<p>You are also dodging a question, so I'll ask it again: which set of statistics do you disagree with? The BLS, the Census or the USDA?",1313403713.0

Without any taxes, Warren could put $1 in his pocket if he wished. Instead the portfolio company (Wells Fargo) pays 33% taxes, then the holding company (Berkshire) pays 29% taxes, then Warren pays 15% dividend taxes.

81,2886187,story,,,557,142,edo,Dear procrastinator,,"Dear procrastinator,<p>Procrastination has nothing to do with disciplining yourself or 'just doing it' This is the most common misconception about procrastination and will instead achieve exactly the opposite of what you want. Let me explain:<p>The reason why human-beings procrastinate is to feel in control of their life. The act of rebelling against an oppressor, an authorative figure telling you what to do, is your way of regaining mastery over your own fate. Very much the same way kids throw a tantrum when their parents order them to do something, the procrastinator puts off tasks because he has come to harbor resentment against the thing to be done. Why, you ask? Because in your admirable will and ambition to achieve your goals, rather ironically, you have created the only thing that can stop you from reaching your goals: a separate mental authority figure causing unneccessary internal strife. You have created a bully out of yourself.<p>Start listening to the way you talk to yourself; Instead of punishing yourself for not following up on things, you need to learn to let loose. Adopt the belief that you have the natural tendency to work productively and act creatively. Nobody needs to man up, shape up, or be disciplined. Stop framing the world as if it is a constant struggle to get things done, instead start viewing life as a sequence of awesomely fun and exciting things to work on.<p>Good luck,\nEdo van Royen<p>edit: Humbled by your comments, thank you all. I write pretty regularly, just never on a public forum like this.<p>note: I notice my writing could use some nuance. Painting an extreme is just a style of writing which helps bring across a point.
