Since it's not crucial for their business, they don't know what they want. Yeah, maybe they have a marketing department, even a digital/social media division. But that can only produce so many ideas, and there's too much internal feedback to guarantee that ideas for, e.g. a mobile app, would be effective or innovative. So maybe they decide to hire a design firm with experience designing innovative mobile apps. In most relationships, the process would only alleviate those problems slightly: they would get more ideas, from outside their own offices, but only a few which the firm considers ""best"" and they would be subject to the firm's biases anyhow. A 'hackathon' like this is clearly a much cleverer option for a corporation: they get <i>many</i> ideas from diverse sources, they get to choose which ones to prototypeand they get <i>30 prototypes!</i> And <i>then</i> they pay up. This isn't really about hackathons, it's about efficient economics. ""Exploiting"" is in the original post's title, but it's really no different from the normal exploitation inherent in every economic interaction.<p>As a consultant, I am used to a certain level of inefficiencypaying me even as I brainstorm, for examplewhich hides the exploitation of my labor. I am upset about hackathons like this because they reveal the exploitation and how it is tipped in Campbell's favor.<p>In a somewhat different vein, being on a college campus, there are similar exploitative relationships, in a sense, at the hackathons I go to. hack@uchicago just had a really awesome hackathon. I was coding, and had an excellent time, but I didn't compete. I know a few other people didn't compete for the prizes either, but were still building cool stuff. We had three main sponsors: UChicago's Physical Science Collegiate Division, UChicago IT Services, and Inventables. All three were engaging in rational economic transactions, beyond charity, much like Campbell's, but nobody's pissed off about it because the economics aren't obvious and the exploitation is many levels of indirection away: nobody directly got a product out of it. The PSCD, however, got some marketing and something to put on their website which will help get them more grants, researchers, whatever. IT Services regularly hires students. I would be willing to bet that the folks from Inventables approached multiple hackathon participants with an eye toward hiring, and I bet the winner straight up got a job offer (which he deserves, for the record, if you're reading this Paul). Meanwhile, I got free food and an excuse to work on a weekend project. I'm not upset because I don't feel exploited by that exchange. I think everybody got what they wanted out of the hackathon.<p>tl;dr: The economics make perfect sense for Campbell's, not for developers. Chances are any time somebody sponsors a hackathon, it's also an economic exchange, but this one is exploitative (or, if you're a Marxist, this one makes the inherent exploitation of every economic interaction more obvious).",1358679298.0

If I really don't anyone want to know that I got this data, that's failed scenario. It makes things easier for service provider, they don't want to know what they're storing. Just like Freenet's data cache. But if I know what I'm looking for, I can confirm if my cache contains that data or not. Therefore this approach doesn't remove need for pre-encrypting sensitive data. Otherwise it's easy to bust you for having the data.<p>Edit: GNUet quote:""The gnunet encryption scheme is remarkable in that it allows identical files\nencrypted under different keys to yield the same ciphertext, modulo a small\nblock of metadata. These files can then be split into small blocks and distributed\n(and replicated if need be) across hosts in a gnunet system to balance load.""<p><a href=""http://grothoff.org/christian/esed.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grothoff.org/christian/esed.pdf</a>\nEfficient Sharing of Encrypted Data - Krista Bennett, Christian Grothoff, Tzvetan Horozov, Ioana Patrascu",1358676498.0

I worked on a popular (and contentious) directory product for whom interoperability (or lack thereof) was the product's bread and butter.  For the mid-2000 release we were embracing XML goodness from the W3C.  XML was in style in the same way JSON is today.  We settled on WS-Transfer and IBM's WS-ResourceTransfer extensions because, frankly, it didn't matter what we picked so long as it was XML.<p>Well, we worked on the release for 2 years and then 6 months before shipping our VP decides that decision posed too big of a risk for IBM gaining 'the upper hand.'  He made a point of blaming people for the decision <i>he</i> had approved years ago.  We then had to rip out a perfectly good and tested implementation of WS-ResourceTransfer, design a replacement, make it an industry standard, and finish with the original schedule.  We came up with something 'different' called MS-WSTIM ( <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd302851.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd302851.aspx</a> -- fun fact, I got stuck writing most of those docs).<p>After the change our principal technical architect spent the next year going to conferences talking about the technical merits of how MS-WSTIM exceeds WS-ResourceTransfer in oh-so-many ways.  He supposedly worked to convince minor players to adopt the new 'industry standard.'<p>The whole thing was a sham.  MS-WSTIM is WS-ResourceTransfer by a different name.  It just wasn't IBM's, and like so much at Microsoft, politics reigned supreme.  I would be surprised if the same were not happening here.",1358676451.0
