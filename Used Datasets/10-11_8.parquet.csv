Makes it hard to differentiate between files and directories at a glance.\n- No drag and drop, you cant quickly copy and move files.\n- Renaming files is clunky (on OS X at least).\n- Right clicking a file doesn't give you many useful options.\n- Doesn't match the host OS's file manager very well. It's some sort of weird middle ground; on Windows it should act like Explorer, on OS X it should use the same conventions as Finder.<p>Compare the file manager to the ones in Coda and Espresso and it's fairly poor.  I know the ctrl/cmd + p shortcut is pretty amazing but sometimes you don't know exactly what you're looking for and have to fall back to browsing through a codebase to find what you're after.<p>This post sounds a bit hateful, but I really like the rest of ST2. It's just the file manager which gives me grief.",1314788308

I guess out of ignorance, I never even considered getting a cofounder. I can't say I regret my decision. Having 100% control over the course of my company is something I wouldn't easily give up. In terms of workload, what does a cofounder give you that you can't get for much cheaper with contractors or employees? In terms of emotional support, I think being married actually helps quite a bit. Even though my wife is not actively involved in the company, I bounce ideas off of her all the time.<p>Perhaps a cofounder is more useful for startups that want to grow very fast (the type YC likes to invest in). But for the organic/bootstrapped style startups (ie 37Signals / FogCreek) is having a cofounder really necessary? Everyone likes to quote PG on this, but consider the source. His experience is with fast growth, VC funded, shoot for the moon style companies. So it may not necessarily apply to everyone's situation.",1314785120

You have two sets of training regimen, an then your conclusion is that one set decreases your fat levels more because it <i>burns more calories</i>. I can't find the study or even a decent abstract, just a small blurb at the university's site[1], but that looks like a huge case of Doctor Obvious to me.<p>What's the common factor? Did both exercise regimens take the same time, so you'll get more calories/minute from aerobic exercise? That would make sense, but just comparing two different sets is like saying that soccer is healthier than basketball, if you partake in one match per week. Yes, there's a difference in the sports themselves, but the bigger one is probably that soccer takes 90 minutes while basketball is 40 (right?).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.dukehealth.org/health_library/news/aerobic-exercise-bests-resistance-training-at-burning-belly-fat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dukehealth.org/health_library/news/aerobic-exerci...</a>",1314784928
