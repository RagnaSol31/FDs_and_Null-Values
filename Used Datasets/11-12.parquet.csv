This is true, but you could use ssh forwarding or VNC (at a considerable performance penalty). I believe the other security issues (mainly related to PID 0 and which user processes are run at) will be solved shortly. Running applications in Docker is never going to be as secure as running an app in a full VM, but it can definitely be better than trusting random code on the internet (the recent Steam client issue springs to mind).",1424606309.0
