Keep the media in check<p>Lesson 2: Make Your Product Clear\n   They clearly need to state what this is and what is not. E.g. it is not Facebook, it is not Twitter it is a way to add more social functions and collaboration to your existing Google services<p>Lesson 3: Launch When Ready\nLinked to point 1 but it has to have a good level of quality at launch.<p>Lesson 4: Have Real Value\nIf it replicates things I can get already from Facebook or Twitter it is not going to add value.<p>If it does allow me to get the best results from my private services (e.g. Facebook, twitter, Google reader) like Greplin but with instant search directly from my Google window that would be valuable.<p>If it gives me Rapportive but in a way that works in Gmail awesome. If it gives me Wisesync but in a way that works in Chromium also valuable.<p>If it lets me play video directly from my Gmail inbox or ""like"" something within my inbox or search and ""stream"" this to my social feeds<p>If it gives me a feature like mysixthsense within search or google reader or adds in Postrank as a google lab feature to inbox and search these would also be valuable to me.",1284549388.0

If you define rich as only those who are in the top 10 richest people in the world, then maybe you have a point (though I'm still skeptical). If you use a more widely accepted measure of rich or wealthy (say $5m in liquid assets) you include hundreds of thousands of people in this country alone. And you never hear anything about almost any of those people. They live quiet lives, building their business and spending time with their families. Who wants to write about that? So journalists cover the flashy bastards instead, which skews your perception. Read some research that's been done on the wealthy as a group before you go making conclusions based on a handful of the most extreme outliers at the top.",1284549372.0

All Google's product and services are inter-connected. Unlike tradition software company like MSFT, google doesn't build products for the sole purpose of making profit from start. They make products, and they iterate and years from now if it reaches a tipping point they will start making money off of it. Most of google products are depended on each other's success.
