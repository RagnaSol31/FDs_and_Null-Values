It must also be noted that you don't usually read every single word in Asian languages since often whole sentences are short enough to recognise their whole shape.

Is it really the material you are taught and can apply to software that brings a lot ? The ability to solve problems ?

But it pretty much stops here. In mathematics, you define all your abstracts concepts and frame of validity, in programming, you are given a (very shaky and detailed) frame of validity on which you build up abstract concepts.<p>The ones that are good in approaching the discipline through the study of details to build up stuff that will work on top of it will make the developers.

42,3381211,comment,3380734.0,3380734.0,2,0,darklajid,,,"That's a fascinating topic for me, for two reasons:<p>1) At the local Hebrew lessons I met a minister of the embassy of South Korea. He told me that Korean is a praised language all over the world (it was news to me - make of it what you want) for its simplicity and therefor speed for typists. He elaborated and said that both the layout (keyboard, I assume) would be very sensible and every 'character' is actually a combination of consonant-vowel-consonant and thereby simple (triplets, always) and carrying a lot of information. Since then I'd like to learn more about this idea and confirm or bust that claim.<p>2) Learning Hebrew is hard. A real quote from a coworker was ""It's an easy language! We only have 22 letters, after all"".\nReduce your alphabet (alephbet?) from 26 to 22. Note that of these letters, 5 are only special versions of other letters and replace those in the last position of the word. Which leaves 17 letters for most words/the meat of the language. And most words are rather short (okay, okay.. I'm not comparing to German here, that would be pointless. Even compared to english it seems to be the same or shorter to me).<p>Bottom line: I still have a bet going that I can generate Hebrew line noise (following the rules of going with the 17 letters and adding the required sofit/end letter if required. Gibberish ending in  would be 'fixed' to end in ) and will hit word after word. On my list of possible weekend projects I have an entry 'Hebrew or not' to crowd-source this.",1324554018

Now I am in a position where I may even be able to execute some ideas that might be of interest to investors.<p>The question of whether to go global at first is really a very hard question.  I think it absolutely depends on the business.  Many businesses would benefit by starting locally and working closely with customers at first before going global.  Many other businesses would benefit by going global right away.  Making the right decision here is sort of tricky.<p>Now, one thing to note is that this isn't an all or nothing question either.  A smart business will globalize where it makes sense and localize where that makes sense.  For example, if I am going to go and provide (or send someone to provide) training, I am not going to send someone half-way around the world for a short-term training contract.  On the other hand, sponsored development on LedgerSMB is easily global.

In my mind, it has long been <i>inevitable</i> that - at the very least - the wealthy population of the planet will retreat into a virtual world, ala ""The Matrix"".<p>It's not just the benefits of instant, unlimited sensory gratification (which are IMMENSE - real-world physical attraction and location no longer becomes an issue for finding partners, you can enjoy <i>any</i> activity at <i>any</i> time which in the past could cost you enormously in terms of money and/or risk:  in a virtual world there's no spread of diseases if you're not in physical contact with people, no risk of death driving @ 140mph, etc. which also means a reduction in health costs, etc.).<p>It's simply far more efficient in many ways:  why physically travel to work when you can have virtual meetings, offices, etc.?  You could attend university anywhere in the world regardless of your location.  Doctors could operate remotely where it's physically cheaper to live.  Sitting at home all day (or in a Matrix farm) also means using less energy so you eat the bare minimum, don't need to own a car, don't need a big house with a garden, etc.  On a larger scale, how useful will e.g. war become as the demand for physical resources falls?  The efficiencies are mind-blowing;  it is globalization of both personal and economic activities and human resource allocation without the physical constraints.<p>Ironically enough, in the same vein as your comment, I would expect people on HN are more likely to be fans of such an extreme form of telecommuting, telelearning, etc.<p>Not that I'm not suggesting all of this is <i>good</i> or <i>healthy</i>.  Who knows what the psychological or physical effects of such a lifestyle will be.<p><i>Speculating further:</i> At that point, why bother exploring the universe?  Or more interesting:  to what extent would wealth exist?  It seems people would only need enough wealth to maintain their physical bodies and access to the planetary supercomputer. Accumulating more wealth could prove very difficult since classical economics falls apart in a virtual world where supply can become potentially unlimited over time.  Would it be possible to accumulate sufficient ""real"" wealth to construct devices capable of finding and communicating with aliens, and/or visiting them?  Would industries capable of building such devices even exist after everybody moves into the matrix after a few thousand years?
