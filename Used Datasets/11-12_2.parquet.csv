I called my mother (father wasn't home) and asked her to send the file. I would guide her through the process.<p>The conversations went a little bit like this.<p>Me: <i>Ok so you go to the desktop and open the mail client.</i>\nMom: <i>I am at the desk</i>\nMe: <i>Not the desk, the desktop on the computer</i>\nMom: <i>Where is that?</i>\nMe: <i>If you click on the little button in the bottom of the screen next to where it says start.</i>\nMom: <i>Internet explorer?</i>\nMe: <i>No the next one.</i>\nMom: <i>Which button do I push?</i>\nMe: <i>The left one</i>\nMom: <i>Nothing happens</i>\nMe: <i>What do you mean nothing?</i>\nMom: <i>Well a small window pops up, is that the desktop?</i>\nMe: <i>No, you are right clicking, you should click the left button.</i>\nMom: <i>But I am!</i><p>We go back an forth a little with me trying to convince her that she is pushing the right button. Then suddenly:<p>Mom: <i>Ups everything disappeared and now there are only small  icons, what did I do wrong?</i>\nMe: <i>No that's it. You did it right, that's the desktop.</i>\nMom: <i>Ok, but that was the right button.</i>\nMe: <i>Hmm weird, well anyway open your mail client, that's that icon I showed you, double click the left button.</i>\nMom: <i>ok, nothing happens that little box pops up again.</i>\nMe: <i>Mom, I am telling you, you are clicking the right </i>button. You need to click the left one.*\nMom: <i>But I am, it's just really difficult.</i>\nMe: <i>What do you mean difficult? You just double click on the  left button.</i>\nMom: <i>I know, but this is not behaving like it used to</i>\nMe: <i>What do you mean?</i>\nMom: <i>When I go up it goes down and it's really difficult to double click with my thumbs.</i><p>Me: <i>Ahh</i><p>Of course I now realized what was going on. She had the mouse upside down. After that I could guide her the rest of the way.<p>I talked to my dad later that night and found out the problem.<p>Instead of the mouse cord going behind the desk and into the computer it went in front of the desk to the USB plug on the front of the computer.<p>So the mouse had ben pulled around but she didn't get that. She thought that was how things should be.<p>Mind you she had used it before.<p>My mom is not a complete moron, yet she didn't manage to realize the problem.<p>We take understanding how this stuff works for granted because we grew up with it and got a more holistic understanding of things related to computers. Our parents didn't.<p>I have often compared it with dropping a geek into the wilderness at the African savanna with a map that isn't correct.

Some is dated, but like the rest of the book, most is incredibly modern.<p>Totally agree about lack of overview. eg. Java's docs on JTree are detailed and there is no shortage of tutorials and samples online, but I've yet to find an overall description of how it fits together. One has to piece it together from carelessly left clues.<p>Auto-generated documentation can be quite useful for working out how things fit together, and you can click through linked types to follow the connections. This is one advantage of statically typed languages like Java (bonus: combining source and doc-comments - ""literate programming"" - keeps them synchronized, or helps to). I often scan javadocs by return type and/or arg types to find the method I need. Haskell has an amazing doc tool where you enter the type signature, and it tells you the functions that match. (BTW: I love this, but do haskellers find it useful on real-world projects, in practice?) Python benefits greatly from not having static types; this is one of the few disadvantages.<p>The author was honest enough to admit some particulars where he didn't follow his advice. It's easy to advise on the right thing to do, but if you find it difficult to get it done yourself, is it really <i>practical</i> advice, under real-world pressures, on those particulars?

You can only observe that inertial mass is not equal to the gravitational mass if you have two objects of different material with different values for inertial mass/gravitational mass. If the big and the two half sized objects are made of the same material then a different inertial mass just corresponds to a different gravitational constant G.<p><pre><code>    Mathematically let m_g be the gravitational mass and m_i be the inertial mass. \n    We have F = m_i*a and F = G*m_g*M_g/r^2. \n    So we have a = G*m_g/m_i*M_g/r^2. \n    Now m_g/m_i is the same for the big object and for the half object.\n    We can absorb it into the constant G and end up with a = G'*M_g/r^2.\n    Conclusion: the big object and the half object have the same speed.</code></pre>,1276601609

I started doing market research for exactly this idea, and saw dozens of people who are trying to approach this market in slightly different ways.<p>Unfortunately, I'm away from my notes, but my latest thought was this:<p>1. Able to import basic excel data, even if an MVP can't deal with VBA. Support the basic types of Excel, and be able to interact with the data in a spreadsheet sort of way. (Much like Access.)<p>2. Don't make IT afraid of this app. Imagine the technical support requirements as people lose data, do something weird. It's a burden to IT. So, it has to be dead-easy to use (Read: like Excel) with incredible documentation (video, audio, tutorials, dead-tree), and has to give buy-in to IT that it will make their lives easier, not harder. Judging by my experience working in shops with small IT, this is really hard.<p>Or, it has to be for very-small businesses without a major IT presence. Then, it has to be cheap, because they already have excel. This looks to be the biggest barrier! You have to convince the client they have a problem. To me, this looks like the wrong market, though the one I started to look at first.<p>It's a sexy market. I'd still love in on it, and the people who finally figure it out will be a billion dollar business. However, more people than you know have tried it. It's a deceptively hard problem and I've been thinking about it off and on for over a year now.<p>I'm starting to think it should look a little different. Take care of an enterprise app framework for small businesses that takes care of single sign on with easy LDAP/AD integration, connections to multiple database, connections to legacy apps (simple links with option for single sign-on integration, with options for new windows or frames) and THEN have an Excel/Wufoo-crossbreed add-on for creating small applications. This would have IT buy-in, as they could use it themselves for small things, it would have built in transparent security, and they would be able to delegate to power users who could define the problem and would be able to work with IT for solutions.<p>This would be a big app. I haven't found the MVP to extract, save for the framework itself.

But I'm not expecting any real help.<p>I know this is a bit desperate but I'm hoping HN user lsc (who runs prgmr) will take note of this.<p>Meanwhile, can I ask you to advise me on choosing another VPS host? I know Linode and Slicehost are the most recommended ones here. Given the prices, I might go in for Linode but I'm wondering if any of you have advice on running a beta cheaply until launching a product.<p>Sorry for the rant. This is my first time running a VPS server. I'd appreciate any help.<p>EDIT: Thanks a lot for your responses everyone. In addition to Linode, a few other good alternatives have been suggested which I will look into.<p>I have managed to get my server up again now and also got a response from prgmr. It's a shame that I had to do this publicly, I don't mean to defame prgmr. But I think it's worth pointing out that this is possibly one bad feature of competing on price.",1276600650

51,1432384,comment,1429524.0,1432072.0,0,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> Terrorism is pretty much about murdering people.<p>No. Terrorism is, by definition, about using fear as a weapon to further your goals. Terrorism can be perfectly successful even if nobody dies -- it's all about playing your opponent's need to react against him. That's why even a fake bomb, or pre-announced bomb attacks IRA style are terrorism -- because there has to be a reaction to a bomb threat, at a relatively small cost a terrorist can force the opponent to do huge evacuations and bomb sweeps.<p>Completely ignoring the 9/11 would have been a better reaction that what the USA took -- but as usually with well planned terrorism, completely ignoring the attack would have been politically impossible.<p>> And what is a proper reaction to an organized attempt to kill civilians in your country?<p>A proportioned response against the attackers, instead of some of their various allies or complete third parties.",1276600392
