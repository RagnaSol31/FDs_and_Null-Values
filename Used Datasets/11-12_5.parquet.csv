You start getting distance problems though - a lot of words it generates are too close to or are trivial encapsulations of existing words, so that'd need taking account of.

You only show up for 30 minutes up to two hours (depends on when you post) on the new posts list and then you vanish forever. You should not repost, obviously, so you can't do much to get your project back on HN for a while. Of course, if you know the right people, they write a blog post about you, which brings you back on HN and you'll be overwhelmed with feedback, but this is rather the exception than the rule.<p>Generally, it is really hard to get people to send you feedback, especially if your project/startup/tool is intended for not tech-savvy users. There will be some users giving you feedback all the time (powerusers/early adopters) and you should stay in contact even if you don't have something new at the moment<p>What I found to be useful is displaying a ""1 minute of your time to improve the product""-form on the (in this case) applications home page, where every user will go. It is important to add a ""no, I don't want to do this""-option, because you don't want to nag your users with a always displaying form-link. Don't do popups, too, they are irritating. Just a small but visible link with a do or don't option and if the user don't want to do it, don't force them again. On my last project, I got almost 20% of the user base to fill out the form this way, which I think is a really strong base for analysing and improving your application/startup/tool.",1298461843.0

I am interested in building a site that scours HN for website launch items, and lists them alongside their launch thread, a short description of what it does, its point score, and the founder's username.<p>There are spreadsheets that do this, but aren't effective.<p>Not even YC has a portfolio page.<p>-- Problem: good sites get launched on HN and then they get lost, or not easily found. There should be a way for them to be tracked, ranked, categorized and tagged. Seeing what people have done and are doing is a good way to find co-founders, mentors, relevant people and prevent duplication of effort. Most importantly, it is a way for users to find online tools and services that they'll use, and to see their founders who they could contact.<p>-----------<p>2) Seemingly good founders and startups are getting rejected from YC, some being accepted after a 3rd or 4th attempt or raising large rounds immediately afterward. People from outside the US are flying into California and being rejected. I have details of a site that crowd-sources due diligence on startups - a task that investors now do.<p>It's basically about putting YC and Seedcamp-type application questions and their answers online, and then requesting and publicizing feedback. Responses and responders are just as important as the pitch, as seen with Quora and its priority on people answering. Tracking interested parties surrounding a startup team is as important as is tracking people interested and attending conferences on Lanyrd. Also, seeing what startups a person is involved with (investor, staff, mentor, user, supporter, partner) is important.<p>-- There was a time when putting a resume online was surprising and revealing to me, by way of LinkedIn.

I am not saying that health care works best in a free market or not, but whether it is elastic/inelastic is not the only factor. Also, depending on which health care we are talking about, it is certainly elastic: sure, if you just got shot and are mortally wounded, you are pretty much ready to pay anything you can to get treated, but maybe that private room or new cancer treatment twice as expensive without proved benefits is not that necessary.",1298460053.0

It bypasses the .NET GC and lets the kernel decide whether it actually wants to write the file out. So if you've got a 1GB file that you need temporarily it will write part of it to disk depending on how much RAM is available.,1298459985.0

A lawyer bills for his services by the hour. Both will provide a best guess at what they think it will take, but if you add some work or they find some problems you eat that cost not them.<p>Why people think software development should be any different is beyond me. If you are not getting equity in the project then you should not be working on a fixed price contract. It places all the risk on you while limiting your upside (you can only make the sticker price on the contract). Meanwhile the client has unlimited upside in this arrangement and shoulders none of the risk beyond the sticker price.<p><i>the employer will feel cheated if paying for longer than they expect (and let's be honest, all employers think that websites take half the time to build).</i><p>Ignorance of the discipline of software development is the employer problem, a good software developer can show them how scope creep, change in priorities and adjustments to specification has a negative impact on their expectations. If they feel cheated that is their problem to deal with, software development is not charity and if it takes twice as long to build and a developer puts in twice as many hours then they should be paid twice the hours just as any other service professional is.<p>The client/employer is not going to say ""oh wow we made twice as much as we expected off the software you developed, here you go, here is some free money"". So why would the developer say ""oh wow the project will take twice a long as, the employers uneducated analysis says it will, let me eat half the labor costs""<p>That being said, only extremely experienced freelancers should consider taking a fixed price contract. It can lead to financial ruin, in almost all situations a freelancer should be insisting on time and materials, like 90% of other service professionals. The exceptions would be reproducible services where times can be estimated with certainty (e.g installing wordpress or Postgres).<p>To answer the parent posters question, I see a lot of Senior level JavaScript freelancers charging in the area of $100-$200 hr for their services.

That's only an extra $160 per build machine. (2x4GB DDR3 sticks @ $80 each)<p>I shaved ~10 minutes off a ~15 minute build and unit test time by putting the SQL DB on RAM and the source tree in RAM. SQL was by far the biggest win. The source tree only saved us about 30 seconds.<p>If you're on Windows just tick the Advanced Write Optimization box on your drive and all your writes will go to RAM. I think there is something similar on Linux. It sounds like you're the type of person who probably already knows this :)<p>L2/L3 cache is absolutely huge but the biggest wins by far IMHO are battery backed write cache. The really shitty thing is most BBWC controllers use 50% of the cache as read cache by default which is a total waste IMO. I find about 10% read cache is optimal on the controller.\nIf you can't afford SSDs and still need to guarantee consistency.,1298459361.0
