Ask if they believe it could be true a decent portion might say ""maybe, who knows!"".<p>But you could be stood on a US street and talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory. Or a UK street and talking about whether the French smell perpetually of onions (deliberately picking two ends of the scale there).<p>The key problem is you get a set of stories from the absurd to the quite reasonable; and you mix it with an already existing resentment. That leaves you with people who don't simply laugh at the absurd, and instead just shrug.<p>As to whether you could sell these stories to people; of course you can. The media, and other aspects of society, sell absurd stories to ourselves every day. Facebook has been abuzz at least three (distinct) times, to my recollection, about the fact that FB were going to start charging for access. People genuinely outraged about this development were raging about it.<p>Chain letters.<p>I also travel a lot in the US and in certain areas you see equally absurd stories about all sorts of different classes of people. Go back over history and it is even worse; we still get absurd stories about homosexuals. A little further and black people got the same treatment. Perhaps the stories we see here are not so openly absurd to <i>us</i> as ""Iran releases killer sharks"" - but if you dig into the story you example it is built on a perfectly plausible basis.<p>There is even a wholly relevant very-recent example; Jews and Money. That is still sold to people with alarming regularity.<p>I know a perfectly lovely, middle class, suburban housewife[1] who, on finding out one of my friends was gay, asked me if it was because he had been abused as a child. She is quite convinced that homosexuality is commonly the result of childhood abuse (safe to say; that one floored me :S).<p>1. No, not like that!",1318334304.0

I'm wondering what recommendations you business owners have for learning enough about accounting principles for a business to maintain the business accounts during the initial growth phase and to understand what the professionals (accountants, lawyers, bankers) advise about business financial decisions. I'm very willing to do hard work in materials that have lots of exercises and problems, but we (co-founders and I) have very little accounting or even bookkeeping background. Are there online courses in accounting? What books are good about small business accounting? What other resources do you recommend? What software tools for actually keeping the books work well?",1318332000.0

Boy is that misleading.<p>So many things here in Israel are challenging my understanding, every day. It doesn't help that I'd describe myself as agnostic or atheist. I guess Jews are the only example (that I know of) of a group of people that claim to share religion, ancestors and culture. I wouldn't know how - for example - one could create a model of a secular state here. I wouldn't know where to separate culture from religion and I'm convinced that I'll never understand the idea of common ancestry / being descendants of the same tribes.<p>Maybe this intermingled religion/culture/ethnicity (if this is the right word?) is confusing more people, just like me.
