18,3546769,comment,3546072.0,3546661.0,3,0,hollerith,,,"Right: revenue means money taken in from sales.<p>We know that it costs Apple about $300 to make a $500 iPad 2 and the cost of making an iPhone is known, too, and that cost is a lower fraction of the price they get (from the carrier or retailer) than it is for Macs. Of course, Apple had to spend many billions to make the <i>first</i> iPad 2, and the $300 does not include support costs (which I think are fairly minimal).<p>Point is that it is known that most of Apple's current profits come from iOS device sales.  Also it is a pretty safe bet that the profit on music and video entertainment sales is fairly low as the owners of the music and video entertainment are very good at negotiating.  Finally, Apple has stated that profit from app sales is much less than profit from even the least profitable hardware lines (currently iPod and Mac).<p>It is interesting to note that even Apple and Microsoft do not know the net income of the various divisions: since the success of the iPod brought new interest and new credibility to the Mac line, thereby increasing Mac sales significantly, and since it is impossible to know exactly how much Mac sales were increased by this ""halo effect', it is impossible to know how much of the cost of developing the iPod should be assigned to the calculation of the net income of the Mac division.<p>Similarly, Microsoft and everyone else knows that the immense market share of Windows in the 1990s among consumers helped Microsoft's products to compete against offerings by IBM, Lotus, Sun, etc, in the enterprise market where Microsoft currently makes most of its money, but it is impossible to calculate exactly how much of the cost of acquiring those consumers as customers should be allocated to the Business division and the Server and Tools division.<p>Finally, for part of its life, Visual Studio was given away to qualified developers because the availability of more apps for Windows was seen as protecting and assisting that business, so a calculating of the ""true cost structure"" of, e.g., the Windows and Windows Live division and the Server and Tools division would have to take that into account.",1328270098.0

I could pay the new $10 per month for a custom domain name or I could just stick the site on a cheap shared hosting package, I use a provider that charges me $65 per year for 20+ domain names on it. Although I do get easier deployment, building etc with AppHarbor its not a compelling story as I don't change my company site that much to justify it.<p>With my second website, I found it much easier as the client want to move fast and AppHarbor's build and seamless deploy really helped as the client could refresh the page and see the changes. AppHarbor really works well with this client and he has come to appreciate that although it is more expensive than say shared or VPS that the uptime is better and it costs him less money as I don't bother charging for 2 minute changes that I can do quickly and push to AppHarbor.<p>Overall, I have mixed feelings about these pricing changes, especially as I started looking at what Heroku is offering. I plan to play around over the weekend with NancyFX, Mono and Heroku. Perhaps that combination would work well with my smaller clients.",1328270079.0

Real Journalists discover it, and investigate. And I think they're sincere enough in their investigation.<p>Some of the Real Journalists discover that there is a distinction in the culture between the ""script-kiddies"" and the ""hackers"". This is the familiar distinction: the hackers make the tools. ""Hacker"" versus ""Software Engineer"" is I suppose like ""amateur"" versus ""professional""; hackers are doing it for the love of programming -- but this distinction is lost in this context where the professionals are agents and spies. Still, the distinction of ""hacker"" is important because the ""script-kiddies"" have no idea how to develop the tools, but merely use them to break into systems. And in observing the distinction, the journalists discover that the hackers are much more important, in the sense that people pay them some sort of homage and respect.<p>When the Real Journalists bring this description back to the Media, of course they bring back this sense of respect for the Hackers. But the Media has a problem: we don't really have a word for people who penetrate security measures. ""Crackers"" are things you eat; ""penetration testers"" are probably machines at a dildo factory.<p>What we'd really like is to use Dutch grammar. In Dutch, someone who ""finds out"" things becomes an ""outfinder."" These people ""break in"" to things; they should be ""inbreakers"". We have it in some words like ""withhold"" -- to hold with -- but it's not a general part of our language.<p>Alas, English is not Dutch and the inbreakers weren't called inbreakers. Instead, just as the Christians are named around the title of their savior, ""Christ"", so the inbreakers are named around the title of their most-respected ""Hacker"".<p>Was it a deliberate choice? In one sense yes, in another sense no. There are impersonal forces at work which conspired to fix ""hacker"" in the mind of the Media as a synonym for ""inbreaker"" -- but it is a deliberate choice for the Real Journalists to not run stories about the <i>other</i> hackers out there, and to not coin a new word that could be useful for the discussion.",1328266953.0
