With the right architecture, performance will degrade gracefully. You'll get slower and slower responses as the load goes up, and eventually start dropping requests, but the servers will not die and there will be no cascading failure.<p>One way to achieve this is to make sure the queuing happens at the load balancer, and no large queues are allowed to build up in the individual application servers.",1363175879.0

First year of use, only shown in public in certified trade shows IIRC.<p>This is how patents work, they require publication to enrich the knowledge pool and the return for that publication is time-limited government granted monopoly.<p>If SpaceX can demonstrate prior use then no later filed patent can, if the law is correctly applied, prevent their continued working of that specific invention.<p>The point is to put pressure on inventors to file, that's one of the two major purposes of the patent system (the other being to ensure due compensation of inventors).",1363175800.0

The close parentheses form of division from 1540 looks like the basis of the long division form of division, i.e. 2)6 with a bar or vinculum, extending from the top of the parentheses over the 6. The long division form finally takes its modern form in 1888. The transformation of that symbol seems somewhat obvious and natural.\nI wonder if we are likely to see further changes, as modern typesetting should resist the variations that handwriting would introduce.
