If you're thinking of moving there, knowing German makes things easier, but you can definitely get by without it. The nightlife is definitely one of the best in Europe. As the comment above said it's very cheap. I'm seriously considering moving there once I have a bit of money saved so I can work on my own projects for a few months without burning through cash too quickly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Hacker_Spaces"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Hacker_Spaces</a>",1232886777

NH wont let me edit the comment but consider this a retraction.<p>I'm more interested on whether Amazon having a monopoly on the hardware/distribution could allow them to dictate the payment model for example they could continue pay-per-book whereas customers normally prefer subscription based models.<p>This is already a fairly dysfunctional market where the vast majority of books are out-of-print and will never enter the public domain. There's also some question about what happens to public libraries.<p>About the sony reader did you use libprs500 (now called calibre) to do the conversion for you? It works on Linux and autoconverts everything I've thrown at it.<p>Personally I use it for reading trashy SF that I wouldn't otherwise buy (I'd feel like I was wasting paper if nothing else). BAEN is a practically unlimited source of the stuff.,1232886373

We know you write a bingo software, but please stop marketing it all the time. It's like being at a party and there is a mattress salesman who always brings the conversation back to mattresses and how he got started, and how he found good deals and so on. At the party, one can walk away from that guy, here, unfortunately not. So, don't use this forum as a marketing tool for your bingo thing.

For example, a feather could be used in a feather bed, or it could be used in a duck. You can program a feather, test it and make it work, without needing to have designed or modelled a duck yet - of course, you'll have an idea where it belongs, but since it is an enclosed and reusable component, it can be created first without a top down model.",1232885897

That can happen to anyone, especially if your last name is common.<p>Google makes names easier to ""recognize"", and the Internet's vastness increases the total amount of ""fame"".

I forget) 2008).<p>It just doesn't work for technical books (why that's probably a good thing -- I'll cover in a minute).  No monospace font, but also, you read tech books a lot faster than normal text.  Pages fly by when they've got code in them (most code in these books are API/language based, which means you usually just care about identifiers), and that hits one of the big weaknesses of the kindle:<p>Page flip time.<p>When you're reading a novel or other all-human-text book, the page flip time is barely noticeable, as your eyes are moving to the top-left at the same time.  However, if you're scanning a book for a specific section or mention of an identifier, it'll kill you with its slowness.<p>However, if you're like me and read a lot of technical books, this isn't such a bad thing.  The kindle's a great way to get in on reading nontech books, which adds a good dimension to a geek's life.  There are mailing lists where publishers give you a new ebook a month, to get you into new authors/genres of sci-fi.<p>Plenty of 'regular books': novels, biographies, newspapers, etc.  It's a wonderful way to richen your life, with amazon's recommendation engine & a good selection of books.<p>My friend has a sony eReader, and his device is a much nicer piece of hardware.  But I win in selection, hands-down.  He mostly just reads PDFs on his now, usually datasheets or the like.<p>As for cases, the original works decently for me.  I also just don't care that much about cases -- anything to protect the hardware sufficiently without getting in my way is fine.  If you play with the case a bit (a little physical-world hacking), you can make it stay on the device pretty well.",1232884955
