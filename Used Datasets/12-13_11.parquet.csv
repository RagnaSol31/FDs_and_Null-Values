Right now most public schools, especially the worst, are very similar to prisons. Students, like prisoners, have to attend. Studends have no choice to attend another institution or not to attend any institution. And, like prisons, public schools must accept everyone sent to them, no matter how bad. Predictably, schools, like prisons, end up being very depressing places.<p>In contrast, public housing vouchers are given to poor people who can then redeem them with any qualified landlord willing to take them. All parties, the poor person (tenant),  the landlord, and the government, must agree before the rental transaction happens. The tenant can choose among among any privately-offered housing. The landlord can choose to reject any tenant that doesn't meet the landlord's standards. And the government only agrees to pay for housing that meets its own quality standards. The result is that good landlords have waiting lists of tenants who want to rent from them and bad landlords are shunned. Similarly, good tenants can find good housing while tenants with a history of bad and destructive behavior find fewer landlords who are willing to accept them.<p>Public schooling could be operated the same way. Poor people could receive vouchers redeemable with any qualifying school. And schools could set their own standards for the students they want to serve. Government would redeem vouchers only from schools that met its own quality standards. The result would be competition and waiting lists for the best schools, and pressure on students to be accepted into the best schools.<p>Public financing of college education works the same way.

74,2212571,comment,2212211.0,2212541.0,0,0,chris_j,,,"The main difference between Lisp and other languages (including Haskell) is that Lisp is homoiconic. That is, a Lisp program is represented as a list, a data structure that can itself be manipulated by a Lisp program. This means that a Lisp program can contain macros that can generate Lisp code at compile time (or even at runtime). This might sound dangerous, especially if you have seen C macros or C++ templates being abused, and it is. It also turns out to be rather powerful; you can use macros to implement at lot of things that in other languages can only be implemented by the compiler writer. One popular example is looping constructs: if your Lisp doesn't have a for-loop then you can implement it as a macro. This is how for is implemented in Clojure, my personal favourite Lisp.<p>What about functional languages? Well, Lisp has been around for so long that it pioneered a lot of programming concepts. One of these is functional programming. Later, many purer functional languages took functional programming a lot further, Haskell being a great example. There are many flavours of Lisp today and some, such as Clojure and Scheme, aim to be fairly pure functional languages (and Haskell is the purest functional language that I can think of), whereas others, such as Common Lisp, are less so. Functional programming is only one thing that Lisp has going for it, of course.<p>As I mentioned, Lisp pioneered a lot of concepts which we take for granted today. This essay by pg gives a summary of what made Lisp different and is well worth reading, along with other pg essays on the subject of Lisp:<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/diff.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/diff.html</a>",1297598658.0

If you're expecting to get people to build your company for you without much value proposition, you might as well forget it. If you're hoping to sell them on equity (founder or employee), they must believe in your company and vision.<p>I assume from your post that you and your brother are cofounders and neither can code? If this is the case, your setup already hardly make any sense. Smart coders will know better. Chances are you hardly know much about the business side of things much less convince coders to build your dream, one that I'm sure hasn't been ""truly"" validated.<p>Of course I am assuming and I could be wrong and you did validate your idea correctly and have much more going, but I seriously doubt it (and I'm trying to say that nicely here).<p>You should in all sense, validate the idea with REAL potential users, not your friends. If that pans out and you have limited funds, outsource a prototype first. THEN and only then, should you consider moving to the valley after you've got some minor traction and a working demo. The valley is not cheap and unless you live somewhere like Manhattan, you're not helping your financial situation much more. You're making it worse.<p>Networking is important but working smart is also important. You can make online connections before coming here. You have your odds stacked against you if you don't have local coders for raising (whether you hire before or after). Majority of all investors won't invest unless you have in-house coders so the long term strategy of hiring overseas hopefully isn't something you were planning and is only in consideration for your prototype/demo.<p>Salaries here are crazy but that's how it goes. At this point in your startup, I would seriously consider finding a cofounder and define very specific roles between you and your brother. And hopefully you're bringing enough knowledge on the business side as you're expecting your coder to bring to the table on the technical side. After all, you don't want to bring on someone who can't code at all and expect them to learn, no one wants to team up with an inexperience business cofounder only to have them learn and certainly not TWO of them. Something to consider.<p>Ideas are great but alone they're not worth much. You need to make it worthwhile for whoever you're working with as well. If you can get a prototype and demo up, pitching to coders AFTERWARDS make things a bit easier. Something to consider.<p>Best of luck",1297598656.0
