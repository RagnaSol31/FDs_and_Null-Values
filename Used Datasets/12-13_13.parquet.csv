For example, if I buy an apple for $0.50 but the maximum I would have payed is $1.25, I enjoy $0.75 of consumer surplus.<p>Essentially what you are proposing is that consumer surplus should always optimally be zero. That in a perfect world, every producer would charge each consumer exactly their maximum willingness to pay for each good.<p>But just as there is consumer surplus, there is producer surplus. Producer surplus is the difference between the minimum price they would be willing to sell a good for and the actual price they sell that good for. So, as an apple producer, if the lowest price I could profitably sell an apple for is $0.10 but I actually sell if for $0.50, I enjoy $0.40 of consumer surplus.<p>In traditional free-market models, at an equilibrium price there is a mixture of consumer and producer surplus. Consumers buy things for a bit less than their maximum willingness to pay, and producers sell things for a bit more than their rock-bottom just-marginally-profitable price.<p>In your model of perfect price discrimination, there is a huge shift in surplus from consumers to producers. Yes, it&",
