I'm not sure I understand the argument.<p>And also, just for an example: In my experience, Clojure's package management beats Rubygems for purposes of a project. You specify your dependencies and their versions (including the Clojure language itself) and a script updates them from the whatever repos you specify. It's taken the Ruby ecosystem some time to come up with RVM and Bundler which accomplish the same things.

The onerous contract is what transfers the monopoly from the artist to the record company.<p>The problem is the cumulative power that the big four record companies wield, due to the sheer amount of rights they control. It allows then to arbitrarily dictate prices and conditions, because if you don't accept their terms, they can lock you out from their entire catalog. Since they have exclusive rights, no one can start a competing service with more favorable terms or a more economical business model. Which is why these four even have the ability to try to keep their pre-digital business model. If there was any real competition here (not saying I have an answer to how that would work), these companies would have been ground into dust ten years ago. Instead they have manage to either litigate away or drown in fees, any possible successor to their antiquated way of distributing music.<p>There are of course independent labels, free music, creative commons and so on, but that's competing distribution models for the artist, and offers no possibility for the consumer to ""vote with his money"". The only choice is to get a different album/song from a different artist, which doesn't make much sense to me.

I like getting updates to applications and kernels with the six-month release cycle, but their new interface release cycle seems rushed. With Arch I have even faster access to app and kernel upgrades without the gratuitous (to me, at least) system changes.<p>You want to upgrade users to grub 2.0? OK, not a pressing need for me, but fine, whatever. But at least when you make that change include system support so I don't have to manually repair the grub menu's default selection every freaking time you update the kernel. </rant mode>",1301054552.0
