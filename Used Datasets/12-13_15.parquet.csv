There's nothing to read if nobody is writing,  and why write if nobody is reading?<p>I had a friend years ago who ran a multimedia-oriented site that only took open formats like Ogg Vorbis.  Although hypothetically,  Ogg Vorbis is a free format which might be accessable on more operating systems and devices,  practically,  publishing in Ogg Vorbis is like speaking in Pig Latin.  MP3 files just play for most people on the devices and OSes that they actually use w/o any trouble.<p>Even though there is an articulate group of people who are concerned with privacy and other philosophical problems with Facebook,  the fact is that most people just don't care -- if you ~really~ cared about those things,  you probably wouldn't be oversharing your life on a social network anyway.  In fact,  from a 2010 perspective,  Facebook's early policy of only publishing to your 'close friends' looks medieval:  the industrial spy,  potential employer,  litigator,  or other person who wants to use information to harm you is going to extract it one way or another,  from such a network.
