This is relatively undisputed.</i><p>I won't dispute this either. But to say that students who go looking for quality can find more quality in the United States haphazard nonsystem of higher education than they can in other countries is not the same as saying that United States higher education delivers good value for money. Higher education in the United States also absorbs astounding amounts of money.<p>Many economists of education (I will mention Mark Blaug, but you could find others) point out that if we must talk about public subsidies for schooling, the place to put them is in the K-12 system with its presumably compulsory attendance, rather than in the higher education sector. Public subsidy of higher education tends to operate as a transfer of funds to the less able rich (who can afford to take time off from the labor force to attend college) at the expense of the more (academically) able poor, who still find it difficult even to be admitted to college, much less to complete it.<p><a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_27/b3840045_mz007.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_27/b3840045_...</a><p><a href=""http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ffp0621.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ffp0621.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ff0615S.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ff0615S.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.tcf.org/Publications/Education/carnrose.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tcf.org/Publications/Education/carnrose.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.tcf.org/Publications/Education/kahlenberg-affaction.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tcf.org/Publications/Education/kahlenberg-affacti...</a><p><a href=""http://harvardmagazine.com/2005/05/a-thumb-on-the-scale.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harvardmagazine.com/2005/05/a-thumb-on-the-scale.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200511/financial-aid-leveraging/4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200511/financial-aid-leveragi...</a><p><a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=510012"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=510012</a><p><a href=""http://www.equaleducation.org/commentary.asp?opedid=1240"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.equaleducation.org/commentary.asp?opedid=1240</a><p><a href=""http://www.jkcf.org/assets/files/0000/0084/Achievement_Trap.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jkcf.org/assets/files/0000/0084/Achievement_Trap....</a><p><a href=""http://www.reason.com/news/show/123910.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reason.com/news/show/123910.html</a><p>Transnational comparisons (yes, including with China) tend to show that the most successful strategy for national strength is to devote the most public funding to broad educational programs for the early years, and to allow much support of higher education by the students in higher education, relying on their savings, their current income, private charity (including discounts from the colleges), and their creditworthiness. Countries with higher education funded largely by private funds actually have greater participation in higher education that reaches a broader segment of the population.",1268225779

17,1180767,story,,,1,1,buro9,Ask HN: What's the best way to acquire cheap computing power for uni projects?,,"I'm in a pickle with my MSc Computer Science project as I've been a little more ambitious than I perhaps should've been and am looking to examine reporting of semi-structured data from ECM systems (notably SharePoint) using Oracle and possibly Cassandra (compare and contrast a traditional RDBMS extended for Xml against a object store built for semi-structured data).<p>The ECM system is going to require several virtual servers to implement, and a few more will be allocated to both Oracle and Cassandra. I'm looking for a cost-effective way of running multiple (in the order of 6) virtual servers concurrently.<p>The university department does not appear to have spare capacity available for my use (it's a lot of hardware dedicated to a single student) and I've examined cloud based solutions such as Amazon AWS, Azure, etc but the cost of running a mix of Windows and Linux servers for 4 to 6 months on the cloud is extremely prohibitive.<p>I'm now of the opinion that it's best to build a system at home, but I don't really want to have multiple cheap workstations heating up the front room. I could build my own system, but paying full retail price on parts makes it more expensive than buying an off-the-shelf workstation so I'm now looking at workstations that could take 12GB to 16GB of RAM. Yet none of the workstations I've found come out cheap enough to be ramen affordable... they're bordering on lobster. Systems like the Lenovo D20, Sun Ultra 27 and the Apple Mac Pro look appropriate but costly when kitted out with enough RAM and disk to do the job.<p>So my questions are:<p>If you needed to run 6 x 2GB RAM servers for 6 months on the cheap, how would you approach it?<p>If I end up going down the workstation route are there established ways for post-grad students to get hardware for their projects at silly-low prices? (I've failed to find any obvious ways to obtain more than a very small student discount as the corp websites unfortunately don't appear to have a ""Are you a post-grad student looking for a huge discount?"" link).<p>For info, I'm based in London, UK... so prices I'm looking at are all GBP which pushes the cost up a bit.",1268225140

I started repaying the rest of them when I finished graduate school in 1996. I finished paying them around 2004. During my undergraduate years I was in an internship program, so over five years of school I had two years of fulltime work. And in grad school I was given a stipend and free tuition.

If the language only permitted ++ as a statement, the usefulness of side-effect would be lost.<p>It's a cliche that C is little more than portable assembler, but at a design level there's a lot of truth to it.

This is relatively undisputed.<p>There are pieces of it that are broken, but the assumption that some new better system will inevitably and miraculously emerge if only we had the political will to smash what we have to pieces is silly.<p>I'm for reform, I'm not for blindly destroying something we have and simply crossing my fingers in hope that it becomes better that way.  If you're concerned about how education runs, feel free to propose a new system, but don't simply assume that if we smash it with a sledge hammer something better will emerge.  Frankly the only thing that's likely to result in is ensuring the US lose its superpower status permanently.  (I think people often forget just how much of our military advantage is predicated on a research infrastructure that involves US universities.  Universities here do a hell of a lot more than just teach students.  Frankly anyone who supports our military needs to consider that our existing system of universities critical to its success.  Smashing this system is as reckless as proposing to simply cut funding to the military and then expecting them go to fight China or take over the middle east or whatever.)",1268223822

Market forces result in grade inflation and low graduation standards, something I think most people agree are extremely unfortunate trends.<p>Alternative proposal:\nRedirect student loan subsidies from students towards institutions directly, possibly also bias the subsidies towards public institutions.  The result should be lower tuition for everyone, mild downward forces on private institutions' tuition costs, hopefully no cuts to program quality and reasonable levels of affordability for reduced income students who will still rely on need-based aid more than loans and continue to have fairly cheap public schools they can opt to go to.",1268223256
