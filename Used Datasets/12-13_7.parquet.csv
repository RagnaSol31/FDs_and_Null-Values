During 2013 and 2014 there was an unprecedented political power struggle between Erdogan and Gulen ( <a href=""http://www.city-journal.org/2012/22_4_fethullah-gulen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.city-journal.org/2012/22_4_fethullah-gulen.html</a> ) whose cult has/had deep roots in the government especially in the police force, bureaucracy and justice system. They control many media outlets. After the breaking point, their sole aim was to overthrow Erdogan from his position, either because he started to block their spreading in the state, or because he simply did not want them anymore.<p>So they throw whatever they have in their hands, probably with a lot of manipulation. They attacked him and his family quite strongly with corruption claims (I would take them more seriously if there wasnt another motive behind all that). One of the attack point was about Syrian conflict. Probably government was supplying logistics help to the rebel groups fighting with Assads government but using their people in the key points they actually interfered with this action and presented this as if Government is helping IS. These journalists in question were also used as a proxy for spreading this. Now that Gulen has lost the battle big time, Government is taking his revenge by making some of their supporters lives miserable. But although they are now in the shadows they are silently continuing their attacks. From my point of view, Gulen&",

What the article is really about is side-effect free programming.<p>This is indeed covered very well, the author manages to explain both what side-effects are and why it makes sense to avoid them in a clear, succinct style with useful examples. Thumbs up for that!<p>However, functional programming is about much more than avoiding side effects. AFAIK, the defining factor for whether a give language can be classed as functional is whether it has functions as first-class objects. That means: can functions be created (and returned) by other functions? Can functions be passed as parameters to other functions? This is a huge area that was completely ignored in the blog post.",1451477526.0
