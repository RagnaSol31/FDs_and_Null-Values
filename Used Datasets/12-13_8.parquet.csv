You have to be very careful about listening to customers, because what people say they will pay for is quite different than what they will actually pay. Aggregately I might pay $80 for access to the Olympics and several other channels as well (I already do this, so this isn't really a stretch). I'm not so sure I'd pay $1.99 to watch the US Men's Basketball team play one game, and even if I would, NBC makes its money through advertisements. There is no proof that a pay-per-view model would bring nearly as much revenue as advertisements over wide broadcast would.<p>And this says nothing of the people who don't necessarily live in Silicon Valley and have ready access to broadband and iTunes.",1343566791.0

You don't have to use your actual real name, just something that sounds like it could be a real name.<p>The idea wasn't to prevent trolling or bad comments--I spent enough time banning trolls and cleaning the forums every day to know that it wouldn't have helped anyway--but to add an air of credibility and, dare I say it, professionalism to the environment.<p>I've found that people interact more intimately when they're talking to ""Bob Smith"" instead of ""cyberwulf555"".

22,4308317,comment,4306292.0,4308298.0,4,0,nirvana,,,"I've been thru Apple's review process enough times, and been rejected enough times to say that Apple does apply its rules equally.[1]  Given the responses I've gotten back from the reviewers, it is clear that I've interacted with multiple reviewers, and I've never seen a deviation.<p>There is the occasional mistake, but the very telling thing about this article is she never tells us the specific rule that she broke.  Hiding this information is important for making it look like Apple is arbitrary.<p>But the thing is, when you're rejected by Apple, they cite the specific rule.<p>Since there are lots of books about Amazon in the bookstore, and since there is no rule against publishing books about Amazon, this story does not add up.<p>[1] Every rejection resulted in me immediately getting pissed off, much like the original OP.  But once I calmed down I realized either I misunderstood the rejection, and the fix was easy and the rejection was legitimate, or the rejection was due to me making an error that would produce a bad experience for the customer, sometimes because I misunderstood the guidelines, occasionally because I was being lazy without realizing it, and often just because of a mistake or bug.<p>Since Apple is uniform in the way they apply the rules, and the rules are not so specific as to cover specific bugs, it does take some interpretation to figure out what they are saying.  If you don't take that step, its easy to fly off the handle and assume Apple is being arbitrary when they aren't.  The reality is, it just means you didn't take the time to read what they wrote you and comprehend it.<p>Of course the rejections feel personal, and I won't tolerate a company that won't play by its own rules, but they've never been unfair to me, and other than a few mistakes that were corrected, I'm not aware of them being unfair to others.<p>However we get a lot of these kinds of stories where someone says one thing, but they never cite the specific rule, or are evasive, which indicates that they're just trying to get publicity and were really rejected for other reasons.",1343566066.0

45,4308293,comment,4307136.0,4308064.0,3,0,Jach,,,"What my bank does (and PayPal too if I remember correctly) is keep track of my IP, and if it changes then it forces me to enter additional data about my account before letting me continue. (This assumes I got the password correct.) I think one or both also may use some cookie(s) to mitigate changing IPs. They may also make use of leaky browser data (like user agent strings etc.) to help identify me; they have the potential to see a lot since I'm not trying to hide from them.<p>I don't see anything wrong in principle with ""account lock out"" <i>provided that</i> it doesn't affect existing sessions and provided that you can just ask the site to send an email with a token to reset your password. Spammers can lock a user out, so what. Minor inconvenience. If it's happening a lot to the same user and it's also affecting the user negatively, something extra could be done to minimize lockouts for the actual user (who should be easy to detect by the server through logs and a premise the user isn't trying to hide).<p>Spammers are able to flood you with ""forgot your password?"" emails, too. I don't know how often they do it. I had my first wave in after 7 years of the same email just a few months ago mostly from old sites I forgot I even had accounts on.<p>I'm not really a fan of the exponential backoff idea proposed earlier above, I'd sooner go with the ""X tries, then wait"" approach. The lockout time should not be more than 24 hours, ideally less. Though one could also set the lockout period to expire when the user's session automatically expires, if there's a current one, but that may be too clever.<p>I feel that there are really two pieces of advice to give on dealing with spammers for the general case... Advice for low-traffic sites and advice for high-traffic sites. I don't have any advice with high-traffic sites since I have no experience with spam at that level (and by high-traffic I mean thousands to millions of uniques per hour), though I don't think the status quo is good enough. With low-traffic sites spam behavior is easy to detect and create a custom solution against. Custom solutions are often better than the popular stuff just by virtue of not having anyone targeting them specifically, and even if that's the case it's still easier to cat-and-mouse if the main options against spam aren't acceptable. Something as dead-simple as loading your form with javascript (or dynamically changing the URL endpoint when the submit button is clicked to something different than what's reported by the form's html attribute...) stops a lot of bots regardless of a captcha, even though you sacrifice the Lynx users. And in my own anecdotal experience I've had more success (less spam bots getting through and leaving a message) with a captcha like ""Please join these two ""words"" together (without spaces): taeiswovd and brhpugqc"" than with ReCaptcha even though it'd take less than a minute to add a parser for mine in a bot program. I used to use an arithmetic question but even the dumb bots are on to that one these days--at least the ones after my comment boxes. (I don't even think they added, they just tried numbers 0-99 and sometimes got lucky.)",1343565634.0

In the current master, there's a variant syntax that lets you use newlines (or arbitrary whitespace) wherever the more compact syntax uses colons. In time, I could see an argument for also expanding the single-letter abbreviations in this mode to make a more verbose syntax. There's also no reason why we couldn't add                         a way of describing requests by manipulating an object, which then compiles down to the request language.<p>Anyway, this is all still evolving - if you have ideas for keeping the language compact but making it less like line-noise, drop me a line.",1343563266.0
