I'm talking about security.  The number of iOS developers who do things like transmit the UDID (Universal Device ID) in plaintext, or who ""encrypt"" their communications by doing things like zipping it (no encryption, or the same key for every client) then ""securely authenticate"" it with CRC32 is just jaw-dropping.  In terms of doing things with just a competent level of security, large numbers of us are screwing the pooch in ways that severely contaminate the pool for the rest of us.<p>Of course, this points to the ultimate incompetent bumbler in this regard: Apple.  Apple should've built a better security library -- one which makes it harder to use security in an incompetent way.  (Forces you to do security right, or the API doesn't work at all.)  For heaven's sakes, they require you to muck with 3 objects just to shift a date from one month to the same day-number the next month.  Some better support in security might benefit the iOS developer community just a bit more than the ability for our apps to work smoothly in both Julian and Gregorian calendars.<p>I plan on making my living through iOS in the next year, but Google seems to be way ahead of Apple with regards to security.",1299419689.0

I would probably be shocked by the number, and then would quickly calculate my lifetime rate, which would probably be about 28 cents per hour.  This is the thing non-programmers never understand; programming takes <i>a lot of time</i>.<p><i>It's like a drug.</i><p>Great analogy!  For me, there's no bigger high than the exact moment of the conclusion of this process:<p>NothingThere + IDidSomething = SomethingThereForTheFirstTimeEver!<p><i>That process, the act of programming is something that I need to do.</i><p>Sometimes I think this is the difficult-to-define missing requirement for software success.  Some call it ""passion"".  Some call it ""determination"".  I call it ""I can't imagine doing anything else"".<p><i>but it has all the components of a 'real' program, input, computation, output.</i><p>Don't forget storage.  That was the killer feature that got me hooked.  You could write a simple program, store the result (on a disk!), come back later and build upon that result.

It applies to almost anything you can do.<p>4. is very difficult to teach.  As soon as you think people get it, they don't.  They stop measuring their own deltas and resume comparing to perfection.  Grrrrr.<p>5. the single most important thing I've ever programmed in business turn-arounds.

I can almost picture that kid!<p>I've only done limited amounts of programming, but I can certainly see how it could be addictive as you get better.  A lot of the time I've spent has been utterly wasted, e.g. fighting for a week to get a rails install configured 2 years ago and then mostly giving up as various tutorials I was following were all out of date.  But when I've gotten something working such as the kongregate shootorial, it's been easy to spend all my free time for a week tweaking it and improving it.<p>I also have to say that the entry point for programming (aside from setting up the environment) has been a lot less frustrating than for some of my other pursuits such as language learning.  I must have learned a good 200 words of Swedish before my pronunciation was good enough that natives could even guess at what I was saying.  Obviously at a higher level, language learning is more about memory than intense thought like programming is, but a lot of people get frustrated long before reaching that point.

On the other hand it also acts as a sceptical element within my thinking, which I perceive to have some value too. \nAlso I really like your description of Chaos and Order. To me it feels as if we can have order one day and with just one piece of feedback or one additional piece of knowledge - BAM - Chaos rules again. But that's not bad, is it? It helps to never settle.

Don't be a non-genius, not well-connected sociology/literature/whatever PhD. You'll be unemployed, or earn 5k$ a year. However, you're severely oversimplifying the actual dynamics.<p>There's a employability <i>sweet spot</i> on the hard-to-soft-science scale. Computer science, certain (NOT ALL) branches of mathematics and physics, chemistry, engineering? Go for it. Here, the industry-academia membrane is fairly permeable, funding isn't too much of a problem (because large chunks of the industry live off your stuff), and working conditions are good. You can do plenty of consulting on the side.<p>Theoretical physics? Obscure branches of mathematics? Astrophysics? You're very much fucked. Not as much as an art history major, no, but it's pretty bad. Most importantly, the life sciences (which includes everything from microbiology to neuropsychology): it's a nightmarish rat race. If you do something biomedicine-y, you'll get funding. But the number of people you're competing with is ridiculous. Researchers spend years and years as post-docs, in giant labs, without a chance to get to the top. Some disciplines are highly relevant for medicine etc. but there aren't that many industry positions. Even if you're in virology, competition is fierce -- because unlike chemical engineering, these fields are highly appealing for millions of biology undergraduates.<p>All these blog posts come from people in life sciences. I'm hardly surprised by that.<p><pre><code>  > So what really should be done is maybe stop educating so\n  > many people that nobody wants to hire?\n</code></pre>\nHow is this not ""fucking around with unis""?",1299416474.0
