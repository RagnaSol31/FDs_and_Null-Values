It is understandable when you see where Photos is coming from.<p>Google+ has proven successful with photographs since it had (at least at the time) an very good picture experience and an interaction model that worked well for communities. So they doubled down on photo features (not to mention that according to rumors, Gundotra is supposedly prone to claim some projects for his division).<p>Now that we have a full fledged photo product, it may be time to :  \n-separate it from Google+, even though g+ should still be backed by photos.\n-Merge as many google photo products as possible into this new experience.<p>Google has made some amazing work with auto awesome features (these automatic albums are slick) and the Photo editor, especially on mobile (where it is far from easy to build an editing pipeline, even if you use Renderscript).",1406987757.0
