3,1171587,comment,1169992.0,1171157.0,0,0,jerf,,,"""There is no forking or IPC - it's just synchronous events and callbacks. In Erlang you have to think about about IPC on the first connection. The Erlang-model might turn out to be the wrong level of process granularity. Maybe the right level of process granularity is how computers are already designed: 10,000-1,000,000 connections per process, use one per core.""<p>Also false. An Erlang ""process"" is not an OS process. It already works the way you say, <i>except</i> it can use multiple cores simultaneously. Automatically. Node.js has <i>nothing</i> on Erlang except a familiar syntax. Nor does IPC come up like some kind of blocker; it's baked into the core and quite natural, often all wrapped up behind a simple function call.<p>And let's not even talk about the baked-in clusterable Mnesia database or the OTP library, which Node.js can only dream about. (Erlang isn't just multicore, it's pretty easy to make it multi-<i>system</i>.) Or how Erlang has code replacement (the Node.js complaint of the day) built right in to the core, where it really has to be for it to work. And Erlang laughs at your ""non-blocking purity""; in Erlang, you can call <i>sleep</i> and it won't block anything! No special support needed, no magic from the user, no arranging things in callbacks <i>manually</i> (how 1980s). Try that in Node.js.<p>It's actually impossible for Node.js to do some of these things because you have to start with them.<p>You don't understand how Erlang works. That's fine, except you started to criticize it. I refer back to my previous comment that the people hyping Node.js don't seem to have used the competition. Maybe my problem is that I have used the competition, quite extensively. Come to think of it, I've yet to hear anyone say ""Gosh, I was using Erlang but Node.js is just <i>so awesome</i> I had to switch!:"" That probably says something important.",1267887230.0

Nice job!<p>Now I can upvote and downvote.<p>I go back to the healthcare essay. Still no ability to downvote.<p>Does anybody here besides the coders of HN want to support the idea that the user can have abilities come and go on a whim and this is going to make for a enjoyable user experience? HN keeps getting more and more nuanced about who can do what when, and, quite frankly, all it seems to do is intermittently piss me off. If it's making things better I can't see it. And even if it is, you don't screw around with system behavior without notifying your user of what's going on.<p>I'm sure somebody will point me to some thread somewhere or another where pg explains that for condition X we're not allowing users to downvote. And also frankly, that's part of the problem. Understanding the system shouldn't require extreme devotion to every little thing said about it over a period of years on every thread related to HN. A system should be simple to use and understand. HN is still simple to use, but beats me if I can understand it any more.<p>So am I out here all alone in this feeling, or is it bothering other HNer's as well?",1267887164.0

Many people have used a variant of BASIC before, whether in 80s home computers, via Qbasic or VB on PCs in the 90s, or via VBScript in Office. This may make potential teachers less intimidated, more confident, and more willing to teach it to kids.<p>Secondly, I can imagine that some schools use VB.NET for later courses, and this could provide a simple introduction to move towards using the full-blown VB.NET, and being able to easily transfer what they already know.<p>That said, I don't really see <i>why</i> it needs to have a pedagogical advantage.
