Greenspun has a particular style, one which thrives on irony, drama, and the occasional dollop of literary exaggeration. :)<p>In fact, the linked article does <i>not</i> argue that Brazilian labor is more expensive than that in the U.S. All we can conclude is that, taking all factors into consideration, cheaper foreign labor isn't driving Embraer to avoid the USA. Given that aviation is a heavily regulated, litigated, and taxed field, that doesn't tell us much -- maybe building jets in the USA for US customers saves a bunch of tariffs, or takes advantage of a tax loophole, or saves delivery costs or supply costs.<p><i>I looked up Brazil's per capita income and it's just under $5k a year.

Generally the situation was that someone who had been working for years decided to start a company with a friend and used the reputation and contacts he'd built up over the years to raise money to finance it.<p>I've never worked at a company with more than 10 employees where there was a non-technical founder who didn't provide access to capital.<p>With that being said, I think as the ""business guy"" there will be a lot of pressure on you to work extra hard and really produce (especially if you aren't providing the financing). It's usually not enough to have ""good ideas"" or ""the idea""...you should be bringing something so valuable to the table that the other founder(s) says ""Thank god this guy is here!""<p>It almost seems that a business guy will have to put in more effort than a hacker as a founder.

Just because dynamic language x does x things hidden behind a bunch of code means that you have to emulate the exact same things in another language to achieve the same result.<p>It's bad smalltalk to emulate C while your programming for it, and similarly it's bad C to emulate smalltalk with it.   It's like I would take his original java version and made it into perl, insisting that the perl script HAS to be in a class definition, and HAS to be in a main method, I MUST define the resultset in a static class list, and output with separate methods.  Saying that perl couldn't reproduce my 'reusable object' java functionality with doing that is just pedantic.<p>He should of just extracted a real example where it's impossible to do something in a short amount of code due to the lack of a specific feature, or being chained to java's static typing.

In our case, economic growth and individual wealth.  For brevity's sake, I'll skip the digression about clustering, distributing and distributing unevenly.<p>So, if that systemic objective does not make <i>your</i> life meaningful, what do you do?  The way of the world is towards this objective because it's the best progress we've made so far towards meeting most people's basic human needs.  Escaping to a different country with human rights and a different objective is not very feasible.<p>Changing the system isn't a good option because for most people the system is fine.  There are also tons of people for whom it's not fine, but they don't notice and it's not necessarily our business to try to wake them up unless they ask.<p>So I think the best option is, like the author is suggesting, to opt out as best you can.  Find what makes you happy and base your life around that, while minimizing your conflict with the governing body (e.g. they pay property taxes, rather than bury a bus full of guns and plan to resist--that would be un-lazy and make them miserable).<p>Had I not gotten married (which I don't regret, btw), I would have continued to work to fuel my desire to buy up a big plot of land that I don't have to mow and building a minimal but fully livable tree house.

31,189606,comment,189478.0,189529.0,0,0,STHayden,,,I think the problem is that people use 'design' as too broad a term.<p>In my mind 'Good Design' is more of a technical comment that talks about whether or not the piece follows the rules of design. If it follows the rules then it's good design.<p>Good Design is not necessarily beautiful or striking. A lot of designers (myself included) can get caught up in the mind set of 'beautiful' = 'Good Design' which is not the case. Most sites should avoid looking ugly but do not need to look beautiful. Also beautiful is often also associated with intricate. Making an intricate design is a different skill set then creating a sparse design. This keep a lot of beautiful sparse sites off these 'beautiful' lists.<p>Good Design is not necessarily usable. I think usability is most important for a website. A usable website focuses on grouping information in intuitive ways so that users can find the information when they need it. Information is not just text but buttons and actions as well. A usable website does not need to be beautiful or have good design.,1210775601.0

It's the munching while coding that I've never been able to do ""mindfully"".<p>The best coding munchies are almost always the worst things to eat, like microwave popcorn, chips, cookies, and soda.  When you're 4 levels deep into a nested routine, who notices that the munchies are gone?
