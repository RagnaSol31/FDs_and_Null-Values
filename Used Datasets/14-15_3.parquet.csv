1,823931,comment,823926.0,823926.0,0,0,jyellin,,,"We live in a country that has been inflicted with events coined as crises from the birth of time. Some of these ‘catastrophes’ include various financial crises, the technology bust, Cuban Missile Crisis, flu epidemics, wars, healthcare crisis, global warming, pollution, terrorism,  and unfortunately, the list does not come to an end.  But with all of this being said, the one crisis that happens to be the root to all of these epidemics in our nation’s history is the identity crisis that almost everyone faces at some point in time. This crisis has the ability to plague our existence and put an end to our personal well-being. Theorist Erik Erikson created this term and believes that this is one of the most important conflicts people face in development. This type of crisis actually commences during our youth as we are forced to conform to the standards set by our surrounding environment. This uncertainty becomes ingrained in who we are, and situates itself in all of us, as we evolve in the world. We battle identity issues when it comes to our physical image, career, relationships, spirituality, emotions, finances, and many other areas as well. As we continue to conform, we begin spiralling out of control, which results in a lack of self worth, an inability to express ourselves, and the underlying concern that we cannot be, do, and have the life of our dreams simply because we are unsure of what that looks like.",1253026640.0

But for web content, the existing method is better. The new format is actually harder to read/scan (and I'm using a 22inch display). So I expand the many articles to one per page, and use the arrow navigation to go article to article.

Documentation, bug hunting, administrivia, the boilerplate crap that crops up are all examples of this. Some or all of them are required, and since they are not fun, it is easy to get distracted and procrastinate.  Some people are just prone to such things. Is it not better that they figure out how to not procrastinate, or that they search for the elusive (possibly mythical) work that has 0% sucky tasks?",1253023934.0
