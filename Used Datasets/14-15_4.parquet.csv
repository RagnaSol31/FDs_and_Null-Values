There is a line somewhere in between facebook knowing only what I explicitly post, and it knowing absolutely everything about me that users will not accept.

The GOF book is much maligned\nI think because people insist on taking each pattern\ncompletely literally down to the last detail. GOF's\npattern (GOF didn't create it but they discuss it on page 4, I thought I was crazy until I just checked just now) is specifically ""MVC, and because we only know\nabout C++^H^H^H Smalltalk graphical libraries and not very much about\nstateless HTTP systems yet in 1993, the model notifies\nthe view of changes too, how else would it work ?"" IMHO.\nIt's an implementation detail, it's not the essence of\nthe pattern.<p>So if a JS framework is now doing MVC that includes the\nconcept of ""model notifies the view"", sure call it\n""classical MVC"" or ""model-notify-view-controller"" (MNVC).\nShrugs.",1316962424

E.g., Siemens Step 7. That is standard IT hacking. Not a ""problem"".<p>Second, you must be able to exploit the installation. Let me explain a bit more.<p>In software terms, what you are given to work with is a list of hex values denoting inputs, and then a list of hex values denoting outputs.<p>So - without knowledge - what you will see is <i>conceptually</i> like this:<p><pre><code>    READ 0x1\n\n    READ 0x2\n\n    IF 0x1 + 0x2 > 314159 THEN\n\n      WRITE 0xA, 100\n\n    ENDIF\n</code></pre>\nWhat do those numbers mean? There's no context until you know what those read/write registers are plugged into. And those could be different for each installation.<p>The second part isn't always brought out in the Stuxnet discussions. Part of the search for understanding for Stuxnet was decoding how the registers mapped to the installation.<p>For the interested reader, I refer you to the Symantec white paper. It is of quite high quality and good technical detail. The SCADASEC mailing list contains useful discussion by people involved in the industry, and they really bring out the differences between SCADA security and IT security. And for the really interested reader, I recommend reading up on PLC programming and digging up protocol standards for MODBUS and DNP3.",1316962124

It's not possible in a classical Rails app (it's possible when you use WebSockets, Pusher or a similar technology, but it's not so popular yet.). MVC was popular in desktop apps.<p>MTV isn't really Web nature. You change the database schema, and the browser client automatically refreshes? I don't think it's really useful. An ad-hoc solution would be better.",1316960377

This will always be a dance between smart developers usurping tracking efforts and smart developers coming up with new tracking methods.<p>I really don't understand the extreme sentiment that your info via cookies is the worst form of privacy breach there is.

I guarantee you these companies know more about you than Google, Twitter and Facebook (unless you post every thought ever, of course).
