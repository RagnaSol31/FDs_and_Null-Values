Looking at these I thought that (i) Google totally blows the competition out of the water in French, Spanish, and German (I even found the German translation slightly more readable than the human one - ""uneasy dreams"" sounds better than the human's ""anxious dreams""); but (ii) the Russian and Arabic translations are not very readable.

In fact, Goldin and Katz suggest that prosperity and equality in the U.S. will need a workforce that has more of the mental agility of a Leibniz or a Kircher in order to adapt to rapid technological change.""<p>I really think this is key to understanding this ""underclass."" It is like a surfer riding a wave, as long as you're up front everything is ok but once you get behind (and fall off the board) it gets harder and harder to get back on. It sounds a little singularity-ish, but we really are seeing an acceleration in the rate of change of technology and culture (or cultural norms like the acceptance of technological interruption at any point).<p>So I think the question that comes from this is what responsibility do we as a society have to help those that can't keep up with this change? We were just talking about internet access as a human right the other day, so where does this play in?<p>Is there some sort of digital welfare that we need to set up? Is the fact that non-agile workers can always fall back on retail jobs good enough?",1268232666.0

Where Hulu only had a single commercial per break, Comedy Central had about 3 per break. Another thing was that the commercials they played were more ""real."" I don't know what experience others have had on Hulu, but it seemed a huge percentage of their commercials were repeats of the same one or two - and often they were a PSA-type of thing. I always found that strange as they only showed one commercial per break and, by all accounts, it was a ludicrously cheap one. They couldn't have been making nearly as much per show as Comedy Central is going to be making now if they can keep all those slots sold. The additional commercials were annoying, but not the end of the world.<p>It seems that Comedy Central's player is one of those that degrades quality when the connection gets slow whereas Hulu would just stop and buffer. After only watching two shows it's hard to know how well it'll work in general, but it didn't stop and buffer once last night. I often had much more frustrating experiences with Hulu on account of the sometimes frequent buffering pauses. (Mediacom is not the world's best ISP...)<p>The primary downside here is that I've been using Hulu Desktop as my television provider for a couple months now. After ABC moved Castle to Hulu, I lost all reason to play the website shuffle when trying to watch a show and (aside from the buffering) it had become a very nice self-contained experience. Now that The Daily Show and Colbert are off the network, I'm back to manually switching players which is certainly a hassle.<p>I'd personally rather have an iTunes-style downloaded media service for television than streaming. It'd be far more reliable. I don't care if the files auto-expire after a number of days of not watching an episode or if I don't ""own"" the copy. I just hate the unreliable streaming and I also hate messing around with all the players. I think Apple's in a great position to offer something like this (tie TV show downloads with their rental infrastructure, perhaps, and then offer up all TV as a subscription).
