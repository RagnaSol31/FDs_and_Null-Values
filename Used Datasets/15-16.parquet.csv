It was utterly destroyed by the stagflation of the '70s where we got both high inflation and unemployement, but it's still the law of the land in the US (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey-Hawkins_Full_Employment_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey-Hawkins_Full_Employmen...</a>).<p>I prefer the explanation that you get inflation by ""printing money"", but as we and e.g. the Japanease in the last two ""lost decades"" show, it's not that simple: this is confounded by the velocity of money as the high level concept and at the low level is expressed as the futility of ""pushing on a string"" (e.g. ""dropping money from helicopters"" as the current Chairman of the Fed puts it does little good if people are afraid to borrow or lend).<p>Macroeconomics is a wild blood sport where no one is <i>really</i> sure of their view of The Truth.",1262447250.0
