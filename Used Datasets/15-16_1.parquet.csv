Builds take long enough that it is easier to work on a large chunk and do a clean build once the couple of libraries and executables I'm working on are in good shape, then deliver the blob.<p>I check-in on my own branch on a feature-by-feature basis, but in practice, no one sees my work until a large blob is out there.

1,216848,comment,216381.0,216705.0,0,0,lg,,,"I believe that on Everett's approach, when you measure some observable with two possible outcomes, the total number of worlds increases, like a bacterium dividing.  But on the version you're suggesting, it sounds like we constantly hop from one already-existing universe to another, because every instant brings with it a different configuration.  But it makes little sense for our bodies to hop between worlds, since they're parts of worlds, so is it our 'mind' that does it?  But that sounds like many-minds, except with many worlds instead of one, and with a new problem of how we do the hopping.<p>Unless by configuration, you mean that each world is a world-line that contains a set of definite outcomes for all quantum events, and so all the quantum outcomes are predetermined for each world, and we explain probabilities by recourse to the proportion of some worlds to others.  That's not really many-worlds, that's modal realism (every possible world exists, and ""the actual world"" just means ""my world"").  Which is more David Lewis than Hugh Everett.",1213372489

Until Microsoft reveals their cloud computing solution, it seems there aren't too many choices for the Microsoft stack hosted scaling solutions, besides Mosso. I've heard Amazon can be used with a .NET app, as long as you are not running SQL Server on the back-end. Is anyone using MS SQL Server Express as the database engine for their startup?

I noticed extra scroll bars in FF but my guess is that's because there is some css padding/margin stuff applied to the body.<p>Because it overrides the page itself you can't click ""Back"" or Alt+Left or whatever to go back to the list of stories.\nI did go back and add the check for if I'm already inside the frameset to my code though. Gotta prevent those recursive split views :). Now if you surf back to the main page in the right frame and click on a SplitView link it will reload both frames.<p>I will look at it in Safari some and see if I can figure out what the deal is there.

13,216833,story,,,27,28,pocketofposies,Ask HN: Web Fundamentals for a Newb,,"I know it is common for non-hackers interested in web development to ask how to get started, but I think my question is a variation and has not been covered in depth. I apologize if I missed a previous discussion addressing this issue.<p>I am attempting to teach myself Rails and have also made a concerted effort to understand Ruby. I have heard on many occasions that it is advisable to understand what problems Rails solves in order to use the framework to its full benefit and my little bit of experience supports this claim. While my study of Ruby has definitely helped me to understand some of the magic of Rails, there are holes in my understanding that Ruby knowledge alone will not solve.<p>My weakness is in understanding web fundamentals, and I would like to take a step back from Rails to do kind of a survey of those fundamentals. In particular, I know I need to read up on webservers and CGI. Any particular recommendations on either subject? I also wonder what other subjects I should be reading up on? Are there any books out there that do a survey of web stuff but are  relatively technology agnostic? Any particular terms I should be googling for? (I do have a basic knowledge of html and css as well as a very rudimentary knowledge of mysql syntax).<p>Another area I would like to focus on is how to design the architecture of the web app itself, particularly in a MVC framework. The books I am using are tutorial-based but they never really address how to figure out what your models should be, etc. They just tell you how to make models in Rails. Any suggestions on this front?<p>I think that I should probably also learn some basics of database design even though ActiveRecord makes it tempting and easy to ignore. Is this a correct assessment?<p>To make a long post short, I am looking for advice on non-Ruby and non-Rails skills that I need to develop web apps. I know this is a great group of people to ask and appreciate any and all direction.",1213371678
14,216832,comment,216614.0,216777.0,0,0,fendale,,,"You're give a lot of credit to large companies - things are done wrong in them more often than not.<p>The developers code to requirements - a bunch of signed off requirements are handed off to them and they go make the thing work, so yea there is a spec, but it doesn't go to the level of 'use library x' or feature y or a 5 table join instead of 5 individual selects etc.  The developers have license to code the thing in the best way they see fit.<p>The point of my comment was to agree with what was said in the article in that its bad to go and spring 5 weeks of coding on the team (whether its an open source or closed source team) without running what you are doing past the other team members or stake holders at frequent intervals.<p>In my case, I have been sprung with weeks of code in one go - it doesn't really matter if there are modular/OO approaches being used - 5 or 6 weeks of code can run into thousands of lines.<p>The same problem appears with other things too - eg I need a report for 20 components of a system, and it takes some time to prepare the stats (one off manual task) for each part - I would say send me the stats for each component as you get them, but they tend to hold everything back until its all done - then when the report isn't quite right its a much bigger job to fix it than if I had seen some stuff early.<p>Agile development is sort of like this too - show your customer things each week as its easier to fix when its going down the wrong path, instead of springing three months of work on the customer in one go to find its no what they wanted.",1213371523

We would often compete with, and work alongside, individuals. It's all about getting your brand out there. You want people to hear about and trust your brand - whether it's your name as an individual, or a company name. But don't confuse people by pushing both. I actually recommend using your individual name unless you want to grow bigger than 2 full-time employees. I have several friends who are individual contractors, and most of them have incorporated under another name. But they are known by their personal name, not their company name. That's their brand, so to speak.",1213371501
