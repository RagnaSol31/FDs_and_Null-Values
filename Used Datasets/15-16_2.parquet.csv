They have no shared state, and use asynchronous message passing as the only inter-process communication - very much like Erlang.  This makes them very simple, and fits in perfectly with JavaScript's existing asynchronous event-based model.<p>""What operations 'block' in js?""<p>Web workers are important because <i>everything</i> blocks in JavaScript.  JS in the browser is single-threaded, which means that if you do anything computationally intensive (reading from a Gears database, sorting a huge array, image manipulation on a Canvas element) then your page can no longer respond to UI events until the processing is finished.  Without worker processes, the only way to do long-running computation without blocking the UI was to implement your own cooperative multi-threading by ""yielding"" with setTimeout(fn, 0).<p>(Note: I'm talking about the model exposed to JS programmers, not the underlying implementation which might be based on native threads, native processes, or green threads.)",1241190894.0

First of all, do not assume anything based on mime types the browser (or whatever user agent) asked for.  It's very hacky to expect consumers to mess with their user agent's Accepts header to get the response format they want. Specifying the desired format such as ?format=xml is simple, clear, specific, and reliable. I prefer default format be XML and other formats available by passing a format parameter.<p>The REST of article has some good suggestions. I made a pun there. Did you catch it?

In Perl, alignment is very important, as you have a lot of code that looks like:<p><pre><code>   my $foo = Foo->new(\n      named_initargs => 'go here',\n      and_also       => 'here',\n   );\n</code></pre>\n(There are various technical reasons to avoid this style, but I think it looks too nice to avoid.)<p>As a result, a non-monospaced font would be a nightmare.<p>However, perhaps if you are using a language where everything is positional (Java, C), then maybe it doesn't matter:<p><pre><code>    Foo foo = new Foo(args, go, here,\n        and, if, you, run, out, of, room,\n        perhaps, they, can, be, written,\n        like, this);\n</code></pre>\nNote that the only alignment is the initial indentation; one space is always as wide as another space, so a variable-width font won't mess anything up.<p>Obviously if you are using Haskell or Python, you will care even more about alignment, and hence will want a monospaced font.  You will also want a monospaced font in your terminal emulator, as most console apps depend on all glyphs being equally wide.",1241190213.0
