(Actually, I think I can prove that.) The only thing that would change is that the ""lines"" on the equilibrium diagram would become ""curves"".<p>I think you can't. If you modeled real traffic congestion for this the paradox would not exist. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so.<p>The ""real world"" examples listed on the page were not because of this type of paradox, but rather because in the real world it takes time to merge, so removing a merge point makes things faster.<p>But a road paradox structured like this one? I don't think you can. The whole paradox is because the T/x does nutty things as T changes (nutty as compared to the real world).<p>At the minimum I want to see f()+c.

It's an idealized extrapolation of our less regimented society, true, but if you grow up as a poor black boy or girl in the ghetto, the forces that are going to keep you there far outweigh the forces that will allow you to leave. See Hurricane Katrina: most of the poor folk that didn't evacuate were too ridiculously poor to even afford to evacuate. The same goes with someone who grows up in a rural town; if they want to leave town and go to college or otherwise make something of themselves, all of the factors in their environment are working constantly against them. I'm tired of people born into privlege (me included) feeling that growing up in an environment where the only barrier to success is your own motivation somehow applies to everyone else.<p>I mentioned in another submission about how one of the greatest misconceptions of the past 50 years is that our environment is somehow completely unrelated to our well-being and the choices we feel we have.
