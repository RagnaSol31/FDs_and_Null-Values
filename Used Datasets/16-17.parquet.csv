There might be a left-aligned, multi-line comment to the right of a block of code(...)</i><p>I cannot fathom what point he thinks he's making with these. If you're using tabs in a way that depends on tab width, you're <i>doing it wrong</i>.<p>Tab indentation generally means that one tab character is one layer of indenting. That's it. It's about <i>semantic structure</i>, not layout.<p>If you want to make ASCII art, or align things like paragraph-style comments, or ""indent"" things that <i>aren't</i> part of a block of code like pieces of a lengthy conditional clause split over multiple lines, use spaces instead (and then the five people who use proportional fonts will complain that using spaces for alignment ""isn't portable""). Of course, if you're using a language with an off-side rule for syntactic whitespace even a die-hard tabber ought to just use spaces.<p>Personally, I dislike that sort of non-semantic formatting business in source code (and I think off-side rules in syntax are a horrible idea), but that's a matter of taste. And obviously, consistency is vastly more important than the particulars of indenting style. But I get tired of people arguing against tabs on the basis of not knowing how to use them properly.<p>On the other hand, this unintentionally makes a different, very strong argument in favor of using spaces: people can't manage to use tabs properly, so don't let them. This is why we can't have nice things, folks!",1263747407.0

It looks a lot like ""thinking"" if you don't understand it.

Perhaps it was just some inpatient moment when he was tired of silly questions, so he dismissed whatever was thrown at him. Maybe he just decided to trust his staff, and was let down. Or whatever.<p>Were the glaciers the main point of the report, or just a footnote? Probably there was a lot of information in it, so the people who wrote it eventually got sloppy with fact checking.<p>Also, isn't science about double-checking?

The second you mention anything to do with Math, their eyes glaze over and their brain completely disengages.  I think there are a lot of things that contribute to that, but generally Math is not taught in a very approachable way.  The KhanAcademy is I think a very good start in solving that problem.<p>I came across this site through an article that was on HN sometime last year, around November or December IIRC.  Since then I've watched roughly 100 videos on that site.  Some of the Finance videos, Trig, and Pre-algebra as a refresher, and I'm now roughly 60 videos into the Linear Algebra videos.  Even though I'm in the midst of my master's program now, I've set a goal to watch 2 video's every day as time permits.<p>I am so impressed with this site, and with Salman Khan.  The math is very well done, but it's also very approachable.  Most of the videos are roughly 10-15 minutes in length and are highly topical.  That makes it easy to jump in and pick up a refresher on something you haven't seen for a while.  It's also great for getting into something you haven't ever seen before.  Personally I haven't ever had Linear Algebra before, and if you've looked at many of the textbooks, they are pretty dense, particularly if you are self learning.  I've found this site to be a great resource in getting oriented and it has really helped me get some traction.<p>I have recommended this site to dozens of people, and while most of them don't share my love of mathematics, they have been able to get some traction in various problems by using this site as a supplement.<p>Anyway, as a daily user of the KhanAcademy, I can't say enough good things about the site.  I don't think it's a stretch to say it has the potential to revolutionize how math is taught.<p>The one downside to the site I've noticed is the lack of problems sets.  There is a tester that will walk you up through the different topics, but unlike the video's you can't just start where you feel you need to, you have to work up through the early material, and that's fairly time consuming.  I have a number of other resource's I'm using for problem sets, but it would be nice to have a few problems to work through for each video.<p>Overall an absolutely fantastic resource.\nRating: 10/10",1263746847.0
