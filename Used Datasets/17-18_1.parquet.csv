Aside actual pre-production, production and post-production costs (which COULD be done for $250,000 - though more realistic budget is $2-3 mil), there is a print distribution cost which can get REALLY high.<p>Distribution copies are expensive, about $1200 per reel copy if you are really lucky (multiply with about at least 1200 screens for a moderate indie flick (about $1.5 mil).<p>If you think targeting digital distribution sites is another option - think again. You still pay print copy equivalent expense, but not to the print service company, but to the actual screen venue. This is a ploy George Lucas ""invented"" and pushed onto screening venues in order to push the cost of digital screens to the distribution companies instead of the screening venues. This will last for at least 5 years from when the venue bought digital screening platform.<p>Then, there is a marketing cost. In A+ budget titles it is in the order of $30-40+ mil. So when you hear about, I don't know, Spiderman 4 having a budget of $200 mil., it means about 60% of that is marketing and distribution cost.<p>Now, let's turn focus on actual production costs.<p>SAG, WGA, DGA - all have a different perspective of what low budget means. There are different categories of low budget titles, and based upon those categories there is a minimum wage you have to pay to actors, screenwriters (treatment, script, whatnot), director, etc... What this means, if you live in some area of USA where those guilds operate is that you are illegal production if you don't pay those minimum wages based on your budget. I have somewhere those scales, if anyone is interesting I can follow up my post and present them.<p>tl;dr;\n$250k budget is not realistic. Too many people have worked on this problem already and smallest realistic budget for a visible project is in the order of $2-5 mil.",1246557191.0

Ideally, you'd just let the JIT take care of it for you, but it's not able to do everything.  There are Smalltalk parsers that use lots of if-then equivalents, because these are faster because of bytecode level optimizations, even though using Dictionary lookup would be clearer and shorter.  That's an example of a leaky abstraction in the compiler->bytecode->JIT implementation of the language itself.  What's worse, is that the structure of the code -- why it's written in that way -- is highly cryptic.  You can't write a bunch of if-then in a way that reveals that they are faster.  The Mercurial project's implementation is optimized to ensure high locality of reference for data on disk.  You can't make stuff like that intention revealing.  You must resort to a comment.<p>I think this reveals a weakness in languages in general.  The issue of performance is mostly <i>orthogonal</i> to most of the business problems you're solving.  The fact that optimization issues get embroiled in code -- this is something we should try to eliminate.<p>""Correct then fast"" is just a compromise.  You minimize the amount of optimization done to preserve as much readability as possible.  We should have languages that allow us to optimize without mucking up code.
