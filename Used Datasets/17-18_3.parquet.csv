A more general (and correct) statement would be ""excluding externalities (including pollution) the cheaper one really is better for the environment"".<p>Externalities are basically costs or benefits (to society, the environment, etc.) that aren't reflected in the price paid for an item.  One really important thing to note is that externalities extend far beyond pollution and can be both positive and negative.<p>Pollution is one of the more visible negative externalities that get discussed, but there are plenty of others (for example, driving a car involves a host of negative externalities in addition to pollution such as increased road congestion (longer commute times, more fuel burned in traffic, more accidents)).<p>There are also plenty of positive externalities that often get ignored.  Take windmills, solar panels and hybrid cars.  The positive externalities associated with manufacturing these items include lower future manufacturing costs for such items (and lower prices and environmental costs as a result) and investment in R&D aimed at making electricity and/or transportation cheaper (both in terms of environmental and financial costs).  So even though solar panels may currently be losing proposition environmentally, there are positive externalities that make buying solar panels today (and thereby moving the industry forward) a Good Thing for the environment.",1230657494

In other words, they used an MD5 collision to synthesize a new CA. Your browser will trust an Amazon.com certificate signed by their rogue CA.<p>They were able to do this because:<p>(1) RapidSSL, FreeSSL, TC TrustCenter, RSA, Thawte, and Verisign Japan will sign certs with MD5.<p>(2) They worked with Arjen Lenstra and Marc Stevens and obtained a method to generate pairs of plaintexts with arbitrary chosen prefixes within 72 hours on a cluster of 200 PS3 game consoles.<p>(3) Even though the prefix of a signed certificate contains fields the attacker doesn't control --- the serial number and validity period (which is effectively a timestamp of when the cert was signed at the CA), RapidSSL fucked up and used a monotonically increasing serial number (!), so they could predict the CA's fields and build them into their collision.<p>(4) Even though generating the MD5 collision requires the certificates to include a large amount of random-looking data, there's a place in the ""real"" certificate and a different place in the ""rogue"" certificate to stash that data: the collision material in the ""real"" cert is hidden the the RSA modulus, which is random anyways, and the corresponding location in the ""rogue"" certificate is masked as a ""Netscape Comment Field"" (a ""tumor"") which browsers ignore.<p>All 4 of these things had to happen at the same time to make this doable:<p>(1) There's no practical break for SHA-1, which is what most CAs use.<p>(2) You have to be able to generate the collision within a short window of time to get the resulting product signed properly by the CA, so you need the new academic result (and the PS3s).<p>(3) If RapidSSL and FreeSSL had simply randomized the serial number, like everyone else, there'd be no way to predict the  signed product of the request, and your collision wouldn't mean anything.<p>(4) You obviously have to play ASN.1 games to make the random collision fit into a semantically valid certificate.<p>They spent $700 generating certificate requests to pull this off; because RapidSSL allows requestors to reissue certs 20 times, each attempt costs $2.50.<p>You want to read:<p><a href=""http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/</a><p>In particular, section 5.3.4 has the clearest description of MD5 collisions I've ever read, with a really excellent series of graphics.<p>IS THIS THE WORST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO THE INTERNET EVER EVER?<p>No. Two years ago, Daniel Bleichenbacher demonstrated a <i>pencil and paper</i> attack on the RSA validation procedure used by OpenSSL. That attack required a mass software update. This one will hopefully just put RapidSSL out of business.",1230657378
