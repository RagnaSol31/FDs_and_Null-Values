They believe that anything under 100% test coverage in several disciplines (unit, functional, integration, etc) is just as bad as no testing.<p>There is, of course, a middle way. Implement as much testing as makes sense for you. Think Pareto.. just the right 20% of testing could give you 80% of the gains.<p>So.. implement integration tests that test your apps very broadly and as soon as one fails, you know you can start looking deeper.
