8,2550372,story,,,6,13,nicksergeant,"Ask HN: What do you think about this idea? It's called ""Strtps""",,"Hey guys. So, I'm starting another startup (I have a problem). It is so intertwined into the startup community (wait until you hear the name), that I wanted to post the idea and plan for execution here.<p>It's called ""Strtps"". I've got http://strtps.com, and @strtps on Twitter.<p>The idea came from this: I'm desperate to learn node.js. I'm following along with <i>the</i> node tutorial (http://dailyjs.com/2010/11/01/node-tutorial/ ) but don't want to build another typical app. So I was thinking: wouldn't it be great to have a repository of startup ideas? Like, a place to go and find ideas of all shapes and sizes for starting a web-based app/business. I'm interested in smaller ideas, but some people might be interested in building an actual business around an app idea.<p>So, Strtps was born. It's going to be an ""idea bank for startups"". Folks can submit an ""idea"", as well as supporting information like traction, audience, market fit, monetization ideas, etc. Some people think their ideas are worth millions and won't want to share them in fear of someone ""stealing"" it, but I think most people are getting over that. Execution is where it's at.<p>There are a few resources for startup ideas already, notably YC (http://ycombinator.com/ideas.html ) and Steve Poland (http://blog.stevepoland.com/100-web-start-up-business-ideas/ ), so I know not everyone is afraid of sharing ideas.<p>Strtps could be a place to find an interesting idea to work on, and find someone passionate about it who might want to co-found with you. The idea here is to connect great ideas with great executers. Right now we've got resources to get funded (http://angel.co ) and to get noticed (http://startupli.st and many others). We need a place to find and curate ideas, and find passionate people who want to work on it with you, revolving specifically around an idea.<p>So, back to the functionality. People submit ideas, then other folks browse ideas, and can ""like"" an idea, or say ""I'm already working on this"". No login needed for liking or saying ""I'm working on it"". The idea there is to simply guage the popularity of an idea.<p>Now, let's say you see an idea that you really like. For now, browsing the site will only reveal the title of an idea, the ""pitch"", ""likes"" and number of people working on it. You are closed off from knowing who owns each idea. If you want to see complete information on the idea (and all other ideas in the DB), you need to be a Pro member. Pro member accounts will cost $12/year, PayPal only. Once you're a Pro member, you can see all info on any idea, and you can also contact the owner of ideas. The point here is to garner serious entreprenuers, developers and designers when contacting an idea-man or woman.<p>And, a small feature - if you're a Pro member and you create an idea, you can make an idea completely public if you'd like, meaning you can make all the details of the idea available to the public (non-Pro members), as well as let non-Pro members contact you. Just a perk of being a Pro member.<p>Whew, a mouthful. What do you think?",1305482116.0

No error code or other reason was given. She could not therefore upgrade because the first step in the process is a sync. It got worse. After a few attempts, she powered off and restarted her iPad. Instead of the normal boot up, she got icons indicating she must connect the iPad to iTunes. When she did, she was advised that she was required to reset the device.<p>Now the real nightmare begins. After resetting the iPad, she had lost all but four of more than 100 mostly purchased applications. This should not be a problem, as the app store knows that an application has been purchased and will re-download it for free. But nobody told iTunes which applications to download. In the apps section, only 67 of her apps were recoverable. And those ""updated"" (meaning were restored) fine. Over the next day or so by browsing the extremely unhelpful app store, where applications are so excessively categorized it is virtually impossible to browse the huge catalog, and checking her email history she was able to make a list of (some of the dozens) of apps still missing. Then she had to go through the tedious process of using the App Store on her iPad to search for and reload each application separately, which took hours. At the end of this, she has no assurance there aren't still missing apps.<p>The original bug was bad, having to reset and lose all her on-device application data even worse, but the inability to smoothly restore previously purchased applications through iTunes and/or the App Store exposed a major design flaw that just fixing the bug won't address.",1305480684.0

In many cases it offers commands that encapsulate a set of underlying operations; for example, TortoiseGit offers subversion-style Commit and Revert dialog boxes that behave like the equivalent dialog boxes in TortoiseSvn, even though Git has no directly analogous commands. This is really good if you want to get work done without being a Git expert.<p>In particular, Rebase in TortoiseGit has an excellent user interface that takes Git's command line rebasing process and turns it into a user-friendly graphical equivalent. I've yet to find any equivalently pleasant user interfaces in TortoiseHG; pretty much all of TortoiseHG's user interfaces are tangled messes of dropdown menus and checkboxes that try to reproduce every mercurial configuration switch.<p>TortoiseGit is also faster and more stable than TortoiseHG. I'm not sure if this is because TortoiseHG is largely written in Python+QT, or just because TortoiseGit is more mature - I use TortoiseHG a lot at work when interacting with mercurial repositories, and it crashes frequently, but I've never had TortoiseGit crash or freeze on me.<p>There are also a lot of UX problems with TortoiseHG that seem to originate in the design of Mercurial, though, so this may come down to my personal taste.",1305479998.0
