If your thermal compound is acting as an insulator, then your heat sink is going to be nice and cold.

5,741841,comment,740959.0,741457.0,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"This seems like a highly questionable conclusion. 'No autonomy' means (to me) no kind of technological assist whatsoever, not just not just no executive power.<p>Consider the humble digital camera. You likely have one close by. My old point-and shoot has 'intelligent' control of focus and aperture, and is 'smart' enough to look for shapes resembling human faces and prefer them as focus targets. Newer models on various cameras include recognizing babies (as distinct from adults), tracking moving objects and so forth. Now, if you have any experience with a manual (film) camera you can't help but be aware of how useful these new tools are, although you might not depend on them. I chose cameras as an example because they're cheap - almost commoditized, in fact - and the degree of 'assist' offered by the technology is really quite startling, and furthermore seems to be accelerating with every new generation of camera.<p>Back in the military context, consider the hierarchical nature of military command. Say you are a submarine commander in wartime. Your job is to sink enemy ships, but you don't want to accidentally sink any ships belonging to allies or neutrals, and (to a lesser degree) you want to avoid sinking even the enemy's passenger ships, where the military gain would be marginal but the propaganda cost to your side would be significant.<p>You, the commander are the executive who makes the decision to fire a torpedo. but to do so, you rely on a mix of incoming intelligence about shipping movements, the judgment of sonar operators about the signature and identity of passing ships, a larger staff who orient your craft and ready your weapons, and finally a small officer staff whose functions are to implement your orders and also to draw your attention to possible error. You, as an executive, are replaceable, mainly by necessity but sometimes by choice; the existence of a tiered officer class in combination with a military code serves as a useful check on excess, though not a foolproof one.<p>Now as far as drones go, the operator is equivalent to the executive. However, the operator's decision is only as good as the quality of information relayed to him or her by subordinates. In this case, the subordinates are increasingly heading towards being technological systems. I would really be surprised if these UAVs did not include some degree of auto-targeting based on high-amplitude infrared signatures or so. We know (from our experience with cameras, and many other contexts you can think up) that real-time signal processing is both affordable and ubiquitous, and we also know that good systems design involves leveraging technology to increase efficiency wherever possible.<p>So the point (finally...sorry) is that the human autonomy you cite is probably somewhat less than total, insofar as it relies on technological assists which aid in the selection and tracking of targets. This is a very marginal loss of autonomy, to be sure - one that may seem so slight as to be negligible, and indeed one which is often positive insofar as it may reduce human error. But:<p>a) as we all know, technology frequently displaces skills to the extent that such skills can systemized, and the military is all about doing things systematically<p>b) it's relatively easy to program a machine to listen/look for the signature of (say) automatic gunfire, but we are a long way from being able to explain to one that in some cultures, this is considered a good way to celebrate a wedding.",1249412117.0

It has not been directly named, for it seems to work more successfully when it is merely uncovered and left in sight, where THOSE WHO ARE READY, and SEARCHING FOR IT, may pick it up. That is why Mr. Carnegie  tossed it to me so quietly, without giving me its specific name.  If you are READY to put it to use, you will recognize this secret at least once in every chapter. I wish I might feel privileged to tell you how you will know if you are ready, but that would deprive you of much of the benefit you will receive when you make the discovery in your own way.""</i><p><i>""The secret to which I refer cannot be had without a price, although the price is far less than its value. It cannot be had at any price by those who are not intentionally searching for it. It cannot be given away, it cannot be purchased for money, for the reason that it comes in two parts. One part is already in possession of those who are ready for it.""</i><p><i>""Somewhere, as you read, the secret to which I refer will jump from the page and stand boldly before you, IF YOU ARE READY  FOR IT! When it appears, you will recognize it.

67,741777,comment,741411.0,741411.0,0,0,maw,,,"I became good friends with a guy who worked in our company's Mexico City office. A few years later, I decided to take the plunge and move to Mexico City myself. It didn't hurt that the girls I chased (including the one I eventually married) didn't speak much English.<p>I've now been here five years, and my Spanish isn't bad. It's important to make an effort, though. I've met people from overseas who've put in little effort—a real shame.<p>Moving to a different country isn't a realistic option for many people, and you didn't say where you're located, but if you're in the States, chances are there are plenty of Spanish speakers in your area. Why not talk to them?<p>As you meet Spanish-speakers qua Spanish-speakers, be sure to identify who'll give you ""correct"" advice and who won't. It's important to be able to understand and to be understood while communicating in various contexts. I've learned lots of useful things about Spanish from pedants, people who play fast and loose with the language, and everyone in between.<p>And there's plenty of well-edited Spanish language material freely available: es.wikipedia.org is generally decent. (By the way, wikipedia can be an excellent translation tool: when you're looking up some very specific term whose precise translation won't be found in a dictionary, try searching for it on en.wikipedia.org and see if there's a link to es.wikipedia.org) Some newspapers with online presences include <a href=""http://www.eluniversal.com.mx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eluniversal.com.mx</a> (Mexico), <a href=""http://www.elpais.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elpais.com</a> (Spain), and <a href=""http://www.lanacion.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lanacion.com</a> (Argentina); there are, of course, many others. Chances are decent that there are blogs that cover topics you're interested in, but be wary, as the quality of editing can and does vary considerably. Incorrect spelling abounds!<p>As you improve, you'll be able to read books in Spanish.  My first book was a translation of one I'd read originally in English.  I think this was a good idea, because I didn't have to worry about vocabulary I didn't understand.  Reading Spanish-language authors in the original is even more satisfying. I'm currently working through Bolaño's oeuvre. Borges and Sepúlveda are other favorites, but I've really only just scratched the surface. (I've also read some stuff translated from third languages, such as several books by Murakami.)<p>As for references: The 501 Verbs series of books is useful (I have some minor quarrels with the Spanish one, but there's nothing out and out wrong, and I do recommend it). I like my Harper Collins Spanish/English dictionary; in addition to a good range of vocabulary, it has one of the best grammar references, in terms of both clarity and layout, that I've had the pleasure to see. (A minor issue for some with Harper Collins is that it has a slight focus on English as she is spoke in the UK and Spanish as it's spoken in Iberia; unlikely to be a problem, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it.) <a href=""http://www.wordreference.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wordreference.com</a> is an excellent resource. I also have a 5-way pictorial dictionary which has proven handy at times.<p>Eventually you'll outgrow whatever Spanish/English dictionary you settle upon and you'll want a more comprehensive, Spanish-only dictionary. The RAE's (<a href=""http://www.rae.es"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rae.es</a>) dictionary is considered by many but not all to be the most definitive.  <a href=""http://www.rae2.es"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rae2.es</a> is a more minimal interface to the RAE's content.<p>So, stick with it and have fun. Learning a new language is very satisfying and obviously very useful too.",1249410275.0

I am OK with targeting such people (and as it happens, I support the <i>idea</i> of fighting and defeating the Taliban in Afghanistan, but I'm very disappointed with the <i>implementation</i>). The kind of drones we use now are basically lightweight planes, and given the physics of fixed-wing flight, that means fly-bys and high-yield single-use weapons.<p>If your intel is good and you have found an isolated Taliban training camp, then OK. But if it's poor, you're throwing a lot of destructive power at the wrong target. Whereas a sniper team might employ a scope or long-range microphone and observe the presence of many women and children or singing and dancing (conclusion: might be a wedding party), a drone on flyby can identify the <i>existence</i> of a target, but is poorly equipped to identify the <i>nature</i> of the target...which is one reason we've blown up a lot of wedding parties in the last few years.<p>Realistically, we can get away with it to an extent because the US is a big powerful country that can throw its weight around (and is allied with other relatively big and powerful countries).
