Both of these sites will eventually become irrelevant -- searching for a job by typing in a few keywords is unnatural.  People hear about jobs thru friends, professional acquaintances, work product (GitHub, StackOverflow, etc), and local businesses (signs) and as LinkedIn becomes more prevalent they will grab more then their fair share of this market without trying very hard.<p>The far bigger opportunity for LinkedIn is to aggregate business leads.  Are you looking to outfit your company with new laptops this year, looking for a block of hotel rooms for a conference, looking for an event management company, looking to upgrade accounting systems.  Each of these leads is worth hundreds of dollars and helping businesses find good vendors is not easy (consultants make billions of dollars/yr making vendor recommendations).",1262458746

I am super wary of his story and am about to walk off. The girl with me doesn't. She wants to go in the ATM and get him some money.

Are these disjoint sets? No, these are roles and there are individuals, lots of individuals, who are both owners of banks _and_ tax-payers. The more taxes someone pays the more likely they are owners of banks as well.<p>The perverse incentives were provided by these owners, demanding low risk and returns way above anything that could possibly be sustainable.<p>He goes on to say ""It certainly did not serve homeowners who are losing their homes, workers who have lost their jobs, retirees who have seen their retirement funds vanish, or taxpayers who paid hundreds of billions of dollars to bail out the banks.""<p>Homeowners are sadly losing their homes. Homes they wouldn't have been able to afford if it hadn't been for the reckless lending of banks. And those risky sup-prime loans, who bought them? Pension funds bought them (among others). Pension funds who demanded outsized profits for the benefit of  exactly those people who now lost their retirement funds.<p>If the banks had walked away with all the profits or were saved when they made mistakes then people would not have lost their retirement funds, because the banks' profits _are_ their retirement funds.<p>Workers sadly lost their jobs. Jobs in the financial industry were lost. Construction workers lost their jobs building sup-prime homes. Many other people lost their jobs that used to be funded by people (themselves) borrowing like there's no tomorrow trusting in their homes gaining value and their retirement funds growing fat from fat bank profits.<p>Now, is this a zero-sum game? Have only people lost who had gained from the same system before? No, of course not, there were indeed people who did not benefit much and are now suffering hardship. And there are rich people who benefited and did not lose much.<p>But what Stiglitz does not say is that these people are few.

I got one from him at a conference in KC (where he also autographed The Art of Deception and The Art of Intrusion for me). It was quite a while ago. Many others (including melvin and TOOOL) have also put together similar snap-apart credit-card lock picks. The problems are that they're too short to really get a good feel with, and they're made of crap metal that doesn't lend itself well to picking real locks.<p>When I'm picking locks, the pick is a long lever, and my fingertips function as the fulcrum. The other end of that lever rests neatly in the web of my thumb and forefinger, which is at least two inches away from said fulcrum. It is back there where I feel what's going on deep inside the lock, sight unseen. The length of the lever (lock pick) amplifies anything felt by the end of the pick.

A professional, who knows a lot details about a bunch of different tech companies, who knows the people, the shakers and the movers. But this characteristic is not only related to programmers but to other professionals in the industrie as well. Of course this could lead to a bias, namely that you overestimate yourself and will bet to much on specific companies, what you didn't do when you weren't a professional.<p>A remark must be made. Because the tech sector is so innovative. And still be a dominant factor for productivity growth. The trend on this kind stocks will always be upwards. And there will always be new companies, with a potential of amazing growth and idem dito stock prices. Maybe stockpicking in the the tech fields just gives you better odds.<p>Overall, I think that programmers have an advantage, because most of the time they are early adaptors. They will use products, before these are well known to the public ( and stock analysts)  Personally, they're just spending more time on their computer and will always use the products which will increase their productivity, which of course are probably produced by the most succesfull companies. But also, professionally, a lot of professionals are at frontier of their field.<p>Maybe, Non-progammers should observe what all the tech savvy people use to increase their productivity or what kind of gadgets they buy. Or which start-ups are popular by the programmers. And make the decision whether this is business savvy or not.<p>At the end, you should check WHAT you're actually programming, and what you boss want you to do.",1262457220

I mostly agree with JulianMorrison on this one, although I think sometimes you can see performance bottlenecks coming. If you know an inner loop needs to be faster than your interpreted language can normally do, you might as well write that segment in C or ASM from the beginning. Mercurial still seems to me like a good example of optimization done correctly.",1262455751

And he was so dead on and hilarious in his assessment of presenting to investors: * I tried for 4 years to get people to take Fundable seriously, traveling across the country, even giving a presentation to FBFund, Facebook's fund to stimulate development of \nnew apps.  It was a series of rejections for 4 years.  I really felt that I presented myself professionally in every business situation and I dressed appropriately and practiced my presentations.  That was not enough.   The idiots wanted us to show them charts with massive profits and widespread public acceptance so that they didn't have to take any risks.*<p>But guess what? None of that matters and it's all so much whining. Dude -- don't go 4 years with any one idea. Try maybe a year or two. This is a numbers game and you may have to get 10 or 15 of these ideas behind you. Forget about financing. It's a fools game played by people with more money than common sense and all about jumping on the bandwagon and who you know, not about real market-changing potential.<p>Damn I feel your pain. I really do. It sucks to have a paradigm-shifting idea and watch some other assholes who are simply better-connected run with it. The marketplace is NOT a meritocracy.<p>I'm right where they were 4 years ago -- new idea, developing a new site, lots of upside potential, and lots of odds stacked against me. I could move to SV and start becoming a professional fundraiser/hanger-on, or I could work my idea and most likely fail.<p>I choose to work my idea. I'm not going to create charts or blow smoke up investors butts. They get so much of that -- it's one of the reasons their discriminators are so broken. Jesus himself could appear and ask for funding to start a new world religion and they'd probably respond with something like ""Wonderful idea, Jesus, but your team doesn't look so good -- lots of fishermen and nobody is even literate. Also the market you're chosen, Judea? Not so good in terms of disposable income. You should move to Rome. Get to know some of the Senators. But good luck with all of that. Don't call us, we'll call you."" [damn. That's a good blog idea -- if Jesus was a startup]<p>Having laughed (and cried) at how real this article was, I wouldn't have written it. As grellas points out, sometimes venting helps and sometimes it doesn't. It's time to get moving, not complaining.",1262455647

For example, if you love Apple, you might decide to ""invest"" 20% of your working hours in building an iPhone app. Since the net present value of your working hours is bigger than the value of your stock portfolio (probably), you are making a massive, undiversified bet on Apple's continued dominance. To hedge, short Apple stock and buy MSFT. That way, as long as you develop a good app, you'll come out okay whether the iPhone gets more popular (you lose money on the short and make money on the app) or less popular (you wasted your time on the app, but made money on your short).<p>In other words, do arbitrage, not directional bets.<p>(Note that this is almost never the right decision to make. The only exception might be if you got most of your income from working on Linux, and you bought shares of a patent troll--the events that make them do well will also hurt your normal income.)",1262455398

I got interested in the article and posted it here trying to find out if there is a difference in the way the brain takes in or absorbs information when it is presented electronically versus on paper? Does the reading experience change, from retention to comprehension, depending on the medium? Personally I have been through a few ebooks lately and have noticed that I am not absorbing  the material at the same rate than a book.",1262455369

As long as they can get you to enter your details, they can get thousands of dollars a year from individual recruiters for access to your information.<p>Look at their site as a service for recruiters which happens to require consumer input. They want you to be promiscuous in your connections, since weak-but-wide links are more effective for recruiting than strong-but-narrow 'true friendships'. They don't have much incentive to drive users to interact with the site, beyond keeping their details up-to-date.<p>It sounds like they're interested in becoming more compelling to consumers, but I wonder how deep that commitment goes when there's no immediate revenue stream from it?<p>Here's one older article that discusses LinkedIn's revenue model:\n<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/technology/18linkedin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/technology/18linkedin.html</a>",1262455305
