I always hated (and still do) having salespeople approach me when I first enter a store and pitch the current sales, new items, etc. so I never did that. I did however greet them for three reasons 1) to acknowledge that we see them and are available for help, 2) to let them know I was an employee, which wasn't very obvious with the casual dress attire allowed and 3) to let potential the thieves know we are watching them.<p>This always pissed off my district manager who would insist on demonstrating to me how to greet customers by basically attempting to instruct them on what to buy. Anyways I don't have any explicit proof that my approach produced better sales, all I know is that when I enter a store and feel like someone is trying to help me solve the problem which prompted me to come to their store, I'm less anxious about buying things.  On the other hand when I feel like someone is pitching a problem to me that I'm not interested in solving I just feel disgusted and often leave.<p>In my mind that roughly translates into building an emotional attachment.  It's the difference between listening and talking.

It looks to me like they're being very transparent and explained things very clearly.  You have a bunch of data in the test set; these are partitioned randomly into two equally-sized subsets, ""quiz"" and ""test"".  You submit predictions for both subsets, but are only told how you did on ""quiz"".  Netflix provides an MD5 checksum for the judging file that defines what the partition is; this file will be made available ""at the end of the Contest"".  So this will be verifiable by anyone soon.<p>Also, don't brush overfitting aside.  In the (paraphrased) words of one machine learning researcher, ""life is a battle against entropy.  In the same way, machine learning research is a battle against overfitting.""  Any data whose test results you use to select your algorithm or to adjust your algorithm's parameters is not properly considered part of the test set; after your optimization that data will provide an optimistically-biased estimate of your true error.  Since competitors could get regular updates on their performance on the quiz dataset, one must assume that they were attempting to optimize this performance, and so quiz set performance was not be a good estimate of their true error.  You can only get a good estimate of the true error of a method by testing against data that has played no part in its development.",1253557598.0
