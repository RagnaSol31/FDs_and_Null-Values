At least with computer protocols and royal protocols they are pretty explicit.

First, unless I'm missing something, endowments aren't showing ""spectacular gains"" as of late. Additionally, Ivy League schools are doling out financial aid to at-need students. For example, Harvard has ""no expected parent contribution"" for students whose parents make less than $60k per year.

As a hypothetical example, parents who make $50k per year are expected to contribute $5000 per year. The student is expected to contribute $2000 and have a work-study paying $1800 per year. The student takes on no loans, gets $39,000 in grants per year, and graduates debt-free.

Yet to deal with some historical injustice it's very easy: find the good guy, find the bad guy, and make some kind of symbolic statement.<p>Odd that you can't see that the very difficulties you face today in being moral were also faced by those in the past.<p>No matter how right or wrong you are about things, unless you're actually changing something it's all so much whining. Turing is a good example of somebody we can rally around and feel good about supporting -- he had a great mind and was treated terribly. But our reaction is all just so much fluff. It's modern morals: change your lightbulbs to CFI, write a check to a charity and leave the heavy-lifting to somebody else.<p>Just not my cup of tea.<p>I think if they want to Knight the guy that's a completely different thing, and it sounds like a great idea.

I submit that there's a much greater cultural distance from modern England to modern Pashtun Afghanistan than to England of fifty years ago.  Would you say that we should withhold judgement when an Afghan woman is beaten or murdered for leaving her house alone?<p>You say that Jefferson was ""doing his best"".  I think you chose Jefferson to make such a statement as easy as possible for yourself.  I don't believe that the people most responsible for Turing's fate were ""doing their best"".  I think they knew they were doing something wrong.  I think that the Taliban know that blowing up girls' schools (and the girls) is wrong.<p>This is why I say you lack a common moral foundation with supporter of an official apology to Turing.  I say that it's wrong, always and everywhere, for a man to be hounded to suicide for his sexual orientation.  If we can't have any kind of objective foundation, what hope do we have of stopping this from happening in the future?  (that's largely a rhetorical question; I'm well aware that there have been two millennia of debate over absolute ethics, but for me this issue is clear as day).<p>EDIT: Grammar--  damn this vanity.",1251743256.0
