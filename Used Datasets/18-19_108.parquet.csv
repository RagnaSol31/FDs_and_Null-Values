If you're really lucky, the computer will be a laptop. And both users have to be at their computers and signed into Skype to make the call, which means that in a lot of cases a video call ends up being coordinated over the phone beforehand.<p>FaceTime just requires that you know each other's phone numbers, (when the spec is released, I'm sure big, bright ""FaceTime Compatible!"" stickers will show up on lots of phones) and, for now, be on WiFi. ""Upgrading"" from a phone call to a video call is as simple as pressing a button. The ""cost"" to make a call is so much lower.",1278874515.0

If you do really well they will reward you with a higher quota, and they'll divide your territory in half. I've seen it happen way too many times. Plus tech sales tends to be unstable. One year you make $200K selling something that is in demand, the next year it's out of style and you get canned for missing quota. In 1998-2001 I was selling Sun servers. It was a pretty damn nice way to make a living. In 2002 you couldn't give a Sun server away. So the odds of somebody staying content in tech sales is fairly low.

Though I never had any issue with my thinking or hearing or talking, I comparatively had slow speed at putting those thoughts into words. Or in otherwords, my thinking speed exceeded my talking speed. 2 points to mention -  1. Either that speed difference is the reason why my brain developed a different interface for thinking in terms of images and pictures than on words. 2. Or maybe because my brain used images first hand and that’s why my talking speed became slow (since visual network is comparatively faster than words). [A brain scan should tell you the difference]<p>Either way, I just said this to explain that our brain just needs a medium to think or if explained in terms of semantics - a medium to develop the semantic net. The voice that you have in your head is not something with which you are born. It’s something that’s being developed. It’s the same that happens with anyone with a hearing/speaking impairment that the brain will develop a different interface for them to think. For example, most people with autism probably will have a different thinking medium.

He's manipulative and cunning.  He believes he has the right to pay people off to get his own way.  He's incredibly secretive - leading double (in some cases, triple lives).  He has no true friendships and while he occasionally wrestles with morality, actually cares very little about the majority of those around him.  The one person who is closest to a friend (Peggy) has been treated ridiculously badly at times. He fears virtually no situation and has a tendancy to act rashly.  He enjoys and seeks out dangerous / risky situations.<p>Black and white can't be used to paint a full picture, and occasionally his character shows traits which describe another side to his personality.  Even so, his character would certainly fit the standard definition of a sociopath / narcissist.<p>It just happens that the attributes Don Draper has been ascribed, also align with western society's view of 'the perfect man'; which is quite telling itself.<p>Down-voting based on a difference in opinion would be a little bit Draper-like ;)",1278872092.0

Patent law doesn't require registration or publication with a patent-related agency or paper.  It merely requires prior art that is publicly accessible or known.<p>The point of registering with a publicly known entity like the WGA is that it may prove a date for the prior art.<p>The specific issue here is whether the WGA's registry is sufficiently accessible that it constitutes a ""public"" publication.<p>The answer depends on what exactly is registered, and whether the idea is ever made public (i.e., internet blog, scholastic paper, conference presentation, etc) or is privately known to the persons seeking the patent (i.e.,  pitching this very idea to the people who later try to patent something based on your prior art, etc).<p>The WGA registry provides proof that something was registered on a given date, but does not provide a public search engine for searching the contents of registered works.  So, by itself, the WGA registration would not provide any benefit unless you're trying to show that the patent-seeker had private knowledge of your prior art on a given date.",1278872073.0

All films and most colorants (in ink jet, dye transfer, etc.) use organic dyes or organic pigments. What made old Technicolor so stable was that it could produce silver separations of the three primary color records, and it was the silver negatives, which are extremely stable, that can be used to strike new color prints (with their organic dyes). Trouble is, this is a very expensive process. Disney used it for its animated features which it intended to release again and again over many decades. Most studios went for the much less expensive dye originals which are less stable, especially if poorly processed or stored. (New viewing prints can be struck from properly stored master prints.) Modern color movie films are quite stable (science marches on), which is largely why the costly Technicolor separation process gradually disappeared.<p>Digital systems pose their own problems, of course. There's media obsolescene (8-inch floppies, anyone?), digital integrity (bit drift, etc.), and media integrity (oops, that tape broke again). Much of what keeps archivists busy is deciding protocols for the continuous migration of images from one generation of media to another.<p>For really good up to date information on image permanence, I recommend the independent, non-profit (unlike Wilhelm) Image Permanence Institute at the Rochester Institute of Technology. They've got some excellent, free downloads on both the basics and the advanced stuff. Wilhelm's book may be free, but it's very old and out of date.\n <a href=""http://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/</a>",1278871984.0
