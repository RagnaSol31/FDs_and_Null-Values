They also replay hundreds of pro games for study, thereby memorizing them. I'd be surprised if it were any different for chess players.<p>In fact, even amateur low-dan -- advanced but far from professional level -- players can replay games they have played in the same day, and can memorize a few games with some practice.<p>Go games often last more than 200 moves but players memorize sequences, not isolated moves.<p>Pros can routinely read 50+ moves ahead but, as tsipiteri mentioned, the hardest part is evaluating the positions.<p>While there is no single ""world"" pro championship, a couple of Korean teenagers have won prestigious international titles. A 19-year-old who's ""merely"" a contender wouldn't be called a prodigy in the go world. I guess Asian go players just train more and are more competitive than chess players.

28,1032926,comment,1032700.0,1032700.0,0,0,jsz0,,,I don't understand the outrage over full body scans. A doctor or nurse often conducts routine private examinations for the benefit of your health and well being. An airport screener does a fully body scan for the benefit of your health and well being -- and the well being of others. I don't really see any difference. Most of the time the doctor or nurse do their examination and there's no problem. We don't view this as being too invasive because we understand it's a wise precaution to get regular checkups -- just in case.,1262717397.0

Forking is pretty fast, and it allows you to share memory in a fairly nice way.  However mixing forking and threading is a quite tricky with python.
