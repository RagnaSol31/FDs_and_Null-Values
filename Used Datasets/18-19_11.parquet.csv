Our Ubuntu server instance is running SBCL Lisp with Portable aserve with Apache providing ssl.  So far, it is truly impressive  (We launched on Ec2/S3 a week ago - it takes us 3 minutes to fire up another instance if we need to).<p>We're able to update at anytime with a simple ssh link, a GIT push, and then emacs/slime directly in to the SBCL thread running (after testing on local machines first, of course).  We can do complete updates with no interruption in service - a very nice feature)",1199904221

12,96429,comment,96281.0,96281.0,0,0,shabby,,,"So, why won't a big restaurant chain try out order-at-table?  6% net margins.  Small changes in restaurants can result in big changes to the bottom line, either good or bad.  And, changing the customer experience is considered a big change.  A huge pilot project for a 500 unit restaurant is to try out slight modifications to its menu.  Trying an order-at-table concept is orders of magnitude greater in potential change.  Several large chains told me they'd be very interested if they saw the concept working somewhere else first.<p>So, the obvious conclusion is to try it out at a smaller restaurant chain.  The problem there is that a pilot is considered a huge distraction that takes away from management's resources.  Also, it's a huge risk when you are piloting in one unit of a ten unit chain.  And, the small chain has no pull with its POS vendor.  So, you can't do an integration.",1199903377

I like my dedicated server, but I recently bought a 512MB slice at slicehost so I could experiment with CouchDB (which is alpha software, so I wasn't comfortable running it on my live production server), and it makes me wonder if I'm not wasting my money on the bigger dedicated server.<p>I have my dedicated server running every service I need (Apache with PHP, PostgreSQL, Postfix, Dovecot, ASSP, Helma), like many people do. But I'm beginning to think it would be better to have the simplicity and peace of mind of separate virtual servers for a few of these functions.
