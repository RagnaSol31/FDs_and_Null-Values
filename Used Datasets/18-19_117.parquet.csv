In large companies, or companies where software is not the focus however, there is very much room for this sort of counter-productive behavior/effect.<p>In the middle management tiers, and in the ""non-mission critical, support divisions"" the company goal and money making are easy to lose sight of. There is a lot of politicking for personal gain, and the employees have a tendency to not care about the company and maximize ways they can personally benefit. This is the land of the programmer who can't code. He exists as a warrior in the landscape of barely competent people with nominal jobs, carving out little empires for themselves and doing things that actively hurt the overall bottom line.<p>I think maybe jacquesm, you have been a good, motivated programmer surrounded by other good, motivated programmers for long enough that you have forgotten the world isn't entrepreneurial, that most people do the bare minimum at ""work, cuz thats why it's called work"". This isn't a criticism so much as a reminder of the rest of reality :)",1295117978.0

It can't be used to freely encode information like a hard disk.<p>- There is no way to retrieve information in this system. This is a bit like packing a large amount of extremely high-density magnetic platters in a box and calling this a storage system, which is very different from using actual hard drives with all the complex reading/writing system (heads, space between the platters, magnets...). Even if they're not connected, it still takes room.<p>- Reliability of hard disks is far, far better than this. Encoding information as a single copy in a single cell is wildly unsafe. Even using multiple copies, it's likely to degrade with mutations.<p>Edit: I was under the impression that a base pair could only encode one bit of information, since only T-C and A-G are valid combinations.

The irresistible economics of large networks.  In other words, large networks make sense economically.  They will find a way to be profitable.  And they will transform the world, relationships, business, culture, worldview.  Large networks might just be the most transformative force in today's world.<p>3.  User experience rules.  It's not about how techy or complex your project is, but rather what's the experience of the user.   How does it add value to them?  And do they LOVE it?  This is what differentiates various Internet services and allows them to gain traction until they can fully utilize network effects to make their site better than anything else out there.<p>4.  Launching new large networks is more challenging.  People are already on FB, Twitter, Tumblr, etc... and to create new large networks can be difficult because people already have their loyalities, and the current large networks are just getting better and better.
