No macroeconomic developments of the last 100 years confirm it.<p>> We’re not being punished for our exuberance<p>We're being ""punished"" for massive malinvestment.  Wealth was poured into assets and ventures that could never achieve positive returns.  A recession/depression is the process of liquidating malinvestments and redeploying wealth and labor to economically profitable ventures.<p>The malinvestment happens partly from mass psychology and mostly because of artificially manipulated interest rates.  The natural market interest rate reflects the amount of wealth available for investment (capital).  When people have saved a lot and there's a lot of wealth stored up, interest rates are low.  When interest rates are <i>artificially</i> held low, investors and business people get the mistaken impression there's much more stored wealth in the society than there actually is.  Then eventually many business plans come to tears at roughly the same time, as it becomes apparent there isn't the wealth to drive demand for the ventures.  This is a recession.",1233772955.0

If you owe 1$ @ 5% over a year with 50% deflation you now owe 2.1 times the value of what you bought.  Once deflation starts people start trying to pay back their debt because their effective interest rate increased.  Which decreases the money supply and causes even more deflation.  This cycle can quickly get extremely nasty with most people defaulting.<p>The free market dampener is people refinancing at slightly lower rates, but this this hits a wall.
