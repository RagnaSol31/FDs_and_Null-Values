I'm not a big fan of Air (the Adobe kind), but what you've accomplished with it is impressive and I look forward to seeing what direction it will take.<p>My partners and I used to work for a prominent Canadian digital imaging software company based out of Victoria, British Columbia (I won't mention names - it's safer that way).  Since our time there, we've moved on to other things but eventually we rejoined to form our own company that created a digital photography product called Snapact (see more here: <a href=""http://www.snapact.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snapact.com/</a>).<p>We focus more on photo management and sharing, so I think that there may be possibilities for working together with you two - at the very least on co-marketing efforts.<p>Maybe we should talk?  If it leads to something, great.  If not, no harm done.",1259953188.0

Meh.  But that post is filled with so many absurd inaccuracies that I have to simply disregard it.  Most prominently:<p>At the top of the page, he shows the exact text that appears on the ""horrible"" search results page.  That text explains <i>exactly</i> how to remove that functionality:<p>""This program can be uninstalled from the Control Panel ""Add/Remove Programs"" in Windows XP or ""Control Panel > Program > Programs and Features"" in Windows Vista. Look for the application named ""Browser Address Error Redirector"". Older versions may be called ""GoogleAFE"" or ""URL Assistant"".""<p>He says this statement is ""ambiguous"".  I have no idea how it is ambiguous, but ok.  He then goes on to say the software is ""hard to remove"", and later that ""users can't get rid of it!"", both of which are outright lies.  Installing and uninstalling software is a normal part of owning a computer, and as you can see above, Google's message tells users <i>exactly</i> what to uninstall.  The entire process could be completed in 30 seconds.<p>But I have to ask myself every time I read this article: why is this guy going to so much effort to spread inaccuracies that demonize Google for trapping search results and presenting ads?<p>Well, because that is <i>exactly</i> how OpenDNS makes money, and Google threatened their business model.  The entire first portion of the post, attacks and all, is present to justify this:<p>""we’ve stretched a bit beyond DNS itself to work around Google’s mis-directed efforts.""<p>By going on the offensive, he now tries to justify providing a DNS service that OpeDNS doesn't just resolve hostnames anymore...instead, OpenDNS makes moral judgments about the domains you visit, and, as they trumpet so loudly, ""we have a fix which does not require more client software"".  What this means to me is that whatever OpenDNS is doing, I <i>can't</i> uninstall it, because they own it -- it's not on my machine, it's on theirs.<p>Listen, when I use DNS, there's a contract I expect DNS to fulfill: I give you a name, and you resolve it to an IP or tell me it can't be resolved.  It is an outright violation of the contract to resolve a hostname I give you to an address other than that with which it is associated, which is exactly what OpenDNS is doing.",1259952663.0

It's a process-- a system, if you will-- and one that few human cultures have been able to implement.<p>Science requires a certain outcome-indifference. This is why it's hard-to-impossible to study questions such as life after death (a universal concern where everyone cares deeply about the answer) or whether there's a God. On the other hand, one can scientifically study the mechanics of how the body dies, because for most people, having the correct answer is more important than what the answer (e.g. the precise biological processes through which it happens) is.<p>The problem is that science, as a system, is under attack from commercial pressures as well as the rapid pace of technological society.

That's 1.1 million a year in income and a 5 million tax break at the cost his capital after he dies.  It's less liquid right now, but 1.1 million a year is well past FU money and getting a loan with that sort of income stream is easy.   If his annual payout was less than 5% then it would have been a sacrifice, but 5% + inflation means he might be extracting more money in real terms than he is generating.  This means over a long enough time scale he basically skims most of his money back, and he leaves the tax break some of it's interest to charity.  Granted if he generates significantly more than 5% + inflation he does lose some money but he does get 5% of an ever larger pool so it's not all that much of a loss.<p>PS:   Which is not to say it’s a bad thing, rather it’s more of a tax loophole than you might think.

Perhaps an NDA might be the legislative path to take - but sometimes there is another approach:<p>There is a story, which may be an urban legend, but it exemplifies this story nicely: An Optimizations Research (OR) company tries to sell a product that can do crew scheduling for a airlines company. To show its power, they presented an optimized schedule where several million dollars could be saved, compared to their current models. The OR company was declined, but the airline took the data and implemented it.<p>What they did not know, was that the data presented were poisoned. Normally, when optimizing, you also account for the robustness of the model, so emergencies does not bring the whole system down. Being smart, the OR company had removed the robustness constraints, which severely hit the airline.<p>So the bottom line is: Try to poison the sales pitch. Know that you keep out something which is crucial to the solution, but does not impede the impressiveness.
