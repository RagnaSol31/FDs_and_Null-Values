Yes, they may all be fun for the developers, but ultimately, they strive to be useful. I'm sure not every aspect of developing a major open source project like one of these is fun. I don't know anyone who finds debugging fun, for example. It has to be done though if you want to produce something useful (even if only to yourself).

44,743960,comment,743768.0,743768.0,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Money. Not a ton, but it's a very time-consuming job.<p>I do like writing documentation, and I'm pretty good at it. Unfortunately it's a thankless task, and criticizing or feeding back to developers about shortcomings often engenders a frosty reply, so I rarely do it any more. Add in the fact that for simpler software, good UI design often makes documentation redundant, are you have to deal with the fact that the things most in need of good documentation fall into two classes:<p>a) domains of expertise where the documentation needs to be as much an introduction to the task for which the software is used as how to use it. Example: Adobe sells a great, great piece of audio editing software called Audition. It has been my favorite for over a decade. The manual is...well, generic. Before they bought the product, it was called CoolEdit, and it had one of the best manuals I've ever read: written by the main author of the project, it was as much an introduction to signal processing and audio engineering as a guide to using the program, since the <i>utility</i> of many fine features is not apparent to the novice user. Inexplicably when Adobe took over the project they ditched this - perhaps preferring to rely on third party publishers or their own publishing imprint (which is quite good). Some of the best documentation, like the above, gives the sense of having been written <i>before</i> the code, rather than afterwards when the programmer is burnt out.<p>b) legacy systems which may completely suck but which we are stuck with. Unfortunately, project managers tend not to look kindly on documentation that starts by acknowledging the software in question is poorly designed, confusing, or contains bugs which may never be fixed. They want documentation that tells yo how things are supposed to work, not documentation that goes into detail about what happens when it fails and how to deal with it (although this is the time when the end user is most in need of quality information).<p>There's one other problem, that of social exclusion. It's assumed by certain kinds of programmers and administrators that the code or tools must be accepted much as they are, and if one finds the system opaque or perplexing that that is part of the price one pays to develop expertise in it.<p>Many years ago, when I first installed Linux, I ended up at a shell prompt armed only with the knowledge of cd and ls. Typing 'help' yielded only a polite error. It took me quite a while to discover the 'man' (manual) command, and when I did I was less than impressed with much of the documentation. As mentioned above, many man pages devote no time whatsoever to explaining <i>why</i> you might want to use something. This is a kind of an artificial example, but one that encapsulates the seemingly arbitrary and unfriendly experience of computing for many people.<p>Reference materials usually do not perform very well as tutorial materials, and yet they are likely to be the first thing the typical user encounters. I made fun of Microsoft's Clippy character along with everyone else, but for the general user who just wanted to use the computer rather than understand it, it was actually a godsend.",1249497467.0

71,743931,comment,743563.0,743563.0,0,0,grellas,,,"Law can be significantly improved through technological innovation but, at its heart, does not lend itself to mechanical application.<p>By its nature, the law seeks to regulate human affairs, which can have as many variations as there are people, thoughts, and actions. That is, law works with what is basically an infinite set of potential variations.<p>In trying to define what is right and what is wrong, what is just and unjust, the law adopts rules and principles to attempt to make sense of the common cases that arise. But there will always be an exceptional case waiting around the corner.<p>That is why judge-made law lies at the core of law. It deals with issues as they arise case by case in an individualized setting. When judges write opinions, they set precedents to help guide future decisions. The precedents in themselves embody sets of rules or principles as they applied to a particular set of facts. When new facts arise, the law can apply the same principles or can distinguish the new facts and declare a variant outcome based on such facts. It is a highly customized system that can't be systematized unless and until human conduct can be systematized - that is, it never can be made predictable except insofar as it concerns recurring types of situations, meaning that exceptions will <i>always</i> arise.<p>When legislatures try to systematize law, they do so through statutes. These are authoritative pronouncements of law that say, in effect, ""for this type of issue, here is what the law will be.""<p>Statutes are so general, though, that courts need to interpret them as they apply to individual situations that may arise under them. This leads right back to the case-by-case approach of judge-made law.<p>Statutes also have implementing regulations by which they are clarified and applied to detailed situations. Just try to read through the Code of Federal Regulations sometime. You will find a maze of detail so individualized that no one would possibly want to waste time trying to systematize. Again, the human factor looms large. Tax regulations might say that this or that constitutes taxable income. But some lobbyist has managed to get Congress to inject bizarre exceptions. Again, though, the real problem is how any given regulation applies to real-world facts. These come with infinite variations and lead right back to the case-by-case type of system found in courts - thus, nearly every administrative agency has a corresponding court (the Tax Court, for instance).<p>When David Dudley Field tried to simplify law in the 1870s in California, he got the California legislature to adopt the Field Codes. These were complete restatements of all the judge-made law then extant in California, all set forth in simply-worded statutes, drafted by the brightest people with the express intention of making the law understandable to lay people. It was a grand experiment in legal simplification. What happened? The judges began interpreting the statutes case-by-case, had to decide how the new ""simple"" language related to the older more complex language in evaluating the continuing worth of the older precedents, and finally had to decide whether the legislature did or did not intend to change the law from what it was before in adopting the new language in any given area. By the time the courts went through that maze, and then had to apply the simple statutes to many sets of complex facts that inevitably arose in real life, they had managed to promulgate a new body of judge-made law that was more complicated than ever. The Field Code, then, turned out to be one of the world's biggest belly flops - it began with a great flourish and ended up a humiliating embarrassment.<p>The same with form contracts - it all turns on customization. If you want to take an elegantly worded contract and just sign it without considering how it might apply to your deal, you are asking for trouble.<p>Law also has innumerable localized variations. There is municipal law (that varies with each city or town), state law (that varies with each state), federal law (that varies with each nation), and international law. Different scenarios can potentially implicate laws from one or more of these disparate levels at the same time. Who decides which law applies in a complex fact pattern where activities might have occurred in multiple states or nations? Or how the law of one region may or may not be qualitatively better than the law of another? Any coding system would need to make such determinations.<p>That all said, if someone can figure out how to put all this in code in any way that is meaningful, it will be one of the most stunning accomplishments ever.<p>The underlying article is a good read. The idea of reducing the overall body of law to code, though, is pretty fantastic, in my judgment.",1249496356.0
