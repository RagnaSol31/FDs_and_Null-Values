I am still missing some part of the picture, so let me ask:<p>Types:  You think about the problem up-front to the best you can.  Most likely you later change the interface.  The compiler now breaks the code and forces you to fix it.<p>Dynamic:  You are flexible, which means you can start your work without having to think up-front (Q1:  How is this good?).  Later when you change the interface (which may exist only in your mind, but it does as far as the modules are to interact with each other in some way at all), the code still breaks but the compiler won't tell you.<p>In either case, as you said ""you have to fix them anyway"".  So Q2:  How is compiler not being able to complain about broken code (and possibly unit tests finding it) helping?<p>One comment here cited an example where one can get away without introducing errors while still changing the type (""f(g(x)"").

This will explain a few gaps.<p>Back in the day (i.e. around the late 80's) we used to have PROPER computers in schools in the UK that everyone had free access to.  My particular school had a large network of BBC Master[1] and Acorn Archimedes[2] machines - all proprietary platforms but OPEN with respect to documentation and doing what the hell you liked with them.  In fact, Acorn, the manufacturer would tend to shove all the hardware reference and programmers guides in the box with the machines (you could not break the software on them).  They ALL had BBC BASIC (very advanced variant of structured BASIC) with an inline 6502 or ARM assembler and most of the earlier machines had analogue and digital IO you could just stuff things into.  They were all networked together as well and could talk to each other.<p>We were ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED to build stuff that plugged into these (rather than the recent policies and AUPs that students have to live with) and write software to control things and even modify the operating system at will.  We built a massive transit shuttle system based on Lego, we build automated cranes, we build light sequencers, we built anything we damn wanted and were applauded for it.<p>Most of the software devs I know in the UK (other than the young and really old ones) tend to have cut their teeth on this kit.<p>Then there was the introduction of the PC which destroyed all this in favour of ""security"", ""acceptable use policies"", ""black boxes"", ""no documentation"" and ""vendor lock in"".<p>Mr Braben was a pioneer of these machines [3] [4] and is held close to the heart of many people.  He wants the education sector to go back to these days (rather than the utter corruption that Research Machines, BECTA and Microsoft have destroyed everything with recently) because he truly KNOWS what is good for the industry i.e. people who know how stuff works and are free to understand.<p>Ironically, on a slight tangent, my children have Linux machines in their school these days rather than Windows, which is used for administrative functions only.

That situation is when you are writing a module (something that would be a compilation unit in a typed language) that calls missing or nonexistent library interfaces, and you want to test parts of the module that do <i>not</i> depend on the missing APIs.  In a typed language, you can't do it.  You would have to satisfy the dependencies first so your code would compile, or you would have to copy snippets of your code out of the compilation unit into a REPL or another file so they could be compiled separately.  In an untyped language, you can experiment with parts of the module and even start writing tests without having to make sure all of the module's dependencies are satisfied.<p>Aside from that one advantage, though, it's the same with types or without them.  For a module as a whole, the compilation dependencies that exist in a typed language are the same as the runtime dependencies that exist in an untyped language.  Whether you're using a typed or untyped language, you can write whatever code you want, but you can't do anything with it until you satisfy its dependencies.  With that one exception, of course:  in an untyped language, you can run code that <i>doesn't</i> depend on the missing APIs but happens to be in the same module as code that <i>does</i> depend on them.<p>Overall, I don't think that amounts to much, especially compared to a typed language like Scala where you can copy snippets into a REPL.  Or even better, Ensime is an Emacs mode that is supposed to let you work with Scala the way Slime lets you work with Common Lisp.
