'undefined' is read-only in the ES3.1 specification and at some point you'll start to see code like the above failing.<p>15.1.1.3 undefined \nThe value of undefined is undefined (see 8.1). This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: false, \n[[Enumerable]]: false, [[Configurable]]: false }.<p>It's true that it can be broken today by unintentional assignment at the global scope, but you're basically skating on thin ice as soon as you redefine undefined or one of the many built-in global object types or global mutable values anyways (Array, Element, Object, NaN for example). Ditto for adding anything to Object.prototype.<p>I wouldn't blame a framework for wanting to place at least some burden on the user to follow a set of basic guidelines to ensure the library functions correctly. Ideally you'd ship your development-time, unminified version of the library with a bunch of startup-time assertions to ensure that the user isn't accidentally walking over core JS objects.<p>Alternatively, you could workaround the mutable nature of some of the globals by defining your own in-scope. When these values are eventually made read-only, these assignments should become no-ops:<p>var undefined = void 0;\nvar NaN = 0/0;\nvar Infinity = 1/0;<p>This is comment is rambling a bit, but I think I can justify the position that at least some of the recommended practices of the c.l.j folk are wordy, unnecessary and out-dated.",1260816349.0

The main reason I switched, since most feaures I cared about could be found on multiple platforms, was build quality. It would be hard to deny that the unibody laptops Apple makes are incredibly solid and long-lasting. Same goes for an iPhone with a basic amount of care. The side-effect of this is resale value. Of course the iPhone's resale value is inflated due to the unlocked market, but even the laptops have insane resale value. It's nice to know that when I need to upgrade I can pay for 30%+ of a new model with the proceeds of selling my current one. Go out and pay $2000 for a plastic laptop, use it and abuse it for a year and try to sell it. Paint will be rubbed off, there will be squeaky loose panels, people will only laugh.<p>Again, these are just my personal reasons for choosing Apple at this time, I am more than willing to give other companies a chance if they can manage to make great hardware to go with their great software.

In the 1980s I worked on a large DARPA project where a huge hit was taken because our admins never tried to restore from backups. It is the kind of lesson that is (hopefully) learned with just one bad experience.<p>This is another reason why I like EC2 deployments: it is fairly easy to take your backups (automated deployment scripts, application, data) and spin up another copy of your whole system (except for flipping the DNS). Make sure those EBS-backed EC2 AMIs are really bootable and functioning :-)",1260813698.0
