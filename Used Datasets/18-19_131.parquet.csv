So I created a PayPal account and transferred $100 in from a bank account.  I then tried to make a purchase, but found that as an outside-the-US user, I would not be able to make payments until I registered a credit card with them.  I couldn't qualify for a credit card at the time... oh well.  So I tried to move the money back to my bank account.  But that transaction was covered by the same policy; I wouldn't be able to do it until I registered a credit card with them.<p>Looking through the ToS, I found that this rule was in there; an international user had to register a credit card in order to disburse any funds from the account.  So the fool in this story is indisputably me.  Still, I found it hard to believe that the system was set up to allow black hole accounts, which money could enter but never leave.  Over a lengthy email exchange, I was assured that such accounts were indeed possible, and that I had created one.<p>Eventually I let go of the $100.  But I never let go my scorn for PayPal.",1283713177.0

20,1664930,comment,1664843.0,1664843.0,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,Over the past couple years I think I’ve come over to the point of view that the university degree system should be abolished and that higher education needs to be restructured.<p>Higher Education was born out of the need to verify applicant knowledge for employment.  Then society realized we needed institutions to instill that knowledge.  So the university system was born to disseminate knowledge.<p>But today we have infinitely better ways to disseminate information and the only reason we aren’t using them is because Universities don’t want to lose their stranglehold on education.  The end result of which is an elitist system that traps knowledge behind a very expensive paywall.  So expensive that only 27% of the nation manages to actually get a degree.\n <p>I don’t have a problem with the Universities still existing.  But I do think we should make a free education available online for all people and grant degrees based on standardized testing. ,1283712717.0

23,1664927,comment,1664750.0,1664750.0,0,0,TylerJewell,,,"I am a Heroku fan.  Some things for you to consider:\n1) The real value of Heroku is time savings.  Their deployment mechanism is near instant, so your savings come from the time you are spending doing more development, rather than managing servers.  If you wanted to hire an ops person, that's a cost savings.<p>2) Scalability.  As your system grows, Heroku manages architecture choices necessary for scaling all parts of your app.  This is at the dyno web tier and database tier.  But it also includes choices around architecting add-ons.  For example, if you wanted to include their memcache add-on and you had multiple apps, should you create multiple memcache instances or one large grid?  That sort of choice is handled behind the scenes.<p>3) Add-Ons.  They handle configuration, billing, and setup of any add-ons you might need.  Biggest savings is not having to research all of them to figure out which ones are stable, viable, functional.<p>4) Cheap to get started.  You can deploy new apps for free, and migrate your code elsewhere if needed.<p>5) Their polyglot strategy is interesting, and they are pushing the envelope with beta implementations around nosql data stores.  There is a nice polyglot post on their blog.<p>6) There is some performance advantages of using some of their add-ons.  Because Heroku is deployed on EC2, and many of the add-ons are also on EC2, the integrated performance can be higher.  EC2 ping rates are faster than gigabit ethernet in some cases.<p>7) Creating identical environments.  If you manage your own servers and you need to create staging, QA, or development servers, you'd have to create those manually and they'd be close, but not identical because there is different hardware involved.  In debugging scenarios, being able to clone a whole app environment has some advantages.<p>Good luck in your endeavor.",1283712576.0

For example every distribution uploaded to the CPAN is tested on some subset of (using last month's statistics[1]) 15 different operating systems, across 81 platforms, and 26 different versions of Perl. Not every package is tested on every perl and every platform because this is a volunteer effort, but the major platforms (Linux, Windows, BSD, Solaris) are generally covered. These test results are aggregated and reported on search.cpan.org.<p>Every package uploaded is given a Bug Queue (rt.cpan.org) so bugs and patches can be reported to the author. Additionally distributions can now specify in their metadata (META.yaml/META.json) the source code repository for the code so you can see from search.cpan.org the place to get the latest code to patch against. Additionally there is a process that if a maintainer goes rogue and stops responding, packages can be taken over. This doesn't happen often but has been used when other options fail. Many modern projects have several co-maintainers who can all make releases lowering the ""bus factor"".<p>Right now the biggest problem is finding the wheat for all the chaff. Sturgeon's Law applies, 90% of everything is crap.

This works for the main socket types and transports (but not PAIR and inproc:)<p>This lets us do things like start clients and THEN start a server... the clients automatically connect when the server comes along.  The server can go away, be replaced by another on the same endpoint, and clients will gracefully and invisibly start talking to the new server.<p>In some cases this is precisely what we want, in other cases it's not.  If we need to detect dead peers, we add heartbeating as a message flow on top of 0MQ.  Most larger 0MQ applications currently do this.
