Yes, Texas has a history of doing very odd things as it relates to topics like sex education and evolution but these things are so tiny in the broad context of a K-12 level education that they are effectively meaningless.<p>When it comes down to it, whether a kid is taught evolution or some far-fetched creationist theory about the creation of the world matters little in the quality of their education as it relates to their success on leaving high school.  That's what kids should be compared on and if I were guessing, I'd guess that's the standard here.<p>It's fun to take easy potshots at Texas based on backwards beliefs in the origin of the species but in the end, kids ability to read, write and do math are far more imporant.",1262976845.0

Why?  Because most food in the United States moves from west to east.  So the demand for space on equipment returning to California for more food has always been lower.<p>Anyone involved in trucking, logistics, or distribution has known this for years.  When in doubt, keep inventory in the eastern part of the U.S. because in an emergency, it's always cheaper to ship from east to west.  Hell, many manufacturers have found it's actually cheaper to make a new product than to ship an existing one back from west to east.<p>Entire manufacturing and distribution facilities have been built in the east financially justified by freight rate differences alone.<p>Sorry OP, your false argument is outed.

As for the statistics given, there is no question that difficult local economic conditions are going to result in people leaving.  And that will result in cost differentials in Uhaul rates.  Current results can be seen from a glance at the economy.  But the results fluctuate over time, 5 years ago California did not look so bad and 5 years from now it probably won't either.  Uhaul rates usually reflect transient conditions and not fundamental problems.<p>Now he's focused on facts that make California look bad.  But that is just fact selection.  If he had a different bias he'd note that California's atrocious way of managing itself has consistently lead to an excess of economic growth compared to the rest of the country.  That is why average salaries here are higher, property here costs more, and expenses here are also higher.  (Which explains why education here costs more.)<p>Furthermore over time California consistently has paid more into the union than it has taken away, and Texas has done the reverse.  Sure, the current budget here is a mess, but if California could ask back from the federal government the recent excess that it sent, California's budget would be fine.  If we did the same exercise with Texas, Texas would be worse off than the California state government is now.<p>So if you look at one set of figures, Texas is better.  If you look at another it looks like California works better.  Reality as always is messy, and perception is more in the eye of the beholder than the facts on the ground.",1262975689.0

Revenue share split with the ISPs. The bet is not on whether or not ISPs would do nothing in response to an inordinate amount of their network being used for P2P traffic. The real goal is to convert the 'bad' P2P traffic, but incentivizing the current P2Pers to use their machines for good use (and earn some money) while doing so. Again, of course, at the limits there might be some problems with the economics of it all - but I think rather than it blowing up, it is just unknown. No one knows exactly what will happen when the majority of the bad p2p traffic converts to good p2p traffic.<p>I do agree that there are major quality issues, but I think we have reached the stage of technological advancement that those problems can be solved. Maybe not with something off the shelf, but definitely solved.<p>As to your last point, the truth is that this idea actually has two business models and uses. I think I might do another post to flesh out that side, but the name of the post bares it out. A legal botnet. In other words, a legal way to fight fire against fire for DDOS attacks.<p>The only way to defeat a DDOS (as far as I know) is to throw more bandwidth at the packets being sent. As it stands right now, it is very expensive to do that from one single ISP (or even a handful of ISPs). With a network like this, it would become an arms race.

In retrospect, there were other, non-technical ""smells"" that indicated that the sausage might not be so well made -- dumb developers, vague managers, production broken-ness, etc.<p>I've seen a lot of Java codebases over the past decade, ranging from good to awful.  To get a feel for the overall quality, I've learned to check out some common things that are usually indicative of overall quality.  For example, bad developers never seem to understand exception handling.  Database connection management is another easy spot to check out -- letting the pool close up one's connections seems to be a favorite pastime. Other stuff that's not necessarily Java specific -- use of custom frameworks that, according to the developers' own descriptions, are replicas of existing stuff.<p>Perhaps, as @hga pointed out here, sitting at a terminal with an experienced developer and insisting that he/she show you the stuff you want to see (as opposed to a passive, guided tour) would be a quick way to gauge overall quality.
