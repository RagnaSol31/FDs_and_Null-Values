It's an article about pulse shaping, which is used to, well, change the shape of an ultra-short pulse. Not generate it.<p>What you want to look for is mode-locking. Essentially it's based on interference. You have a lot of standing waves in a laser cavity and lock them so that they all have the same phase. Then they'll interfere destructively except at a regular interval where they add up to make a powerful but very short pulse.

The last thing we want is government enforcement of birth rates; prosperity takes care of that without taking away anyone's freedom. Most prosperous nations have lower-than-replacement birth rates among the wealthy citizens, and that's actually going to become a serious problem unless we can make more poor people wealthy.<p>By 'wealth', I don't mean just money, I mean everything that goes into a better quality of life: Freedom, food, water, housing, education, and energy. In my opinion the first and last are the keys: people must be free to pursue activities which will improve their lot in life, and energy must be abundant and inexpensive to enable people to act on their freedom. With plentiful energy, food can be produced with minimal labor, water can be cleaned, materials for housing can be produced cheaply, and all of the above can raise people up from struggling for subsistance so that they have the time to devote to education.<p>Finally, in a world full of industrious, well-educated, and free people who have plenty of energy at their disposal, the problems caused by global warming can be tackled and solved whatever they may be.

A pure split test (A/B) doesn't quite seem right, because it'll be more difficult to compare w/o doing some sort of multivariate regression.<p>I'd suggest this: peel off a small segment (10%, 20%) randomly out of your user base.  Give them the option for monthly / annually.  Compare the revenue from that group to the revenue from your control group.  Even if you do anger a few of your customers, or the monthly plan costs you a lot of sales / revenue, you've only done it with a small section of your audience.<p>The only downside to this is that you might find some customers prefer the monthly plan, even if you only want to offer the annual (after testing, you find that annual is more profitable to you).<p>Each site is different.  Each customer base is different.  This seems to me like a situation where you should collect data, rather than look for high level advice.",1262023432.0

Sorry, but I used to work in this industry too and you are way off.<p>First, you know hardly anything about these people. At best you have a guess about their income. You don't know age or occupation or education level. (Not to mention a large number of the names are probably bogus -- I would certainly fill out bogus data.) Realistically, you'd have to overlay it with data from other sources to make it usable to anyone besides, perhaps, other companies selling overpriced puzzles.<p>I can get much complete and valuable demographics for much less than $1 each.

And wind resistance is still v^2 so it'll still go as v^2 only slower.<p>The brake limit is an interesting one, though. Apparently brakes are not providing a constant brake <i>torque</i> as one would naively expect, but instead a constant dissipation power. This is why everyone can lock their brakes going slowly, but it's normally quite hard to do if you're going 80mph. (For a normal ""family"" car.)",1262023218.0
