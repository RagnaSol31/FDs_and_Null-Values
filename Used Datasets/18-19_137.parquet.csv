It is just easier for someone raised in the burbs to not come in contact with non-white racial groups, poor communities, openly gay couples, etc...<p>Just some food for thought...<p>When many people think of cities they think of New York, Chicago, LA, etc. There are smaller, second tier cities that offer good proximity to an urban center and cultural life while still giving good public education and safety. A city fitting this description that I'm really high on right now is Portland, Me.<p>When I was single I lived in Boston for a bit and didn't own a car. It was one of the happiest periods of my life. A monthly pass for unlimited bus and train was about $45. The low price allowed me to live in the city, sharing an apartment of course, on a $26K salary.<p>One of the benefits of relying on public transit is being able to read. Nowadays I'd probably code but laptops were large and expensive then. (There is nothing more wasteful of your time/life than sitting in a traffic jam IMO.)<p>I worked out in a section of the city called Forest Hills. On Fridays, after workouts ended around 10p, I'd take the Orange line down to Chinatown to eat. I'd regularly walk around side streets late night and never had a problem. (You get used to guys asking you if you need anything. A quick ""Nah, I'm cool"" and they'd walk away.)<p>I don't know your nearest city so only you can judge the safety, but I looked up the violent crime index for my own and it's on par with Chicago.",1252609015.0

One observation though; anyone else notice that the bar chart is a bit misleading?  It compares running Tornado in 4 processes behind nginx to running Django behind Apache and Cherrypy as a single Python process.  As a fellow coworker put it, ""With 4 extra processes running of course it will be 4 times as fast.""  I'm not opposed to this kind of comparison when the intent is to show how configurations can increase req/sec, but if the intent is to compare one Pythonic webserver to another, this comparison seems a bit unfair.  That said, assuming the ""Tornado (1 single-threaded frontend)"" measure is simply Tornado running as a single Python process, it still is plenty faster than Cherrypy.",1252608242.0

The cost of flash would have to start going down even more drastically than it already is to ever come close to matching the manufacturing cost of a DVD or even a Blu Ray disk, but I would think there would be a point where the value/$ would make it worth it to the consumer. Faster loading times, more durable games (ie no disk scratch errors), no real space limit on the games, extra room for game specific DLC, and I'm sure other advantages that I can't think of now that would be cool.<p>Street Fighter 2 super dooper HD remix might only need 5-10 gigs worth of memory, so they just throw in one 16 gig module (or two 8 / four 4 gig modules for data striping and faster loading times) and ship it. Metal Gear Solid 7 and its over 9000 hours of CGI might need 200+ gigs, so they just throw in as much flash memory as they can and go to town with their high res textures and lossless a/v.<p>Lets say Rock Band 5 ships with 80 songs at approximately a half gig a song, as well as 20 gigs of everything else, for a 60 gig total footprint. They then could ship the game on a 120 gig flash cartridge, mark half of it writable to the console, and boom.

70,815835,story,,,26,31,agl,Ask HN: Why don't we see more HTTPS? Is CPU an issue?,,"I'm considering if I should put time into making SSL handshakes faster (by using more modern primitives). I get conflicting reports about whether the lack of common HTTPS support (https://news.ycombinator.com doesn't connect, for example) is exacerbated by the CPU load of performing handshakes.<p>Here are the numbers:<p>ECRYPT says that 1248-bits is the ""Smallest general-purpose""[1] modulus size these days. Well tuned HTTPS sites (Google, Amazon) will negotiate RSA/RC4/SHA1 [2]. Google uses a 1024-bit key, Amazon has a 2048-bit key.<p>An SSL handshake with cipher-suites that involve RSA require an RSA private-key operation on the server[3]. The ECRYPT benchmarks suggest that a 2048-bit RSA private-key operation takes about 14Mcycles on a Core2 [4], which is about 158 ops/sec/core. (You can also run `openssl speed rsa` to get numbers for your system.)<p>So, if you run a non-trivial website, my questions are:<p>* Why don't you support HTTPS (if you don't)\n* How much is a problem is the CPU load of HTTPS (if you do), and do you worry about getting slashdotted?\n* How many connections/second/core do you handle (if you're willing to reveal such information)<p>Cheers<p>[1] http://www.keylength.com/en/3/\n[2] `openssl s_client -connect mail.google.com:443`\n[3] RFC 5632, 8.1.1\n[4] http://bench.cr.yp.to/web-impl/amd64-margaux-crypto_encrypt.html",1252606890.0

Diferent stocks have different resolving power. Normally finer grained (slow) film has more resolving power, higher sensitivity (faster) film has less resolving power, etc, all else being equal.<p>> A simplified triangle of image quality capability is made by grain-speed-resolution. If you try to get more speed, graininess usually increases and/or resolution decreases, etc. With advances in film emulsion technology the triangle gets bigger. You get higher speed with the same fine grain, equivalent sharpness, etc.<p>> If you have coarse big grain you get more speed (sensitivity) but the resolving power is decreased, while if you have finer smaller grain, packaged in a more uniform way into a thinner emulsion layer, you get better sharpness and the ability record finer detail per millimeter, but less sensitivity (you need more light) somewhat similar to having more pixels packed into a sensor.<p>> The lens on the camera also has a resolution limit and the combined resolution of the film emulsion and the lens resolution that ends up on the final image on the negative is less than each's.<p>> So having the resolving power of the final image (c/mm) and the size of the image (mm) you can multiply both and get what the resolution of the film/camera/lens system is capable of.<p>> Also what we perceive as grain on photographic images is actually grain clumps as the grains are randomly distributed in irregular patterns within the film emulsion. (The smoothing and more uniform distribution of grain in film emulsions is one of the ways film quality has improved over the years) We're not looking at the individual grains themselves when we look at images in normal picture and movie viewing magnifications. To see the real individual grains you have to use those microscopic enlargements where the image is blown up so much you can barely make any of it.",1252606660.0
