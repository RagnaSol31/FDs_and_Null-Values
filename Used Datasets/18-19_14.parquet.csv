11,277867,comment,277742.0,277773.0,0,0,wmf,,,I think those low-budget MMOs are not subscription-based; they have a freemium model where most people play for free and some people pay to pimp out their character. So the article is saying that non-subscription MMOs are more profitable than subscription MMOs. It's basically Web 2.0 for games.,1218912432

It's basically impossible - there's such a huge time investment that most players are unlikely to play more than one game at a time. Plus, to compete with WoW head on you have to spend their kind of budgets, which is an arms race you would be very likely to lose.

Your comment seems reflective of that belief.  I'll just point out that herding libertarians is not an easy task, and the coalition that is the Ron Paul revolution is already mostly fallen apart.  I wish it would stick around...but libertarians just aren't very strong on the collective effort front.  It was a pretty fragile coalition to start with...many of Ron Paul's supporters had one or more serious concerns about his positions (some touchy subjects: abortion, immigration, gold standard, church/state separation).",1218910022
