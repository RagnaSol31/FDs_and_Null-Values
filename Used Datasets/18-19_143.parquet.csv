21,583754,comment,583164.0,583164.0,0,0,kmavm,,,"Interesting claim that ""language designer"" == ""mastermind."" Being great at designing notation for algorithms (which is what languages really are) is conceptually distinct from what most people think of as being a good programmer. It so happens that some language designers have found themselves in that place by virtue of being great programmers (the example that jumps to mind is Dennis Ritchie), but the two coincide less and less often as the field matures, and languages become less of a ""systems"" problem. At least in academia, the programming language people are perhaps the least likely to ever have to write a line of code in anger.<p>This gap between coming up with neat notation and the resources need for a world-beating implementation of a language is one of the tragedies of the ""dictator-for-life"" that has arisen for the ""developer productivity"" languages (perl, python, ruby...) The language equates in practice with the particular implementation that the designer banged out and maintains. The presence of this reference implementation strangles other implementations in the crib, because users know that libraries, .deb's, new language features, etc., will appear first in the dictator's implementation. Thus, we have datacenters full of nice fast CPUs that spend their lives executing Joe's-favorite-language's switch-on-bytecode VM loop, when they could be running a compiled implementation with more sensible resource usage.",1240944611.0

I agree it's important to focus on things under our control, but there's a difference between taking active control over one's life and taking moral responsibility for other people's actions.  The fact that we use the word ""responsibility"" to refer to both these things -- the common aspect being an attitude of initiative and self-reliance as opposed to helplessness and blaming -- confuses rather than clarifies the issue.<p>Using the dual nature of the word ""responsibility"" is a common ploy to distribute blame to everybody equally when discussions of blame become counterproductive.

It's fine to be learning geeky hobbies, coding, reading hacker news, etc... but that alone is not enough to be successful in life. You need to broaden your experiences and learn about things that seem to have nothing to do with what you think you're interested in. It allows you to recognize new trends and opportunities. I guarantee this will come in handy some time down the line. I always think of the story that when Steve Jobs dropped out of college, he went and sat in on a calligraphy class. Why on earth would a geek need that? Well, years later when Apple was building the first Macintosh he was able to draw on that knowledge when they were figuring out how to support fonts (<a href=""http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html</a>). I experienced this in my own life. I wanted to be a biologist, so I really got into my science courses taking extra biology classes my senior year. On the side, I dabbled in various computer-related activities, but I always felt like that was taking away time from my important biology stuff that would eventually be my career. When I got to college the field of bioinformatics started to emerge, and I realized I could use my biology skills <i>with</i> my computer hobby. Suddenly, all that time I thought I had ""wasted"" playing around with computers became my career. You just never know what the future holds.<p>Finally (and this is major), speaking as a fellow (reformed) introvert: you have a huge, gaping problem to address. You need to be able to easily and freely communicate and socialize with people. This is not some warm, fuzzy BS. It's a real life skill you have got to master. It's hard. It's painful. It's embarrassing at times. But, you have to do it. In ""Hackers and Painters"", Paul always talks about having the wind at your back in startups. Mastering social skills is an awesome hack that gives you the ability to make your own wind. People who can really network and socialize get things other people don't. That's a fact of life. Many introverts complain that this isn't fair. I always did. The reality is, social interaction is a pretty easy hack to get what you want in life compared to most other methods. It's worth the time and effort required to build up the skill. If you're hopelessly clueless how to interact with people, you could start off by reading ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"".",1240941774.0

In the twelfth grade, I was 'homeschooled', I did a lot of independent study (AP English, AP Computer Science, Science-Fair, I attended the National Youth Leadership Forum on Technology), and I took three college courses every quarter. (Physics, Chemistry and Engineering).<p>It was an immensely challenging year, and I had a lot of free time to learn what I wanted, and work an interesting challenging job on the side.  When I applied for college, my parents wrote a letter saying what I did, and I had college transcripts to back it up.  In my state, if you take college classes as a high school student they call it 'Post Secondary Enrollment Options Program' and the taxpayers pick up the tab.<p>I also only spent three years in college for the same reason; I started feeling like I was wasting my time.  That may or may not have been true, at college I could have applied myself more and used more of the resources around me (most professors are professors because they are very good at what they do...learn from them, not necessarily from what they teach in class).<p>Some of it is probably you, and some of it could be the place/people you're around.  This is very hard to look at objectively.<p>People aren't unreceptive to high school and/or college dropouts.  People are unreceptive to slackers, and underacheivers.  Honestly for me it just doesn't come up much, unless people ask 'Where did you go to school?' and by then they've usually made up some sort of decision about what to think of me anyway.<p>Dropping out of school has not closed one opportunity to me.  At least not one opportunity that I would have pursued anyway (probably some big corporations have restrictions on that sort of thing).<p>What it comes down to is this:  Do what you want.  When your guidance counselors tell you ""If you had all the money you would ever need, what would you do?"" Don't mistake that to mean, 'after high school, after college, after this certain point in your career'.  That means ""right now, what are the steps that I need to take to make that happen"" and doing them.",1240941607.0

If the iPhone SDK offered this sort of feature then people who want it (like me) could have it, and people who are not interested (like you) could pass.<p>The only 'protection' you need from apps like this is the freedom to choose them or not as you like. Crippling the platform is not the answer.",1240941601.0
