I can only tell you the truth - it takes a long time for the pain to <i>subside</i>, but it never truly goes away. The only thing you can do is to talk with friends and family and to tell stories about your dad to keep his memory alive. It's been 13 years or so since then and recently I got married and we had our first kid. We ""adopted"" a very good family friend to be a surrogate grandmother to our son, not in replacement of my mom but just to fill the void.<p>I know this goes against the ethos of HN, but life is really not about software.

14,2113001,comment,2111671.0,2111671.0,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Hardly.<p>Apple could certainly avoid continuing to innovate and continuing to compete and get eaten by competitors (especially Android in the mobile space). However, there's still plenty of room at the top for Apple. The developing world is a huge, and growing market. And smartphones and similar devices are likely to be a huge business there for a variety of reasons.<p>Moreover, Apple is better poised than ever to compete against Microsoft on MS's own turf (business computing). Computing devices that take advantage of ubiquitous networking and heavily rely on managed applications (in the style of iOS) are almost certainly the wave of the future in enterprise computing. The era of ad-hoc application deployment is on the wane, managed applications will be a huge boon to enterprise IT, and to users as well. There is still a lot of work that needs to happen before that vision can be realized though, but Apple certainly has as much, if not more, of an opportunity there as anyone.<p>To a quick approximation I'd say that Apple could grow its revenue by a factor of maybe 5-10 in the near future without having to do much heavy lifting, merely by continuing to keep up (and occasionally get ahead) in what it's already doing (in phones, computers, and music). And it could grow by another factor of 2-10 in the near future (10-20 years-ish) if it made significant investments and pushed into new markets. They'll probably do the former, the latter is probably more unlikely.",1295290394

Getting more qualified people into the hiring pool can only help.<p>When I started off in CS, the introductory class was 60/40 (approximately the same as the school) at the start.  By the end it was 85/15 - women dropped it at a far higher rate then the men.  Why?

A guy who got a B or C would look at it as they we're doing well enough and work harder, a woman would be more likely to think that ""they"" were right and this field wasn't for them.<p>In high school, my guidance counselor told me not to bother applying to MIT, and if it wasn't for my parents standing up for me, I likely wouldn't have.

It's not the thick piles of snow that cause problems, plows take care of that.  It's the thin layers of slush, and the pools of water that refreeze into thin layers of ice.  The difference between the almost straight white driveway and the black driveway was dramatic enough in my case that I had to resort to going outside and busting up the ice by hand with a piece of rebar, several days after snowstorms.<p>Now, I'm fairly certain that using reflective surfaces on roofs of buildings in warm climates and using absorbing surfaces on roofs of buildings in cool climates has been standard practice for... decades?",1295287528

For several years Verizon network had minimal smart phone users, but after Android and iPhone usage ramps up they could have the same sorts of issues.<p>PS: I want to stick with AT&T because Verizon has shitty reception around around my parents house.

It's not just a design sense (like Ive), nor a good sense of what consumers really ""want."" And there are plenty of downsides to this unique gift. (We can all cite plenty of examples.)<p>I don't think we've seen that from anyone else, even at Apple, over the years, so there's no real replacement possible.<p>I think it's even spilled over to Pixar's success, which is pretty amazing.<p>(Maybe Alan Kay rivals it, in a different world.)",1295287347

Now its just scary to hear anything about them.  And i use it as a rulebook of how not to do youre infrastructure.  Im amazed facebook works at all frankly.  I also think its one of the ugliest sites ive ever used.  Its what 5 years old now and they still dont even have some basic functionality on it.
