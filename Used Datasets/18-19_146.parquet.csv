All went well for the first few years, but as we grew he was unable to move from the entrepreneurial role and let the organization grow. His micromanagement doomed an attempted expansion into a larger market and the company floundered because of it.<p>Getting a company off the ground takes very different skills than what is necessary for growing a management team and developing real business strategies. It’s kind of a catch-22 - you need the entrepreneur to get started, but once you get there he or she may not be the right person to get you to the next level.",1261594742.0

24,1012559,story,,,65,35,ryankshaw,Apple is terrified of iphone web-apps being as good as native apps,,"Last week we all had a very interesting investigation ( http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=997508 ) of how apple seems to have come up with a css/js/html5 framework called pastryKit to make really good ""native-looking"" web-apps on the iphone before they ever started with the whole app store idea. Some of us, like myself went and looked at it ( http://help.apple.com/iphone/3/mobile/ ) and then pulled it down and put it up on github so we can take a look at what they are doing and learn how we too could do some of the same  css transforms, transitions and ""flick"" scrolling like they do in their code.<p>Well, it looks like Apple is scared to death of that idea.  They want to make sure that the web-app experience on the iphone (except for their own help system) remains crippled and seemingly second class when you compare it to one of their native apps (even though their own help system shows the it <i>is</i> possible for it to be just as good).  It looks like they went straight to gitHub and forced them to take it down.  Here's the email I got from them.  Bummer!!<p>I'm writing to inform you that we have received a takedown notice from Apple regarding your repo, PastryKit.  We have made the repo and all forks private so that they are no longer publicly accessible.  If we do not receive a counter-notice from you within 10-14 days the repo will be deleted.<p>I would like to encourage you to read up on the DMCA takedown procedure and your rights here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act<p><pre><code>    Tekkub\n    GitHub Tech Support\n    http://support.github.com/\n    Join us on IRC: ",

It was a small project that engineers were just doing in their spare time. So that's one example. Facebook too from what I've read.

Both of these <i>small</i> projects grew into large projects, because of their success. What I'm trying to say is that you typically can't set out to create just a small project.<p>The nterface story was definitely just the next level of luck based co-founders. Although, we really did meet by chance. I probably should have gone into more detail that I did in fact hire Dave and Jason to design/program a small project that I was working on.

When you get an item from the queue it is temporarily hidden then once you've processed it successfully you explicitly delete the item from the queue. If the item is not deleted within the set timeout period then it goes back into the queue ready for another worker to have a go at. I assume RabbitMQ has something similar.<p>Actually I'm not sure why they used RanbitMQ rather than SQS for this task. SQS seems to me to be a perfect fit and there's no extra effort involved to set it up.,1261592950.0

What if, because of the deeply interconnected nature of Pandora, the Na'vi evolved to include the surrounding nature in their in-group?

The amount of ""developers"" out there who have no idea what they're doing is shocking. The dot-com implosion helped cut some of the excess weight, but there are still a lot of people working in software who have no excuse being there.",1261591383.0

It happens slowly, starting with the use of naturally occurring tools, like chimpanzees do with sticks, or certain octopi do with coconut shells.  Some birds use rocks as tools.<p>Tool use evolves up from there, but if we look at our own species as an example, it probably doesn't ever really stop.<p>The Na'vi are probably more like echoes of human beings at an earlier point in our evolution, with the added property of having an intrinsic physical link to the environment around them.  If the ecosystem ties directly into your CNS, you're going to think real hard before engaging in widespread destructive behavior, because you know first-hand how painful the damage is.  So things like mining, which gave humans metal, would take the Na'vi longer, because they'd want to find a way to do it that won't cause them a ton of pain.<p>But they'd get there, and since Cameron is talking about sequels, the next installment may very likely show how contact with humans has pushed the Na'vi on to a more rapid path of technological development.<p>And your post really doesn't deserve to be downvoted, so it got a +1 from me.  Come on, we're discussing the science fiction in a movie. :)",1261591267.0

All in all I'd rather have a conservative dem than a liberal republican -- at least a conservative dem will contribute to the Democrats having control over committees and procedure.<p>But what I really want -- and what I think this country needs -- is a progressive.
