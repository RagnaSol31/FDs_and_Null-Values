Two, rice is a pretty heavily refined food, and white rice especially has been stripped of most of its nutritional value (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_rice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_rice</a>).<p>From the perspective of spending minimal time, I suggest the unintuitive solution of learning to use slow cooking techniques. Most slow-cooked food is fire-and-forget: quickly prepare the ingredients, start the heat source, and get back to your hacking. Three hours later, you have several dinners' worth of excellent food.<p>Example: A simple beef stew takes about twenty minutes to prepare. Chop up about 1.5 lbs of beef into small pieces, dice one onion, mix with 1.5 lbs of unpeeled (but properly washed and scrubbed) fingerling potatoes cut in halves. Mix with salt and some water in an enameled cast iron 5-quart Dutch oven. Put in a 375-F oven. Return in three hours. You now have about three days worth of dinners. Improvise with spices as you see fit.",1246301966.0

13,679458,comment,678975.0,679279.0,0,0,10ren,,,"I'm guessing; hopefully my betters will correct me.<p>A <i>homomorphism</i> is a mapping which preserves the structure of the original, where <i>structure</i> means the relationship between different parts. For example, <i>x + y = z</i> is a relationship between integers, that is preserved by <i>map(i) = -i</i>.  For instance, <i>2 + 3 = 5</i>, and <i>-2 + -3 = -5</i>.<p>BTW: the more common term <i>isomorphism</i> is a special case of homomorphism, in which you can always do the reverse mapping (technically, an isomorphism is a <i>bijective homomorphism</i>). Because it seems pointless to encrypt something if you can't decrypt it, I think the homomorphism in the article is actually an isomorphism. I think they <i>say</i> ""homomorphism"" because that is the specific aspect of the breakthrough.<p>Now, it seems that if you encrypt something in a way that preserves structure, it's not going to be very good encryption! Really excellent encryption seems more likely to look like a one-time pad. A one-time pad is when you have a book of unique random numbers, and you encrypt the message by using the message as an index into the book. For example, you can convert the string ""hello world"" into a number, and use that number as an index into the (very long) book, to find what unique number it refers to. You can then send that unique number to someone else who has the same book - they look it up backwards and get your message out. The encrypted message has no structural relationship to the unencrypted message. This is just one example of absence of structural relationship.<p>What these researchers claim is a way to encrypt a message in an effective way, which also preserves structure. Seems impossible, doesn't it?<p>OK, so what's the point? If you have preserved structure, then you can use tools that analyze structure, such as spam filtering. I tend to think that having the information about whether a message matches spam or not gives you an awful lot of information about the message... counter to the goal of encryption. So I'm withholding judgment... but I suspect that if they have solved this problem, they have done it partly by redefining the nature of the problem in a clever way.",1246301369.0

First of all Erlang has for instance here [1] proven to be viable for HPC. Erlang is useful mostly for high scalability problems e.g. Clusters etc.<p>The authors claim that their pthread implementation scales better than Erlang. This is most confusing as I suspect them to have made design errors in their Erlang system. They wrote they ""ported"" it. Erlang is a SSA based FP lanugage specifically designed for soft real-timeness and scaling out of the box. There are even works currently to get it running under hard realtime constraints [2]. While this is not exactly targeting high performance it is still important to point that out. If performance is so crucial a fortran based implementation might be better probably.<p>Thirdly, I suspect that the portation of their system doesn't take care of language pitfalls like proper tail recursion etc. which would explain the problem in scaling.\n(See page 1 section 3)<p>Other thoughts in bullet version:<p>- Pseudocode is iterative style, Erlang is a FP<p>- ""variance was negligible"" -> Error bars in Graphs would tell us that.<p>- Point 6.1 actually gives me the impression that a implementation in C++ would be preferrable compared to Erlang due to the emphasis on performance<p>- I think the memory issue on the last page is the key why erlang performed so badly...

And one does not need to wait to have irrefutable evidence to start acting.<p>People build computer models to simulate the weather. The physics is not the problem. The initial conditions and the assumptions are the problem. The atmosphere is vast. We can measure temperature and other stuff mostly at the Earth's surface. Some people are now building UAVs to fly around and collect measurements which will be used to increase the accuracy of the climate models. One problem: the climate is a chaotic system, i.e., it's highly sensitive to disturbances on initial conditions. Another problem: the models neglect the biosphere. Most carbon is in the biosphere, not in the atmosphere. Computer model says temperatures are going to increase 9 degrees Celsius. People panic. Wait. Does anyone know how to model the dynamics of the biosphere?! Short answer: no. It's a complicated problem. You can forecast CO2 emissions from industry, but no one has a clue how the biosphere will react to abrupt temperature variations.<p>One caveat: there are cycles. The Sun has cycles. The Earth also has cycles. The temperature in the middle ages was known to be a few degrees higher. Was it also due to CO2 emissions from the industry? Definitely not.<p>There was a time when there was no ice on the Arctic. There was also a time when most coastal areas we have today were underwater. There's no reason why that can't happen again, for sure.<p>An important issue: what does ""global warming"" even mean? Are the minimum / median / average / maximum temperatures increasing? Or is the variance increasing? Does this happen everywhere. What I read was that the cold, high-latitude regions were getting ""warmer"" (whatever that means), while the tropical regions were pretty much the same. This is too much complexity to be sold to the masses. The masses want entertainment, not information.<p>OK, suppose that temperature will increase by 9 degrees or so. Sea levels will rise and threaten us all. The U.S. can try to regulate emissions to counter this, but will the Chinese do the same? This is Game Theory 101. Moreover, what will people in the U.S. and Europe say:<p>""Sorry you Chinese, Indians and Brazilians. We destroyed the planet, and now we won't allow you to develop because of that. If you want to keep your houses warm in the winter and power your industry, we will accuse you of treason.""<p>Last but not least: is regulation the best solution? What is the problem with global warming exactly? Rising sea levels? Increased CO2 concentration is good for the plants because they grow faster. I say, build a pipeline from the Arctic to the Sahara to pump fresh water into local agriculture. If the Israelis can grow tomatoes in the Negev desert, I don't see why the North Africans can't do the same.<p>The problem with regulation is that it won't work on a global scale. A politician would rather compromise the planet than tell his own people that they have to starve and freeze to reduce emissions. This is much more than capitalist greed. This is about human rights: people should have the right to consume energy to increase their standard of living.<p>Science is one thing. Policy is another. Let us keep them separate. Studying the climate should be decoupled from politics as much as possible.",1246299913.0

Tor is low-latency and not a mix[3], so packet size & timing data can be correlated to determine whether two hostile nodes are on the same tunnel. You-H-N-H-Dest, where H are hostile nodes and N a neutral node. The one beside You is a guard node, and can determine its status as such by observing how often you connect to it (your node connects to only a small group of guard nodes). The second H is the exit node, and knows what the Destination is. A simple timing attack plus the mutual connection to N links your ip to the destination. There are 1800 tor nodes[4], I'll let you do the math on how long it would take an adversary with a very modest budget (or 20 zombies) to land two hostile nodes in this configuration. It's not very long, given that your 3 outbound tunnels reconstruct every 10 minutes.</i><p>You're right on this.  I knew about timing attacks, but I didn't know they were so easy.  I though you needed a big infrastructure like Echelon.<p>I think a solution for Iranians would be using I2P or Freenet, or even Tor if it's just with .onion websites, because then the traffic never leaves the darknet and therefore it's more resistant to a timing attack (You might need something like Echelon for a timing attack in this case).

I eat mostly 'plant-based whole foods', in the words of Joi Ito.<p>At the same time, it's nice to be able to eat a variety of foods. Some people who are vegans primarily for ethical reasons rather than health or taste reasons may miss meat and/or cheese a lot (especially in the early stages). In this case, these products provide a substitute for the foods that they may remember and enjoy but no longer choose to eat.",1246298630.0

Imagine if the united states banned all foreign grown lemons but allowed in all foreign grown avocados.  Well, you could say that by removing all tarrifs from avocados, we've increased free trade.  But you can bet that any farm outside the US hoping to access our market that can shift production to avocados will do so, and any farm in the us that can shift to lemons will do so as well.<p>This is what we've done to engineering.  If you make it easy to come to the US as a programmer, but not as a lawyer, you distort the market.  You should absolutely expect this to deter americans from engineering and encourage them to go into law.",1246298540.0
