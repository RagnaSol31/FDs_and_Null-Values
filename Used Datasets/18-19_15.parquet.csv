8,122590,comment,122207.0,122331.0,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> Breaking up things with naps is actually highly effective.<p>I disagree.  Naps are inefficient.  By breaking sleep up into more blocks you multiply the time you waste trying to fall asleep, shaking off ""just woke up"" grogginess, changing clothing, getting to and from bed, etc.  Batching tasks is almost always more efficient.  Grocery shopping every few weeks is much more efficient than going twice a week, for example.<p>I did some shift work for a while so I speak from experience.  I would get about five hours of sleep before waking at 4:15am, and then take another hour or two of sleep in mid afternoon when I got home.  I adapted comfortably to this and didn't mind it too much.  But it did absolutely nothing for productivity or alertness.  All it meant was more time spent changing in and out of PJs and lying in bed falling asleep.  It also constrained the flexibility of my schedule because skipping the nap did a number on me.<p>Are people in siesta countries notably more productive than regular night sleep countries?  I think evidence indicates the opposite.  This whole ""hacking sleep"" thing is a red herring.",1203878753

11,122586,comment,122106.0,122487.0,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"If the article at the top of the thread is atypical of a tenured professor, <i>this</i> post is absolutely typical. I've heard this speech a million times. If you ever need to hear it again, ask any professor to give it to you and they'll happily oblige.<p>Undoubtedly, most tenured professors are having an ""absolute blast"". Why shouldn't they be? They are the end product of a rigorous system of selection for their particular set of personality traits. If you're not the kind of person who adores being a researcher to the exclusion of all other thoughts -- if you are not either a truly <i>diehard</i> optimist, or the most stubborn person you'll ever know -- you won't make it to where this guy is.<p>The career advice here is good, solid advice, as far as it goes. But the parody of this would be fun to write, and might contain equal amounts of truth. (""(2) Iterate until you find a group that looks excellent, or until you discover that all the excellent groups have a waiting list, at which point you need to either quit grad school, apply for a personal fellowship and win it, or work for whoever has the grant money to pay you."")<p>No time for extensive parody today, though -- besides, the guy at <i>Piled Higher and Deeper</i> has covered that ground better than I ever could -- so I'll leave you with this caveat: Very, very few of the people you interview with in a research group will ever tell you that your academic career is a waste of time and that you should just leave, even if it's true. They've got a very strong incentive to recruit you, so that you can apply your inexpensive intelligence and energy to their projects. They've got an incentive to be careful what they say to you, because if word gets back to their colleagues that they are discouraging prospective students it might derail their careers. They also have an even bigger incentive to keep fooling themselves.<p>And, you know, academic scientists really don't like pain. They're not drill sergeants. Taking starry-eyed optimists, most of whom remind you of yourself, and kicking them in the chest is not a lot of fun. It's for their own good, but it feels like euthanizing puppies. It's just so much easier to encourage them to follow the same path that you did, and to let time and nature and bureaucracy take care of teaching them the harsh realities of life.",1203878183

15,122582,comment,122412.0,122412.0,0,0,webwright,,,"Totally depends on the startup.  What's the core problem of your solution?  If it's technical, you need hackers.  If it's user-experience (""we'll make a better solution because the current solutions are clunky!""), you need a UX god.  If it's a sales/distribution twist, then you need a smart sales/biz guy.<p>There are certainly scenarios where a non-hacker will be valuable.  But for 90% of the startups I see on HN (and elsewhere), someone who is not a ""builder"" (code, design, copywriting) is a non-critical element for the first phase of a company.<p><i>IF</i> something starts to take off, that can change.  Google hired Eric Schmidt, and I hear that Mark Zuckerburg wants a biz CEO.  But until it starts to take off (which is the hard part), a non-builder is non-critical.  Not useless, mind you-- just less valuable than the alternative.  Better than nothing, though!<p>Oh, and saying that Steve Jobs is a non-hacker is ridiculous. He certainly evolved into something else, but the guy started out going to homebrew computer clubs, working as a technician at Atari, and attending after school lectures at HP.",1203877630

It seems to me that it's less important which specific technologies you take classes in (for the most part) than determining which level you you like to work on.  I think of it similar to programming languages: some people prefer ""high-level"" work, like application / UI design, or multimedia or image processing.  ""Low level"" courses are going to be more about systems design, working with distributed / embedded systems, etc.  It gets easier to choose once you've made that distinction.<p>You're asking about  grad courses, so which CS classes have you already taken?",1203877341

I still make snap judgements but I prefer to form an impression of a person over time - interesting until proven boring and even then, as the filmmaker Pedro Almodavar said - 'it's our little quirks that make us human'. And to quote Neo in the Matrix, 'one does not truly know someone until they fight them' - you're not fighting someone until (hopefully) you have an established relationship. First impressions are overrated and I think they can be countered with better n++ impressions.
