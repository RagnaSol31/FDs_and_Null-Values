One year later we scuttled the whole office and started everything from scratch. Everything they produced was garbage. Can you find talented people in India? YES. But it will cost you so much there is no point.<p>There is <i>no</i> sense of company loyalty. There is <i>no</i> sense of how to work independently without being told what to do. Status is defined as 1) how many people work under you, and 2) how many servants you have. If another company offers to give them 5 junior programmers (""freshers"") to work under them instead of 4 you can kiss them goodbye. Oh, and never take their word about anything. You need to review the code on a daily basis to make sure something is actually getting done. Not to mention, while they will tell you otherwise, java and .net is the only thing they give a rip about, maybe a little php.<p>A startup is an inherently creative process. It would be like Bono outsourcing a new album-- then finding out they only play sitar. He would spend TONS of time documenting everything about how he wants it to sound and telling them in detail exactly how it should work. If he is <i>lucky</i> they will get 75% there. Creative processes just don't work like that.<p>Large bureaucratic organizations can squeeze the cost savings out of outsourcing, but for a startup it's just asinine. The only exception is VERY rote tasks. Basically just data mining. Send them a link to a website that you want mined and they will do it pretty cheap. Now, you could probably write a script to do it in about the same time, but in some cases it's easier just to give it to them.<p>Now that I think about it, the reason I left to do a startup was because I wanted to get away from people who get a big chubby over Thomas Friedman but don't have a damn clue about software development.<p>I've had much more luck and a hell of a lot more fun traipsing around Guangdong and dabbling in manufacturing.",1247597160

That person at the terminal isn't using code, they're using a program. Once you start talking about the rights to inspect and modify software, you've left those people behind, so they aren't the users who are concerned with those rights.</i><p>This is a common refrain when criticizing the GPL -- that users are hopelessly ignorant, and incapable of even the most basic modifications to the software they use. ""Why even bother giving them the source? They'll never be able to use it anyway"".<p>There are several issues with this criticism. Ignoring for now the set of end users with the technical ability to modify and compile the source code on their own, lets assume a non-technical user wants to make a change to the software on their system. The software is licensed under the terms of the GPL, so the source is available. This user has several options:<p>1. Buy some books, attend classes, and learn enough about software engineering to modify it themselves. Not an attractive option, obviously, but it's available as a fundamental baseline. This is only available to users with plenty of free time.<p>2. Ask somebody, either in the online or local community, to make the change and provide the updated version. This is the purpose of ""bug trackers"", a popular fixture on most websites for free software. Unreliable for complex features or specialized use cases, but for issues common to everybody (""software crashes when this button is double-clicked"") it can be effective.<p>3. Hire a contractor to modify the software. Possibly expensive, depending on what language the software is written in and what changes are being made, but likely within the budget of even small businesses for most reasonable cases.<p>Now, lets compare it with the case of a non-technical user with a BSD-licensed binary on their system. The source code might not be available, because the BSD license does not require distribution of corresponding source, and there may be legal restrictions on whether the user is allowed to inspect or modify the software.<p>1. The first option, ""do it yourself"", is made more difficult because the set of required skills will be larger. Assuming for now that the software was given to the user under the BSD license (ie, no additional restrictions), they still face the challenge of reverse-engineering and modifying the binary. This requires a more specialized skill-set than modifying (for example) Python or Java code. It can be done -- I know a dentist who hex-edited his practice management software to change some poorly-worded tooltips which were confusing his staff -- but will certainly be more difficult than modifying the source.<p>2. Since the source code for some version of the software is probably on the internet, somewhere, the user can attempt to find it. This source might not correspond to the version on the user's system -- perhaps there are missing features, or incompatibilities between versions. In the best case -- source is the same version, everything works -- there was no advantage to the user over GPL'd software. In the worst case, the source is useless and the user must revert to editing the binary.<p>3. Asking the distributor to make changes to the software is possible, but unlikely to succeed unless the change is likely to result in additional revenue to the distributor.<p>4. Hiring a contractor will be much the same as in the GPL'd case, assuming no additional restrictions have been applied. However, as in the first case, editing of a compiled file without the corresponding source will be difficult and time-consuming. The price of hiring a sufficiently skilled contractor will be tremendous.",1247596412
