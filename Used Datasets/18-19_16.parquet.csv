What distinguishes the two - what is the defining characteristic of a web app? (One comes on a CD, one is downloaded - no) (One is written in C++, one is written in a vm-hosted language - no).<p>Is it just that you use HTML/JS to write the app?",1220813899

Maybe that would be plausible if we found very efficient AI implementations, but the initial attempts of actually doing it at will undoubtedly be quite inefficient. And the slowness of feedback is a huge factor in coding, as well....",1220813613

It was hard to get scRUBYt to learn the ""correct"" rules.  It tends to be over-specific or over-broad.<p>2. It was slow.  Really slow.  Using Ruby Mechanize was at least 2-3x faster, and even that was pretty slow.<p>3.

But even if the abacus wielder followed the commands exactly and emulated the x86 instructions with paper and pencil, would anything actually emerge from the exercise that would be enlightening in anyway?<p>Probably not, since it would take a few thousand years (I'm handwaving here) to compute the contents of the first frame.",1220812812

Now, since some human beings seem to be smarter than others, I think it's possible to build a machine that is closer to the ""smart"" end. And, of course, with the help of such machines, we will be able to do this better and better (as with knowledge and technology in general). Therefore, we could build many Einstein-level intelligences (or a bit better, since he wasn't perfect).<p>Behind this, my key point is that ""more intelligence"" is an illusion. Einstein was a function of his times (there was the unexplained lack of motion through the ether, for one thing) and, like Newton, saw further than most because he SOTSOG. He wasn't fundamentally smarter than you - though he might have been able to keep track of more ideas than you, and track their relations to other ideas, and he might have been more free of convention (the humility to admit he didn't know, and the arrogance that you don't either), and more dedicated than you. Ie. he was probably smart<i>er</i>, but not fundamentally.<p>Being able to accept that you don't know, and therefore to be open to <i>see</i>, is the important thing. Not intelligence.",1220812303

What's missing knowing how to do it (software inventions).<p>But it's true that faster hardware can open our eyes: (decades ago) the inventor of a new way to use silicon to make CPU's faster said that once the extra silicon was available, the solution was obvious to him.
