2,116001,comment,115800.0,115891.0,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"Good idea, but how about instead of posts costing you karma, spam costs you karma.  Then if your karma goes negative, you cannot post until it becomes positive again.  That way it doesn't penalize new users with low karma, but it will only take two bad posts to render a spam account ineffective.",1203015371

6,115996,comment,114846.0,114846.0,0,0,oditogre,,,"Varies by how long I've been awake.  5 - 6 hours on weeknights.  8 - 9 on weekends (but the entire 'day' - from time I woke up on Friday to time I wake up on Saturday, for instance - will be longer than 24hrs total).  I can get by on 4 or 9, but usually less than 5 for 2 days in a row or more than 9 under any conditions and I feel like hell all day.  When I have extended periods (more than 5 or 6 days) where I have no particular reason to get up at a certain time, I fall into a sleeping pattern essentially the same as the '28 hour day / 6 day week'.  My sleeping habits have been about the same since puberty, and my mom's are about the same as mine (my dad sleeps about 9hrs a night).",1203015192
