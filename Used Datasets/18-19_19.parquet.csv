9,120603,comment,120550.0,120596.0,0,0,dskhatri,,,"Aha.. cool.. I see the map now! \nAnother suggestion: Coordinatr would be a great app if all my friends were regular users. However, I am guessing that a lot of people would rather use their regular scheduling tools (Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar) to keep track of events. Those calendars don't have as rich a feature-set as coordinatr but are still the first point of schedule tracking. Anyway, my point is: coordinatr can really set itself apart by somehow integrating with these calendar systems (something like how xobni attaches itself to Outlook, but something simpler)!",1203619758

Why is everyone copying what I think I first saw on Draftmix?<p>It's not easy for people to read sideways.<p>Put it at the top or bottom of the page so users don't have to cock their head to one side.

17,120595,comment,120478.0,120478.0,0,0,mixmax,,,"This sounds very right to me.<p>Some years ago I had a business doing techno raves and I hardly made any money from it. (lots of beers and girls though) Then I started doing boring stuff, and I realised something important:<p>The more interesting or cool a niche is, the more people will flock to fill it. Which results in lower income for each business owner. Just look at artists, musicians and DJ's. Lots of girls, fun and beer. But on average, not a lot of money.<p>On the contrary I know people that are in the furniture moving business that make insane amounts of money. Why? Because it is a shitty business and nobody wants to do it.<p>Basically it's about supply and demand - the more people that want to pursue a career in a given niche the less the average businessowner will make in that niche.<p>So you should all stop doing ultracool social network apps and start doing boring ERP systems. If you want to make money that is. ;-)",1203618862
18,120594,comment,120550.0,120569.0,0,0,tim2,,,Whether Front-loading or end-loading registration requirements is more successful seems to hinge on which is greater: (1) the user's expectations coming into the site (2) how great the user finds the site once he's using it.<p>If your site has a low value when the user signs up but this value builds as he uses it more (eg. networking sites) then you're probably better off front-loading the registration requirement. My experience.,1203618839

23,120589,comment,120550.0,120550.0,0,0,dskhatri,,,Kudos for the nice simple styling and layout! A few minor points:<p>- would be great to highlight today's date in the calendar<p>- I don't know about the general populus but I never allow any site to import my gmail/yahoo contacts. The address book also links to plaxo. Can't you implement an import yourself?<p>- would be great to add a google map widget,1203618575
