While it has a good community to encourage you and cheer you on, there isn't a sense of urgency to do things nor an easy way to share with people where to go about doing it.<p>Mobtropolis can geolocate photos and scenes, so once someone has done something and posted it, you can see where most people have done it.

13,109215,comment,109155.0,109170.0,0,0,NoBSWebDesign,,,"Of course the obvious solution here is to sort them differently. You don't have to reject anything. Just sort the front page by popularity instead of ""hotness"" and give a link to recently popular. (on a side note, picking someone else's nose is listed 3 different times in the first two pages with the same photo). Or, you could make the top of the page a ""Most Popular of All Time"" box and the start listing the ""hot"" ones under that.<p>Your first thought may be that many of the social news sites sort by recent activity by default. And this is true, but they also have users that check back several times a day. Your site, while interesting and promising, probably will not have that kind of user. Maybe once a week or even once a day.<p>Or another possibility is what I did on my site (ratemystudentrental.com). Sort by what is most useful to first time visitors, but then once the user logs in, make the home page sort by recent activity.<p>Also, while I do think this is a pretty cool idea, I have two other criticisms.<p>1) The design leaves much to be desired. I thought I had been redirected to some static placeholder page, or maybe some subdomain of your blog when I first clicked the link. This is also partially due to the fact that your homepage redirects to mobtropolis.com/scenes/hot, instead of just giving me mobtropolis.com.<p>2) This would be way more freakin' sweet if it integrated with Facebook. You could have an app that pull my ""adventure/dare"" pictures into my Facebook profile. You could also allow users to determine the difficulty of each challenge and give awards to users who compile the most difficulty/popularity points by proving they've accomplished those challenges with photos.",1202150014

Of course the experience of using C++ is different than using C++ with knives, that's trivial, and I'm not saying that they are the same language or environment. My point is: the original argument makes the same trick, by making a modification to the language / environment that makes it very unusable... my extension of the argument to blood and knives it's just a way to show that the original argument is using exaggeration.<p>Everything else equal, the shorter program wins.

[1]<p><i>Life experiences</i> is a fuzzy and abstract phrase -- ""challenges"" or ""unusual experiences"" would be better, and a specific mental image like ""strange foods"" or ""something you've never done before"" would be better still.  <i>Document</i> is an abstract phrase -- what you really want to say is ""describe"" or ""photograph"".<p>The help page... is not much help, I'm afraid:<p>""Mobtropolis is a tool to find, map, and share interesting experiences in the local world around you through peer pressure and simple game mechanics.""<p><i>Peer pressure</i> and <i>game mechanics</i>?
