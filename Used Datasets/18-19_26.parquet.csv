There are things neighborhoods talk about and things they don't.  How do you bubble up the things they talk about?  How do neighbors engage each other in discussion on local topics.  That's what we're working on.,1216753173

Among people who use them, I suspect that the next major predictor of success would be adaptability. Confirmation bias is the opposing force: once we form a model, we are biased towards it, and tend to overlook contradictory evidence.<p>One tactic that increases adaptability is not forming a model until you actually have to; this avoids confirmation bias.<p>You're also right about the nature of the test: as an experiment, it does show that presence of generative models predicts success.
