If you want to hear about the launch, give us your email address"".  Measure how many of your free customers sign up for that.\n4) Look at the resultant list for interesting email addresses and send a personal email to some of them asking them if they'd want to dive in as pilot customers and help shape the product.<p>",
5,192827,comment,192595.0,192663.0,0,0,DenisM,,,"When comparing ""access to the world's information in one click"" to ""lefora.com is forums made easy—it's like blogger for forums"" you're confusing the mission statement with the value prop. Value prop answers ""what's the practical use right now? What problem does it solve for me?"". Mission statement is ""where do you take it next? what's the pattern to your actions?"".<p>Your users wouldn't care for your mission statement nearly as much you yourself or your investors should. The press, well those might be either way - depending on who is their target readership.<p>One important exception to the rule is if your mission is touchy-feely, like ""our new GM seeds are solving world hunger, one seed at a time"" (for a GM research lab). That would make good press for any newspaper.",1211050009.0

That somewhat qualifies as a thorough distraction. But then you say something like you find yourself return with greater competence [1]. From experience, have you found a good strategy?

(Ok, there's Google, but that's not the good-old footnoted style.) Next, a bunch of fairly obvious things (TV is a time sink, so are other forms of distractions, and distractions prevent you from doing work!), then a submarine (plug for a personal investment).<p>The ""solution"" of separating out a work machine isn't particularly insightful either. I've done this before and I bet many others have also, and its efficacy depends highly on the person. (interestingly, I would guess that those who are very good at focusing wouldn't have to employ as many tactics to prevent their distraction).<p>Indeed, this wasn't the peer-reviewed kind of essay that normally gets linked here, but probably an inspirational thought-stream writing. Pardon my lack of tact, but given the ever-warm feedback to all pg essays alike, this one was, frankly, comparatively bland.",1211048918.0

Whenever a message is sent to a recipient that has never received a message from that account before, modify the message to include a link at the top that the recipient can click on if the message is spam.<p>--This is probably something workable, but then it needs a certain proactive work from users which I think people who don't clear their inboxes don't do normally.<p>2. Limit the number of new recipients that can receive email from that account to a few dozen a day.<p>--nope, won't work. What about jobseekers who spam employers. As much as this is spam, there are diamonds in the rough.<p>3. If the number of spam reports from that account exceeds a certain threshold, shut the account down.<p>--workable. but what if the user's computer is spambotted? not everyone is an expert. probably a few days warning before a shutdown is a workable solution here. again, it'd be better if the server informs the user of spam flagging and intercept outgoing messages until they agree to a TOS.

If she doesn't see programming as a career, then it's possible that the field is incorrectly portrayed in higher ed.  If I were to describe what a programming career looks like, it would go something like this:<p>You solve interesting, hard problems every day, and not just ""math"" problems.  You solve communication issues, design issues, and you learn a hell of a lot about the way other businesses operate.<p>You get a flexible work schedule, not a 9-5 hell (unless you <i>choose</i> corporate life).  For women, this can be especially helpful.  As a woman who kept working through the whole family starting phase, I can tell you that almost no other career will allow you such freedom in working hours.  Get in at 8, go home at 3 to pick up the kid, code from home 8pm-12am after the child goes to bed.  Hours in the office matter less than the quality and size of your contribution.  I can't imagine being a single mom with rigid work hours; I'm being judged on what I produce, rather than how warm my office chair is.<p>You have so many avenues in programming to start your own business, be it a consulting shop, or a start-up business.  Build a webbapp, a desktop app, or help others do that.<p>Here's my favorite: your programming skills apply to EVERY industry, interest, or hobby.  No matter what you love the most, there is a way to use programming to further that thing, streamline that thing, advance that thing.  Try to find an exception.<p>So how interesting is a programming job?  How convenient?  How suited to women?  I say: A Whole Fucking Lot.",1211048818.0

22,192808,comment,192659.0,192788.0,0,0,simonw,,,I'd be a bit scared of using Erlang for crawling since the actual text processing capabilities of the language are pretty weak.

Videos are a good way to mix it up and maybe attract people that don't like reading blog.
