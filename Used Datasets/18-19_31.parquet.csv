2,677062,comment,676770.0,676988.0,0,0,mediaman,,,"Labor is actually a substantial part of airlines' expenses.<p>Southwest's most recent SEC filing indicates that its 35,000 employees represent 32% of its total operating costs, or about $3.4bn. These employees served about 101.9 million passengers. [1] That's about 2,911 passengers per employee, or $33 of labor cost per passenger.<p>A traditional airline such as American Air, with 70,900 employees, has labor costs of $5.9bn, serving just 98 million passengers [2], which is 1,382 passengers per employee or $60 labor cost per passenger. So costs per passenger are almost 2X.<p>That makes me question the data in this chart. The only two data points related to labor are crew costs (3% of savings) and administration (2%). But actual labor costs appear to be a much more substantial part of the savings.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000119312509015591/d10k.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000119312509015...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4515/000000451509000008/aa120810k.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4515/0000004515090000...</a>",1246128893.0

It's sad that the merchant eats at least 1.5%, but it's not my problem (although I will offer greenbacks to small business owners).  We've never carried a balance, and the credit card companies haven't done much scamming for fees.  I guess we're seen as more powerful than someone who needs a credit line, so they know that even a little bit of gaming will cause us to cancel the account.<p>Interestingly, Revolution revoked our card.  I'd used it exactly once when Buy.com was offering $50 off a purchase for signing up.
