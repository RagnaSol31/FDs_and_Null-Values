4,285337,comment,284678.0,285225.0,0,0,etal,,,"Pretty good. C is unmagical, but that doesn't keep developers from adding their own special magic...<p>Reading Guy Steele's late-1990s defenses of Java, and observing how C and C++ actually are used in industry -- yeah, I actually am happy that Sun managed to bring Joe Application Programmer about halfway to Lisp. In general, magic features like built-in garbage collection and all the basic collections in the standard library are a Good Thing. The main problem I see is that C is designed for systems programming, where everything really should be explicit, while most of the code that actually gets written belongs at a much higher abstraction level. Still, even in higher-level languages there are edge cases that make much more sense if you understand how the situation looks from the level of C -- for example, performance profiles.<p>(At the self-deprecating C shop where I worked last, I was the one deleting macros, wrapping lower-level code with Swig, and pushing Python and shell scripts for new code. We used glib, too -- which removes 10% of the pain while demonstrating ever more clearly that C should not be the primary language for big userland applications.)",1219604017

It was an Open Source based business, and a big part of its appeal was the fact that a well-known developer on the project was the one supporting the systems and software.<p>Selling it would have taken more time for a questionable payout.

I grew up on Visual Basic 6 and Perl, and finally I hit puberty and decided to learn C. But it was like nothing. I found the the syntax familiar, the language powerful, and even having more features than Visual Basic. The modularity makes so much sense, allocating and deallocating memory has a strange familiarity, and when you get nice data structures and pointers, the algorithms than unveil themselves are simply beautiful. Operating System API as simple C function calls feels wonderful.<p>The only thing that tripped me up for a while was pointer syntax, but that wasn't a problem after I realized that * simply means ""dereference"". Segfaults suck, but then again you can just printf() something right before and after a suspicious block to see where the problem lies.<p>Finally, what I'm getting at here, is that I'm not sure if I can say I ""know C"" or not. I've written several apps, including a RPG/style game engine and a chess AI. But essentially, there was <i>no</i> learning curve. It just makes it really hard to judge my skill level.<p>Also, I would like to note that C is a great programming language. Did I mention I like C?<p>I apologize for that incoherent post.
