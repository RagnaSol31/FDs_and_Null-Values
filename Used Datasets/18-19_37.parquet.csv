The simplicity of the system makes it easy for anyone to get started, hence the popularity.<p>There is also the bit about taking an existing UI (written in HTML) and being able to insert programming hooks into it at will.

6,439518,comment,439298.0,439298.0,0,0,cdibona,,,"So: working for a large company is different than working for a small company. I started at G when it was ~2k people and now we're at ~20k people. I've worked for very small companies and much larger companies than Google and I have to say that Google is a great place to work, when comparing to both and is probably the best large organization for a real , cs focused, software engineer to work for. If you love algorithms, scaling problems and the rest, you are likely to find a group where you can be pretty happy, intellectually speaking. But, if you aren't into that kind of thing, it may not be the place for you.<p>As long as I've been there, Google has been about 1/2 engineer and 1/2 everyone else. That's very atypical for large technical organizations, where if you have 25% engineering you'd feel pretty lucky. This also means that sometimes there is a 'engineers and everyone else' sort of thing going on. This is reflected in the exit stories, as are the very real problems that face globally distributed engineering organizations.<p>I find myself wanting to make excuses for some of the complaints mentioned in the article, but it really comes down to not every company matching every engineer, and if you have a large engineering org, you'll have some people who don't fit the org (the short story writer), and some people treated lamentably or regrettably by thier co-workers or managers.<p>A side note: the hiring process is much better than when I started. I've been sitting on hiring committees for 4 years now, and it is much more efficient than when I interviewed. I was interviewing for an odd position though, so it was even more extreme in my case (for both good and bad). I interviewed with 13 people and was given an offer within a few weeks. but back then a typical interviewer would have 8+ interviews, now we almost never go over 6.<p>That said, hiring is a dark art. I don't pretend to have an answer for that.",1232304655.0

What you say pretty much sums it up.<p>Google is just so used to being the hot cool shit and they haven't been large enough for long enough to realize that simply isn't true any more. Don't get me wrong, they are both incredible places to work, but Google needs to adjust to their new count and composition of employees.<p>Luckily, the original article is just one of many bits of proof that Google is aware of problems and is working to resolve them. Microsoft would never show this level of transparency for (the obviously justified) fear of these sorts of forum posts leaking.",1232304653.0

If any European country (or the US) had been on the receiving end of the Hamas rocket attacks, Gaza and the surrounding areas would have been smoking piles of rubble years ago.  And yes, Israel has the capability.<p>As to Israel's sins, they pale in comparison and they don't have a history of doing everything that they can to wipe out the Palestinians, something that is within their power.  Meanwhile, Hamas' ""kill all Jews"" charter appears to be representative.<p>Interestingly enough, it's not just Jews.  The reason why Arab countries don't allow significant numbers of political Palestinians has nothing to do with Israel.<p>The ""plight of the Palestinians"" is almost entirely self-inflicted.  Israel was able to ""make the desert bloom"" without local help so it's absurd to claim that Israel is keeping the Palestinians down.",1232303605.0

When karma was implemented at /. we used to expose the number, but then the number became why people did things on /.
