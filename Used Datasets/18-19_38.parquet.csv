It allows you to make it look in-house enough, but it still looks slinkset-y.  It's good when you're an implementer of technologies rather than a programmer of them.<p>Beyond that, these types of sites only work when you have enough members.  Have a community of 25 and it's not going to work well.  But often your boss/customer might demand it anyway because it's the cool new thing.<p>Beyond that, it's a hosted service that hasn't defined a revenue model.  Most likely that means that at some point in the future, it's going to get worse for you (cost you money, have ads, etc.).  So, I wouldn't want to put my site on there without thinking that through.  Maybe that doesn't matter to you because your IT department has the money to pay what I'm sure will be reasonable fees.  If this is your personal site that you want to be a new community HuffPost, I'd rethink it since you're beholden to someone who has basically said, ""we'll make you pay later.  In the meantime, just enjoy.""  While I'm sure the Slinkset people aren't like being in debt to the mob, it's not a position you want to be in with a site that you want to make big.",1220986183

28,299687,story,,,23,19,unalone,Ask HN: Good books on mathematics for somebody who's only taken high school math?,,"I was just reading Lockhart's Lament again (http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf, if you haven't read and reread it yet), and I got a tremendous urge to really start getting into math. Problem is, I don't know where to begin with it. So I figured I'd ask: what books out there discuss math in the same way Lockhart does? I don't want a drab textbook: I want something that makes math as fascinating as it was in middle school, when I actually had fun learning about this stuff. Something that really is ecstatic about math.<p>I remember having a book about Fibonacci that was like that, but it was a pretty small book. Just as an aside.<p>And, if you don't have a good math book (though that's what I'm looking for), are there any books you've read that inspire that same sort of ecstasy in you? Personally, I've found myself inspired both by Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything, along with Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point. (Even though the latter wasn't exactly a scientific book like it purports itself to be, I was still fascinated by the concept it discussed.) Anything else?",1220985176

But it wouldn't have solved the problem in this case...a blocking IO single-process vs. non-blocking multi-process configuration is obviously not going to fare well, and it couldn't be made (significantly) faster by rewriting some bits and pieces in C.<p>There are also pretty big costs associated with shell scripted processing, like spawning a new shell for every command (while Perl, Python, etc. do not, unless you're explicitly forking).  While there was a thread about programmers greps a few days ago, and out of curiosity I compared find+grep to grin and ack, and found that find piped to grep required a quarter the time of ack (written in Perl) and more than an order of magnitude less time than grin (written in Python) to perform a simple search, I also know that for more complex cases the cost of shell-based processing grows as complexity grows.<p>For an interesting comparison, look at the GNU autotools vs. cons (in Perl) or SCons (in Python).  Both cons are dramatically faster than the autotools.  Partly because they aren't as complex and don't target <i>quite</i> as many build systems, but also partly because they do most everything from a single running process.",1220985092
