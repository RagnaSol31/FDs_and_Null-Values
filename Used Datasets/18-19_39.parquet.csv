Just my impression, of course, but I get the feeling that PG is trying out a social ""hack"".<p>There's a magical section of life that a lot of people don't take advantage of - the first few years out of college, when your responsibilities and personal needs are very, very low.  A lot of people in their early twenties who don't go directly to grad school spend this time as paralegals, programmers for bigCorps, and so forth.<p>In a way, YC is testing out a perfect hack - showing how a remarkably small amount of money, along with just a bit of encouragement, can completely alter the course of a lifetime - and, if it is successful and spreads as a model, ultimately change the nature of careers and work.<p>It's not that married founders with kids and a mortgage <i>can't</i> participate, but if ""married with kids"" describes you (and it certainly describes <i>me</i>), you probably aren't in that state anymore.  But it's up to you to decide - I do know a startup founder who is 40 with a wife and little one (his wife works, though, which helps a lot - though in this case, the few grand YC offers would be irrelevant, and he's funded through a more traditional investment approach).  I know lots and lots of married programmers with kids who work as early employees of startups.  I could recommend this, because if you're very skilled in Silicon Valley, you can probably get a new job quickly - but it's probably nothing like being in YC.<p>I remember my first few years after college - I lived near the beach in San Diego, my rent was about $325 a month, and I surfed <i>constantly</i>.  Then I went to grad school.  Wouldn't have been a bad time to try a startup, I suppose.",1219949691.0

I think some people can sing, some people are extroverted, some people have athletic grace and ability, some people can draw or have other artistic ability. Many people don't like to speak in front of a crowd, in the same way that I would view what would be involved in becoming a cost accountant or stock control clerk. My use of the term ADD was not meant to imply illness, just a convenient shorthand for the way that many folks are.<p>The books I suggested offer a variety of suggestions for how to manage the downsides to ADD. I suggested them because I have read many and found these useful. I don't view myself as sick or having an inner dolphin (or at least being any more ""special"" than anyone else that I know).",1219949645.0
8,289388,comment,289120.0,289288.0,0,0,briansmith,,,"SUP will always have more overhead for a single feed, because it requires more than one (conditional) request: you need one for the SUP feed each time it is polled, and one for the content feed whenever it is changed.<p>Even with 10 feeds, SUP will probably not break even because processing 1 conditional request for the SUP feed is not really less work than processing 10 conditional requests. Each way will have approximately the same network latency (you can process 10 GET requests in one round-trip with pipelining) and the same bandwidth usage (you can stuff a few GET requests and a few 304 Not modified responses in a single packet with pipelining). The same techniques used to efficiently update a SUP feed can be used to keep individual cache entries for each individual feed up to date. Even without pipelining, the benefits are of SUP will be negligible for a site with just a handful of feeds.<p>The fixed cost of implementing SUP and the variable cost of maintaining it needs to be included in the cost analysis, not just the bandwidth.<p>SUP and Sixapart's stream will be useful for big sites. But, they are unnecessary for small ones, at least as far as they've been documented so far.",1219949501.0

40,289353,comment,288767.0,288767.0,0,0,modoc,,,"Fixed bids aren't so bad.  The trick is learning to do really good estimates.  Figure out how much information/requirements you need in order to create an estimate, and get that data first.  Document what YOU understand the scope of work to be (separately from the provided requirements) and make that the basis for your fixed bid.<p>Many customers will prefer a higher priced fixed bid, rather than a lower prices hourly based estimate, because they can budget for it (or get budget for it) without worrying about overruns.  Many less scrupulous development firms (or people who just can't estimate very well) end up billing well over the initial estimate when doing hourly invoicing, and many customers have been bitten by that before.<p>In my experience smaller client will be more likely to go for the hourly approach, due to the initial estimate being lower, and feeling like they have more control over the costs during the course of the project.  Larger companies almost always work with fixed size budgets approved on a project by project basis, and so having a fixed cost (even if it's potentially higher) is key for their internal budgeting and resourcing.  Plus it protects against the overruns hourly project can bring.  I've never seen a Fortune 500 outsource a full development project on an hourly basis.  It's almost ALWAYS fixed price, just due to how they handle their own budgets.<p>The trick, imho, to good fixed price cost estimating is to get the best requirements you can up-front, and restate them yourself in your SOW, broken out by task groupings instead of however the client structured them.  Clarify any potentially nebulous requirements/tasks yourself, and let the client know if they want to change the way you've filled in the gaps, they can do so, but you will need to submit an addendum to the invoice for any changes they make (unless otherwise agreed upon - i.e. same effort swaps of un-developed areas).  Once you have the overall task list figured out, do your internal task breakdown and estimates.  Then, pad your estimates out by perhaps 50% (this depends on how good you are at estimating, and how many times you've done task/feature X before).<p>If I have a task doing something that I haven't done before (i.e. some sort of crazy-cool ajax front-end wizardry (I'm a back-end guy)), I'll pad that out a bit more, since I'm likely to run into a snag or two along the way.  If it's something I've done 100 times before (i.e. user registration/login/logout/forgot password flows), I don't need to pad that, since I can estimate that pretty exactly.<p>Also, don't worry if your padding seems high, or your SOW price seems too high.  The client always has the option of doing an hourly approach instead.  It's up to them.  The more projects like this you do, the better you'll get at estimating, and it becomes second nature.",1219946934.0

Even if they can't universally stop copying, and a small number of people can still introduce high-fidelity copies, they can use technology to create deterrents to distributing them.<p>Two simple examples:<p>If a license or physical player is needed to create a high-fidelity copy (for instance, by capturing raw video streams from a player), and the output video is watermarked, content providers can revoke the player. Now ""free"" copies cost players.<p>If the same technology creates a trail of evidence leading back to ""pirate 0"", people will start getting sued. Not everyone the RIAA sued was innocent, and there's nothing to say that the DVD legal teams will create the same PR firestorm the RIAA did by abusing the system. Just as importantly, if it takes a huge amount of effort to create a supply chain of unlawful copies, the court case is much more damaging.<p>Content protection is not really a practice focus for us (though anticheating and kernel protection are), so my thoughts on this are not an exhaustive summary of the space of solutions content providers have.
