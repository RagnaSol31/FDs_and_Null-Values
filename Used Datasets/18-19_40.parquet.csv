Their customer dollars enabled a new class of Italian artists and scientists to pursue creativity and innovation.

26,493391,comment,492450.0,492753.0,0,0,jackzombie,,,"The reality is that is usually the marketing force behind an artist that generates his revenue, not actually the art itself. I have met so many extraordinary musicians that can shred the guitar and who write very clever music on a daily basis but will never make any money at it unless someone better looking than them takes their music and performs it. Since Meatloaf, I cannot think of any fat pop musicians. Art driven by profits is not always the best art. Coming from eastern Canada, Friday nights and weekends we have caleighs where anyone can pick up an instrument, sing or clap along, and nobody ever holds out for more money to perform. I do agree with your first sentence though, more time spent on art produces better art. But in the case of Carl Sagan who was a scientist, got his inspiration from his day job, which in turn helped him to produce his art (I include his Cosmos series as part of his art, I don't think we need to get into the debate of what is and isn't art). Its more of a sad reality that most art needs money to exist. I'm not calling for an art revolution or anything, I just wanted to point this out as some food for thought.
