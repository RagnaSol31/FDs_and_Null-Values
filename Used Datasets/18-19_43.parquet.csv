0,230049,story,,,5,11,lux,Ask HN: Carbon neutrality for a startup?,,"I've been seeing more and more companies becoming carbon neutral these days (Dreamhost is a popular example, and Rackspace offers a ""green"" server configuration as well as of this past January). After watching Al Gore's TED talk covering 15 ways of reducing your personal footprint, I started to look into companies selling carbon offsets.<p>My question for Hacker News is, how would you assess the footprint of a startup so as to be ""green from the get-go""?  What I can think of is:<p>- Personal carbon use (house, transportation), since we don't have an office yet\n- Servers (our host isn't green to my knowledge)\n- Additional services such as Amazon S3 and EC2<p>How would you go about calculating a carbon footprint for such a scenario?  Also, do you think there is a real promotional advantage to being green?",1214593121
