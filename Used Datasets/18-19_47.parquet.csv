Configuration, deployment, and all round administration skills are part of the tool kit that you need even if none of this is your primary responsibility.<p>I would also add JavaScript and Ajax to the necessary skill set.  If you are a freelancer or job hunting, JS, HTML, and CSS increase the number of gigs that you can tackle.  Even when the backend is your primary responsibility, you will often be called upon to do a quick fix in the other areas.<p>Farming out design is good advice, but often the HTML and CSS is not really usable, so you will need to know enough to make it work on your site.",1232909879.0

For example, there is something of a trade-off in consultancy that you can get more money for more esoteric skills, but you will get fewer billable hours per year. If a narrow speciallity pays twice as well, but you only get half the work, you will not be taking home any more money, and that extra spare time? You might need more than 100% of it to prepare for when the speciality narrows to nothing.<p>Hitokiri's key problem is to settle on his accounting treatment of his Plan B. At some point in the future the SAP gig will turn sour. Perhaps in five years, perhaps Hitokiri will need two years money in the bank to maintain his standard of living while he rebuilds his career. If that is the assessment, then Hitokiri has to save 40% less inventment returns. That makes it look a lot less lucrative.<p>The key point is that the extra pay has to cover both Plan B and compensate for any special unpleasantness in the work. You have to be very careful to avoid double counting the extra salary.",1232908602.0

These plants have insects living in their roots which are feeding on them. At some point in time, insects arrive and settle on the leaves of the plants. They start feeding, and the plants die on or two weeks later. So these insects move to other plants nearby - soon, all the plants in the field are dead, and then all the insects in the field are dead.<p>But let's say there is a single insect underground that feeds in such a way that the chemical composition of the plant is mildly changed from the standard plant. The above ground insects will avoid this plant, because it smells a bit different, and so this plant will be one of the last to die. As a result, it will be the dominant plan in the next generation of plants. In the next generation, the plant that emphasizes this trait will continue to win, and in a few generations, the evolution will occur.<p>This ties in with my theory that evolution can only occur under very high pressure, and it happens very suddenly. This slow evolution theory that is common now is wrong, in my opinion. I believe that mutation is common, but singificant changes happen only under immense pressure.<p>That's why humans are no longer evolving. That's why women still have to suffer at childbirth - midwives have removed the pressure.",1232907984.0

I agree sounding rockets (yes I know what they are thanks ;)) are not orbital devices - but it proves the groundwork and paves the way to more exciting stuff.. surely.. dismissing such data <i>offhand</i> seems a little unhackerish and uninspired :(<p>To clarify my point... (as it seems to have got lost in the noise)\n- There have been <i>no</i> orbital launches from balloons to date\n- There <i>HAVE</i> been sub orbital launches to date\n- NASA (and possible CU) are looking into launching orbital devices from balloons\n- NASA have plans for a Balloon which will be able to carry a ton of equipment up to a ""launchable"" height.\n- My conclusion from this is that far from being impossible it is perfectly within possibility, probably with our current technology.<p>@all Sorry to feed the trolling.. now that my point is clear I shall move on ;) :D",1232906595.0
