I reduced the TTL a few days before the move and I also set up Apache on the old server to proxy all requests to the new server. Look up Reverse Proxy for Apache. I turned that on when I changed the IP addresses in the DNS records. So there was no downtime. I left this up for a week and then shut it down. Worked great. Note: This site doesn't use SSL.

So, yeah - unconvincing. In the heavily McMansioned areas of the USA, people are commuting to a suburban office park, not a city center. Thus, the housing choice is going to be between different suburban developments, not between a gated community and an apartment downtown.",1216404292

They just don't get it.<p>This article is based largely on the assumption that priority number one will be to port everything to Windows and I think this is an absurd assumption to make.<p>Are we to believe that Microsoft is willing to risk throwing away $100M+ in order to migrate this thing to Windows?<p>Don't forget that Microsoft ran Hotmail on Unix for years. I imagine by the time they got around to porting it to Windows they were about ready for an upgrade anyway. (Plus, Windows was finally getting to the point where a project like that could even be considered.)<p>My guess is the meat of this deal was about bringing in some new IP and some bright engineers- not about running some search engine that almost no one has heard of. In that case, the platform it runs on is largely irrelevant.",1216404174
