None of these  are elusive, they are very cleanly defined, trivial concepts. So it's a very well-posed question.<p>Of course, we could still not be able to <i>prove</i> the (non)existence of a polynomial algorithm for SAT in ZF set theory. In that case, too bad for ZF, but whether P=NP is still a meaningful question.",1246647514.0

If you read Kent's blog, it sounds like he's exploring different ways that programmers can monetize their work. This is certainly one way for a very capable programmer; I can't even imagine how much I'd learn spending two hours coding with, say, John Carmack (or even Kent Beck :^). I could easily see spending a few hundred dollars for that.<p>I could also see this being a good way for a programmer to make money who isn't necessarily a rock star, but has deep knowledge of a particular library or some such.

21,686442,story,,,4,4,Anonymal,Tell HN: I think the App Store is completely corrupt,,"After selling an app on the app store for a couple months (and climbing pretty high in the rankings), I'm convinced the app store is corrupt in the following sense.<p>Most of the 5-star reviews you read on the App Store are fabricated. It's pervasive, every successful app does it, and you basically need to assemble a review posse to compete at all.<p>In the end, the good apps filter to the top, because even though you can arrange good reviews, once you start selling apps fast enough you will get bad reviews that will drive you back down.<p>But still, you need to rustle up or manufacture reviews on each release to get in the game. You can immediately increase sales by doing so, and so everyone does it.<p>The result is a competition that encourages dishonesty, and people end up buying apps under false pretenses - because everyone doesn't know the 5-star reviews are all fake. I think Apple needs to take some steps to clean this up.<p>Obviously, Apple doesn't care about this today. You can tell because there are no controls or anti-gaming technologies in play here. Also, Apple has no interest in rooting out fake reviews (which increase sales temporarily, but on a regular basis, like a heartbeat).",1246646311.0

US students are free to go to their med schools but prefer US schools because the quality of the education is so much higher.<p>The US has excellent health care, but there are two problems: availability and price.  If you dont have employer paid insurance, medicare, or excellent health, you are pretty much shut out. The pricing structure is out of whack.  My SO takes a drug that costs $700 per month.  It went generic in February and in October full competition will kick in and it will probably cost $20-30 per month.  Meanwhile we are paying for excessive profits, television ads, and salesmen.  I dont know what the price is in Canada or Mexico, but probably much less.<p>Another example of a completely whacked out pricing system is hospitalization.  Several years back I had a pretty routine routine heart procedure.  The bill from the hospital was $80,000.  The insurance company allowed $20,000 and I only had to pay $2000.  Someone without insurance would have been hit with the whole $80,000.  And then there was the anesthesiologist who didnt participate in the insurance plan and billed me $4,000.

That offers solid feedback about intentional keypresses while giving the fingers a place to rest.<p>There's still the issue of finding keys by touch.

Perhaps one mechanism may be to engineer a retrovirus that would rewrite portions of DNA.  This could obviously have far more important impacts as well: such an RV could reprogram cancerous cells to die off like proper cells, or disable their angiogenic capability; and of course it could be programmed to rewrite genes implicated in diseases like sickle-cell anemia or multiple sclerosis.<p>Another issue is that while genetics of course plays a role in behavior, I think it plays out more in directing the development of the brain, not the actual millisecond-to-millisecond activities of it.  Based on my ankle-deep knowledge of neuroscience, I think that adjusting the DNA is unlikely to cause an adult brain to rearrange itself in such a way as to modify behavior.  A more likely use for it could be in adjusting brain chemistry, which I'm guessing can have dramatic, if not entirely targeted, effects.",1246644218.0
