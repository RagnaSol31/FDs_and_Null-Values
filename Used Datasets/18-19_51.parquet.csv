Most clean energy companies focus on developing new technologies, but the largest market opportunity is to compete with utilities at the top of the food chain in the retail electricity market. The single greatest opportunity we will ever have to reconfigure the relationship between people and utilities is to capture the surge of interest in clean energy.<p>No existing websites help people find, within seconds, the best clean energy options in their area. We make it fun and easy for people to find and compare clean energy options based on price and customer satisfaction.<p>We’re also building the first national marketplace where solar owners can sell, retire, or donate renewable energy certificates by clicking just once or twice from an email update. There’s more, of course. Apply below to see the demo site and to learn about our business plan.<p>Looking for: \nLead engineers and designers to join the team as technical co-founders. Founder is a renewable energy industry expert and former engineer (not CS).<p>You are a person who:\nUnderstands and enjoys the social networking world; is willing to develop an interest in auction platforms and commodities markets; leverages open source as much as possible; builds data and API-driven websites; takes initiative and doesn’t require excessive direction; knows and owns up to your shortcomings;  values open communication; and likes brainstorming and working with in small groups.<p>Additional: \nYou must have patience. The clean tech community and market, while valuable, won’t hit their prime until around 2012, when one day we’ll look at a spreadsheet and realize the world has changed. You must want to build a viable business, solve technical problems for a social end, value transparency, want to crack the great monopoly of investor-owned utilities...and help solve this climate change thing along the way.<p>Technical requirements:\nCurrent platform is built on PHP, Java and MySQL. From here on out it’s your job to decide coding details and to justify your decisions. You should be experienced and smart enough to both setup the right architecture and to inspire others to join our team. You should care about UI design as much as you do code.<p>Offer:\nEquity. A very large target market to attack. A technical challenge that will only grow over time. A crash course in clean tech, the electricity market, and community-building. Opportunity to build a nationally recognized company and make meaningful decisions.<p>Funding status: \nInvestors want to see a public launch before considering funding.

What you care about is that the second time you visit the site, when you log in with your brand new account, that the cert the site sends you is the same you received when you created the account (the site is the same you created the account on). This has nothing to do with the fact that the cert is signed from a trusted CA or not, and thus, making it difficult for the user to accept a SS cert is not the right solution IMHO.",1218823290
