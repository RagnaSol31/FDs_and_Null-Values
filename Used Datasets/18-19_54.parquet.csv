You'll have a long, hard road ahead, but it can be done.<p>If you just want to get something working, find existing hardware (iPhone, Android, tablet PC, etc) that does what you need and code for it. This is by far the cheaper option until you get into selling thousands of copies. Since building thousands of units requires even more tens of thousands of dollars, it's a fair bet that you'll be better off with expensive hardware for a long time.<p>I am an EE/SE with plenty of experience who sometimes takes on contract work. I was actually asked to build a device like this recently. Small quantities, say 5-20 per year. My suggestion to the buyer was that we use a mini/micro ITX board, standard off the shelf electronic hardware and a simple custom designed hardware interface that I would only charge him about $1k to design and that could be built for about $70 each. And this is a very simple board that has 1/1000 the complexity of a NIC card that you can buy at MicroCenter for $10.<p>Custom hardware in small to moderate quantities is <i>expensive</i> make no bones about it.",1232476562.0

But ClearCase with UCM has an equally powerful branching capability and in some ways is easier to use and manage (from a developer perspective).  And there's probably at least 10 years of development and actual large-scale use behind it.  It's good stuff, or at least the theory and workflows (just tune out the CC implementation parts).<p>FYI, my background was as a consultant in enterprise version control dealing with a number of different products: PVCS, Dimensions, Harvest, Starteam and ClearCase.

On TV, the broadcaster controls the order and scope of reporting (you're fed the news). On the internet, vital information can easily become unreachable due to developer mistakes or usability problems.<p>With a newspaper, everything is in front of you and is in the same place. It's been in that place for years and will remain there in the near future. If there were an accepted (and acceptable) format for online news, this would be a non-issue, but until then, I'll continue to get my news from the newspaper. It's durable and only requires reading light.<p>It's also nice to avoid using a screen for everything.",1232475100.0
