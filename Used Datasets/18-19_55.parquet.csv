I don't understand how these teams can make such generic conclusions and then immediately contradict each other on such level. One team says ""we are certain, reality doesn't exists"", the other says ""nope, it does exists"". Either the articles interpreting the teams' results are exaggerating the claims, or quantum mechanics is mocking both teams making contradictory results possible.",1236365905.0

This reminds me of Live Messenger, when the service goes down for everyone (including articles on ZDNet and places about the outage) you check the service and it <i>always</i> says that the Live systems are running without a problem. I still can't understand why MSFT simply never admits there's a problem; IMO it hurts their reputation a lot more that they don't than if they did.<p>Honestly, I find myself looking at the apple website, watching the prices of all their products.
