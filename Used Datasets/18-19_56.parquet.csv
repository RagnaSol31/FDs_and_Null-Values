And that can never be true.  No one can make promises like that, but those promises mean that they don't tell you things like backup strategies, replication, data centers, etc.  And so you're just left with a promise that they've taken care of everything.<p>While I don't expect a company to tell me everything, I much prefer Amazon's take on the issue.  For example, they specifically quote an annual failure rate that they expect and offer S3 snapshots (which are replicated across multiple boxes in multiple locations) as a backup.  No hype or promises; just the knowledge I need to make sure I don't loose data.<p>With companies like Slicehost, Linode, or Amazon I know what I'm getting: a Xen instance with a certain amount of RAM.  I can then replicate data, take backups, etc. to make sure that my site stays up and running.  With Media Temple, I just get the promise of ""hundreds of servers working in tandem to power [my] websites"".  Clearly it isn't 500 servers just working on my site or anything like that.  So, what is it?  It's a mystery and I find that when companies try to be mysterious, it's not because they're giving you more; it's because they're giving you less.",1235933853

11,499186,comment,499067.0,499067.0,0,0,mdasen,,,"Yes.<p>First, App Engine will really only run things that are written for App Engine.  If you have a Python web application, there's a good likelihood that it won't run on App Engine because it does things that App Engine doesn't (like relational database stuff or cron jobs or whatnot).  Enterprise applications are things already written.<p>Second, enterprise applications are usually things that don't need to support millions of users so much as they need to have features.  You're not serving like Digg or Google so much as doing non-real-time data processing.  So, App Engine's infiniscale thing isn't as important as a relational database's ability to have triggers.<p>Third, App Engine doesn't have an SLA.  That's a harsh sell for enterprise stuff.  It doesn't even have a way to make a backup of the database in a dump file.  That makes it an absolute no-go.<p>Fourth, App Engine's low cost usually isn't a concern on the enterprise level (even if it should be).<p>App Engine is a cool service, but whether it will become important is yet to be seen.  If you're running a small site (say, 1,000,000 pageviews per month), you aren't going to have trouble scaling a MySQL/PostgreSQL database and application.  You'll normally be showing one pageview per second at that rate.  So, it's just as easy to go with Slicehost or Amazon.  And using Amazon or Slicehost or the like has advantages - you get to use any software you find useful, you can have relational databases, etc.  So, for small sites, App Engine's scaling capabilities aren't so important.<p>For larger sites, you just can't deal without a backup strategy, SLA, and cron jobs.  It's too limiting.  Plus, when you're a big site, you can hire people to deal with scaling issues.<p>So, it misses a little on both sides.  I really want to love it, but there are just some gaps in the offering that are really important.  I don't think Google needs to worry about the low side since they can't practically offer things like JOINs off their architecture, but on the high side, they need to offer data dumps and cron jobs and a little more information about the data integrity in the system (how many copies, how fast is it replicated, etc.)",1235933310

The meaning of money, which she explained, is the same quite apart from your ""traditional capitalist values"" -- didn't want to let that rhetorical slap zip by unchallenged.<p>If you can understand the meaning of money and claim that love of money, which embodies that meaning, is the root of all evil, fine. But then, you might as well say that love of ANYTHING that's good is the root of all evil. In the same way that this maxim exaggerates its claim, I can plausibly argue that love of sex with women is the root of all evil, because men commit most evil and, one way or another, most of it has its roots in pursuing women.",1235933251

Each person has different standards for what they find hot. Why shouldn't that play out during sex?<p>Those fantasies go far and wide. I'm sure every single person reading this has had bizarre sexual thoughts and ideas. Perhaps not for long, perhaps you've denied the thoughts to yourself as wrong, but the thoughts have crossed your mind.

In both cases, that drive is an unbroken parade of suburbs.<p>Second, the conventional definition of ""sprawl"" is by population density. Chicago's is 12,500/sq mile; 2.8M people live within the borders of the city. San Francisco is more dense, but has only 800,000 people. No valley city even comes close.<p>Finally, your anecdote about the drive to Rockford would apply just as well to NYC --- drive 50 miles in any direction from NYC waiting for the suburbs to stop. Apparently NYC is also a sprawl city.<p>Notice I'm giving you the most favorable possible comparison here, pretending you compared San Francisco to Chicago and not San Jose. Saying ""Chicago has much more sprawl than San Jose"" is like saying ""Chicago has much more sprawl than Oak Brook, IL"".
