But if you check out the peers in your torrent client, you will see that the majority of users use utorrent.<p>Anyways it's not just about torrent client (which is not a too complicated piece of software) but other kinds of desktop and server applications, that are required to have low latency and small footprint. Rhetorical question: why all major browsers are written in C/C++?<p>Don't get me wrong, I like dynamic languages, currently I am working in python (besides C++), but the main advantage for me in those languages are rapid prototyping/development and lots of built in libraries, not the performance.",1255889850

This excludes renters and other non-homeowners. It also excludes people without stable or established careers, as they could be required to relocate.<p>2) The user will pay their bill on time. (Otherwise, their e-mail address will go away.)<p>Additionally, having a broadband ISP excludes the rural American demographic.<p>People fitting in both 1) and 2) will be more likely to have positive credit scores for obvious reasons.",1255889805

Yes, some aspects of the behavior of a person are in the genetics, but it's more the environment that models it.<p>Eg. in my family we have a strong tendency to identify new business opportunities, but this doesn't mean it's 100% because of the DNA.\nIt's more about about the environment (in my case family) type of culture and education.<p>Thanks for the name of the report.

The temporary crisis of confidence caused by a falling stock price led creditors to start fleeing as well, preventing Bear from rolling over it's daily debt. As they point out in the article, Bear was highly dependent on overnight lending at that point.<p>Also, making money via naked shorting doesn't require the company to die. It merely requires the share price to fall.",1255888890
