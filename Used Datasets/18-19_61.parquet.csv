Your skills in any of those activities are at least somewhat interchangeable with <i>real</i> life.<p>Monopoly is only amoral because in the subset of the universe we've isolated, we've taken out some of the details that would normally result in morality. You also don't have to worry about eating in monopoly, or in Call of Duty. That's why it's a subset.<p>Rules in monopoly and rules governing corporate actions are analogous, not ==. That's what I meant by asking what's the difference.<p>When you play monopoly it's like isolating variables so you can hone specific skills. Obviously playing monopoly does not equal an MBA, but that's because monopoly is a scaled down version of life only dealing with buying and owning property (and without concern for individual human lives), and it certainly can hone some business skills. But this is, to some degree at least, how all games are. Some games will be more of a waste of time, others less, some none.",1267383576.0

Jobs involving little or no use of education(like working in a cheap restaurant, serving tea in offices, construction workers etc etc), can be easily done by kids. If you have educated 100 kids, made them do nothing until they turn 18, and there are only 50 jobs requiring education, and 50 jobs requiring no education then you have just wasted many years of working and earning of those kids who will work in the latter category.<p>Someone has to do jobs requiring no skill or education, By enforcing an anti-child labor law you are just removing the natural head start those people would have in life (by working and acquiring experience) against those who go to schools and colleges.<p>People who grow up on farms are almost always out of the application of anti-child labor laws, and its important for them to do so, and because of this agriculture remains a profession passed on from generation to generation.<p>The point is with gradual prosperity less and less kids work in dangerous menial jobs, its not the child labor laws which have prevented kids from working, but the parents have stopped sending their kids to work because its not needed anymore.<p>About break the laws of those nations, well honestly speaking my own observation is that American companies follow the most amount of laws in these countries than any other individual or domestic corporation, this really does increase their costs more than how a domestic corporation would produce the same thing(by breaking the stupid laws and bribing govt officials), but American corporations don't care because they aren't really producing for domestic markets, they are producing for American markets where people can pay the slightly higher cost.",1267382915.0

In 2005 the scene group H2O needed 1500 manhours for cracking it, from their NFO (iNFO notice from the scene group about the release) for Steinberg.Cubase.SX.v3.0.2.623:<p><pre><code>   H2O does it again.........!!!\n\n   Although everybody thought that Syncrosoft and Steinberg\n   had found the ultimate protection, we prove otherwise.\n\n   We admit that it's getting harder and harder to do and\n   this one may possibly be the last one we do.\n\n   Due to the complex nature of the protection we thought\n   of approaching it from another direction.\n\n   The Emulation is now done on driver-level, which means\n   that the Emu essentially mimics a dongle, look in the\n   License Control Center to view the applications the Emu\n   supports. By writing the Emu at driver-level we probably\n   went beyond cracking an application. The amount of\n   effort invested in this project is staggering, estimated\n   at over 1500 manhours during cracking, developing &\n   testing, and probably will never be done again.\n\n   (...)\n\n   Note to protection coders:\n   Unbelievable way you transform an application. We\n   estimate that between 30% & 40% of the application are\n   wrapped in the script protection. Protection is one\n   thing but this surely effects an application\n   performance. You probably could get a performance gain\n   of 50% without the protection!!\n</code></pre>\nNFO for Steinberg.Cubase.SX.v3.1.1.944 has more details on the way the protection works and its impact on performance:<p><pre><code>   Note to Steinberg/End-Users:\n   It seems that our prior Release Note stirred something\n   in the Audio Community (Yes, we can read). To get some\n   of the facts straight we're going to reveal some\n   secrets about the copy protection itself, and why we\n   stated that it severely impacts performance.\n\n   Info from Syncrosoft website:\n   [QUOTE] ""Syncrosoft's protection solution is different\n   from mainstream software copy protection methods. It is\n   based on a secure executer, the eLicenser, and the\n   patented MCFACT technology""\n   ""At runtime, the transformed program code does not\n   reveal its semantics. The eLicenser's crypto-services\n   are called from time to time by the transformed program\n   code.""\n   ""The transformed program code is represented as tables\n   in the computers memory. An adversary can not reverse-\n   engineer or debug the tables, because a reverse\n   transformation from the tables to original program code\n   is not feasible. If the tables are manipulated, the\n   transformed program code will crash or produce invalid\n   results.""[ENDQUOTE]\n\n   So it's not crackable?...\n\n   Now here is the explanation for what really goes on:\n   Transformation is based on replacing ordinary machine\n   code into tables representing results from calculations\n\n   Example: Adding 2 numbers.\n\n   Normal machine-code would look something like:\n\n   Add eax, ebx\n\n   This will take 1 CPU cycle to execute.\n\n   Now comes MCFACT:\n\n   1) Transform the first number into a table\n   2) Transform the second number into a table\n   3) Do allot of manipulation of these tables\n   4) More manipulation\n   5) Transform the Tables back to the numbers\n   6) Add the 2 numbers\n\n   This entire piece takes up hundreds of machine code\n   lines and a lot of loops inside this code...estimated\n   CPU-cycles <insert number greater than 1 here> No\n   performance loss? We don't think so..........\n\n   And this code runs all the time!!......The dongle in\n   fact is only called 1 out of 10 times inside these\n   scripts.........\n\n   A good example is the protection build in the midi-\n   part. This is entirely wrapped in the script-crap. Try\n   moving a note and swirl it around.....you should notice\n   a sluggishness in the movement.\n\n   In fact u will notice an improvement in version 3.1\n   prior to the 3.0 release. This is not due to\n   improvements made by Steinberg (the midi-engine is\n   still the same) but improvements made by Syncrosoft!\n   (They optimized the script engine)!!!!!!!\n\n   To give the end user some peace of mind: the scripts\n   aren't built into the real-time audio-engine.....this\n   is impossible because of the performance loss u would\n   have from the MCFACT.</code></pre>",1267382645.0
