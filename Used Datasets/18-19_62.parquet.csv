On one hand, you can see this as 90% of Chinese billionaires are the kids of high ranking officials.<p>Bot on the other hand, you can see this as 90% of Chinese kids of high ranking officials are expected to marry someone who is successful/will make them look good.  Anyone who's dated an Chinese girl whose parents are relatively successful (especially if they are East Asian themselves) will probably tell you a thing or two about having to measure up to standards.<p>In Chinese society, people use their relationships to leverage life (and by extension, business and politics) to the full.  Thus, it's not acceptable to marry below you because if you do, you may be forced to hire the relatives of your lowly mate.  It is shameful if your family is not doing well, and it is shameful if your close relatives don't have a job.  This is the cost of sticking together, having strong friendship and family bonds-- you do not want any relationships that are too one-sided or unsustainable.<p>While modernization has weakened this system nontrivially, it does feel that it is still the norm, and we have reason to believe it will continue (at least to a greater extent than here in the West).  The reason is that China has too many people, too many mouths to feed.  China produces many more engineering students than does the US.  But most of them aren't hireable.  There's a reason why we're still ""better"".<p>Finding the right talent in China is even more formidable than it is here, and it always has been, thanks to the fact that China has 3x more people per acre of arable land than the average country (cited from Stratfor but I can't find the link).<p><i>Now I'm not saying that the system is fair or even efficient compared to the Western system, but using the family to extend one's goals is a byproduct of Chinese society.</i><p>I would argue there is some wisdom in what they do.  Here in the West, our HR departments often prefer to hire people who are referrals.  There's an implicit understanding that good workers like to hang out with other people who are good workers.  In this light, the Chinese are merely extending that wisdom beyond the workplace.",1248634694.0

Consultants don't deploy anything (though they will claim they do).<p>You bring in a consultant to advise you but they never make the actual decision or even necessarily know what thought process is going into that decision.  In this case the proof is in the post itself.  Not only does he not address all the factors I mentioned above he focuses on things Enterprises simply don't care about.  Again I say: Support is king.  If you write about Enterprise IT without even mentioning support you don't know what the heck you're talking about.<p>I'm not blaming consultants.  The nature of a consultants job (never actually doing the work) creates an enviornment where he or she is detached from what's really going on.

(Yahoo had manual editors at the time, too.). This also meant the portals had nearly the same results and Google was where you could get an alternate opinion.  Google kept their ads separate from search results, which was lauded by Slashdot users and Google picked up lots of word of mouth about that.  After that, Google came up with the do no evil motto as an official stance.

The prostate cancer survival rate in the US is 99.3%, as compared to 77.5% in Europe. We get better health care in the US.<p>You conclusion doesn't follow from the data. The only conclusion you could make from that data is that the US has better care for prostate and breast cancer than Europe.<p>Most people don't die of these diseases. Indeed, most people don't die of cancer. So we should be looking at survival rates for all conditions, i.e. life expectancy.<p>As it happens, most (all?) western European countries have longer life expectancies than the USA, and all spend less on healthcare. If you wish to conclude that the US system is the best one, your conclusion isn't supported by the facts.",1248632115.0

That author also disagrees with the Coanda effect conclusion.<p>The discussion in there is the best I've seen, it centers on the concept or circulation, the vorticity of the flow field around the wing. One example that's used is the fact that if you just take a wing by itself (try it with a long, flat piece of cardboard) it will ""fly"" while rotating in the air. It doesn't fly very well, admittedly, but it certainly exhibits a glide ratio a lot better than something with the same cross-sectional area that's not a wing. In that case, there's <i>no</i> top or bottom of the wing at all.",1248632041.0

In an enterprise, features don’t necessarily win the day (which is the argument this author makes).  A good enterprise has a few primary concerns...<p>1.  The availability of good support \n2.  An obvious return on investment\n3.  Ease of deployment\n4.  Integration into existing systems\n5.  Products that require testable skill sets from employees<p>Microsoft wins in the Enterprise generally because its support is so good.  If you have $245 and a phone you can solve any problem with a Microsoft product even if you’re a low level tech support person.  They will sit with you for however much time it takes to fix the problem (even overnight if necessary).  On the other issues Microsoft publishes tons of Return on Investment studies, half of Sharepoint is already built in to Windows server, Microsoft has gone to all kinds of trouble to make Windows developers able to manipulate Sharepoint and they offer certifications to test possible employee knowledge.<p>Google on the other hand offers no support for its services, Google Wave is way too different from anything that exists to demonstrate return on investment, deployment is easy but worrisome from an IT perspective because you have no control over the server, and there’s no skill set to test for just yet.  The only thing it has going for it is its ease of integration.<p>The concepts of Google Wave may very well make their way into the Enterprise but we’re years if not decades away from that actually happening.  When it does I suspect Microsoft and every other enterprise application vendor will have competing products making the discussion no more than academic now.",1248631743.0

I couldn't agree more - and I had an idea. Maybe this is completely unoriginal, and maybe this is actually highly illegal or widely frowned upon - but that's why I'm throwing it out there for comment. I think it would be fun to set up a monthly competition where a server is set up, and contestants attempt to be the first to hack the box (and achieving a specific goal like replacing the home page, or something like that). I'd be willing to run the contests and provide all the hardware, etc... I was thinking a series of games could focus on various Linux distros, or various versions of Windows, etc...<p>So I'm posting this to see if there's much interest in running such a contest (say, once a month or so), and if there's comments as to the other implications of such a game. Obviously, DoS attacks would be strictly against the rules, so as not to cause any problems for my ISP. Any thoughts?",1248631205.0
