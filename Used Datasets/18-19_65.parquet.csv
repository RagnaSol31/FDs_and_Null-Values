Put the must haves in the free version, or most of them, and the nice ones in the paid category?<p>I have no idea what the usual way of dividing features between versions is, but putting the must haves in the free version should help build user base.

It starts off by randomly creating 20 cars with variable car shapes, wheel sizes, and counterweight sizes.<p>It determines how well each car does on the course and uses this information to mate the cars together in order to get a more successful car. The way this is traditionally done is by evaluating a ""fitness"" function on each individual in the population and giving the higher scoring individuals a better chance of mating.<p>This process keeps on going on until some criteria is reached.
