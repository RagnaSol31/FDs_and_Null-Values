9,317072,comment,316690.0,316808.0,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"""This is good stuff. I certainly hope frameworks like ramaze stick around and gain their own niche market share. ...  I had to get away from Rails. In fact, if other frameworks like Merb, Ramaze, datamapper, and Sequel didn't show up, I would have had to dump ruby.""<p>It's a tough sell in the mainstream Ruby (ie. Rails-centric) community.  For example, at MtWest RubyConf two years ago, Chad Fowler told the assembled crowd that people working on Nitro (arguably the forerunner of Ramaze, and an influence on other Ruby Web tools) to stop.  Flat out stop working on it.  ""We don't need it; it's just like Rails.""    Which, of course, was simply untrue.  (My take was that Nitro was to Rails as Ruby is to Python.  Similar, but with enough differences to matter.  Ramaze follows in that way.  Ramaze is opinionated software that says your opinion matters )<p>Fortunately, people kept on with developing new Web frameworks (both Rails-like and not), but none have had the same level of hype and business backing as Rails. Merb gets some decent attention, perhaps because it's (sort of) Rails-lite or Rails-done-better.   (I'm not trying to disparage Merb, just offer an idea on why it gets more traction than, say,  Ramaze.)<p>Seeing almost every 3rd-generation Ruby Web framework use Rack is encouraging, as is the continued lack of coupling to any particular ORM, and I expect to see even more loosely-coupled, easily assembled Web tools to come along.<p>Good times.",1222540970

You'd be out $25k.<p>So diversify your cash across banks (although that's harder and harder with all the acquisitions going on).,1222540621

28,317051,story,,,4,4,lallysingh,Ask HN: Deciding between Haskell & Lisp,,"Hey folks, I'm going functional and want to decide between the two.  Some of my thoughts and concerns are below.  I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.<p>Why I like Haskell:<p>- It compiles to native code (in GHC)<p>- It has a grammar<p>- The type system looks fascinating<p>- GHC also has native support for Literate Haskell files, which sound pretty useful considering the density of functional code.<p>- Lazy evaluation looks like a great way to pass around work for threads, or to model certain problems.<p>- It's nice how they handled side effects ala Monads.<p>Why I'm still curious about lisp:<p>- I don't know how to compare CLOS or macros against  Haskell's functionality.<p>- Emacs.  A single language across the board could be nice.  I've been a long-time user for it, but mostly for imperative languages, org-mode, and latex.<p>- Connections to old hacker lore & culture.  Tons of old stories on Lisp being wonderful, AI research, etc.  Considering how simply lisp's survived & evolved over the last 50 (!) years, there's apparently a lot more to the whole thing than I can determine beforehand.<p>Of course, the real decision is which one becomes my first native functional language, and which one becomes the second.  But it's really going to boil down to which one I choose for my next personal dev project.  The second will have to be an experimentation platform, based on the lens developed in the former.<p>I suspect others are in the same situation (for differing reasons) and hope that this thread be useful to them as well.<p>Thanks in advance!<p>-Lally",1222538518
