In particular, they're slower, uglier and always seem to be missing some of everyone's favourite features. Office isn't perfect, but it's almost always fast, and it has a <i>lot</i> of features.<p>Get the implementation right, and you've got a great Office competitor. But given the limitations on the speed of a web-based application I'm not convinced it's possible (but keen to be proven wrong!)",1217876383.0

But not only is it missing the only piece of redeeming value in any distribution system, it is not in essence any different than the private redistribution system.  That is, there are still people deciding how to spend money.  It is true that people are flawed; but they are no less flawed because we call them government.  In fact they are more so: we have removed the only incentive to improve redistribution that they may have had.<p>But then it is not easy to silence the voices of those who ask whether it is not paradoxical to entrust the nation's welfare to the decisions of voters whom the law itself considers incapable of managing their own affairs; whether it is not absurd to make those people supreme in the conduct of government who are manifestly in need of a guardian to prevent them from spending their own income foolishly."" - Ludwig von Mises",1217873457.0

A less complex parser will have tremendous leverage by making it easier to craft syntax-aware programming tools.  Smalltalk has a history of amazing ground-breaking programmer tools written by single individuals years ahead of their appearance in other languages.  Contrast this with Ruby.  I like Ruby a lot.  It's a great language.  The syntax is a bit hairy, however.  Teams of people worked for a couple of years to produce an ANTLR parser which is independent of the Ruby VM's parser and could be used for programming tools.<p>A good programmer can just crank out a top-down Smalltalk parser in one day.  If you make your language easy to work with, you get a more powerful toolset sooner.  On top of that, the lowered barrier to entry gets you more real innovation in that toolset.",1217872960.0

This implies that the author thinks that existing web Office tools haven't gained traction because they're too diffusely targeted.  The author seems to think that if a web Office tool had a clustered communities of users, this would somehow drive adoption of a web Office replacement.  This is an interesting idea, but I think it's inadequately motivated in the writeup.  Do college students comprise the right population for these sorts of clusters?  I don't think so.  I think college students collaborate too infrequently for them to bother adopting such a tool, especially on projects requiring Office-like functionality.
