That is why great frameworks like Spring, Guice or Stripes exist.<p>Sun loves you when you use J2EE/JSF/EJB/JMS/JWHATEVER. But there are serious alternatives that are more lightweight, easier and less intrusive.<p>Of course you will not add value (read: buy into) to the Sun Enterprise Ecosystem :-)<p>Staying away from (most) 'Enterprise' Java standards has worked very well for me.

I've seen many projects where people think they don't need Spring but where it made 100% sense. And made the project simpler and easier to manage and test.<p>Even in small projects it makes a lot of sense to have a good seperation in layers or services and to use a <i>mostly</i> invisible helper to glue things together.<p>Modern Spring can configure your app with a very minimal amount of XML. If you don't like XML then use annotation based configuration.<p>I totally disagree with your statement that Spring only exists to manage the 'massive configurability of Java design patterns'. The only patterns that the foundation of Spring introduces are IoC and 'configuration by convention'. Those have been proven to be extremely powerful patterns that simply allow you to burn half of the 'J2EE Design Patterns' books.",1231872871.0

He recognized that most interesting materials are stronger under tension than compression -- steel, for example.  This is part of the power of the geodesic (tension spreads throughout the structure, yielding global tension and localized compression).

At least in the designs I've seen -- and in the aluminum building shown in the article (look at the ""foundation"").<p>But similar to a tepee, the top would also open (and rotate) for ventilation purposes -- domes and round structures have useful air circulation patterns.",1231872537.0

So to give an example lets say the spreadsheet was never invented.  That wouldn't have stopped people from creating a mathematical equation to determine credit worthiness.  Bankers would just have Joe Spreadsheet do the equation by hand.<p>He's still going to be equally uninformed and he's certainly not going to be able to verify the validity of the equations while he's doing it.  He's simply completing the required steps to get the equation to produce an answer.<p>So again the spreadsheet isn't obscuring anything that wouldn't have been obscured without it.

The company I work for is considered one of the best web development in my country and virtually none of our clients come from the front page. We have much more important things to work on than to spend time and money on something that is frankly just there for the sake of being there.<p>What I'm wondering right now is what do people mean when they say ""x doesn't get the web"" in the context of companies. There are far more companies out there with not-so-spectacular e-retail websites than there are Googles and Facebooks, but they are all part of the web-as-an-economic-vehicle.<p>I think that the number of cosmetic bugs on a site is merely a measure of technical competency for whoever coded / qa'ed the site before it went live. Extrapolating this measurement to all Microsoft operations might be a nice excuse for Microsoft-bashing(tm), but I've been finding this sort of articles counter-productive especially when people start talking about such non-scientific measurements such as ""getting the web"", instead of focusing on things like current research and interesting acquisitions done by Microsoft recently.",1231870739.0

Bayes rule implies that divorcees are therefore more likely to be the type of people who make bad marriage choices, and second/third marriages are more likely to fail.<p>I'll give a simple numerical example. I assume some people marry badly, and have an intrinsically higher probability of divorce. I assume the probability of divorce does not change after the first marriage.<p>Let MB = Marries Badly, and D = Divorce. Assume P(MB)=0.5, P(D|MB)=0.9 and P(D|!MB)=0.1. Then:<p>P(MB | D) = P(D | MB) P(MB) / P(D) = 0.9 x 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.9.<p>So 90% of divorcees marry badly. Therefore, a person who has gotten one divorce has a probability of getting divorced on their second marriage of:<p>P(D | MB) x 0.9 + P(D | !MB) x 0.1 = 0.82<p>Therefore, in this model, 50% of first marriages and 82% of second marriages will end in divorce.",1231870455.0

Obviously that's sometimes necessary and good. It's not the same thing as mandating a standard-for-how-all-interfaces-shall-be-defined-and-all-grammars-declared.

A bunch of oil companies took years to define it. Do you know what happened? First, the overwhelming majority of projects still use the old ASCII format which is much easier to work with.
