My suggestion would be to try and work with a small start-up who wants to quickly build some sort of international presence in a country of your choice and go live there for a year. That way you're working on something cool, you're still building your skills, but you're also able to take advantage of doing some travel outside the U.S. Given your background I'm sure someone would take a chance on you as a good business development guy.",1246733623

Several reasons for that:\n1. The countries many immigrants are from, you know they have very affordable medicine and education (former Soviet Union, for example), so in fact any  modern American big software company parasite on this cheap facilities, without any interest in developing similar things domestically.\n2. There plenty of examples of countries with high rates of innovation, but with low immigration rates: Sweden (ericsson), Finland (Nokia), Japan.\n3. I dare to claim, that immigration erodes values of American society.Imagine a person from China or India (the country where 60 million people literraly  live in poop, they are born in cast of poop-cleaners-by-bare-hands), the person comes to USA and imeddiately becomes middle class (upper sometimes).

What it shows me, that there is a real demand for highly skilled engineers, even in a downturn,  and a lot of ""i am an American, I can't find a job lets send the h-1bs home"", are probably voices from people that have no talent, or desire to work.<p>This is truly work Americans can't do, as I am not cheap at all, actually very expensive, money and paperwork wise.<p>The secret in the Silicon Valley is that 80% of the code is produced only by 20% of the engineers. If I have my own company, (or you had your own), I'd want to hire from that 20% pool, no matter what their race, ethnicity, or immigration status they are. Unfortunately, you have people on the 80% pool, that scream (or wishfully thinking) that if immigrants weren't here, there would be able to command higher salaries, and find job easily.<p>It is often much easier to blame others, instead of just looking in the mirror.",1246731510

This is already taxed money so thats even more than it sounds.<p>So that means you currently have 5 years of complete freedom to discover what it is that you want to do.<p>Move to Silicon Valley, start a startup, or join one. Or go travel. Nothing really broadens your mind like travel. And you can easily do that on $20,000 a year if you have no other commitments.<p>It's not $100,000 that you have saved up. Its 5 years.

I use my workstation for everything else.  That gives me a strict division between productivity sucks on the Windows laptop and productive work on the Linux box.  When I want to focus, I can sit with the laptop outside my field of view, so I don't see new emails and IMs.  If I need to consult html docs while I'm coding, I use Conkeror on my Linux box so I'm not tempted into random surfing.  Using Conkeror and Awesome WM on my Linux box makes it very no-nonsense and very conducive to concentration.<p>Ummm, so, I already voted for Linux since that's where all the work gets done.

I'm sure others will mention the obvious political and government things. I'll risk the ensuing flame war and suggest that the lifestyle in America is better. My roommate's girlfriend is from a small town in mainland China, and by small town she means 1 million people. Her parents live in a 2 room apartment in one of those gigantic concrete high-rise complexes. In order to escape that sort of lifestyle you actually do have to be the cream of the crop entrepreneurial engineer with the blessing of the government. Even then, when you succeed you're just living in the same type of city, but maybe in a nicer apartment.<p>In contrast my parents are from a small town in the USA and they have a big house and 3 cars and play golf every thursday morning and have 4 kids and a bunch of nice stuff and can afford to travel to hawaii, or arizona, or montana, or wherever. And they are just normal, average people who didn't even start their own multi million dollar business with the blessing of the government.<p>There are definitely people who prefer the bustle of the city and for whom work and achievement trumps all else, including creature comforts. But for people who are into the 2nd type of lifestyle I've described, there's only a few places in the world where it's relatively easy to achieve: the USA, Canada and Australia. Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I know about China, I don't believe that sort of lifestyle is possible for anyone.",1246730714
