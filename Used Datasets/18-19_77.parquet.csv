In my experience, this statement is only said by people who have never tried.<p>For example, numerical calculations that are highly SIMD can be improved substantially by using SSE instructions. Autovectorization is ok, but not great. Furthermore, a programmer who is familiar with SSE instructions can alter/swizzle data to make things easier to use with SIMD instructions. Yet further, a programmer can take advantage of things like non-temporal storing which compilers will not do on their own.<p>Now, granted, you can massage gcc into giving you ""good"" code with alot of hints but to do it ""right"" you are still peering at the assembly and making sure gcc isn't doing anything ""stupid"". Highly optimized C code is so dense with compiler directives as to be unrecognizable to someone unfamiliar with the underlying architecture.<p>The belief that your naive for-loop computation is somehow transformed automagically into perfection by the compiler is a pure and unadulterated myth.",1227724660.0

Initially, believing the cavalry men to be intoxicated, the Russian response to this threat was delayed several moments.  Regaining their countenance, Russian commanders ordered the enemy cavalry charging towards them destroyed.  Russian artillery subsequently opened fire, raining destruction on the enemy cavalry.  Les Chasseurs d'Afrique, as shocked and surprised at the developing scene as the Russians, hurriedly organized themselves and rode to the assistance of their bumbling Anglo counterparts, providing cover for the retreating cavalry men.<p>At the end of it all, the attacking cavalry was devastated.  Less than half of the allied cavalry men committed to the initial attack made it back to their lines.  Of this number was their commander, a man by the name of James Thomas Brudenell.  He returned, and considered himself to have given it 'the old college try', went to his yacht, waiting in Balaklava harbor, and ate a champagne dinner.<p>This cavalry unit is known to history as the 'Light Brigade'.  It was commanded by wealthy men who had purchased commissions that more capable, but less wealthy men could not afford.<p>We bear witness to the results of our modern day 'Charge of the Light Brigade' daily in our newspapers, on our favorite internet news sites, on our favorite blogs, and via Fox and CNN.<p>My point is that the current crises will necessitate some rather unpalatable structural changes for the United States.

Why would you use my site vs. flickr or picasa etc... \n1. You keep 100% ownership of YOUR media, you don't have to sell you soul in exchange for a free service. That's why I created this site... those are my pictures and I refuse to give up my rights in exchange for a free service.\n2. The other sites I tried are so clutered with ""web 2.0"" garbage that they are annoyingly slow or loaded with all kinds of ads or offensive material.\n3.

(You yourself said you enjoy discovering new kinds of humor, and kinds of humor implies underlying patterns.) I believe that it is possible to discover these underlying patterns, and then make a determination as to whether a statement falls into one of these patterns or not. This can be done independently of whether or not a person exists who can see that the statement falls into one of these patterns.<p>But I also believe that humor is subjective, in terms of the feeling we get when we hear something funny. I don't believe that this can be quantified or measured-- when I say that humor is objective, I simply mean that a binary determination can be made as to whether or not a statement falls into some underlying bucket.<p>""And your original point wasn't about humor. It was about interest. The two pertinent definitions: 'The state of 'wanting to know or learn about something or someone,"" and 'The advantage or benefit of a person or group.'""<p>My belief is that the first dictionary definitions you list is a symptom of interest, but not what makes something interesting.<p>The Baillargeon paper I cited talks about how babies look longer at impossible events. For example, if you create an illusion whereby you drop a toy and it appears to fall through a table, the baby will look at that longer than if the toy lands on the table like its supposed to.<p>Interesting is very easy to define: Anything that violates our expectancy of how things are supposed to work. (Insight and humor are specific subsets of 'interesting'.) In practice you wouldn't describe something that was insightful or funny as interesting, for the same reason you wouldn't call a senator a congressman even though a senator is a congressman.<p>Anyway, it is this violation of expectancy that makes us want to know or learn something. In other words, when our expectancy is violated we naturally want to either find some new schema, or else amend our previous schema to make it more accurate.<p>Anything that violates our expectancy is interesting in an objective sense. And things that violate expectancy do generally hold our attention. But not always. The reason being that insightful writing is even more compelling than writing that is merely interesting, so it tends to steal our attention away.",1227723142.0

Obviously, that's no way to evaluate competing solutions. We need facts. We need apple to apple comparisons of hardware and operating systems, where we can get them.<p>Of course, every /serious/ business can and should get into the details, but for the sake of argument, I invite you to compare a couple apples from the barrel: Sun Microsystem's Sun Fire X4150 (used by Kirk's site), and Dell's PowerEdge 1950 III.<p>They support /very/ similar hardware options (rack units, CPUs, memory, network, internal storage, out-of-band management, power, expansion slots, etc.), have roughly the same price depending on options (~$7500), and run roughly the same major software (Linux, Solaris, VMWare).
