17,720113,comment,720005.0,720005.0,0,0,grellas,,,"For legal factors to consider in selling a small business, see <a href=""http://www.grellas.com/faq_small_business_007.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grellas.com/faq_small_business_007.html</a> (you may find some of this helpful even if yours is not a ""small business"" sale).<p>For more sophisticated deals, some random thoughts (from a lawyer who has represented many hackers, not a hacker as such):<p>1. Avoid earn-outs if at all possible - if you go with an earn-out, plan as if all you will see will be what you get at the initial closing.<p>2. No-shop clauses are fine but keep them short and make sure they can only be extended by mutual consent.<p>3. Talk with your law firm/CPA firm about tax and structural issues up front, <i>before</i> you do a term sheet. If you have a C-Corp with low-basis assets, an asset sale will leave you with a potential double tax hit. A stock sale or tax-free merger (A, B, or C type) is preferable in such situations but each has limits and restrictions on it - understand the structural points up front, it will help considerably in how you negotiate the deal.<p>Term sheets may be legally non-binding but, you can bet, they will shape your deal all the way through to closing. Structure it right in the term sheet, then, and you will not be haunted by inadvertent blunders up-front that prejudice your deal throughout.<p>4. Watch out for duplicity. Use NDAs and limit due diligence to protect against a buyer's gaining a lot of info about your company and then using it competitively against you after dropping the acquisition.<p>5. In dealing with acquisition teams, make sure to do the primary negotiating with the key decision-makers so as to avoid getting the ""two step"" shuffle.<p>6. Try to limit trailing liabilities on the deal. Limit the size of hold-backs. Keep the reps and warranties as narrow as you or your lawyers can negotiate. Make sure they have a short-term expiration date (e.g., 1 year from the date of closing).<p>I am sure others will have more significant practical points to make. Many other items might be added to this list.",1248374997.0

24,720106,comment,719972.0,720069.0,0,0,skolor,,,"The delayed sign up idea seems to be very potent. Rather than having someone dump all of their information into your database right away (which you then have to save, probably for as long as your app is running), you slowly draw the information out of the user, making the registration process as transparent as possible. If (using your example) Aunt Suzy goes through all the work to sign up, then gets confused, not only does she have a bad taste in her mouth when it comes to your app (""Oh, MyBigApp? Yeah, I tried it once, but after I spent 20 minutes signing up I got confused and left""), she also won't be coming back to use that sign up if she got confused. For the most part, there's no reason to have a user registered for something if they're not going to use it.<p>In regards to connecting apps, I'm really not convinced being able to do that is a good idea (I hate it when people have to post everything they do online to Facebook, or whatever else they use).

I'm less familiar with the linage of Final Cut, but I'm sure whoever developed that before Apple did fantastic work.<p>But, though it's become a cliche in this context, I think what makes these products world-changing is Apple's vision. [EDIT: actually, now that I think about it, it's not their vision. It's their <i>business model</i> (the very thing the OP was deriding). Apple sells hardware and can use software as a loss leader. So it's able to sell Logic and Final Cut for much less than when they were the sole income of their respective companies] After Apple bought Final Cut and Logic, they slashed prices, refined the interfaces to make them much more approachable, and gave users a way to migrate from simple iApps, to Express versions, to the full-blown Studio packages.<p>This ease of use, low cost, and easy migration vision of Apple's all works together to democratize the creation of media. As a platform, it places an emphasis on the <i>creation</i> of media, not merely the <i>consumption</i> of it.<p><i>That's</i> what I find world-changing about it, and I think its all stuff that's happened post-Apple-buyout.

Further, parents in poor families often work excessive hours, and quick meals become the norm due to the lack of time.""<p>I personally think this is BS (sorry for the tough stance) and I agree with others in saying it's an educational thing.  My family grew up in poverty when we immigrated to Canada, but we still managed to eat healthy and cheaply.  My parents also worked crazy amount of hours as the only jobs they could only get were poor paying remedial ones like dish washing.<p>Despite all our hardship, we managed to eat a healthy diet and we were able to do so because my parents understood the value of vegetables and fruit and stretching the dollar when it comes to groceries. Now that I'm all grown up, I can't go more than two days without feeling amazingly guilty if I don't integrate a good serving of vegetables into my diet.<p>When ever I hear stories about how people are claiming that the public is being educated, I always think of this interview that I saw once of a young girl who idealized Jared from the Subway commercials.

What was extremely sad about all of this was, her mom was nodding her head in agreement.<p>I've been out of school for quite some time now, but for the life of me, I can't remember being educated in school on a regular basis on how to eat healthier.

There was kind of a numbers reversal, following the late-September stock market crash. For example, in October 2008, following release of new aluminum, unibody laptops, US retail Mac revenue grew 25.5 percent, while Windows PC sales fell 4.2 percent, according to NPD. By January 2009, Mac retail revenue was down 10.4 percent from a year earlier and Windows PC revenue was flat.*<p>He goes on to say Mac Sales are up for June YOY, while attributing some of this success to price cuts, and noting that while Apple enjoys the high-margin territory firms which are pricing on value are holding onto market share.<p>I think the real losers here are not PCs in general or even manufacturers with a range of offerings like Dell and HP, but other luxury computer brands like Sony and boutique workstation suppliers.<p>As noted, the brick-and-mortar limitation is really distorting. Last time I was in Office Depot or Best Buy, they were strongly emphasizing value over performance with their space allocation.",1248373318.0
