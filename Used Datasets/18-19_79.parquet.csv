It runs VLC, an open source app that plays anything as long as it isn't DRM'd (and some stuff that is DRM'd).</i><p>I really hate this. It seems to me like people really don't understand audio/video encoding and compression. After putting in patches to ffmpeg I found an appreciation for the capabilities and limitations of the software. For example, the reason why his netbook probably isn't able to play 720p H.264 is probably because it doesn't have an integrated hardware decoder chip. The iPad does. After seeing the kind of nasty things that people do with video formats I don't really blame Apple for limiting the video decoder. FFmpeg, for example, is perfectly willing to package AVC/H.264 video and AAC audio into an avi container in complete violation of the specification.<p>It's not like Apple leaves the user no choice, either. Quicktime 7 is capable of transcoding almost everything I've found to AVC/H.264 in an MPEG4 container.<p>I'm not claiming I'm an expert on signal processing, but it always seems like the people who know the least are screaming the loudest.",1270320308.0

The feeling I have is that  I always conceived of the world the way it is now, and it's only now catching up.  Google wasn't earthshattering, although it's true that I do a lot less interlibrary loans.  I keep up on news better, because I always found newspapers tl;dr (except for the comics page, and Web comics are better than anything on there nowadays anyway).<p>I've taught my kids everything they know about the Internet, the only excepting being that my daughter researched Twitter for me and how to tweet from my phone - but only after I asked her to.  And yeah, she found xkcd on her own - a year after I'd been following it.<p>So I just don't buy it.   Unless I'm a digital native, which is chronologically impossible, I'm forced to say that there are just some people who deal well with the Internet age and some who don't, and there is a generational skew due to exposure - but talking about ""natives"" vs. ""immigrants"" is boneheaded.<p>Your larger point is spot-on.  I have yet to interest either of my kids in programming, despite numerous attempts.  For my son, 11, the computer is essentially a gaming and cartoon serving machine, and for my daughter, 15, it's a portal to her friends around the world and something to write her fan fiction and more serious work on, and find music.

The breakthrough concept that turns everything on its head is usually itself just one sentence.<p>In programming, we change two lines and then run the program again, we build on known, tested libraries and languages, we develop a concept on paper and then implement it. And because these things are built on a small foundation of logical concepts, we can build the language to ensure ever-greater levels of self-consistency that would otherwise only be manifested at runtime.<p>Feedback loops.<p>The fiction writer has a short feedback loop - the ""state"" of a story is small - no explosions of complexity as one would get with loops or recursion - so its progression can be kept in her head.<p>The programmer has a longer feedback loop, because her expectation is not to maintain the entire progression of the program in her head, but to let the computer do it and then display the results in some manner.<p>Dynamicness optimizes the feedback loop for greater incrementalism: the program runs until it hits any one point where an irreconcilable error is encountered, and then multiple options are available to fix the error and even let the program continue.<p>Staticness optimizes the feedback loop for ""batch"" error-checking: the programmer writes a full body of code she thinks is correct, with no run/test cycle to speak of, and then gets all the errors at once. When the program compiles, it works.<p>Since we can't implement either ideology perfectly, it's probably best to have some of _both_.",1270319703.0

At that point, if you can get two or three times as many cores, running about the same speed, on the same number of square millimeters, with the same power usage, then your computer will effectively be two or three times as fast. At that point, it becomes hard to justify the massive amounts of chip real estate and power consumption devoted to decoding 386 instructions, slightly accelerating single-threaded performance with huge out-of-order execution buffers, and that kind of thing.<p>Tilera seems to be kind of betting on this today. GreenArrays is betting on it a lot harder; they have what appears to have taped out silicon with 144 processors, running an aggregate of 100 billion instructions per second, on 650 milliwatts, linearly scaling down to 14μW on idle.<p>Things I disagree with in your description:<p>• It's not clear that OpenCL or Grand Central will be the software platform on which people will achieve massive parallelism for most performance-critical software.

(I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that you aren't very experienced; otherwise, you would have told us how experienced you are.)  In this way, cooking is like programming.  As with a programming task, a recipe that takes an hour of attention now may take half an hour of your attention next year, and there's no way to enumerate the difference as a handful of tips and tricks.  The biggest difference between a beginner and an expert is that the expert executes the fundamentals quickly and sparely while the beginner gets bogged down in uncertainty.  ""The recipe doesn't specify what kind of oil to use.  Does it matter?  How big is a pinch of salt?  What size and shape am I supposed to cut the asparagus into?  The way I'm holding the knife is giving me a blister.  The dishwasher is running and all the cup measures are inside -- how do I measure a quarter cup?  Do I have to get it exactly right for this recipe?  I forgot to buy carrots.  Do I have to drive back to the grocery store, or will the recipe be fine without them?""<p>None of the answers to those questions could be called ""hacks,"" but the experienced cook saves a lot of time by knowing the answers right away and proceeding without thinking about them.  Luckily, expertise is context-specific, and you can develop narrow yet valuable expertise by making the same recipe several times.  You'll become experienced at that recipe quickly.  If you've made a recipe six times, you can make it in your sleep.  Learn ten recipes and you're set for life, at least for the days when you want cooking to be quick and cheap and predictable.  Just because a dish takes you an hour doesn't mean it won't work for you; it only means you're slow because it's your first time making that dish.<p>Repetition is also the key to improvisation.  With a little experience, you can browse through the grocery store (or your refrigerator) thinking about how your favorite recipes might accommodate the attractively-priced (or about-to-go-bad) ingredients that are available to you.<p>Of course, you need recipes to get started.  Here are two books that have been extremely useful to me.  (My bookshelf looks much more interesting and sophisticated than this, but like you, I need healthy, quick, and cheap more often than I need a cultural or historical adventure.)<p>Kimiko Barber's <i>The Chopsticks Diet</i> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chopsticks-Diet-Japanese-inspired-Recipes-Weight-Loss/dp/1904920985"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chopsticks-Diet-Japanese-inspired-Reci...</a><p>This book has the kind of gimmicky title I would normally pass over in a bookstore, but I went looking for Kimiko Barber's books after reading some articles by her in the <i>Financial Times</i>.  Fast, simple, probably dumbed-down Japanese cooking.  You won't have to adjust the portion sizes.<p>Mollie Katzen's <i>Vegetable Heaven</i>  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mollie-Katzens-Vegetable-Heaven-Uncommon/dp/0786862688/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpi_11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mollie-Katzens-Vegetable-Heaven-Uncomm...</a><p>Not exciting, but more of my quicky standards come from this book than from any other.<p>If you want particular recipe recommendations, I would say:<p>Bean stews and chili are great for freezing in large quantities.  When you freeze food, remember to store it in quantities that are convenient to reheat later.<p>Miso soup is ridiculously easy.  Here's a relatively complex variation, still ridiculously easy, that is a complete meal thanks to the addition of soba noodles:  <a href=""http://kitchenoperas.com/2010/01/11/miso-soup-with-soba-noodles-and-greens/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kitchenoperas.com/2010/01/11/miso-soup-with-soba-nood...</a><p>Salads and raw veggies are great.  You can skip the bowl  and just shovel them into your mouth.  They're great for snacking on at the office, especially since packing them just means rinsing, patting dry, and putting them into a Tupperware container.  Expand your idea of what's great for snacking:  the older you get, the more asparagus and green beans taste like candy.<p>There are a lot of ways to consume wilted, sad-looking greens that you can't afford to throw away:  learn them and don't forget them!  Miso soup, pasta puttanesca, stir-fries, perhaps anything with a sauce with a strong flavor.<p>If you like kimchi, there's nothing that can brighten a cold lunch or add flavor to a boring dish of rice and lentils better than a few pieces of kimchi!<p>P.S.  Final edit, I swear:  Sharpen your knives!  Using a very sharp knife instead of a very dull one cuts your vegetable prep time in half.  The easy way is to take your knives to a professional.  The geekier, cheaper, but much more time-consuming alternative is to get a sharpening stone and learn to do it yourself.",1270317888.0
