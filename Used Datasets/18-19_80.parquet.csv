30,1273486,comment,1273397.0,1273397.0,0,0,secretasiandan,,,"I would stress that with Excel, changing the underlying data set, especially dimensions of your data is annoying and not very automate-able.  This is the case even when the analysis is the exact same or very similar as the original.  You either need to copy formulas over for every data set/sheet or write VBA code to automate this, which still isn't as flexible as in R.<p>Excel is better if you want to pore over the data: study a piece, scroll down, study some more.  R is better if you can easily pinpoint the areas you think are interesting and index directly into the array.  Excel has indexing capabilities (F5 which goes to an address), but not by row/column names.<p>Additionally, you can't do multi-step analysis that involves segmentation/sub-setting of the data very easily with Excel.  This is related to the first point about changing an underlying data set or its dimensions.  There are ways around this, but they are VERY annoying.<p>I use R for the majority of my analysis.  I used to be a Matlab user but needed to find a cheaper tool when I left my job.  I still use excel for simple data inspection and when I need to send my analysis to other people to peruse.",1271529966.0

We can't guarantee either outcome because what we're selling is the option value."")<p>None of the studies of motivation I've seen have specifically addressed such a situation. They concern motivating <i>good</i> work, not <i>sticking around through a foreseen ownership discontinuity</i>.<p>A stay package may not make people happy and productive, but it does <i>contractually</i> keep them around, giving the new owners a reasonable chance of receiving the knowhow and functioning business, before eventually making their own personnel/motivation decisions.<p>(That's why even though Fred Wilson is right about the stay packages' propriety and value, I don't think there's anything wrong with calling them 'bribes'.
