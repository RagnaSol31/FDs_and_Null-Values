There is also a lot of high end math, but a lot of the useful parts of the field can be understood based on that and say the temperature limits of steel.<p>Add in Stefan–Boltzmann law; which states that amount of thermal radiations emitted per second per unit area of the surface of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (Kelven), and kelvin = Celsius - 273.  Which let's you consider the limits of say a large solar thermal collector.<p>PS: It's often not about precision as much as a sanity check.",1243450779.0

This field includes facets that are very close to programming, such as algorithms, and those that are one layer removed, such as complexity theory. These deep subjects are implied by any kind of programming.<p>- If you believe that today's programming languages have nonsensical constraints, you should explain what those are so that we can all benefit from their removal.",1243450779.0

It's just too easy to do a one way hash.<p>Okay, there is only one reason, if you are building a system that allows the storage of multiple accounts and passwords that are ""re-used"" like in some browsers' auto-complete feature.  Then the concern is security of the local machine and if you use that technology, you're increasing your personal risk.<p>In the scenario I mention there, it is absolutely imperative to use an advanced two-way encryption algorithm.  In that case, the hacker will need to compromise the database and the code, which should be obfuscated as well so the decryption keys are more difficult to discover.<p>There are some hackers who will always be able to hack you and some that will never be able to hack you.

On that subject at least, most women vote with their feet.<p>The current sexual politics of soft polygamy, created mainly by feminism, benefits no one except for a few ""alpha"" males. It's terrible for the majority of men. It's terrible for children. It's terrible for women over the age of 25.<p>""Soul-destroying"" is the best term for the modern dating scene.

But I think in general it was a good thing.<p>So basically what I'm trying to say is that there was a time when women were told ""You can't do this, you can only do that"" (""this"" being things that were considered male like having a job and ""that"" being things that were considered female like staying at home with the kids).  That thinking was wrong.  Feminism combated that thinking and said ""you can do anything you want"" and that was good.  So up until that point I think things were good.<p>But now we have a group that says ""You must do that and you're a bad feminist if you do this"" (see ""this"" and ""that"" explanation above).  That's wrong headed.   And to bring this topic back around to HN I think a lot of the efforts to get women into technical fields are also wrong headed.
