Quite the contrary.<p>If they open-sourced Silverlight, would they lose money from their authoring tools? What they would lose is some level of control, but they could win a big enough user-base to take on Flash, which is still king. Would I care if their authoring tools are proprietary and expensive? Not at all if they're getting the job done, as long as the platform is open.<p>You see, open source is really about economics, being many times a cheaper and more effective way of developing and distributing software. If you want to talk about rights with normal people, you'll have to explain those rights in terms of benefits.<p>Having the ability to share software with your friends is not a good incentive for many software developers. But having your piece of software maintained by others (when you don't want to die doing that) is an incentive.<p>And I don't think that the ""giving back"" attitude should be forced. It should come naturally from the inherent gains. We are so blinded by the individualism promoted by capitalism that we forget sharing and cooperation have real advantages. But being blinded by an ideology with opposites points of view is evenly shortsighted.<p>You see, while many people in Silicon Valley or in Cambridge are working happily in startups or on cool projects that will save the world someday, the rest of the world is kind of stuck in consultancy with flat hourly bills, working on boring and-not-quite-fulfilling projects that in many countries pays less than your average gas-station supervisor. And working on Free Software when your hourly rate is $10 an hour you can trust me it's not that great.<p>Another thing about open-source software is that there are clear disadvantages of the development model. You can see that in the unpolished GUIs of the open-source applications or in the lack of documentation (there are times when I thank God if I find a blog-post with an example for a library I'm trying to use). The notable exceptions are only those where the software itself is a complementary to something else that sells (like hardware, or ads) ... which is ironic since Microsoft was worshiped back in the day by many programmers for being a successfully pure software company (finally, our profession was going to have recognition).<p>So yeah, fighting a war against proprietary software is futile. Proprietary software will never be replaced by ideology. A better business model will (like <gasp> software as a service ... in which the software doesn't even run on your machine).",1254163883

It's not a call to extend the CSS specification or to add support for abstractions in browsers.<p>I have always found it easier to avoid bugs when parsers are dealing with canonical forms.  In other words, make the browser support the absolute minimum syntax required to achieve every effect in CSS.  Anything that's merely ""syntactic sugar"" should be handled at higher levels, and then ""compiled down"" into raw CSS.<p>This restriction not only makes it easier for browsers to agree, but it means that you're only likely to find quirks in your higher-level <i>tools</i>: which, importantly, are <i>outside the end user's domain</i>.  Bad tools can be replaced, or you can adjust your flow to insert post-processing steps that fix the output.  You don't need as many ""debugging tools"" because you can simply examine the generated files to tell if something was interpreted correctly (whereas, if a browser isn't seeing things the way you think, good luck figuring that out without extra tools).",1254163547
