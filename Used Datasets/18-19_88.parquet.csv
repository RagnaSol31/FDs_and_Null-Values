With a distribute system like Hadoop you can build a cluster of cheap machines and spread the computation across them.  With a shared memory architecture you have to scale up with multi-million dollar machines like SGI's altix line.  So if you want to be able to use a cloud of cheap computers you need something like MPI or Hadoop.",1265482700.0

All of them have since disappeared, but all were great ideas that would have survived had they not need to be immensely popular immediately.  One example was a movie streaming service that would right now be way ahead of netflix, which wasn't even a thought at the time, but there just weren't enough people with broadband then.<p>Compare that to now.  I'm running a bootstrapped startup that has time to wait on customers.  We have the patience to work with existing customers and nurture them and make them very happy.  We are cash flow positive and there's really no reason we won't keep growing forever.<p>We got started several years ago and are in a market that sees newcomers come and go within the span of 6 months. I've watched the industry leader crash and burn -- it was venture backed by SAP Ventures and many big names in silicon valley, but it was too soon.  Not enough customers and the vc's closed the doors.<p>Some of our competitors do what they do precisely <i>because</i> they don't have a long term vision.  They have the short term vision that wants to pop!  Get big fast or die.  But not all technology gets big fast.  Sometimes a patient slow growth of customers is the way to go.  That's the traditional way businesses get started, grow and succeed, but today, it seems the majority of tech entrepreneurs think the only way to go is the vc path to spectacular growth, but old style businesses still work in technology too.<p>Lesson is, take your time.  Get profitable enough to quit your job and concentrate on the business and own all of it for yourself.  Slowly grow your revenue like you would a salary or something else.  You don't need a million dollars a year to be happy, if you're making $100k or even $40k on your own with a product you've developed, you can easily live off that and have all the freedom and luxury that comes with being your own boss -- or well, having customers who are your own boss. But with even 10 customers, it becomes a lot easier to say no to the wrong direction and focus on the path forward.<p>On the other hand, it's almost impossible to say no to an employer or a venture capitalist that pays your rent and they can easily steer you in a direction that isn't in your long term best interst, which is and should always be happiness.",1265481089.0

I've known Loren since the day I started at TechCrunch and think he's a funny, smart guy.  But he's also spent a lot of time in the last few months ripping incessantly on TechCrunch.<p>That's sort of his thing — he's been ripping on Scoble and Dave Winer for years, but I suspect he gets a bit more attention when he does the TechCrunch bashing simply because there are quite a few people out there who love to hate TC.  You can get a sense of this by looking through the archives of twitter.com/1938media. Maybe he's really had some epiphany about TC being evil after being friendly with us for years, maybe he's bitter about Michael failing to attend his conference, or maybe he's just doing his schtick.",1265480481.0

People don't just stumble upon it and fall in love. They go to it because they've been told how many other people have gone to it. And we have decided it's still okay to rate things based on how frequently other people go to them.<p>Brusilovsky is a prick. Not because he accepted a present from a business, but because he's spent his entire life doing vacuous, meaningless work in exchange for attention and celebrity. We all gawk and applaud that it's so nice a 17-year-old managed to write for TechCrunch, but when you look at the guy you realize he can't code, can't design, can't write. All he can do is whore, and even that he doesn't do well. But he writes for TechCrunch and so he's worth our time.<p>We care more about quantity than we do about quality, as an industry. Witness the recent conversation about the Google redesign contest, with people bitching and moaning about how the new aesthetic design was ""worse"" than Google's current design because it denied information. We have this mindset wherein we still think Google ought to be everything for everyone; the result is that Google meets a lot of people's needs without really providing a breathtaking experience. Google's the archetypal villain here, that cares more about edging out clickthroughs than it does about anything else. And yeah, it's nice, and yeah, it's made Google the industry leader, but in the end being ranked ",
