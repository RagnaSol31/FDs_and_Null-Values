Partial continuations like shift/reset can be implemented on top of call/cc but not efficiently.<p>More to the point, there is a small but exceedingly vocal subset of the Scheme community that hates the idea that the language should e.g. define a module system even though practically this is an absolute requirement to get any real work done.  It is worth pointing out that until R6RS, which has attracted a great deal of criticism, there was no way to define user-defined types within the language.  ""Small Scheme"" can wither and die for all I care; I want to use the language, not worship it, and so R6RS is right up my alley.",1250881075.0

William Zinser once used an illustration about an exchange between a writer and a brain surgeon where, in response to the surgeon's casual reference to doing ""a little writing on the side,"" the writer gave as a riposte the thought that he would do a ""little brain surgery on the side"" as well. The point: we all think we can write because we all do it, but quality writing comes only through hard work, severe discipline, careful thought, and lots of practice - just like brain surgery.",1250880789.0

The reason they do this is because the first questions most companies ask a potential sales hire is ""who do you know?"" or ""what's your rolodex look like?""<p>When the only relationship of trust is between the sales person and customer, s/he is able to bring clients along with them to whatever new company they migrate to...and show immediate success with new employers in doing so.<p>By creating a relationship of trust between you and your sales team, you are able to break down barriers between the client, and create and more fruitful long term relationship among all parties involved.<p>The other question you should ask is ""why do sales people leave in the first place?""  Again, this gets back to the root of the problem, where most companies create their own coin-operated sales teams.  ""Today's records become tomorrow's quotas"" is something that all top performing sales professionals are keenly aware of.<p>If a sales professional hits 2X of their quota two or three years in a row, and those record sales become next years quota, the resulting book of business is unsustainable in the long term.  Because of that, most top sales professionals will stick around just as long as they are able to maximize their earning potential.  When the inevitable ""down"" year comes around, it's time for them to reassess and start looking for a new opportunity.<p>By setting reasonable expecatations with your sales team year after year - by that I mean set a quota that provides a reasonable rate of return on your investment in their salary - you will no doubt create an environment that ""Group Three"" sales professionals want to be a part of.

I seem to have gotten over my caffeine withdrawals and am feeling much better actually. Today my husband asked me how my head/neck was and I had to admit it was maybe a 1. Maybe. It’s been a really long time since I’ve been able to say that. I can’t believe just getting rid of the pain medication I’ve been taking for years has gotten me to this point! It’s almost ridiculous to think about! Anyway, I’m not perfect yet or anything. I did have a headache last night. But I at least feel like the “routine of headaches” is gone. I no longer get a headache every day at specifically 11:30 am and in the evenings as well like I used to.<p>The diet is still a work in progress but I found a bunch of great recipes that I’m excited to try. I am also in search of some good vegan restaurants because I have a feeling it would be much easier to find something there for me to eat as opposed to most chain restaurants around here. It would just be nice to have the option to eat out occasionally.<p>Other than that, life is fine. I find myself with a lot more patience which is really great for my little one. He’s been a darling this week and it’s so nice to have more fun with him rather than being tired and frustrated with the neck pain and so no patience for him.<p>Also, there were two humming birds flying around my yard all morning.

This might be due to perceived comfort, or perhaps the expense of the fancy dress and its maintenance. Whatever the reason, enforcing a dress code imposes a cost on employees, both financially and in some cases emotionally.<p>In an age of tight money, I would expect that more firms would find this a way to save on employment expenses. Other things being equal, at the margin they'd be able to attract better talent for equal benefits. Or, conversely, they'd be able to attract equal talent while spending slightly less on benefits.<p>Thus, allowing casual dress can be a money saver for companies, with no real cost to implementing it.<p>Several posts in this thread assert that ""dressing up"" is a matter of respect for one's coworkers. I don't see why this is so. Certainly, observing hygiene and grooming habits so as not to be <i>offensive</i> fits into this framework. And certain ritualized situations (weddings, funerals, proms) demand it. But I fail to see how dress fits into the more general case.<p>Indeed, it seems to me that in what we like to think is a diverse, open-minded, tolerant society, that the real act of respect would be to look deeper at a person than just clothes.
