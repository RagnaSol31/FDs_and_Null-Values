I remember interviewing a senior java developer who claimed 5+ years of experience and had no idea what a Singleton was. What made it worse was that even after explaining it to her, she was unable to figure out how to  implement one. \nDevelopers asked the strangest questions when interviewing other developers. I worked with a guy once who liked to ask his interviewees what the decimal value of 0xFE is. One candidate didn't know the answer so my coworker didn't think he could possibly be a good software engineer. I admit that (having done assembly coding in school) it seems odd that any software engineer wouldn't be able to figure out what FE is. But I still thought it was a bad way of testing technical skills. Would you rule out a candidate who doesn't know 0xFE ?",1212087564.0

26,203557,comment,203457.0,203457.0,0,0,Alex3917,,,"So for me the specific example I was thinking of was this:<p>""it's damn hard to get into an Ivy League school. Even valedictorians and kids with perfect SATs are rejected from their top picks every year. But athletes got into the best schools even with mediocre grades...<p>Let's think about this logically. To get into an Ivy as just a student you basically need straight A's, 1400 SATs, and lots of extracurriculars. This meant I'd have to go to school eight hours a day, do two or three hours of extracurriculars, and then go home to six or so hours of homework. As an athlete A's and B's are fine as long as you don't have any C's, and you don't need any major extracurriculars other than your sport. That's what the coaches will tell you when you're being recruited at least, but in reality a couple C's are usually fine if you just want to go to an Ivy but you don't much care which. This would require going through the motions of being a student, and then practicing a couple hours a day year-round. Same result, less work, more fun!""<p>The logic behind this doesn't really make sense unless you're stuck in the mentality of a zero-sum world. That said, this thinking seems to have been a precursor of sorts to later and more interesting musings on zero-sum systems.<p>I can only remember a handful of specific ideas I had before that which I'm still vaguely impressed with today.",1212087227.0

Getting introduced to a VC via a connection, even a very casual connection, is virtually the only way that you will have the opportunity for a first meeting, unless your site is already well-known.<p>""what kind of deals should i demand/expect?""<p>Depends a lot on how much you have to show.  If you already have a product and users, your valuation will be higher and you can get a better deal.<p>""at what stage is good to start seeking VC?""<p>When your company absolutely needs the money and/or connections to succeed.  For some ideas (probably not most web application ideas though), this may be before you even start building the product.  For other ideas, this may never happen at all.  People get somewhat religious in this particular debate, and I won't try to defend one particular side except to say you shouldn't be opposed to VC funding on principle because some ideas absolutely need it, but many web companies don't. You should take a long and serious look at your company to determine which category it falls under.<p>""or shouldnt i seek but let the VCs find me(ie laucnh product and if it is good people will come and VCs will come)?<p>If launching your product and looking to get users before raising money is an option, you should take that option.  There are many reasons for this, and not just ""so the VC's will come to you."" The most serious is that when you raise a large sum of money to execute on a certain idea, you lose flexibility in being able to change your idea. If you don't have any users yet, changes are good that your idea will need to change. If you've raised VC money, it can be difficult (but by no means impossible) to sell them on your new direction.<p>""what is normal, VCs approaching startups or startups approaching VCs?""<p>I would say that a startup approaching a VC is many orders of magnitude more common, but a VC approaching a startup certainly happens and is much more likely to result in a deal being made.<p>""are there a lot of unsinister ""sharks"" in the business?""<p>I think you mean a ""sinister shark"", as an <i>un</i>sinister shark wouldn't be anything to worry about, now would it!  (Plus, the alliteration is spoiled!).  But sure, there are slimy people in any business, but especially in businesses that have the opportunity to make people rich.  Get to know enough people and you should be able to identify who these people are.<p>""what else to think about?""<p>Your product!  Making sure people want it, building it, growing it.  This should be your primary focus.<p>Also, and not to be too impolite about it, you should also think about using proper grammar and spelling on this site if you want people to have a good impression of you.",1212086514.0
