I've never had the street problem but definitely had a fear of being seen in public that led to lots of alone time.<p>Your point about trying to be positive strikes a chord also.  Folks who know me just a bit or only professionally consider me a relentlessly cheerful, encouraging person.  I've always got something great and positive to say about a situation, no matter how bleak it is.  In part, this is because just about anything is better than what I feel inside, so I'm able to spot the positive pretty easily.  Also, it's partly an effort to will a certain view of reality into being.  Nothing's great until someone labels it such.<p>The folks who really, really get to know me tend to get worn out once I let down the shell and let them see a bit of what's going on inside.  In dating relationships I try to ease the other person into understanding how I get by, but even so, there comes a point where they ""get it"" and you see how disappointed they are.  I've found the best approach is to just tell her that I have dark periods when nothing I say will be useful or productive, so I'm not going to say much.",1245524349.0

It's just different.<p>Yes, in academics, professors X,Y and Z will usually try to get you to introduce their pet subjects in review.  You also later find out that getting a paper approved has a lot to do with who you know (as opposed to <i>what</i> you know), and that getting the choice talks, collaborations and grants has a lot more to do with schmoozing and networking than anyone likes to admit.  It's a social problem.<p>But you know what?  That's life.  Humans are fundamentally just a bunch of howler monkeys, flinging poo at the cage walls and trying to steal the shiny rock (or the girl) from the alpha.  Put more than a few people together in any activity, and you'll get competition, preening, back-biting and politics.<p>In academics, powerful professors demand that you brown-nose and compete for favor;  in industry, powerful rich people do the same.  In academics, you find that most days are spent managing mundane chaos, with real research advancements happening only a few times a year;  in industry, most of your time is spent appeasing people, reacting to short-term crises, and coordinating with your co-workers.  When you really think about how chaotic humans are in groups, it's amazing that forward momentum happens at all.<p>Point is, I don't think it's fair to imply that ""interesting"" scientists migrate to industry because of some fundamental difference in values.  Personally, I made the migration because the monetary up-side is much better in industry.  Otherwise, I think the bullshit-to-accomplishment ratio is roughly the same.",1245523869.0

Do you really think that there are 100,000 evil, evil people who are on a crazy power quest to dominate the world by destroying computing for everyone else? No. These are people who love technology and honestly believe they are doing right by the world.<p>OK, so assuming that is true. How do I explain why IE is so broken?<p>Microsoft is an ENTERPRISE software company. Consumers are small potatoes, who, until recently, were completely ignored by the brass of the company. When enterprise customers have an itch, Microsoft will accept their damn good money to scratch it. If there's no itch, there's no scratching.<p>Many years ago, Internet Explorer rendered the web just as well as any other browser out there. Microsoft added proprietary extensions in order to be able to build things customers wanted. They didn't fix bugs that customers weren't complaining about. Maybe the individual engineers comprehended the importance of web standards, but leadership hadn't even heard of them. Besides, Microsoft wasn't even sure this web thing was going to take off. So when enterprise customers stop complaining - when their _intranets_ were good enough - Microsoft stopped investing in browsers. Simple as that: move on to the next thing that will make us money.<p>Lest we forget: Microsoft ""embraced"" the web by writing IE. Then they ""extended"" the web by inventing Ajax <<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)",

Feeling happy happens very rarely, never last more then a few hours at best, and just plain feels weird, wrong almost.<p>A recent medical problem however pushed me over the edge. I want crazy for a few weeks.<p>It was a terrifying experience. While I never heard other voices, I did hear a constant chorus of ideas very clear and very specific and boy did they ever make my usual dark view of life look positively joyous.<p>Added to that was a constant feeling of crippling fear, basically a continuous panic attack and insomnia.<p>That constant chorus of dark ideas was about every negative thing you can think of.

But I am not going to let that part of me run things. I make real everyday efforts to be less dark and cynical.

25,666656,comment,666360.0,666360.0,0,0,dkarl,,,"I find this perspective appealing and romantic, but there's another part of me that protests that skilled labor is as vulnerable to technological progress as any other work, and that any romanticization of it is in danger of being opposed to progress.  Like medieval guilds, it's based on the assumption that there's a fixed amount of work to be done in each profession.  What happens when his town doesn't need small engine mechanics anymore?  Economic dislocation, retraining in a different profession, something that rips away <i>his</i> basis for a fulfilling life.  What happens when time after time, it's more sensible to replace than to fix?  What happens if technology removes the mystery and challenge from his job?  Any technological challenge or mystery indicates a deficiency in the underlying technology which will someday be remedied.  Also, don't forget one of the fundamental laws of software:  your intellectual interests and the interests of your users are almost always in opposition.  99.9% of the time, there's an easy, simple, boring way to do something, and you wish you could try something interesting instead.<p>The Golden Rule prohibits doing things the interesting way at the expense of your users, and in a way it prohibits his entire vision of work.  He thinks it's a bad thing that parts are cheaper to replace than to fix.  Ecology aside, that's a very selfish way to think.  It's Luddism.  He wants people to forgo cheaper and more reliable transportation so he can have the pleasure of fixing their engines in a less efficient, more expensive, but more intellectually rewarding way.  That's fine if he makes his living doing boutique work for well-off people who romanticize handicraft and buy his services as a narcissistic enjoyment of their own enlightenment, but it takes on a different tone when he's fixing the motorcycle of a working-class guy who needs it to get to work.<p>The basic problem is that anything done on a human scale is extremely expensive unless the customer makes a whole lot more money than the person doing the work.  Again, it's fine when a small number of uncommonly competent people produce expensive, boutique work for the rich.  Maybe it's even fine when an extra-smart guy like him decides to live a modest life fixing motorcycles.  It's not fine when regular joes have to depend on the limited competence of other regular joes for such a vital thing as transportation.  It's fine when it's one guy with a PhD writing a book for a bunch of urban keyboard jockeys, but an entire economy full of the work he imagines would SUCK, s-u-c-k suck.  The few areas where people deal with hands-on craftsmen are a nightmare.  Plumbing and contracting are crapshoots.  You can pay a big chunk of your monthly budget for shoddy work.  Imagine that model extending to everything you buy.<p>If you're over forty, there's an easy way to compare craftsmanship with the soulless corporate model.  Remember what it was like to take your car to an auto mechanic instead of a dealership?  Remember the grizzled guy with greasy hands and decades of wisdom who loved taking things apart, understanding how they worked, and finding the most elegant way to solve things?  Yeah, he took days to work and got things right about 80% of the time.  The soulless corporate dealership model actually works pretty well.  So what if they don't care if the work is done in an interesting or elegant way?  They want EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT which is to get your car back to you quickly in working, reliable condition so you don't go around telling your friends how much they suck ass and how their cars break down all the time.  Whereas this guy wrote an entire book about what HE wants to get out of fixing your stuff.",1245523154.0

I have few attributes that I suspect are behind my depression. This being one of them. I have been doing the same- but unlike the OP and others, I get depressed that I bought a book and by not reading it completely, I didn't give its due. I take it very personally that I have Cormen's Algorithms and not gone past chapter1. It's like insulting the writers- i don't know if you get it. It's like you want to be the most passionate religious man on earth and the holy bible you really wanted to read and you know that is what you want is lying on the shelf, while you are trying to sort floating divs on a web page...and whenever i pick up a book, i will hit a block where it gets difficult to understand and because i am used to reading other books in a more casual way, i come to tell myself how dumb i am. i convince myself this to be true when i read about everyone i follow and all the books they have read...it's a vicious cycle that's been eating me inside out - in almost a literal sense.<p>...But many a times, I will just grab a book (anything - even non technical) and read it while sitting on the throne - read a few lines and ponder over it. my favorite is sicp - which i have not completed after having it well over a year.

Erik Naggum, in his online capacity, was a consummate intellectual bully. (It's hard to imagine anything less true of PG than that.) You know how everyone talks about how dysfunctional the Lisp community is? Naggum did more than anyone else to poison it.  Go read the archives of CLL and see for yourself how it starts out as a wellspring of intelligent and civil discourse and then decays under the influence of some smart, funny, nasty characters. The whole thing is a case study in the fragility of online communities.<p>As one longtime Lisper explained to me, Naggum was so smart and willing to put so much time into it that he became a torque on the whole thing. Most people who found his style obnoxious simply left, and for many (not all) who remained he became the local standard. People began to imitate him and it ultimately affected not only that group but the Lisp world as a whole. Many nice people have tried to repair the damage, but it may never happen: the niceness required to do so is orders of magnitude greater than the poison. It's like trying to clean up an oil spill.<p>Erik Naggum was obviously really smart and could be quite funny (I enjoyed that aspect of his writing), and for all I know he was a smashing great guy in person - but as far as the above-mentioned harm goes, those things made it worse, not better.<p>Edit: given that HN's defining quality is to foster intelligent and civil discourse in a way that <i>doesn't</i> get poisoned, your equivalence (and the place you posted it) are kind of ironic.

The field of physics is so large and the amount of knowledge and sophistication required in both mathematics and physics to actually ""discover laws of the universe"" that it would be very difficult to achieve such a level by simply independent study.</i><p>I wanted to disagree with your sentence, but now I see it is not grammatically valid. I'll try to guess what you meant and disagree with that.<p>I heard this argument many times. It's basically, ""There's too much physics to do physics!"" Just because there's a lot of physical knowledge out there, doesn't mean that you have to be a super-genius to do fundamental work. I don't know exactly how to explain this, but I think I can equate it to the internet business, which is probably more familiar to most HN readers.<p>What people say about science can also be said about the internet business. There are so many companies working on internet products, so many start-ups and so much money being poured into this, that surely you have to be a genius with a lot of money and connections to do something that will make a difference!<p>But we know that's not true. And I claim it's not true for science either.<p>--<p><i>it would be very difficult to achieve such a level by simply independent study [...] I think there is too much made about autodidactism.</i><p>I think you're dissing autodidactism too much. What do you think about people teaching themselves to program?<p>Also, just because you're studying independently, doesn't mean you don't consult with other people. I routinely consult with grad students.<p>Also, when you're doing research, you're being autodidactic by definition.<p>--<p><i>Sure, there people like Srinivasa Ramanujan but they are very, very rare. [...] how many autodidacts take their learning to such a rigorous degree?</i><p>How many HN readers actually found a successful start-up, get rich, and live the rest of their lives leisurely working on interesting problems? Probably not too many. But it's not a reason to give up.<p>--<p><i>I just don't think we can say ""See, academics aren't even interested in learning about the World. They are glorified bureaucrats that can solve differential equations.""</i><p>It's a generalization. There are still many fine scientists.

Way more $$ in that than academia.<p>Similarly, there's more $$ in working in industry with a PhD rather than academia.
