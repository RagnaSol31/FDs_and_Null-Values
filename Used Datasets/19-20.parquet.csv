Many of these services might not even allow you to enter any data, but at least you would get to see what they look like on a daily basis. You can give really early feedback as well.",1174506874

Still biggest thing for me as a would be watcher, needs stickyness.  I like the fact you can embed justin like a widget, and all the bits you have to rss it out etc is nice but overall stick is lacking.  <p>Spend, Build, Learn, Craft, License, Sell thats yer best bet here.  I seriously doubt these guys can go a year, and if they could i mean my god, gun to head please, eventually the audience will WANT you to turn the thing off.  People like blogs for stories and threads and ideas that get manifested into an entry, in a real time stream, that after thought processing isnt there, so you may see it you may not, stickyness is relying solely on the person in play and whether or not somethings really interesting to see.  <p>",1174506268

Which in turn may lead to revenue problems at many advertising supported sites.  Also, not every site is suitable for PPA - since they won't convert well (domain parking being an extreme example).  It will be interesting to see if there is any impact on Google's short term revenue.",1174505141
