What most of these commentaries seem to miss is that the material cost of the AppleTV is only going to drop since the hardware requirements aren't going to change much.<p>Look at the bill of materials. There are $100 tied up in CPU, Chipset GPU & network chip.  How much will that cost in 18 months?",1181332678

I don't need a $1B return, the VC does!<p>It's critical not to confuse what a VC considers successful to what a founder would consider successful. The two are not one and the same. <p>Getting a VC to fund you is a means to an end, and you do it when you think (as they say) that you have a $1B idea, since you'll need all that cash to make it worth anyone's time.<p>Bootstrapping a company though doesn't have those issues. You should use this approach when you have an idea that may be profitable and good to you, but isn't going to change the world. (Note that this definition classifies 95% of startups out there today)<p>You only get into trouble when you're looking for VC money for something that isn't likely to pay off. VC's don't care, because they leverage you as a 1/10 chance already. ",1181331305

13,26932,comment,26926.0,26926.0,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"Actually, Facebook generates a great deal of revenue via advertising.  That said, I will concede that the ad based Web 2.0 business model has yet to be tested in an economic downturn.  This is something that could leave a Web 2.0 company at the whim of unscrupulous hedge fund managers in the public markets.  If their revenue proves to be susceptible to downturns, it will be a less than happy time for Bay area employees.  Still, perhaps these companies will be able to come up with a new revenue generating product line.  I know that most Web 2.0 entrepreneurs can trot out a list of other ""business models"" a mile long.  However, the issue with them is that they generate revenue in the millions in 'best case' scenarios.  What the markets would be looking for is revenue in the hundreds of millions, or billions.  At a MINIMUM tens of millions in the 'worst case' scenarios.<p>I think that Facebook has the best chance of ALL of the Web 2.0 sites to make a run at the public markets.  Maybe they can charge the users for access later.  Or perhaps they can charge all of the developers for access to the platform API.  Maybe they will make contracts with advertisers that span YEARS while the internet ad boom is hot.  That way they will still have money to get them through to the next ad boom.  There are a lot of things they could do.",1181329607
