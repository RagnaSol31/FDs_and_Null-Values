2,109266,comment,108861.0,108861.0,0,0,eugenejen,,,"Not in defense of Arc, but so far your definition for ""concise "" is the length of the program. But by mandatory alternating '{' and '(', you add a level of complexity in grammar to Arc' . I guess that is the reason you feel it as less powerful. So maybe 'concise' does not mean 'short' but means consistent and easy grammar for expressing idea. I guess that's why people like Ruby better than Python better than Perl.",1202155056

I'll think about it some more.  I've tried to keep as much out in the open as possible, but it's generally tough to tie an action to no one if you want to do something with it later.  Maybe OpenID will help in this regard.  Have to look into it.",1202154402

Maybe I am living in fantasy land, because I was a Java developer most of the time, but I couldn't care less if my web applications run on Linux., OS X or Windows, if the system admin can ensure me that it is secure (or at least takes the responsibility for it). And all other web development languages, Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP and so on are all available for Windows, too, so where is the problem?<p>Does Yahoo have any other desktop applications besides the useless messenger? If not, then everything else is web applications, so most of their engineers should be fine. Only the sysadmins might be in trouble, IF MS decides to switch over to Windows servers anyway.<p>I know MS switching to Linux seems unlikely, but wouldn't it be cool? ;-)<p>I just don't think that MS are the evil empire most people seem to make them out to be. They solved some really hard software problems, that for example Apple never had to solve (hardware compatibility). They really did useful research in usability. They never were a monopoly. And they made some bad design decisions, but to their defense, a few years ago security wasn't the big topic that it is today. I can't think of an excuse for Vista, though.<p>Personally, I also use Linux, btw., I am definitely not a MS fanboy.",1202154104
