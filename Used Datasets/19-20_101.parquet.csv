The original design was targeted as efficient, long distance flying, at the expense of capabilities like aerobatics; according to the article, this guy has stepped up his with a re-designed engine an ignition system.

Planes can achieve substantially better fuel economy than land-based vehicles because of 2 factors:<p>1) More flexibility in body design.  Cars must have 2/3/4 wheels with reasonable clearance to maintain safe balance on the road surface, which usually adds to drag.  Planes can vary from tri-wing to tailless flying wing.<p>2) Low air resistance at high altitude.

Apple never intended for anyone to SSH into their device or see a shell at all.<p>2. Many users install sshd on their jailbroken iPhones without knowing or caring about the implications, and leave it installed and running.<p>There are a few possible solutions to this problem:<p>The maintainer of the sshd package should prompt to change the mobile user's password at install time, disable root SSH access, and install sudo. It would also be a good thing to only allow SSH over WiFi (by default).<p>Maybe a status bar icon to indicate when SSH is enabled should be installed by default, and SSH could not run at startup but require that the user activate it per-boot.<p>(Actually, BigBoss, the developer of the popular dashboard application SBSettings, REMOVED the option to permanently disable SSH access, arguing that SSH is often the only way to fix up an iPhone that won't boot into the GUI and that it should start unless the user disables it for that boot. I disagree with this decision and think that, at the very least, sshd should shut down after the device boots successfully.)<p>The root problem here is that the developer of sshd for the iPhone probably released it to be used as a debugging tool by other developers and hackers.
