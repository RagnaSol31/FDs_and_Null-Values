I have things I'm strongly but quietly passionate about, and don't feel the need to make a show of it.  I know there's a famous quote about that somewhere, will post if I can find it.<p>There's also the problem that I express myself much better in writing than verbally.  This is definitely a problem I'm working on, but many times when I start talking about something I'm passionate about I feel like I'm making a hash of the explanation and not doing it justice, or worse sounding like a bs'er.<p>Point being, don't take a perceived lack of enthusiasm for actual lack of enthusiasm (or more pertinent, lack of dedication).

10,3008798,comment,2982256.0,2994269.0,3,0,BrendanEich,,,"Look at what's actually happened, never mind the future:<p>1. Dart development (Dash, whatever, and there may be more, including CSS and HTML killers; not sure, rumors swirl) has been ongoing for approximately 2 years -- <i>or more</i>. It didn't start last November.<p>2. Google members of Ecma TC39 have been working on ES.next (some harder than others, I observe) without being able to show how Dart solves ""unfixable"" JS problems. Such demonstrations would help either:<p>2a. steer JS toward fixes if the ""unfixable"" assertion is false (as seems likely to me; little is unfixable on the web), or else:<p>2b. abandon doomed fix-the-unfixable attempts and instead work harder on other and fixable problems (e.g. being a better target language for Dart-to-JS compilation).<p>3. Delayed open-source means other browser vendors and volunteers have a high hill to climb to become committers/reviewers/co-owners, so Google controls the open source. This has happened many times. Competitors are unlikely to join, especially if the code is complex and has deep dependencies on other code (cf. NaCl/Pepper).<p>BTW, WebKit is an example more than a counter-example. It was Apple-dominated even though early-mostly-open, and now Google has taxed Apple committers/reviewers and is gaining the upper hand.<p>WebKit was early-open, a fork of KHTML at first, then set up as webkit.org in 2005 patterned after mozilla.org and in the aftermath of a recruit-half-the-Safari-team-to-fork-Firefox attempt by Flock. This history shows more open that closed, and earlier open at that, but mixed up with various intrigues and corporate control agendas.<p>While the history is not a clean win for any point of view, WebKit is a ""commons"" of its own. Note how chromium.org has to hold the Google-only extensions that Apple <i>et al.</i> won't take.<p>4. Standardization of Dart could happen anywhere, but it would be perceived as anywhere from wasteful to hostile for Google to bypass Ecma TC39. Early opening of a draft spec or even just an open-source implementation again could have won friends and influenced people on TC39. Late opening goes the other way.<p>What actually has happened, from what we already know: late-open.",1316289288.0

In my case, Class Metric allowed me to touch on the big ideas of the week during my lecture, measure confusion on topics, and figure out how TAs should structure their discussions and labs to be the most useful to the most students. The message posting system also allowed TAs to participate directly during lecture as well, answering questions and addressing confusion as it appeared so students could better keep up with the lecture material.

This is a viewpoint found pretty much uniquely in the US, and I see it as a fascinating cultural development. The self-esteem movement is the cause. Anything that makes a child cry or even feel uncomfortable is considered de facto evidence of abuse. Also allowing your children to play in the yard unsupervised is child neglect, as are cases where a small child gets up in the middle of the night, unlocks the door and wanders down the street. We've even had parents arrested for this, charged with abuse, and placed in prison in the US. There's a ""Free Range Children"" movement that counters this thinking with reality checks that a child playing alone outside is not really highly likely to be abducted by pedophiles: according to statistics it's less likely to happen than being struck by lightning (and lightning strikes can happen while playing outside supervised.) Most ""abductions"" are non-custodial parents. Stranger abductions are extremely rare (a dozen a year) but almost exclusively teen girl kidnappings. Small children are almost never taken. Yes there are exceptions, just as sometimes people get struck by lightning.<p>Related to this idea of risk comparing the US to Russia I found this video that some Russian kids posted last week fascinating: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjAMdbEXSdo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjAMdbEXSdo</a> There you will see four school kids, three boys and a girl, wearing street clothes, climb the cable of a fairly tall suspension bridge, while videotaping the whole thing. Meanwhile cars drive by hundreds of feet below. No one calls the police, the kids aren't arrested then placed in state care, the parents aren't arrested and charged with neglect. That's what would happen in the US and people would be on TV denouncing everything about this. Is what they are doing dangerous? Somewhat. The chance of falling is similar to that of playing on the monkey bars, only the potential injuries are clearly more severe. That said, children have died from monkey bar falls. Should climbing suspension cables be advocated or sold as an adventure holiday? I'd say not. I find it very interesting though that in Russia it's not interfered with. The kids choose to do it of their own free will and they are not harming anyone, they are assuming the risk themselves. Let them do it, why not. In the past, Americans accepted more risk, more crying, more stunts. People went to the moon, an intrinsically dangerous task. Russians tried to go to the moon as well. Many died trying. It was considered worth the risk, people took the risks  themselves, and if they were hurt that was part of life.",1316287125.0
