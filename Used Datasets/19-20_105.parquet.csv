Every product is depicted at its exact actual size, regardless of screen size, resolution or web browser. Web shops observe increased customer satisfaction and expect higher conversion rates.<p>Web shop visitors will now be able to accurately assess the real size of products, which previously was only possible in regular shops. ""By making products tangible we can improve the online shopping experience. The ability to better assess online products generally leads to higher conversion rates for web shops."" says co-founder Niels Hoogendoorn.<p>Full-scale product display on the internet is now done for the first time, therefore the size of the impact isn't clear yet. However, according to Hoogendoorn the interest from several large Dutch retailers confirms the potential of True Size. ""We expect to start two large pilot projects this year.""<p>True Size is already available as a plug-in for popular web shop applications such as Magento. The examples on www.truesize.nl/en/ show several full-sized product displays.",1254167895.0

Instantly we were able to play with site colors without search/replace drama. The stylesheets themselves also got far more readable, since you never have to work out in your head what a particular hex string probably meant. Little things like that remove friction from the dev process, and are totally worth it.<p>Of course, once we had all the colors in one place, it became obvious that we had, for instance, 4-5 different oranges all within 15% of each other. We kept the variable definitions, but made them all the same base color.<p>We repeated the same process with font sizes.<p>Finally, we went through all our markup and evicted the Blueprintisms, moving them to the stylesheets via Chris' Blueprint Compass mixins. This was more than a ""semantic vs. visual"" hygiene win. Playing with column widths involved finding where Blueprint classes were passed in or coded into markup. Now they're right there in the CSS, where you expect them to be.<p>We've got tons of opportunities to reduce the stylesheets further by macro-izing or mixin-izing, but just by transliterating our code from CSS to Compass we got a big enough win to be happy for this dev cycle.<p>Can't recommend Compass highly enough.

Have an hourly rate, but make an estimate for all jobs and make the price fixed based on that.  Feel free to overestimate in this part; just make sure that you can come up with a solid number.  For example, ""10 hours, that means you owe me $1000.""  This will be the fixed price for the job.<p>2.  Tell them that if your estimate goes horribly wrong and it turns out that the job is vastly more complex than you thought (but you couldn't know ahead of time), <i>they owe you nothing</i> if they decide to stop the job at that point.  If they want to continue, of course, they can pay you more based on a new estimate.<p>In my experience the primary problem with small clients is that to them, $1000 or $2000 is really big money; they feel very worried about signing it over to you for dubious gain.  So it's very important to make sure that they feel that they are guaranteed to get the return they were promised.  And 2) almost never actually happens in reality; it's just an important step to making them feel comfortable with hiring you.<p>Another reason to go with smaller clients is that it's easier to get a job and there's less overhead; instead of dealing with a huge corporate bureaucracy you can often just get on Skype, discuss what you need, sign an agreement, and start working within an hour or two.",1254166057.0

What's interesting about this Erlang example is that people are actually doing it. My suspicion is that it's more trouble than it's worth. The simplicity of the sexp representation and the fact that it's the same representation as the original language (no special notation for ASTs) are what make macros so natural in Lisp.
