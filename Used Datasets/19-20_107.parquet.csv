Searching for something to read while I was gone, I popped into an Atlanta Barnes and Noble and futilely tried to find some books which were on my Amazon wish list.  Of the five or six I looked for, they didn't seem to have any, save for ""Hackers and Painters"" (which required a storewide manhunt to track down where exactly they had decided to shelve it).<p>I read it in my hotel room that night and spent the rest of the week enthralled by the thought of quitting my job and working at a startup (either my own, or someone else's). When I got home, I told my girlfriend that I was possibly in the middle of something, and would need to take the next few weeks to decide if I was about to upend my (our) life.  She was understandably nonplussed by this discussion.<p>Fast-forward a few weeks and I managed to come back down from the ledge. It may have just been the comfort of home, or the general inertia of a content over-priviledged life; but I reverted back to my previous plans, and set aside the fanciful notion of slaying dragons and working at a startup.<p>So by all means, you should read it. Just be careful about your mindset when you do, lest you also be swept away by notions of ramen dinners and liquidity events. Like a call to the sea, it has the potential to plant itself in your mind and than drive you mad if unheeded. You've been warned.",1315683839.0

As I recall (and I was at Sun at the time in the 'liveoak' group which was to become the Java group) Netscape already had been thinking along these lines and something they called 'netscript' which was their view of how to increase the interactivity of web pages. The original suggestion was to flush it and go with Java to fill this niche, but it was pointed out that having a 'light weight' interpreter already in the browser was useful when all you needed was a ""little"" interactivity (like a pop up over a form field to tell you what it wanted). No doubt somewhere I've got a 1/4"" (QIC) tape with my old Sun email which would let me tell you definitively but that is my recollection. There was concern that people would not know which to use 'netscript' or 'java' and so somebody (and I don't recall who) suggested it be called 'javascript' so that it would be clear it was a lighter weight way of adding interactivity than 'Java'. (most folks at the time thought of 'scripting' languages as light weight languages). The thought being ""If its small and trivial just do it in javascript, if its bigger and more sophisticated step up to the power of Java."" At the time I don't think anyone anticipated how much could be put into Javascript, nor how tight fisted Sun would become around Java.",1315683787.0

In fact, the baby boom era was unusual -- with the possible exception of the first industrial revolution in Britain (1700s), it is without precedent in history.  Two underlying factors are responsible: 1. the destruction of all other industrial nations in WWII (and consequent international demand for the dollar), and 2. cheap energy.<p>In 1947 the US had the world's only intact industrial infrastructure.  This created tremendous overseas demand for our goods and our currency.  As reconstruction abroad rapidly succeeded, the demand for the latter began to outstrip demand for the former, and we were all too happy to supply Eurodollars to meet it.  By 1972, foreign claims on US gold reserves were totally unsustainable and Nixon unilaterally ended the Bretton Woods agreement.<p>Lightning struck twice on our shores with a sustained period of unbelievably cheap petroleum, which also ended in the 1970s.  Recent work in thermoeconomics suggests that technology improvements are deflationary unless society can increase its gross energy consumption.  Today's ICs are thousands of times faster than those of 1980, but they do not cost more.  This is an efficiency improvement - a deflationary effect.  (This deflation is largely missed by typical macroeconomic measures, which don't handle ""hedonic"" change well.  The classic demo is to let people spend inflation-adjusted dollars in a catalog from 1980, and one from 2011.  Nobody buys much from the older catalog.)<p>Building tract homes by the millions, on the other hand, requires increased gross energy consumption and is therefore monetized and reflected in measures like real GDP/capita.  A similar issue exists around funding for ""R&D"".  You can only fund the R.  Since 1980, there's been an outright explosion in the number of scholarly publications disclosing promising breakthroughs, but breakthroughs can't penetrate society without energy.  They sit on the page.<p>Today, we are a people harboring postwar expectations in a world of global competition and expensive energy.  President Obama's recent speech was, like many he's given before, a populist appeal for a protectionist return to postwar conditions, when a high school diploma and a pulse could confer property ownership.  Such measures cannot succeed.*<p>One of the most important roles of government in industrial society is to subsidize the production of energy.  For the past 40 years, our government has sat idle (or even enacted counterproductive policies) while the real cost (EROI) of our energy sources has skyrocketed.<p>A common claim in connection with such graphs is that changes around 1980 are due to tax policy.  I personally favor progressive taxation (and models suggest it can help with income inequality) but to suggest that tax policy is solely responsible for changes seen since 1970 is ignorant at best.  And such claims are seldom accompanied by notice that all income quintiles (and all races) have marginally higher real income today than at any time in the past (effects of the great recession aside)... a moderately reassuring fact that would be left out only by someone attempting to tell a story.  Psychologists know that income inequality has real, negative effects, so we should try to address it.  But we mustn't do anything that would disturb the modest Pareto growth we have.<p>* Greenspun's comments on Obama's speech are also excellent: <a href=""http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2011/09/08/obamas-speech/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2011/09/08/obamas-speech/</a>",1315682910.0

It's already possible to get power and heat density that is more than what your typical datacenter can handle.

There is a reason that local politicians will try to move the seat of government back to Houston or Dallas every so often ;)<p>Texas, though still a 'stronghold' for the Right at the moment, is getting whittled down.  For example: in the Fort Worth area, one of the reddest in a red state, 12 years ago was voting 96% Republican.  4 years later it was 88%.  These days it is around 65%.  Strongly red to be sure but the trend is unmistakable.<p>Also, a lot of 'Rockstar, Ninja SuperHumans' in SF are eventually going to want to raise a family.  I love SF (aside from the slight claustrophobic feeling it gives me) but it is terribly hard to raise kids there.  Aside from the tiny living spaces and lack of places to play, child care is astronomical.  Austin is a great place for raising a family.<p>Everybody's mentioned the cost of living.<p>Some differences with the Austin 'scene' as opposed to CA.  Ideas are greeted with a bit more skepticism...the second or third question that will always be asked is 'Sounds great!  How is it going to make money?'

Also, entrepreneurs seem to be a slightly older set of people.  Not much but it is noticeable.  One problem is that traditional banks around here (Austin) seem to be next to clueless or just extremely cautious when it comes to technology (if someone has a favorite tech savvy bank(er) in the Central Texas area, please let me know).<p>Anyway, I have convinced people to move from SF kicking and screaming.  They have had a lot of the same reactions of people here (""I never want to be a Texan!"", ""Where will I get good beer?"", ""Is there any good food there?"", ""The jobs are not as exciting."" etc, etc.) and they have ended up being very happy here.<p>Austin is awesome!

Back in late winter this year, I picked up one little Wordpress gig for a startup down in Austin.  It went well. Since April, approximately 95% of the money I've made has come from companies based in Austin TX.  I just got pinged yesterday from a contact about a potential long term dev gig that's looking to train the hire into the CTO over the next 2 years.<p>I'd love to move there because I'm really into the food and the music scene down there, but my Michigander wife is not into the brutal heat.  I'm not sure what my point is, except that in my personal experience, Austin is absolutely exploding right now.  There are at least a couple incubators down there, ala YC.  The culture is really cool.  It's pricey compared to Sussex county NJ, but there's also stuff to do there, not like Sussex county NJ.<p>Cheers.",1315681221.0
