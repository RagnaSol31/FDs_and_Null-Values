12,1704826,comment,1704032.0,1704032.0,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"A colleague of mine from university used to study various things using a C4 rotating mirror camera that was originally designed to film atomic explosions.  The film is in a circle around a centrally located rotating mirror.  Between the film and the mirror is a barrier with 140 lenses, and another barrier with 140 slits.  As the image gets flung around by the mirror it's mostly projected onto the barrier with the slits, but sometimes falls on the slit.  There it goes through the associated lens and gets focused on the film.<p>The camera takes 140 photos in a millisecond, giving a 7 micro-second inter-frame time.  The experiment is done in complete darkness, and is set to trigger a flash of less than 1 milli-second.  The camera has to be loaded and unloaded by feel in complete darkness.<p>The camera itself runs at a pretty high vacuum to allow the mirror to be reasonably large and spin at 60,000 rpm.  The flash has to be pretty bright, and is fed by a 0.5 farad capacitor charged to about 10,000 volts.<p>The whole setup has to be driven from outside the room for safety reasons, but you don't want to be in there when the flash goes off.  You can see it though the wooden door, and the room is noticeably warmer afterwards.<p>It's pretty cool.<p>Edit: Found a photo of it:<p><a href=""http://www.smf.phy.cam.ac.uk/fsp/Equipment/Cameras.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smf.phy.cam.ac.uk/fsp/Equipment/Cameras.html</a>",1284839423

If only he'd got the internal combustion engine to work.""<p>This implies that all the Wrights did was slap an engine on a Cayley design and fly. It's an egregious misunderstanding of the Wrights' numerous essential contributions to flight that made flight possible.<p>1. The Wrights designed and built their own engine from scratch. Nothing available had anywhere near the power/weight ratio they needed. Essentially, the Wrights invented the first aircraft engine.<p>2. They invented the first correct propellor theory, enabling them to produce propellors that were twice as efficient as their competitors'. This, of course, enabled the engine to be half the weight and power. (This factor alone is why I don't believe the other pretenders actually flew - they didn't have the power.)<p>3. They developed a 3 axis control system. This is absolutely crucial to successful flight.<p>4. They discovered that the existing data for airfoil efficiency was wrong by a factor of two. Airfoils needed to be twice the size as was previously thought. The Wrights invented a wind tunnel balance that was able to measure lift and drag, and used it to develop a refined, successful airfoil. Nobody else came even close.<p>5. They developed their technology over a series of increasingly sophisticated prototypes. It's probably the first example of a directed research and development program.",1284839406

If you are a single founder and want to stay that way, then starting a consumer business whose success depends on getting a lot of customers doesn't seem like the way to go. When I do take the plunge and start something of my own, it's going to be something that caters to very few customers, who in turn sell something to a lot of customers (e.g., a publishing platform for authors where you make a cut of every book sold) or who I can charge a lot.

Also, I will admit I was slightly more flustered when they blocked my company account once and was requesting documentation that would be impossible to produce: in that case my personal reaction was anger. However, I again went through the same sequence of ""that doesn't help"", and then had multiple pleasant multiple-hour long conversations with some /epic/ support people who worked their asses off to help me. Being calm and rational, certainly being nice, is very important. I am going out of my way to say this because I do customer service myself, and when a customer ruins my day by yelling at me (or posting public vitriol over what was likely a misunderstanding) it becomes very difficult to be motivated to be helpful, and what you really want in those circumstances is more of an ""above and beyond"" response, which is unlikely to ever happen once you've sent the all-caps angry-mail. :(",1284837450

Obviously legacy systems will have to stay in place until smartphone adoption is as ubiquitous as credit cards are today, and the only person you're inconveniencing by using them instead is yourself.<p>2. My iPhone is smaller than my wallet, and is more indispensable for travel (and would be vastly moreso if I could use it for even a small portion of payments.) I guess this one is just a culture difference, but it looks like the world is moving my way.<p>3. In keeping with the above, you could still carry around your debit card if you want the backup. (Your phone could even act as a passive RFID backup, so you don't have to carry around the card.) But since it wouldn't be your primary method of payment, you would be able to up the security on it such that every payment must be signed for, and signatures actually validated. A bit kludgy, but that's how it is supporting legacy technologies.<p>4. What happens right now if your debit card is stolen? Except without the ""Enter PIN"" part.<p>But seriously, since this technology is customer-initiated, the security of it will continue to improve as security features on phones improve. Whatever my new phone supports — fingerprint, face recognition, geolocation — I can use to authorize payments, and the merchant never has to worry about it.<p>5. There's a tradeoff between security and speed, here as in all things. Maybe this system would wind up being a little slower than our current one, which provides almost no security... I guess that's a fair tradeoff for me. After spending 20 minutes finding my groceries, whether it takes me five seconds or 45 to authorize the payment isn't a big deal. And as smartphones improve, it will get faster and faster.<p>Anyway, if you think what I'm proposing is the heavier, bulkier, or less secure option, I'm not sure if you've thought about what a debit card transaction actually entails.",1284837341

They propose an end-run around this rate-limiting step. In their model, PEP donates its phosphate to PGAM1. Thus, PEP becomes pyruvate. Normally I wouldn't expect this to be a meaningful way to produce pyruvate--but their data appear to support the notion that PGAM1 becomes dephosphorylated at a high enough rate that this process can repeat itself fast enough to sustain pyruvate production. Oh, and phosphorylated PGAM1 isn't just a temporary phosphate holder--they hypothesize (relying on other studies) that it helps shunt carbons into biosynthetic pathways (which you need if you are a proliferating cancer).<p>It's not every day that someone figures out how living cells bypass a canonical rate-limiting step in the fundamental metabolic process shared by all living things.",1284837289

I've made half-hearted attempts to stay current with UI technology but stopped pre-Ajax.<p>Years ago, my family joined a babysitting coop. Parents who know and trust each other join and babysit each others' kids. There is a ticket system used as currency, and there is a formula for tickets involving number of kids and length of sit. The coop aims to have 30 families. As families leave, new ones are recruited from acquaintances.<p>The coop had been running for years before I joined, doing everything with phone and email. In one of my efforts to learn UI technology, I built a website to run the coop, using Python, Django, Postgres, and Apache.  Members request and volunteer for babysitting jobs, an administrator select volunteers, a president controls membership. It's plug-ugly but gets the job done. It's a very simple application. The real value in the work is that the features have been designed and fine-tuned by very involved members.<p>I have no talent or interest in the business side of things, but it occurs to me that this could be turned into a small business. A coop of this sort has a specific set of interests and is in a single zip code. Ads (which are not on the site currently) could be targeted extremely precisely. The coop collects some annual feeds, so its possible that a website like this could charge an annual fee per coop.<p>The service could easily be generalized in obvious ways, e.g. swapping other kinds of services and goods. There are other coop sites on the web, but they rely on random people signing up, and to my eye they appear to be pretty inactive. One insight from my coop is that you'd need a more active sales approach to find existing coops who could use the automation.<p>So what do I do with this and how?
