If Mixergy had started with a hint of a commercial angle, it would have telegraphed the change and softened the blow. Instead, many Mixergy fans (including me) thought that Mixergy was a feel-good project ""giving back"" to the entrepreneur community, and we felt blindsided by what seemed like a sudden shift in emphasis.<p>That's not to say the balancing act is easy. I'm working on a Ruby on Rails tutorial project (<a href=""http://www.railstutorial.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.railstutorial.org/</a>) that definitely has an altruistic component, and it has been a challenge to indicate that it's not a charity. For example, although I'm giving away the HTML version of the book, I've emphasized that I'll eventually be selling a screencast version of the tutorial. I'm also offering ""Unlimited free downloads [of the PDF version] 'til the book is done"", which creates the expectation that I may eventually charge for the PDF.<p>Managing expectations is an art, and even highly capable people sometimes blow it. Imagine how much friendlier the reception to Arc would have been if pg had soft-launched it in '03 rather than writing essays about it for half a decade and calling it the ""hundred-year language"". It was pretty hard to live up to those expectations.",1268509899.0

My gut instinct is that with Haskell you have to put in a lot of extra effort but you are repaid doubly in robustness.  Obviously in real world scenarios there is a balance to be struck since a lot of code is just for throw-away purposes, or failure around edge cases does not affect the bottom line.  However I suspect that the lack of traction Haskell gets in the commercial software world is more a result of human nature than actual economics of long-lived software projects.<p>The reason I'm bullish on Haskell is because I suspect it can be a significant competitive advantage in a lot of the type of data processing scenarios that start out simple in a startup, but can become slow/buggy/unmaintainable over time.",1268509649.0
