It basically means you can't be fired except for one of three reasons:<p>1. Reasons in your behavior. For instance, if you steal from the company.<p>2. Reasons in your person. For instance you have developed a back-problem and can't do your job anymore.<p>3. Reasons within the company. Like restructuring eliminates the job you were doing. And this reason also requires that the employer has to prove that you cannot work at a different place in the company. If the company wants to fire a lot of people for financial reasons it has to be ""sozialverträglich"" (socially acceptable) which means employees with children and older employees can't be fired unless all younger employees without kids are also fired. There are exceptions.<p>It is actually quite hard to fire someone in Germany, who wants to stay. It takes years and if the employer loses in court he has to pay the salary for the time of the judicial proceeding plus the employee is still not fired. Because of this risk and the associated costs for the employer it is common to have some compensation payed to the employee. Its usually about half of his current monthly salary (before tax) times the years he was in the company.<p>The employment protection is not negotiable but the ""Kündigungsfrist"" (period of notice) is, to a certain degree. I think 1 month is the minimum. Employment protection is applicable if the company has more that 10 employees and the contract is indefinite. Fixed term contracts are only possible for at most 2 years. After that the employment becomes indefinite automatically.<p>Here is a long version in english:\n<a href=""http://www.ilo.org/public/english/dialogue/ifpdial/info/termination/countries/germany.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ilo.org/public/english/dialogue/ifpdial/info/term...</a>",1268250842.0

Current planning using Primavera (Gant Charts have failed to capture the complexity of the Project and have become so cumbersome that no-one is really using them).

Most people simulate activities (systems approaches fall into this), but my intuition is that I should be simulating people and not activities. Some sort of cellular automata idea. Another observation is that the project history - in a way has properties similar to those of traffic, with work slowing down without anyone really realizing the reasons behind it.<p>I am looking for ideas out of the box, links any research you might have come across.
