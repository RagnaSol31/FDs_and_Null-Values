1,997258,comment,997060.0,997217.0,0,0,mojombo,,,Interesting. Can you explain why you're doing one-off fixes instead of creating a general release with the fix that everyone can use? This seems like a bit of a complicated edge case that most people don't need a solution for. Semantic Versioning is very simple and has no intention of solving every possible versioning problem.,1260907179.0

In many cases you type something like ""gofmt -w filename.go"", press Enter, and then it's gone, never to be read.<p>In the language itself, fmt (something completely different from gofmt) is used as a package identifier. In the Go style, package identifiers are typed repeatedly, the identifiers inside a package are not imported into the global namespace. So if code contains many calls to the Printf function, there will be many instances of fmt.Printf. In this case, fmt instead of format is a good decision too.

We give them a one-off release containing only that fix. What do you label it? If you label it 1.0.1, then the next ""official"" release will be 1.0.2. Worse, what is the label for another release off the branch, after your trunk release of 1.0.2? I find this unsatisfactory because the two releases are not necessarily related to each other. AFAICT, all version systems that involve only numbers and dots will either fail to handle branches, or become horrifically complex.<p>I've seen products where releases were branches off branches. This happened because the customer is extremely risk adverse and we had new code in trunk that they didn't want to test; they wanted known-good code plus a subset of trunk. Management went along with it because the customer is several orders of magnitude larger. We strayed from trunk for so long that trunk got dropped, and one of the branches was designated the new trunk.<p>My general goals for a version system are:<p><pre><code>    1) provide a unique version for every build\n    2) Give an indication of where this code came from.\n</code></pre>\nI currently advocate a Git-like solution.

If you're running Git, this is just the SHA1 of the tree, when you build. That is the build's ""official version"". If you want to see where the build came from, git can draw you a pretty picture. When doing the build, allow the user to specify a human-friendly label, as a string.

If you just set your headers to the far future, you'll be stuck with outdated content on the client that you can't control.

Likely the first patent will have expired long before the current cases have finished. I doubt they'll have too much more time to sue people, so it's not likely to affect companies any of us start.<p>2. The validity of the second 2004 patent that discusses AJAX and makes claims that would hurt most of the companies named has not as far as I can tell yet been tested in a court. It's possible that the plugin patent was valid, and the AJAX one is not. If so, the danger to us is much less.<p>3. The more big companies are hurt by patent trolling, the more effort they'll likely spend on trying to reform the system.<p>We'll see how it goes.",1260903664.0
