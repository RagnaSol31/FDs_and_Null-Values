The ionization rate for radiation is proportional to (I'll ignore boring constants) Amplitude^N, where N is the least integer such that N omega > - E_0.<p>Here, E_0 is the energy of the bond the radiation breaks, and omega is the frequency of the radiation. Amplitude is small (you'll be thermally cooked long before Amplitude > 1), so the ionization rate is a small number to the power of large N.<p>It's virtually unmeasurable for small amplitude and large N.

Aside from that I personally dislike the oversimplicity of the style of CSS that leads to difficulties in creating stylesheets that are easy to navigate what with the lack of structure (over a couple of years of fixing up a design stylesheet are rarely that pleasant to look at), having some basic support for variables and calculations to more easily create complementary colors to your document styles also be nice, but eh.<p>See if I get killed for those opinions.",1256239761.0
