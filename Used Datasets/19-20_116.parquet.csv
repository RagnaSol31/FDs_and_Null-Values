Sometimes while working 40 hour weeks I don't write any code at home preferring to do one of the many other thing I enjoy. Other times I'm practically buried in work and come home and poke around on a side project. This just varies depending on my mood and what (if any) interesting stuff has my attention. If you enjoy something, you'll find time. If you don't enjoy it, why is it your career again?<p>If you ask me the whole point of this discussion shouldn't be 'coding at home' but instead 'giving a crap'. Even <i>just a little</i> passion for your field will get you a long way in <i>any</i> profession - and I think that is especially true in creative fields like programming.<p>Here I am on a Saturday afternoon putting some thinking time into my field... have I devoted the day to it?

10,873746,comment,873408.0,873408.0,0,0,swombat,,,"I stopped reading at ""strong typing"". (well, not really... but I started typing this comment roundabout there)<p>First of all, what he describes is not called strong typing, it's called static typing. Ruby, for example, has strong typing (every object is one type and one type only), but not static typing (you don't declare the type of an object when you declare a variable).<p>Secondly, there are many powerful languages that don't have static typing. Is the author implying that those languages are inherently buggy?<p>Thirdly, the author is not advocating what he declares in the title. He proposes methods to catch bugs, not to avoid them. His methods are also flawed in that redundancy does not ensure bug-free code - only that you haven't made any silly mistakes in your coding. Bugs come from all sorts of sources, and ""code typos"" are only one minor source. Other sources include: maintenance changes (which cause unforeseen effects that were not previously covered by tests), design flaws, and changed external circumstances. None of those are covered by the technique he lists.<p>Sorry, but this is just a poor attempt to capitalise on a catchy title. Nothing to see.",1255204409.0

Exercise to the reader.""<p>followed immediately by:<p>""I find this debate insulting.""<p>This seems to always happen with hiring debates - last time, it was the ""Would you hire someone without a college degree?"" question on Reddit about 8 months ago.  Interestingly, all the degree-less folks I <i>would</i> hire kept their mouth shut in that debate.  They <i>know</i> that they're good enough to hire with or without a degree, so they don't need to prove anything to anybody.

I code because I want to, not because I care whether someone will hire me for it.  If it gets me a job, so much the better, but if it doesn't, I can always start a company, compete with them, and kick their asses.  It doesn't have to be mutually exclusive to having a life, either.

The intent, which it does okay, is making your computer match the color tone of whatever your indoor lighting is, which makes the display more red than it makes it dark. But what you really <i>want</i> it to do is make the display dark enough that it won't keep you artificially awake late at night when the monitor is the only light source. On the Mac, the best tool I've found for that is Shades (<a href=""http://www.charcoaldesign.co.uk/shades"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.charcoaldesign.co.uk/shades</a>) which unfortunately doesn't have a timer. But binding to alt-space or whatever is pretty much just as good.<p>As a side note, the effect that monitors and other bright lights have on preventing sleep is the suppression of enzymes in the pineal gland that convert serotonin into melatonin about an hour before bedtime. There's a deletion mutation in the genes that code for one of these enzymes (ASMT) that's very common in autistics and relatives of autistics (which is a non-trivial subset of hackers/coders/geeks), so you might not be benefitting from the darkness anyway.

But you may be more succesful if you turn it into an iphone/blackberry/android app that does not need constant connectivity.<p>I will give you another idea which is tangentially related to what you are doing. There are timers that are used for people that bill for their time (e.g., consultants, lawyers, accountants, etc.) They are some pretty expensive ones that are used by top law firms and work very well. And there are a lot of cheaper ones that are aimed at startups and the like and are pretty terrible.<p>I am an attorney that just left one of the top firms in the nation to try to start my own practice. One of the biggest annoyances is that I cannot find a timer application that works as well as the one my law firm used. It should not be that difficult. But all the applications aimed at small businesses are pretty bad.<p>So I think if you aimed your timer for people that bill for their time, you might be succesful. But you have to make it good. You have to make it so it supports client- matter billing. Also make sure it can easily interact with standard accounting software. Also make sure it is easy to switch between tasks and create new tasks (this where most existing applications fail epically).<p>Basicly, if you can make a billing timer which is as good as Capre Diem but does not cost an arm and a leg, I think you may be very successful.",1255201399.0
