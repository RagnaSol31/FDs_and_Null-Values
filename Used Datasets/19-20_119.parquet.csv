The majority of my closest friendships and professional opportunities have come from time spent on the Internet.

There are a lot of homeless youth and young adults who panhandle, etc.<p>Also, in Canada the work force is far more competitive (higher unemployment drives this).  The person helping you at a fast food restaurant is a good communicator, appears clean, and is helpful and good natured.  Across the border in the US, many fast food employees are noticeably less able.<p>So my hypothesis is that due to higher unemployment, many ""homeless"" in Canada are in fact people who would easily hold down a job in the US.<p>The US homeless, on the other hand, almost all appear to have psychiatric problems or substance abuse problems.  I'd speculate that few US homeless would be able to hold down a simple job even if they were given a $5K per month stipend and fully subsidized apartment for the first year.",1283111647.0

I’m not sure if I have any other options. Could you help me?\nPerson B: I don’t have time. Just use PXE.""<p>The author is contriving a bullshit situation to make her point. If Person A is unwilling to ask what PXE is for fear of looking stupid, then they sure as shit aren't going to explicitly ask for help. Person A is only asking for help because she made them ask for help. That doesn't make any sense. If the problem here is communication like she says it is, she could at least provide a realistic communication scenario.

Do you get it? Person B's not being elitist. He's being the opposite of that. He's assuming that if you have any further questions, you'll just ask them because you shouldn't feel embarrassed to do so. But more impotantly: WHY THE HELL ARE WE NOT DISCUSSING WHAT PERSON A DID WRONG? If you don't know what PXE is, the solution is not to complain about the vast culture of elitism in the technology industry. The solution is to get over yourself and ask what PXE is.",1283111447.0

14,1644383,comment,1644032.0,1644062.0,0,0,_delirium,,,"This is one area Google does things relatively well, I think. Especially when they branch out and design a new thing with heavy CS content, the lead designers are often in their 40s or 50s and have experience with significant past systems in related areas: Rob Pike, Lars Bak, Ken Thompson, Peter Norvig, etc.<p>I think one reason is that people of that age are mostly the ones who even <i>remember</i> various useful solutions to problems and tradeoffs that have come up in the past. CS is strangely bad at digitizing its history: I can get a philosophy journal issue from 1890 on Jstor, but many CS journals and proceedings from as recently as <i>1980</i> are still dead-tree only. And many are still relevant, e.g. the V8 js engine is strongly based on 1980s Smalltalk compiler research. A handful of important papers (say, by Turing) have been piecemeal scanned and put online by interested people, and a handful of university classes cover historical aspects, but overall I don't think history transmission is taken particularly seriously in CS circles. So, it ends up being more of a living-memory sort of deal, where if you want knowledge from the 1970s/80s to influence your designs, you have to hire people who personally remember it.",1283111294.0

Such large scale market inefficiencies would not last for long.<p>Surely there will be some workers who are paid marginally more because of minimum wage laws, but not much more.  Because of the large quantity of low paid workers, the gains from automation are significant.  One wheat combine does the work of thousands of laborers.<p>Firms do not ""take advantage"" any more than workers do.  Surely some workers would be paid somewhat less without minimum wage, but surely more people would be employed, gaining skills and experience, etc.<p>Who really knows what the impact of this would be on various industries over time.  The modern world has done away with low skilled manufacturing jobs (which might have been the first rung on a ladder to more skilled jobs) and replaced hundreds of thousands of workers with a far smaller number of robots.<p>Most advocates of minimum wage prefer to look at the world as a single slice of time in which it's obvious that someone is benefitting from the policy.  Over a longer period of time, the benefit is far more difficult to detect and the case for minimum wage evaporates.<p>Imagine a world in which people could be hired for $2 per hour (where that's all their skills were worth).

It feels like I'm contributing to something greater than myself.<p>I think one of the most fundamental human urges is to feel like you belong to something. Helping people is so far the best way I've found of satisfying that urge. Capitalism seems to be based on the idea that that what people really want is more stuff. I think the reason that seems to be true is because having stuff and acquiring more of it is necessary to survive in a capitalist society. You need to have money to buy food and shelter. That's also why people don't share more of their stuff - sharing their stuff reduces their chances of survival. Even if somebody is rich ""enough"" to survive, they still need money to participate in nearly every other aspect of society. They can't listen to music, or go out with their friends, or really do anything unless they have money (or stuff that can be converted into money).

91,1644303,comment,1643180.0,1643994.0,0,0,neilk,,,"Maybe my comment was unclear due to the hyperbole. I am agreeing with you, in that one possible reason is that CS really is that bad.<p>But I also don't agree with your hyperbole, that 99% of CS students are subtly sexist or otherwise actively against women's participation. Maybe I am living in a bubble or something, but my experience is that CS people are actually somewhat less sexist than most of society, and I can think of other university departments (business or law) that have far worse behavior by men.<p>I think the geek tribe fails horribly when it comes to other things. Perhaps these are what is more important.\nUnderstanding the emotional context of communication is one. Simple grooming and attention to social norms is another. Lastly CS students are usually quite timid in one way or another, and prolong adolescent pursuits and attitudes essentially perpetually.<p>I am not a straight female, and I can't claim to know what they are thinking. But I think, from their behavior, that they are repelled from CS in part because in many respects it's a low status job for low status, somewhat troglodytic men.<p>We are not talking about startup school here -- I mean the vast majority of CS grads, who are destined to grind out buggy Java libraries in a caffeinated haze for the rest of their days, wearing increasingly threadbare vendor t-shirts that cover less and less of their belly. Unlike law or commerce, which might be even more sexist, but at least they're around people that have the tact to hide this, and the men can communicate emotionally, respect social norms, and generally have higher status.<p>This might be very politically incorrect to state, but in my experience, women will be incensed and mortified at sexist behaviour by low-status males, but will rationalize it when it comes from equal or higher-status males (maybe I deserved it, maybe it's just a joke and I should forget it, etc. etc.) I mean, otherwise, why would there have been a need for a feminist movement, if not to overcome that tendency? So I'm suggesting that the sexism in CS is similar to other fields, but that women <i>notice</i> it more, because most geeks are incapable of projecting that power aura. And furthermore, because the field seems so low status, women have far less incentive to ignore the sexism.<p>Men do exactly the same thing when faced with power imbalances, if you think about it. People laugh <i>with</i> their boss even if he's a domineering asshole, but they wouldn't tolerate that from someone they deemed a peer or underling.<p>I don't want to reduce women to simple breeding machines looking for alpha males -- the evolutionary psychology approach. Furthermore, the fact that there is <i>any</i> sexism at all in any field is deplorable, and we shouldn't look to other fields to set our own norms.<p>But I'm just trying to describe what I see... in part  because I feel that way too. There are many times when I look around the people I see at conferences or whatnot and feel a certain creeping horror. And wonder, out of the infinite things I could be doing with my life, why I am talking with this guy with a monotone voice and a severe dandruff problem about CSS bugs in IE6. How much worse could it be for a straight female?<p>This is actually why I didn't go into engineering myself (I got a degree in an arts subject and only returned to programming much later).
