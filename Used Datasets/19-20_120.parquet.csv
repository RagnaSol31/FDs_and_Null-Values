In that way, I think they encourage a lot of people to try who might not otherwise have tried.   People often like to impress their teachers.<p>Two, as angel / early-stage investors go, YC is the closest thing there is to a top-tier firm.  We don't know much about their financials but we do know their first big raise came from Sequoia, itself a top-tier firm.   Top-tier funding comes with perks.  You get YC's participation and connections.  You get to say you got money from YC.  $N from YC is worth a lot more than $N from your uncle.<p>Finally, for many, a YC interview will be their first big pitch and so there is a damaged goods concern:  if YC turns you down, your odds with others are diminished.   (That's not exclusive to YC:  if X turns you down your future odds are diminished, for many values of X.)<p>Being turned down by YC doesn't mean that you are at the bottom of the pit.

Look, both sides can probably agree:<p><i>Rule number 1: My code is crap.</i><p>The worst kind of incompetence is believing you're better than you actually are.  Even the best make mistakes.  Have an accurate idea of where the problem lies.  Often, it is more likely that a bug is the result of your code than ""a compiler bug"" or some such thing.

If you are racing to the patent office for fear that someone else will come up with the idea, then your actions demonstrate that you likely shouldn't be granted the patent.<p>For instance take the ""mostly done"" issue.  If you have it mostly done, until that last piece arrives nobody has any idea how many other people had it mostly done as well.  Which means that it is impossible to figure out how innovative your idea is, and therefore we don't have good evidence that you really deserve a patent.  Given that handing out patents causes real economic harm to others, I don't think they should be handed out on such poor evidence and therefore don't want to see those patents handed out so quickly.<p>I am strongly against allowing an exception because it opens up a common form of patent abuse.  The story is that a small company invents a new technology and get a patent on it.  A big company would like the patent, but can't get access.  Instead they get patents on all of the things the small company needs to do to commercialize their invention.  Effectively they build a ""patent wall"" around the existing patent.  And now the small company is forced to come to terms with the big ones.<p>The one issue you raise that I agree with is that often people build on their own ideas.  The better mousetrap is often better in several ways, not all of which you think of at one time.  But in that case I see two possibilities.  One is that the subsequent innovations can be used without your other innovations.  In that case you can get a patent on them.  The other is that the subsequent innovations can't be used without your other innovations.  In that case the patent you can get on your previous innovations will protect your subsequent as well.

It's not uncommon to see websites with a light feel, where main pages contain actual paragraphs of text at size 16-18pt - you can actually make a really good impression by changing the font to something elegant in that case. You don't need any sacrifices for usability, SEO or content management when you design those pages. The text is there for everyone and owner of the website can edit it without going through image exports, etc.<p>Of course it won't look as good as it would in a pdf for a couple more years, but it's a good start anyways.",1257879607.0
