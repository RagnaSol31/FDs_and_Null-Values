What if the attacker forks and rebuilds the chain of the last week but randomly leaves out every tenth transaction while slowly poisoning the genuine chain with useless transactions until the algorithm decides to switch? You just undid thousands of transaction originally confirmed a week ago. If you could just make up a couple of rules to prevent all 51 % attacks they would not be an issue in the first place.

A better argument from that perspective is the observation that Type III civilizations expand at an alarming rate. Whatever the motivation for expansion[1], basic simulations and back of the envelope calculations show that even with technology we could imagine building in the not so distant future, humans could expand into the cosmos at >0.9c. We must assume the same of ET.<p>Now information only reaches us at the speed of light; we are only capable of looking for ET in our own past light cone. That means that any Type I or Type II civilization like us should <i>expect</i> to see an empty sky for most of their existence, until all of a sudden the most distant stars go dim (Dyson sphere, or whatever energy capturing device).
