There's a big difference between what I would call a ""duct tape programmer"" and someone who happens to keep a roll of duct tape handy.  The former will run that duct-taped system in the next race, and will keep adding duct tape as problems arise.

Unit testing (done TDD style) does not slow you down, it speeds you up. One day I hope Joel eventually realizes this. ""<p>Bullshit.  I call TDD more like ""insecurity driven development"".  Perfect fit for big corps, where mistakes are punished, and being fast is not really rewarded. *hence the myriad of processes to do even simple check-ins.<p>There is much better ways to deal with it:\n1. Design interfaces, that implement the features you think you need.  That's like the outline of your essay.<p>2. Have classes that implement them  (put all messy code there). Write your essay.<p>3. Do some functionality testing on the features that are important, and can reasonable be measured (.ie. no functionality testing/unit testing in UI stuff).  And make sure you use it.  Unit test may catch only some stuff. Proof read it.<p>From my experience in my previous startups, If you have to ship in three weeks, unit testing is the very first thing that gets tossed out of the window.<p>At the end of the day, who cares if your product has few bugs.  You got to ship something.  And I am saying this from experience, where a product I worked is being used by over 2million of people.  Buggy? Oh yes. Did the bugs kill the overrall experience,  i don't think so.  If we had missed that deadline, there was huge financial ramification for the company (apart 10s millions of dollars, it was  a relationship breaker with the main client). We took our time to fix some of those bugs on subsequent releases.<p>If we had to do TDD, we probably would have never get done in time.  Sure we might have found and fixed some of the bug earlier, but none of those bugs were detriment to the whole experience anyways.<p>The only time you really should care to test about even the most minuscule feature, is if you are doing some highly financial/sensitive stuff.\nMost starts are not in that field anyways.",1253821329.0

Having them does not make your code bug-free and even if something is covered by a test it is still possible that both the test and the code are wrong in the same way.  Putting too much belief in correctness due to tests passing can be just as bad as not having any tests at all.  Unit tests are great at api boundaries and points of interface between data-munging code, but every function or process does not need its own unit test.<p>Unit tests also have a high up-front cost that is frequently not justified by the return on this investment.  There is a subtle art to selecting the granularity of testing that takes a while to learn, and spending too much time around TDD zealots will often lead coders who have not learned this skill to waste time writing tests instead of getting things done.<p>Like IDEs that flag type errors, compiler warnings, and debugger breakpoints, a test is just a tool.
