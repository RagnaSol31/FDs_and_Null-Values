I know for sure that this is the case in Emerald, and I know that other window managers allow various themes to move around the position of the buttons at will. If they changed the underlying code to <i>force</i> all themes to use the same button position regardless of what they have it set to... that's a lot bigger of an issue than just changing the button position in the default theme.<p>Maybe someone running 10.04 Alpha 3 can confirm that this is being forced upon other themes. Another thought is that maybe most themes don't specify the button locations because they are used to the defaults being 'buttons on the right,' and this Ubuntu change messes with the global defaults rather than just applying the changes locally to the new default theme.",1268423746.0

It’s a dense film, visually, narratively, and symbolically. It dumps you straight into a fully realized world, doesn’t stop much to explain how it works, and is full of rich and believable but extremely socially awkward characters (they’re a mix of utterly isolated engineers – who build robots to hang out with because they're so incapable of dealing with people – and killer robots). I think it’s one of Harrison Ford’s most impressive performances (not to mention Rutger Hauer). Especially if you watch the version without the voiceovers, the film does very little to help the reader out.<p>But I’ve found it one of the most rewarding films, raising all kinds of deep questions about modern society, the nature of cognition and consciousness, teleology... but it only gives back as much as you put into it.",1268422956.0

Not a book, obviously, but a game - however the story is still text-based. I suppose you could look at the game elements as illustrations to go with the text. But the text (the story unfolds when the player reaches and accesses various computer 'terminals' strewn about the levels, sometimes hidden) is much more than just prose, it's really a hybrid between prose, code, and 'concrete poetry' (poetry where the position/spacing of letters creates a visual impression). The characters who narrate the story are powerful AI constructs for the most part, in possession of their own psychology/pathology and free from their human masters/creators, and from human concerns.<p>I think in creating a new voice (that of the AIs), Bungie used an entirely new mode of expression, with brilliant results (I bet the Marathon's Story website is still active).

Try doing the same with a typical Linux distro, and you'll find your apt-get (or equivalent) will pull in all sorts of dependencies that you may or may not desire if you want to use the latest software.</i><p>You've made a mistake in your Linux distro selection, if lifecycle in a priority (and for me, it usually is). RHEL (and thus, CentOS) has a seven year update cycle. During that period they will never ""pull in all sorts of dependencies you may or may not desire"". It is a stable platform and it remains the same throughout its lifecycle. If you prefer apt-based distros, Ubuntu LTS has a five year lifecycle. Debian tends to be about 3-4 years, but is based on the development of the next revision rather than a stated lifecycle, as far as I know (so if Debian develops faster, you have to upgrade faster).<p>That said, I suppose one could argue that on older stable Linux distros, one might have to add some dependencies from outside of the core OS in order to run super new stuff...though I rarely find things that won't build against the libraries available on CentOS 5 or Ubuntu 8.04LTS. Some developer tools move really fast, as do some of the new-fangled Gnome or KDE user applications, but mostly I never notice that the OS is a couple years old.<p>So, yes, Open Source does change faster, but there are very easy ways to opt out of the rapid release cycle for systems that need stability (like servers). I can't tell you the number of folks I've met over the years who've started out with Fedora or Ubuntu, only to figure out that upgrading every 12-18 months is stressful and unproductive, and moved to a more predictable distro, even though it has older packages.<p>In short, you have a choice about how long you can use a Linux distro safely and productively.

Because real societies are rich and textured, full of contradictions and moral ambiguities, characters with complex motivations.<p>Snow Crash has a bitmap pattern that can hack into programmers’ brains and knock them unconscious and the complete collapse of nation-states and The Diamond Age has pervasive nanotechnology. Dune has gigantic sand worms and psycho telepaths. China Miéville’s books have giant mutant bird-people. Speaker for the Dead includes aliens, artificial superintelligence, faster-than-light communication. &c. &c. &c.<p>“Real literature” (any way you define it) has many of the same building-blocks: gods (The Illiad), fairies (Twelfth Night), voyages through the underworld (Dante’s Inferno), characters who hop from one body to another (Death in Venice), interesting new interpretations of language and cognition and radically different cultural/social customs, etc. etc.<p>But works (including those set in space) that oversimplify and preach at us, or just serve as fantasies for us to insert ourselves into as passive escapism are little better than Horatio Alger novels, or, say, the trashiest kinds of romances. They can be fun, but ultimately they don't have quite so much staying power.",1268420412.0
