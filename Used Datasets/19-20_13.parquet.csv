If the sensors are tied in with the meters themselves (letting you pay for it over your phone and whatnot), then a lot of the work for the city's parking enforcement is gone. All that would be required is to keep track of expired meters with cars still parked there, and any cars parked while parking is not allowed.<p>Although that will probably mean that a lot of people might lose their jobs, it means that the gov in turn saves money on gas|CNG|power for the cars, and possibly get more money from parking tickets.",1215891472

24,244632,story,,,3,14,amrithk,Solving the problem of multiple writes to the database,,"Hi all, \nThis might perhaps be a simple problem but I was wondering if people had any solutions for this.<p>I have a form which allows people to upload images. When a user uploads an image, I save to a database, \n1) a modified name for the image, \n2) a caption for the image, \n3) the id of the user who uploaded the image, \n4) Some other information that are used for image retrieval purposes<p>The form allows users to upload up to 30 images. I do not want to write to the database each time \nthe user wants to upload an image. Rather, I want to store each upload request (plus all the associated information I need like captions etc) and make a large write when a user has confirmed that he/she is satisfied with all of their choices.<p>How can I do this easily? \n1) I have considered storing the attributes and information associated with each image in cookies and retrieving and processing cookie information after the user has confirmed his/her choices. However, I am not comfortable with this option as I cannot control what happens to the cookies when they are stored in the client machine.<p>2) Another option is to obtain many hidden fields (more than 30) in the HTML form and fill these up with the associated information I need. I could then process the information in these hidden fields before writing to the database. However, this seems pretty clumsy.<p>3) A third option I was considering was using Amazon's Simple Queue Service to queue image upload requests and then unqueue and process the messages after a user finished making his/her choices and hit a confirm button.<p>Which solution among these 3 is the cleanest and most flexible implementation? Are there other solutions for this problem?<p>Thanks all.",1215890908

It's an early prototype of a tiny part of the vision they have; the dipping of the proverbial toe in the water. What Lively and the other Google technologies will grow into will again be a different target market.<p>More importantly, a VW like that might be a hit for a year or two before people lose interest or something better comes along. But that sort of faddy thinking doesn't interest Google. They're entering the VW sector as groundwork for a service that people will find <i>necessary</i> in 5-10 years time.<p>My guess is that it'll be Maps, Earth, Street View, Android, Lively, AdWords and many more services all rolled into one big Augmented Reality (in this view it also makes sense for them to take over Wikipedia and Flickr - which they've recently incorporated into Maps).",1215890465
