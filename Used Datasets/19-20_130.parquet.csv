It is in an industry where raising funding would be a disaster and guarantee no orders ever again.<p>I was working for a company some years ago, and pay started to get late.  No word from management, no explanations, and when it did turn up, no apologies.<p>We were all starting to look to jump, and some did.  I found out what really was going on and started to make serious plans.<p>I won't go into full details, but after about 6 months we managed a hostile management buyout.  We dealt with some unpleasantness from some people who jumped early, and half of those who had stayed were made redundant.  That was a horrible, horrible thing to do, but we had no choice - we had no money.  It cost us a bundle, but it was the only way to save the company.<p>The ones who stuck with us are now secure in their jobs, have equity, have 50% of the six months of missing pay restored (we weren't responsible or liable, but we honored it anyway) and have a fantastic work place.<p>In the middle of the worst, when negotiations were bad, we asked a few people why they were still working 5 hours a day, four days a week, when they hadn't been paid for three months, and everything was uncertain.<p>""We don't want to work with anyone else."" was the rather humbling reply.<p>Since then there have been months when cash-flow was tight, and money wasn't on time.  Company directors, I have learned, are legally obliged not to destabilise the company, and telling employees the exact situation when money is tight can be regarded as that.  It's not always the owners' fault.  Employees are quick to say ""You should've told us."" but legally, the situation is not always that clear.<p>I have to say that we, the directors, never took more pay than the employees until they were back on full pay.  even then we took 1/4 pay for a further few months, then 1/2 pay until the cash-flow stabilised.  We never asked employees to forego pay without ourselves first taking nothing.<p>I'm not making excuses for your bosses, nor suggesting that you stick it out and hope it all works.  My employees did, and they're very, very pleased about it.  I stuck it out, took steps, and now (part) own the company.<p>Take control, one way or another.

I would imagine you could construct a definition of number based on multiplication whereby 0 would no longer be a number... but only according to your <i>new</i> definition of number. There's nothing wrong with having a new definition of number, but there is something wrong with writing the statement in English ""0 cannot be a number"" without providing your definition of number. By the standard one that English usually means when the word ""number"" is used without mathematical qualification, yes it darned well is, just as infinity isn't. And, correspondingly, you can construct numerous number systems where there are various ordinals that have characteristics inline with what we expect from ""infinity"", but those aren't the usual infinity anymore, either.<p>When somebody asks whether infinity ""is a number"", I don't think it's really helpful to start dragging in constructs from number theory and defining new definitions of number for the apparently sole purpose of dazzling the poor question asker.

Wanting to silence such speech would be against consumers interests (and in this case - health/safety) and would surely be protected speech.,1248807750.0

The program still starts up when you click on it except it doesn't register itself as a foreground application until after it is loaded.  The time to start the application is exactly the same, bootup time is unaffected, but the icon just doesn't bounce.",1248807677.0

I would say how you go about it is going to depend at least a bit on your framework/programming language.  I'm using Ruby on Rails for my apps so I would probably just follow the generally accepted RoR best-practices on 18n which dictates using the file system and YAML translation files based on keys that you use in your app (at least the last time I looked that was the best practice).,1248807657.0

Well said. \nFrom a <i>strictly</i> scientific standpoint, designing the tests around the claims of the participants is only useful so far. The anecdotal claims of people who claim to suffer from this condition would be suspect at best.<p>What is know is that electromagnetic energy can and does effect the human body, it is just a question of what thresholds we are talking about. It would stand to reason that some people are effected at different levels than others for various reasons. (Hydration, PH balance, even height could be a factor when talking about specific wavelengths).<p>All that is to say, the wifi thing may very well be bollocks, but I still would love to see more rigorous research done.",1248807637.0
