If you run the Teacher's Union Pension Fund with $10B, you can't just trust your internal team or one or two large advisors. You want to get as much information as possible about all the sectors of the economy, locally and globally. So instead of hiring 1000 people to do the research for you, you pay 10-20 different companies to access their newsletters, briefs, and suggestions, each of which is written by an analyst. If 75% of analysts say ""Buy APPL"" while 5% say ""Sell APPL"", rest being neutral, you can get an idea of what the general market sentiment is.<p>To put it simply, instead of asking Gruber what he thinks of Apple management, you ask HN, Slashdot, and Ars readers.

(It can also avoid polluting the cache, with the correct hint instructions.)<p>On more typical workloads, though, where you've got a lot of harder-to-predict memory access, what would really come in handy is lower memory latency. And if this type of RAM works, it will give us both: huge bandwidth, <i>and</i> dramatically lower latency.<p>The system stack, instead of being HD->RAM->L3->L2->L1->registers, could look more like ""Hard drive -> Giant shared non-uniform nonvolatile L3 cache -> shared or core-local L2 cache -> core-local L1 cache -> registers"".",1318187599.0

I agree that Wall Street financiers seem to focus too much on using secondary (and tertiary) effects to simply amass wealth, and i worry that that actually has a negative overall effect on society. But without a liquid secondary market, the primary market is significantly stymied!",1318187193.0

Below's a link to a forum where I posted about it along with a link to an actual .ext I created.  But you can see from that forum thread that somebody has reported that McAfee has falsely reported it as being a virus.  I list the steps I took to create the .exe, the last being to run OCRA (One Click Ruby Installer).  The problem might be something done within that, but I think there is a larger problems: anti-virus software does this to <i>many</i> small developers of .exe's  So on the other extreme, perhaps a class action lawsuit is in order?  Just sayin.  Aforementioned forum post (containing link to .exe) is at: http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?150123-Windows-Desktop-App-using-Ruby-(instead-of-AIR)  The .exe runs on Windows only",1318187023.0
