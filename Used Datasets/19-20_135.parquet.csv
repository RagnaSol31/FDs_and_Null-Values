In a similar fashion, we (society) don't want kids to interfere with productivity, so we stuff them in kindergartens and schools so they are out of our way until they reach their 20s and can be regarded as fully productive. And we put old people in nursing homes for the same reason.<p>I wonder if the current practice of everyone hiring only ""the best of the best"" is suboptimal for society as a whole, since it leaves a lot of potential productivity on the society table: Someone with a disability might be (say) only 5-10% as productive as the average healthy adult, but add up everyone with some sort of disability and it sums to a nontrivial amount of underutilized capacity.<p>But I'm not sure. It's a game of numbers: There are administrative costs to hiring and managing (say) 10-20 people to do one person's job. If the ""less productive"" part of  the population is small enough and the productivity difference between ""less productive"" and ""more productive"" is large enough, it could be a net productivity win to pay the ""less productive"" some small amount of money to go away and stop bothering the ""more productive"".<p>Which is essentially what we do today.",1342899291.0

Addictiveness might be closer to autism spectrum in this regard than the 'choice' to use performance-enhancing drugs.<p> <i>Is the benefit conferred something that is relative/private/zero-sum, or absolute/public/positive-sum?</i><p>In athletic competitions, a steroid-user only gains (the victory or the all-time record) when someone else loses. If everyone responds by also taking steroids, we've just created a new altered variant of the original game -- spending more, having more health effects, creating an 'incompatible' record book -- without any net gain (unless there is some absolute improvement in, say, the spectacle value of the activity). So the culture is more likely to disfavor steroid use, especially if used for secret advantage, or likely to set off a 'red queen race'. But when someone creates a lasting research result or piece of art -- that is <i>not</i> primarily understood as having displaced someone else's achievement, but rather setting some new absolute peak. When an addict/enhancement-user leaves the world a hit song, a great book, a new scientific breakthrough -- a non-zero-sum result -- it's easier to accept the precursor activities, even if usually illegal/taboo. And that goes doubly when we also consider the third axis...<p> <i>Do usage benefits also impose clear offsetting costs?</i><p>That is, does the user suffer for the advantages conferred? Otherwise, the use is more threatening: our old taboos and norms are wrong! Late adopters are screwed! What should the rules be, what should I do? Conversely, if the drugs include clear punishment with reward, people can fit outlier users into a comforting moral framework. ""The addiction inspired his work but also drove him crazy."" ""She did brilliant work while addicted but died young of an overdose."" Because the use seems to include its own punishment, the social shunning doesn't have to be as strong, and individuals can make the decision ""that path is not for me"" without resorting to moralizing absolutes.",1342898927.0

(And a 4-digit karma on HN.) I'm also an opiate addict; I've been using for over 5 years. Not IV, just OxyContin (time release oxycodone). I've also been diagnosed bipolar I[1].<p>Opiates allow me to conquer depression and major stress. Working at a company, with massive investment, several employees, and need to keep coding, keep morale up, lead a development team? Opiates turn what would be crushing stress and keep me positive so I can focus on getting stuff done. But could I tell our board about how I cope? Hell no.<p>There are many more folks in my position. Junkies give us opiate users a bad name, just like meth-heads make stimulant users look bad[2]. So, it's just not acceptable to mention usage, even when it's OK to say how ""I'll really need a drink tonight"" or even take smoke breaks during work. Which is funny, as opiates have very little heath side-effects (obviously overdose, but after that, constipation is the only real issue).<p>And yes, I've opted out several times. Once, like Paul Erdos, I decided to prove to someone that I could, and took a whole month off. Despite being on the equivalent of ~100-200mg of morphine a day, it was not very hard. (Sure, if you start IV'ing heroin, things might be different.) Overall, I decided I do better with opiates than without.<p>Any excuses that remove stigma and get society closer to rational discussion on drugs is an overall win.<p>1: Opiates are one thing that really work for depression. Mood stabilisers that all doctors want to prescribe leave me content to do nothing - literally. On them, staring at a wall all day is ""just fine"". Zombification.<p>2: Except most folks seem to think ""meth"" is some crazy other drug, not related to what they give hyperactive kids.

It is old, and not being updated.<p>If they had bought a windows phone those 2 years ago, they would be saying the same thing about their windows phone.<p>But i agree that most android vendors suck at updates and should be avoided. But you should avoid their phones just as much when they are running windows.<p>Really, only Apple is doing this right: you get the full ecosystem experience for at least two years.<p>Those skinned android are often already six months behind and wont be updated.<p>But to compare a three year old android phone with a fresh new windows phone is unfair and illogial.",1342897760.0

But it probably would go faster in Phonegap to go from PSD to app.<p>I don't agree 100% with most people not noticing though. I do feel a smooth app adds to the overal experience.<p>I tested the first app they showed in the Phonegap gallery and it has that typical Phonegap feel to it: laggy response and glitchy transitions. It gives the app a sloppy feel.\nMaybe people won't notice, but it's not a fun app to use.",1342897555.0

It's interesting to distinguish between the terms 'facial detection' and 'facial recognition'. The former basically judges whether or not a face is in a picture or video while the latter attempts to associate faces with names/identities. Two very different things. I just wanted to point that out. OpenCV is good at detection, but I'm told not so good at recognition.",1342897352.0
