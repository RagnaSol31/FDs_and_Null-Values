I believe that money can be better spent on improving the lives of those people. Better food, water, and housing will help make those people healthier, which will improve the infant mortality rate, which will naturally lead to a reduction in the birth rate. One reason poor people make a lot of babies is because many of the babies don't survive and a higher birthrate is necessary to ensure the survival of the next generation. With a lower infant mortality rate, it becomes an economic burden to have too many babies, so most families cut back to just one or two children. This is a trend that can take a couple of generations to become widespread, but large changes like this should be slow so they're not disruptive.",1262028958.0

There were people coming from English-speaking countries who could get management-level jobs mostly by virtue of coming from an English-speaking country.

They were seen as having an understanding of how the capitalist world works, and this was valued (whether or not this was true).<p>After a decade, the people were not seeing the quick returns from the switch to capitalism that they were hoping for.

114,1019135,comment,1017708.0,1017708.0,0,0,mark_l_watson,,,Zed made some good points. I also like simplicity in designs (and make things more complicated by refactoring <i>if</i> the need ever arises). That is one thing I like about Ruby: it is so simple and concise to do things that are not simle and concise in other languages - this makes code look simple and thus easy to read.,1262027352.0

As a few people have pointed out here and over in the post comments, the issue at hand isn't so much about statement modifiers as it is about how Ruby 'defines' local variables.<p>Take this for example:<p><pre><code>  ra:~$ irb\n  a = irb(main):001:0> a = b\n  NameError: undefined local variable or method `b' for main:Object\n  	from (irb):1\n  irb(main):002:0> defined? a\n  => ""local-variable""\n  irb(main):003:0> \n\n</code></pre>\nIt just so happens that using statement modifiers in the way I tried using them brings this behavior to light.",1262027159.0
