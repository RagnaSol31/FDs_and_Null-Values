But if you're hiring the first five employees, you don't care about nine out of ten - you care about that one time you <i>do</i> recognize a promising candidate. Every selective process has a false negative rate, there is no way around that. Amazing people get turned away by all kinds of smart people in all kinds of places all the time. If you have ideas on how to lower the false negative rate without increasing the false positive rate, I'd love to hear how you'd do it.<p><i>What gives you the idea that people with such potential would apply at RethinkDB?</i><p>Because they already have. Smart and driven people apply for the same reasons smart and driven people do anything - they're interested in the problem, and have an innate desire to solve it. In any case, if you sit around and wait for great people to apply, the sourcing part of your recruiting process isn't done right. If you want great people, you have to go out, find them, contact them directly, and then do everything in your power to close them.<p><i>People that botch their interview because they are nervous can't be better than you?</i><p>Of course they can, but again, it's about increasing the false negative rate to lower the rate of false positives. I <i>can</i> afford to turn some great people away, but I can't afford to hire someone who isn't great. Any software startup that works on hard technology has the same constraints - if you hire people that are anything less than stellar, you significantly lower your chance of success. In a startup you (mostly) don't have geographical limits for your customers, but the corollary is that you also don't have geographical limits for your competition. When you're targeting every customer in the world, you're also competing with every company in the world. Going into that with anything but the top-notch team is suicide.",1269287896.0

We also made clear that these attacks and the surveillance they uncovered—combined with attempts over the last year to further limit free speech on the web in China including the persistent blocking of websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google Docs and Blogger—had led us to conclude that we could no longer continue censoring our results on Google.cn.<p>So earlier today we stopped censoring our search services—Google Search, Google News, and Google Images—on Google.cn. Users visiting Google.cn are now being redirected to Google.com.hk, where we are offering uncensored search in simplified Chinese, specifically designed for users in mainland China and delivered via our servers in Hong Kong. Users in Hong Kong will continue to receive their existing uncensored, traditional Chinese service, also from Google.com.hk. Due to the increased load on our Hong Kong servers and the complicated nature of these changes, users may see some slowdown in service or find some products temporarily inaccessible as we switch everything over.<p>Figuring out how to make good on our promise to stop censoring search on Google.cn has been hard. We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services, including users in mainland China, yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement. We believe this new approach of providing uncensored search in simplified Chinese from Google.com.hk is a sensible solution to the challenges we've faced—it's entirely legal and will meaningfully increase access to information for people in China. We very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision, though we are well aware that it could at any time block access to our services. We will therefore be carefully monitoring access issues, and have created this new web page, which we will update regularly each day, so that everyone can see which Google services are available in China.<p>In terms of Google's wider business operations, we intend to continue R&D work in China and also to maintain a sales presence there, though the size of the sales team will obviously be partially dependent on the ability of mainland Chinese users to access Google.com.hk. Finally, we would like to make clear that all these decisions have been driven and implemented by our executives in the United States, and that none of our employees in China can, or should, be held responsible for them. Despite all the uncertainty and difficulties they have faced since we made our announcement in January, they have continued to focus on serving our Chinese users and customers. We are immensely proud of them.",1269287143.0

We're just trying to raise awareness of hidden fees in the industry. We see it all day every day in competitor proposals. Credit card pricing is inherently complex and difficult to present to merchants.  We've tried to simplify the complexity of pricing and buying merchant services by posting our pricing online and not hiding any fees. We try to raise awareness because at times it feels like we're the only provider out there that doesn't hide fees. I am sure that there are other providers that do not hide fees or present them in a way that hinders a merchant from properly understanding rates they'll pay - we just rarely ever see it.",1269286872.0

I think citations need to acknowledge datasets more, as do promotions otherwise people will have large incentives to ""silo"" vertically and not share. A big issue that has no excuse is public access to journals though. It's amazing that the public pays for the research and then pays for it again and again in every library's subscription to the vampire publishing houses who do nothing other than distribute a few hardcopies that nobody reads and then gatekeep the pdfs (the editing and review is all done by academics, so it's just copy and typesetting that's commanding this huge price).

Consider briefly the FDA approval process and a profit-seeking scientist developing a pharmaceutical.  The scientist has a 20 year time horizon to maximize profits, so  she has a huge incentive to do R&D and to launch the product.  Meanwhile the FDA regulator collects the same salary whether he approves or delays approval of a drug, yet he stands to be fired and disgraced if the drug he approved causes harm.  If he's overly cautious in order to keep his job, society suffers profoundly.<p>If you claim that government is better than private industry at solving these sorts of problems, you are making the rather strong claim that the incentives of the FDA burocrat are broadly superior to the incentives of the R&D scientist.<p>It follows that you would believe that if all R&D scientists were paid a fixed salary and stood to gain nothing for finding a breakthrough drug but stood to be humiliated and disgraced if any unforeseen consequences of a discovery occur, society would be significantly better of.<p>I think that's a fairly sweeping claim to make, and I'm curious if you could elaborate.<p>Also, with respect to the automotive pensions, I think you'd be well advised to review this history of the PBGC (pension benefit guarantee corporation).  It is a government entity tasked with offering pension insurance for workers in the event that the firm fails.  Surprisingly, both unions AND corporate interests lobbied congress to decrease the premiums firms would pay into the PBGC.  The result is that the PBGC is not actuarially sound and that if a few major US firms failed the PBGC would go belly up.<p>Why did this happen?  Corporate interests understand that once the government provides a safety net, so long as they were compliant they have nothing to lose (plus, if the firm failed then it's game over anyway).  Unions focused on increasing the current allocation of benefits and didn't worry about the future... after all they ""won"" improved pensions for workers and were pleased when firms could dedicate the extra cash (saved by having artificially low risk premiums) to other forms of compensation, etc.  So in this case the government clearly acts on the whim of interested parties and utterly fails to protect citizens (even though doing so is a trivial matter of actuarial calculations and collection of a premium!).<p>So I would be curious to read your elaboration based on these points of rebuttal.",1269285641.0

I had a client last year that nickled and dimed me and every other vendor they have.  It's their way of doing business.  Then they stopped paying on time, claimed it was due to the economy.  \nThing is whenever they got a new sale they would ring a bell, once for every $1000 of the sale.  We had several days each month where the bell did not ring less than 10 times.  On top of this they expected me to perform duties that I was not contracted to perform i.e. man customer support phones, I'm a developer.\nI ended our relationship at the end of the year and haven't felt better about any decision.
