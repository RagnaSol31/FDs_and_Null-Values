3,153288,comment,153201.0,153201.0,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"That is an interesting story. What would be <i>really</i> interesting, though, is to read about the company that saw through this kind of prejudice -- that hired the equally-qualified minority workers at wages depressed by such prejudice, and then made a killing. It happened with women -- Greenspan Townsend hired lots of female economists, because they were underpriced -- but I've lived in St. Louis, and I do not recall any successful businesses that emphasized hiring minorities, outside of sports and entertainment.<p>This reminds me of <i>Blink</i>, in which Malcolm Gladwell dwells on a similar habit of used car salesman. It is fortunate that Gladwell's career as a journalist has given him more insight into auto sales than all those guys who do it for a living -- but what's sad is that he can't convince jurist and economist Richard Posner that it's because car salesman are immoral, not because they are making intelligent deductions from available data (<a href=""http://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/posner-blink.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/posner-blink.html</a>).",1207166144

As far as I know, this has never been done.<p>(Note that I'm not disputing full fledged autism. I'm just uncertain about aspergers.)<p>(1) For those unfamiliar with stats, this is what I mean. Let x be an N dimensional vector, representing the personality/physical features of people (i.e. x[1] = propensity for antisocial behavior, x[2] = seizure frequency, x[...] = other diagnostic criteria).

That helped us understand how much people wanted it (measured by traffic and conversion of traffic to sign ups).  We were immedietely barraged by lots of people who had ideas about the product, and we listened very carefully.<p>We ignored lots of things that it might've been bad to ignore in favor of building features that people wanted and talking with users.  We didn't incorporate.  Didn't get a bank account.  Didn't talk to a lawyer.  Didn't worry about SEO or any other marketing (even though I'm a bit of an SEO nut).  Didn't talk to investors.<p>Lots and lots and lots of focus on reducing frustration, reducing friction, and increasing value-- and lots and lots of communication with users (to understand that stuff better).<p>Boiled down-- lots of focus on understanding what the market wants (both individual lifehackers and biz teams that want to be more productive) and then building/iterating.
