You have friend lists, bulletins, status feeds, and profile comments-- all of the most popular features of Facebook.  You don't have ""MySpace Apps"" but people add stuff like quizzes to their pages and send questionnaire bulletins all the time.  ",1195760146.0

3,82804,comment,82781.0,82781.0,0,0,cperciva,,,"Why do you need to promote your startup somewhere other than on the internet?<p>My (completely accidental) approach is:<p>1. Spend four years being heavily involved in open source development (FreeBSD in my case) and gain a reputation for producing really cool software (both FreeBSD Update and Portsnap have elicited reactions of ""how did we manage to survive before this was available"" from multiple sources).<p>2. Announce that I'm working on a new project.<p>3. Watch as emails flood in from users of my earlier works who are convinced that whatever I'm working on right now has got to be the best thing since sliced bread.<p>Of course, I haven't launched publicly yet, and I don't know how many these enthusiastic people will end up paying to use my current project -- but it certainly won't hurt to have an established reputation for doing cool stuff.",1195758887.0

5,82802,comment,82787.0,82798.0,0,0,amichail,,,So any suggestions as to the app name and description?  Should they preserve the deception?,1195758752.0

8,82799,comment,82737.0,82737.0,0,0,Goladus,,,"If you plan to use a small, fixed number of servers and run them 24/7, then EC2 probably will not save you much.  It may even be more expensive.  The price advantage works best for tasks that need flexibility.  Sites that alternate between high demand and low demand, periodic or one-off processing intensive tasks where a 24/7 server is overkill-- that's where you really see the benefits of EC2.",1195758347.0

But then, why actually use the money that people are paying you for bandwidth to support their connections when you can just throttle BitTorrent?",1195758087.0
13,82794,comment,82787.0,82793.0,0,0,amichail,,,"For each friend, the user needs to think of the best lie to tell that friend in order to get him to add the app.  The friend would then get a notification with that lie.<p>For example, if one of your friends is into virtual gifts, you might make up a lie such as ""X has just given you a virtual gift.  Click here to see what it is.""<p>But there is no such gift.  Once the user adds the app he will learn its true nature and can send out lies of his/her own to his/her friends.<p>This is a game where the number of points scored depends on the number of friends (and possibly non-friends) that you tricked into adding the app.<p>If the app name / description reveals its true purpose, then the deception is only in getting the friend to click on the link in the notification.  Users may then decide whether to add the app given that they know something about its deception.  But this might skew the virality stats of the app ideas.",1195758042.0
