The subprime debacle began in the spring of 2007, and really began to spiral out of control on July 26 with various calamities in the CDO markets. By August 6-10 (the week of quant turmoil) it was starting to have an effect on equity markets-- which were strong at the time, and didn't start taking a real beating until Jan. 2008.<p>The economy was strong in 2007, with 4.9% (annualized) growth in Q3. Subprime didn't blow up because the economy tanked, because the mess began during a great economy, and turned it into a bad one. Of course, the tanking of the economy has made the credit situation even worse and will lead to even more defaults.<p>The default rate goes up during a bad economy, and everyone knew that this risk was there, and that a cyclical recession would occur sooner or later. What caused the rate to be ""unexpectedly"" high was the prevalence of speculation. In a bad economy with falling house prices, a resident homeowner is still going to make his best efforts to avoid the embarrassment and hassle of foreclosure, even if he has negative equity. Negative equity is irrelevant if he's going to live there for 10 years. On the other hand, a greedy and unscrupulous speculator has no reason not to default.",1229196421.0

When spawning a thread, there is instantly a huge space of possible paths for the program to go through. The coder then proceeds to prune off all paths that will lead to bad results, with the usual arsenal of mutex, semaphores, locks etc. etc. It's intellectually unbearable.<p>The alternative would be to explicitly specify which paths are allowable, rather than allow them all and then forbid which isn't.<p>I don't know how <i>that</i> would work, I don't remember who said it.

I worked on a team once with mostly contractors (paid hourly) and a couple of moron permis who were like that.  They were averaging 12 hour days across the year.  The contractors did it because they were well compensated for it.  But the permis did it because they thought they could stand out this way.  Get promotions, raises and bonuses.
