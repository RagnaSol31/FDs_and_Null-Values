One option to look at it is a Chevy Prizm, which is a re-branded copy of the Corolla made in Fremont.  They are usually cheaper used than the version with the Toyota emblem.<p>Try to get one for under 5,000 dollars, with less than 100,000 miles, from 2002 or newer.

Likewise, the page of any post should be able to be cached infinitely.  They don't run their messaging queue off their database I'd assume.<p>Really, Twitter doesn't do relational data which makes scaling a good bit easier.  The small amount of relational data that they do could be easily denormalized and pushed into memcached.  The problem that a lot of web apps face is that it's hard to denormalize because so much of the data is relational.  The only relations that I can think of is Person follows Person and Post belongs to Person and Post replies to Person.<p>So, it's not hard to denormalize that in a way that you can push into memcached rather than having to hit the database much.<p>I'm not saying that's how I'd do it if I were building Twitter, but with minimal relations and a small amount of data it's easy enough to keep the MySQL store in memory for log(n) lookups from memory and use memcached for O(1) lookups for the majority of stuff.",1243799087

12,634998,comment,634692.0,634901.0,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"It's more complicated than ""functional is slower than imperative"". Functional data structures are sometimes less immediately efficient, <i>but add persistence</i> (since they're immutable, they share subsections of the data structure, and/or have access to snapshots of past versions of the structure being modified). Whether this gives you needed features or just means extra work and cache misses depends on what you're doing. If you have a functional data structure and you want to add ""undo"" or backtracking, you're already most of the way there, while adding this to an imperative data structure means extra work to keep track of state changes.<p>_Purely Functional Data Structures_ by Chris Okasaki is, by far, the best collected resource, if you want to read further. (His thesis (<a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf</a>) is the kernel of the book.) Also, the fourth chapter of <i>Developing Applications with Objective Caml</i> (English translation: <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/</a>) discusses functional and imperative styles' strengths and weaknesses.<p>Reducing everything to runtime benchmarks obscures how, in practice, the trade-off is often more like ""it was a huge pain in the ass to get working without bugs, but it's 2% faster"" versus ""it took twenty minutes and was correct on the first try"". (Also, whether or not you use it in production, OCaml <i>rules</i> for prototyping complex data structures, in the same way Erlang does concurrency and C++ does linking errors.)",1243798833

This a good article about an industry where major players failed to make the transition because ""core competence = core incompetence.""  Hasselblad developed a digital system early on but dropped it because they felt it was so inferior that it would damage the brand.  As a consequence they missed out on the learning experience.  They should have read and deeply understood Clayton Christensen's ""Inventors Dilemma.""<p>My SO is an artist who uses digital photography to make studies for her paintings.  She started out with a 6 megapixel Nikon D70, but the resolution was inadequate for her needs.  Last year she moved up to a 12 megapixel D300 for around $1500 with a new lense.  At the time I looked at the new new Hasselblad, 52 megapixels at $35,000.  Needless to say out of out budget. The thing is a Hasseblad is not worth it for nearly anyone.  With the Nikon software and Photoshop, the can take 6 overlapping images and stitch them together and get a 50-70 megapixel image.  May be Hasselblad will last a few more years, but by then your under $5000 Nikon or Canon will have surpassed it.<p>Also the HP z3200 printer produces superb prints.

If Robots can work on more than 1 wave at a time (eg manage/monitor input on one wave and send summary updates to another) then it also opens up possibilities for lazy distributed processing applications.

And it's not entirely their fault, Google really, really hyped the UI.<p>Google Wave is potentially a new real-time (in the interactive sense) protocol for the web, one that easily supports many different languages (robots talk to waves across a protocol). And by open sourcing the server we have a new scalable distributed ecosystem for user generated content. Extensions (built on robots) are parasitic, this opens up incredible interactive possibilities.
