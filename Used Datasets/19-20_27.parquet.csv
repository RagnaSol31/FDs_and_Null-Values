About a month later they were asked to hire another Perl programmer and one of their interview questions was what's the difference between 'chomp' and 'chop' (chomp removes the final character of a string if it's a newline, chop does it regardless).<p>They were shocked that the interviewee didn't know the answer because they considered it basic knowledge, ""it's in the first chapter for gosh sake."" The first chapter in this case covered differences between Perl 4 and Perl 5.<p>In Perl 5, nobody uses 'chop', they all use 'chomp.' Many experienced Perl programmers might even have forgotten that 'chop' existed.<p>And that's my major problem with gotcha questions, they tend to be pretty far from measuring if a person can actually write productive code.",1212090369.0

If someone knows the solution they are trying to get at, they can focus on the program itself, as opposed to worrying about solving the problem and coming up with the algorithm. Ideally there are a few ways to solve the problem, brute-force methods or more efficient ways.
