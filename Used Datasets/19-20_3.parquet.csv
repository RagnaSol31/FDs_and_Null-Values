1,168125,comment,168094.0,168094.0,0,0,osipov,,,"Great article. I do all my work entirely from home and up until this point I couldn't pinpoint precisely what was missing. The article uses an excellent phase I was trying to articulate: ""casual serendipity"". Effectively, this is about casually describing your work to random people and finding serendipitous connections to other projects or learning unexpected, but relevant information.",1208635056

Trac kicks the living shit out of every other issue tracker I have ever seen.  You should look into Trac and/or Trac integration regardless of what VCS you us; all useful VC/SCM systems appear to be supported nowadays (alas, no Visual SourceSafe)<p><a href=""http://trac.edgewall.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trac.edgewall.org/</a><p>Trac kicks so much ass.  Moving to Trac legitimately made my hobby site real amounts of money because people entrusted us with more goodwill as a result of our quicker responses and better communication under Trac.<p>OOOH LOOKY HERE!  A trac-lighthouse comparison:<p><a href=""http://warpspire.com/tipsresources/web-publishing/lighthouse-the-bug-tracker-youve-been-looking-for/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://warpspire.com/tipsresources/web-publishing/lighthouse...</a><p>AND someone produced a Trac-Lighthouse mirroring tool (not unlike the very useful git-svn SVN-Git mirroring tools):<p><a href=""http://github.com/shayarnett/trachouse/tree/master"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/shayarnett/trachouse/tree/master</a><p>This is just too awesome.  Maybe GitHub is truly The Way.  I haven't been involved with a Big Project on GitHub yet, only Google Code, so take the following with a metric fuckload of NaCl please.<p>My experience with Google Code has been closest (in terms of communication and transparency) to that of running my own Trac installation.  I assume they're  converging towards Trac simply because it's the lowest-effort option at a Python shop with an SVN-centric offering.<p>Github is neat but I have begun to wonder if Git and its toolchain isn't a little discouraging for new/dabbling developers on a germinal project.  I use both, although I'm beginning to drift away to Git for new work.  Then again, I've been using Unix toolchains for 14 years now.  I'm the target demographic for Git.<p>Oh, fuck it.  This post has just become a catalog of useful links and migration tools for me.  If it helps you too, so be it, but writing this much means I have to help myself :-)",1208633861
7,168112,comment,167605.0,168055.0,0,0,apathy,,,"I liked both of the lists.  As usual, both of the articles could be elided and the lists would do the trick (of communicating 99.9% of the information present)<p>I'm tempted to hand Cringely's list (with ""find yer best nerd"" precaution prepended) to every last one of my clients.  And then up my rate a little.<p>There are companies with whom I work where I would dearly love to implement a big-data-on-the-server, pay-as-you-go service model (eg. digesting microarray data, normalization, preprocessing, PCA) talking via HTTP (as deltas/resultsets) to a lighter-weight client.  It's got to the point where any implementation of consequence basically has to be like this given the amount of processing required.  I'd do it for free, for fun, if it weren't for the fact that I need that time to work on papers and other paying jobs... plus I like spending time with my daughter.  It's one of those ""shit, if I knew back then what I know now"" situations that I figure old people find themselves in all the time.  (Because I am now over 30 and, therefore, <i>OLD</i>)<p>Once upon a time, I hated my job(s) and needed to be paid exorbitantly just to show up.  Now I need to be paid exorbitantly to turn down the 'other' jobs that pay well but are less interesting.  I guess that is a good thing.  I guess it also means that I am no longer an 'IT consultant' because the 'IT' part of what I do is ancillary to the meat, which is algorithmic and (multi-)domain-specific.  Hmm.",1208633216
