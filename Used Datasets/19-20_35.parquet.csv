7,558800,comment,558767.0,558767.0,0,0,zkarcher,,,"Have you tried developing one? ;)<p>In my experience, unusual game mechanics breed terrible edge cases. It's difficult to handle these gracefully and consistently. I'm developing a new Flash game called Toaster Bro:\n<a href=""http://blog.zacharcher.com/2009/03/20/toaster-bro-alpha-10-days-later/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.zacharcher.com/2009/03/20/toaster-bro-alpha-10-d...</a><p>The basic concept is simple: you have a magic wire. You plug outlets together to produce various effects. Hopefully it's not evident to the casual user, but this has been extremely difficult to smooth out. There are many types of outlets (not just electricity); wires can stretch between rooms (but only the player's room receives tick events, so the toaster rooms trap you inside, preventing you from remotely plugging in the toaster); there's a full scripting engine but you still have to handle all the state changes, ...<p>To keep this game simple, I made an early compromise: only one disconnected wire is allowed at any time. If you start drawing another wire, the original vanishes. Otherwise it becomes a topological nightmare, as users want to connect the loose ends of 2 wires, it's just very confusing to play, or understand what's happening.<p>A friend asked me if I could put logic gates in the game. This is probably superfluous (couldn't you just run electricity to the final destination?) but this could be used to break the system, because you can plug electricity into the logic gate's output. What now, bitches?! So you need even more rules, then.<p>Also I think basic ""warfare"" games are easier to contemplate, because we're all familiar with throwing pellets at our grade school friends, and whatnot. Most of us didn't grow up warping the fabric of time and space, so it's hard to think in that context ;)",1239566054

Next we compare the two groups again, but this time we are surprised when we find both groups are capable of non-moral acts.  Also, we jump from a simple comparison of believers and non-believers to the use of god's name.<p>The point just doesn't say much more than, ""people are capable of good and evil"".  A religious person would only become troubled that evil people are misappropriating their belief system to back their evil acts.  i.e. Hitchens point will not faze a religious person.<p>A better response would be to show in the positive that a similar morality to Christianity can be built from a few well reasoned assumptions.  This would address the GP's wish to show that morality is not dependent on a religious system. It is important to remember, from a religious persons perspective morality is defined by God.

The answer, ultimately, is judges and juries. These people have a wide range of discretion and are often surprisingly reasonable. (Although certainly not always. And they cost a lot to convince, and they can be <i>randomly</i> unreasonable, which is why there are a lot of jury-trial horror stories and why lawyers prefer to avoid jury trials whenever possible.)<p>If I leave a loaded gun lying around and you pick it up and shoot me dead, the legality of your action is going to depend crucially on what you can make the prosecutor and the jury believe. If you convince them that you did it by accident -- that you were honestly just playing around with the gun on the assumption that nobody would be dumb enough to leave a loaded gun around -- you might be found innocent. If you had a documented motive for killing me, or were arguing with me at the time in front of witnesses, or if there were <i>no</i> witnesses... well, good luck.<p>Finally, when you say:<p><i>It doesn't harm any end-users... at worst it only modifies their profile page.</i><p>You are making a lot of unwarranted assumptions. For one thing: If you publicly deface a website you advertise the existence of an exploit which someone <i>else</i> might then use for evil purposes. But, more importantly: Who says that an edit to a user profile is always harmless? People have lost relationships, job leads, careers, and reputations over such ""trivial"" things.

When you characterize column stores as ""engineering around"" the ""pecularities"" of HDDs, you make it seem like column stores are a workaround and row stores are the ""natural"" approach, which I don't think is the case.
