The author wants a service that allows developers to quickly and programatically convert proprietary format documents (MS Office, etc) to standard easily viewable formats (pdf, flash) for FREE to 'die' because he has somehow missed the obvious text-selection tool in iPaper (even same icon as Adobe uses), the obvious ways to download the document as pdf, and somehow has mysterious double-scrollbars that no one else seems able to duplicate. Better vote this post up!<p>I'll try to counter the rant with one of my top reasons Scribd should not die:<p>Have you ever been to a corporate site that has loads of links to Microsoft Office documents? (Ex: <a href=""http://www.humanrights.coe.int/equality/Eng/WordDocs/Document%20list.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.humanrights.coe.int/equality/Eng/WordDocs/Documen...</a> ) I have, and it's such a pain to have to download and open the documents manually. Then I also have the documents that I downloaded cluttering up my hard drive - when all I wanted to do was take a quick look at it. So I find myself not even bothering with the Office documents - which I'm sure is not what the company trying to promote themselves wants. If you look at <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/platform/documentation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/platform/documentation</a> - you'll see Scribd has provided a solution to this problem with their QuickSwitch service. Once this is used, all of those proprietary format documents on the site are 'magically' converted into standard formats you can view easily: pdf and flash. Nice.",1213991953

XMPP uses SSL if possible and otherwise does a dialback so you can at least be sure the message was sent from the server it claims to be from.<p>The other aspect is that XMPP is young enough that it can still change to do more (since there are only a handful of clients and servers, as compared to SMTP). As far as I can tell, SMTP is completely stagnant and any improvements that can't be made unilaterally won't happen. (I'm not very familiar with SMTP, I'd love to be proven wrong.)",1213991777

However, this means that they use option = meta, which means other keystrokes like option-U (umlaut) are not really Mac-like.  (Also, Aquamacs doesn't appear to support non-ASCII keyboard layouts at all, though it can open non-ASCII files, while in Carbon Emacs I can type Hiragana and even use the native Kanji selector.)  Tradeoffs.<p>For another, in Emacs the idea of ""buffers"" and ""frames"" (Mac windows) are completely independent concepts, while in Mac apps they're basically the same thing.  Aquamacs tries to use the Mac system (only one buffer per window frame), but this appears to have some strange consequences, probably because Emacs really wasn't designed for that.  (Choose Preferences, and then close that window; the preferences buffer goes away, but the window remains.)  Tradeoffs.<p>Mac OS X and Emacs have very different interfaces, so you can't be perfectly Emacs-like and Mac-like.  Each implementation picks a different set of Mac features to obey.
