A lot of the mess is from it's continued support of PHP4 and PHP5 which have a lot of incompatibilities in their object models.<p>I haven't used Symphony in ages, but it was originally a fork of a project called Mojavi (which I used to work on).  It was designed as a pure PHP5 MVC framework with a heavy emphasis on being easy to override or modify any of the components.  I don't know how true it's held to that these days, but the original code base was pretty slick.<p>That said.  I don't use either, I've got a little 300 line OOP MVC wrapper I wrote that serves my purposes.  But if I were going to look at a framework today it would be Zend or Symphony.",1229543546.0

One of our products (SourceGuardian.com) provides encryption for PHP source code.  Our experience was to create something that we wanted to use ourselves, as the competition at the time was charging $6000 a license, and then we turned that into a product. We have created several other applications and are working on some backup software which links with Amazon EC2/S3 and is due for launch in Jan 2009.  For this, and for the other software under this brand we'll be looking primarily at a reseller model.  Finally we are also working on hybrid apps, that take the power of the internet/servers/cloud and use that for processing, bringing the data back to a desktop app/widget as well as iphone.  The latest one is competitive intelligence online and my own feeling is that desktop apps still have the edge for usability right now.

You're already using the Reflection API to to get to the names of the method arguments so that your /hello/$first/$last works, no? Or are you just relying on the order and assuming the developer puts things in teh right order, ie /hello/$foo/$bar works just as well?<p>If the former is true (you're already getting the param names), then there's no further overhead to map directly to $_REQUEST. I forget the exact Reflection syntax, but wouldn't it just be something like<p>$argsToPass = array();\n$args = ReflectionMethod->getParams(); //you got an array of param names in the order they appear in the function\nforeach ($args as $arg) {\n    if (!isset($_REQUEST[$arg])) { //check if the arg is optional and fail if not }\n    $argsToPass[] = $_REQUEST[$arg];\n}\n$ReflectionMethod->invoke($argsToPass);<p>I haven't touched this stuff in a while, so I might be completely off, but I'm not sure what overhead you're referring to...<p>Once again, I'm not defending this approach, as the extra logic you've put in to interpret the path probably makes things a lot more flexible and easier to debug.",1229541616.0

But I suspect that non-profit would use that money for their actual causes (I know I'd rather my donation to <a href=""http://kidcancer.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kidcancer.org/</a> go to curing kids' cancer than pay for a top tier web consultant).<p>And that doesn't even consider the Randall Munroe-autographed gear those donors would be missing out on.",1229540626.0

Late static binding (coming in PHP 5.3) will be nice once it is ubiquitous.<p>Attributes are a way of declaratively making a statement at a more ""meta"" level. Because doccomments are a first class language construct in PHP (i.e. Reflection provides doccomments for you) it seemed the most appropriate place for providing additional metadata.",1229540561.0

This guy is in the habit of submitting every single one the stories he writes for the Wall Street Journal's tech news site. Like most of the others, it's a sensational headline on top of a baseless article. But on the bright side, at least he spelled his headline correctly today. A job posting for ""Business Product Manager"" is supposedly the smoking gun here. Sheesh... If publishers are willing to pay for this stuff then I'm in the wrong business.<p>Hackers News is not your own personal advertising outlet. If you've got something worthwhile by all means submit it, but it's getting a little old seeing every article you write pop up on here.",1229540410.0
