If you can't stand behind doing work in a mainstream language, don't take those jobs, and accept that you're going to earn a fraction of what your peers do.<p>However, when you deliver product to people in a language nobody else uses, and implicitly recommend they deploy code in that language, and you do it because you're bored with PHP, and you pick the language you move to deliberately to mask the costs of using a less popular language by compiling it down to PHP, you're coming pretty close to screwing over your clients.<p>Happy to be wrong about this, though.

I've been writing PHP apps for a few years now, and I contribute to multiple PHP webapp projects, and I'm never fighting the language.  PHP is capable of doing just about anything that any other language can do; you just have to work with PHP and stop trying to make it act like Ruby or Python.<p>PHP has an absolutely enormous library, which makes just about anything possible in a webapp without needing much in the way of external libraries.  Templating is a core feature of the language, and with a small bit of planning and a knowledge of how to employ PHP's strengths, you can get a lot done really quickly.  Perhaps the biggest stumbling block is inconsistent naming and parameter schemes for the core library, but even that is just a simple lookup in the excellent php.net documentation.<p>If you're fighting your tools in their strongest domains, you're not using the tools correctly...",1240689153.0

Everything bad about the banking industry, they do more of it, and they do it more aggressively.  Stacking withdrawals on an overdrawn account to maximize fees, pushing expensive products aggressively every time they interact with a customer, horrible and disjointed online experience, dramatic credit card rate increases, etc.  I moved from Chase to Frost Bank in Texas many years ago, and never had a single complaint.<p>When I moved out to the valley in 07, I opened a business and personal account at WaMu...and was very happy with the experience.  Now, I can't go into the local branch without seeing at least one person yelling (literally) at the teller, because of unexpected fees, bounced checks, etc.  I experienced it myself...I deposited a $9,000 check to the business account via the night depository, as I knew I had some advertising charges coming in a few days.  I found out a week later that they'd declined the check, due to a problem with the endorsement (despite the endorsement being exactly the same as I'd always done), and charged us four NSF fees (total: $132).  They didn't send me an email or call me on the phone...they mailed the check back, and it took a week to get here, so if I had been making a lot more purchases on that account, it could have spiraled into insanely high fees without me even knowing there was a problem.<p>Needless to say, I've been shopping for a new bank since then.  Everybody left standing in this area seems to suck equally badly (and be owned by a megabank like Chase).",1240688954.0

If we were just simply facing natural global warming (and maybe we are, I'm no expert), I'd say ""lemonade from lemons"" and all that.<p>I tend to come down on the side of action to stop possible human contribution to global warming, though.  One reason is simply fear of the unknown - there might be benefits, but we're doing alright now, and that isn't really a knob I feel like needs to be tweaked just to see what happens.<p>But another far more important reason for me is that it seems like the actions needed to stop the possible human contribution to global warming are Good Things whether they're actually causing that particular problem or not.  Spewing less crap into the air?  Sounds great.  More energy efficient cars/trucks/devices/appliances?  Sounds great.  Paying attention to energy costs expended on lighting, and as a side effect maybe getting to see stars in the sky over a city sometime?  Awesome.<p>I always wonder about the people who say we shouldn't take action.  Because it's too expensive?  That seems to miss the basic observation that the economy exists to serve the wants and needs of the people within it, not the other way around - if people decide this is something they value, that they want to work on, the economics will work out.  I really think its something more basic, the traditional dichotomy between the personal and the common.

My intent in the response above was just to point out that the WSJ author seems to be assuming people already know the negative side.  So it wasn't that he was painting a rosy picture it's just that he was trying to provide supplemental information to what people have already heard.<p>That said, if you're curious, my problem with GW has always been the focus on the cause and not the effect.  I don't have a problem with us trying to do everything we can not to change Earth's enviornment.  In general I think it's a good idea for humans to make as little an impact on nature as we can in going about our day.<p>But at the same time it's a proven fact that our planet makes dramatic shifts in it's climate even without our influence (Ice Age for example).  So the reality is climate change is coming whether we cause it or not.<p>Beyond that GW is not proven beyond a doubt so if it happens not to be true we'll have spent all our time trying to stop causing something that we were never causing in the first place.<p>So basically my opinion on GW has always been that, since we know climate change is coming no matter what, humanity should work on preparing itself for climate change's effects regardless of who or what causes it.",1240687816.0
