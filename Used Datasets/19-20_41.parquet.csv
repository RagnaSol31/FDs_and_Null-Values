But this file would be one directory up from the project directory ... which is outside of your Django project. Django puts the directory one level up on your PYTHONPATH to compensate for this, with the assumption that part of your project lives outside of version-control, etc. The solution is to remember to put the directory above the directory that the project lives in version-control and treat it as part of the project.
