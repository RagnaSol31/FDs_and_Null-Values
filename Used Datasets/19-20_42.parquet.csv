31,551493,comment,551362.0,551362.0,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,We use object store for exactly the kind of thing he argues it should be used for (slightly analogous to CAD).  I think it sucks.  A normalized relational schema would be much better.  Instead we suffer endless invalid pointer crashes and inconsistent data all over the place.  Changing the schema is also a nightmare.<p>OODBs are a seductive hack.  They can look like a great idea because initial development is simple.  You get to skip the laborious step of developing a proper relational schema and setting up mechanisms to ensure integrity.  Two years later your data is an inflexible mess with subtle integrity errors here and there.,1239132471

The problem with this stuff is usually the painful verbosity of Java necessary to use it, but you can wrap away that pain very quickly with Clojure.<p>I do take the point about needing to fiddle with the classpath for any other Java code you want to use.  But for me the Java classpath system holds up better than most other software deployment mechanisms.  Usually, you just download a jar file, drop it on your classpath, and it just works.  I think jar files are an unappreciated success story of the Java ecosystem.  Clojure has functions to easily add jars to the classpath at runtime, which is even better, but I find it does not always work seamlessly for me.",1239131021
