However, I do wonder if there it a point where the dark side of network effects, which are primarily sociological in nature, will simply overwhelm any technological aspects or other moves on the part of a community's stewards / leaders.",1216321810

How much control/influence do you think these types of investors have?  They have a minority stake, rarely have a board seat, etc.<p>It's easy/popular to blame bad products on investors, but usually that's pretty unfair.  I think (at the seed stage) it's usually due to the founders.<p>I think better advice might be ""don't take so much money that you have to give up early control.""<p>It seems to me that a well-run angel funded startup will get to market quicker and have a slightly bigger (and potentially quicker) exit if the founders play their cards right.  So you trade a small minority stake for getting ""there"" (wherever there is) months or years sooner as well as having a slightly better shot at a win due to investor influence.<p>This all assumes a goal of eventual liquidity, of course.",1216321787

But I didn't originally set out to make Voo2do into a business -- the only way I get money for it at present is through donations.  Are you saying anyone who wants to build and offer a web application should form an umbrella corporation for that?  What about non-web software?  Where do you draw the line between ""personal experimental project"" and ""entity that needs a state-sanctioned organization around it""?",1216321555

You can learn enough Perl in a week to write neato sed/grep/awk type programs and shell script tupe stuff to outfit your command line however you like.  Also... it's a good investment because your tools will run on any platform.  You can soak up a measure of Unix culture as you go and you'll pick up a swiss-army-chainsaw that you can use when your usual dev tools don't cut it.<p>Going up to the next level in Perl has a larger learning curve than you might expect... but the ""low hanging fruit"" are very easy to get the hang of.",1216321213
