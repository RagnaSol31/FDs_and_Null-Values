12,155172,comment,155063.0,155063.0,0,0,ALee,,,"As a non-hacker on a team with two exceptional hackers, I would recommend the following startup advice:<p>1) DO have incentives that reflect contribution- all of us have equity split evenly, everyone brings something to the table; these guys will later also help determine the direction of future hires (and I trust their abilities to do so)<p>2) DO be more open than usual- the difference between bullies and real partners is being able to include everyone in the process, it makes everyone feel like they're working toward the goal. Definitely make sure that you're adding value and let others know of what you're doing and say why. Include people in meetings if they want, usually, your biz dev meeting are so boring that your partners don't want to sit in (they want to be there for the decision, but not for the meetings before it).<p>3) DO NOT micromanage- I think Sam Altman said this in an interview that the greatest startups are where you have a bunch of people doing amazing things all at the same time and they're driving to a goal. Definitely set milestones for each other, but do not question when your hacker takes time off to play Guitar Hero<p>4) DO make it about the company- You're building a company and that's the bigger goal, it's not about you, it's about the company. So, stick to milestones, stick to atomic goals, and go hard down the path to victory.<p>5) DO make the environment easier to hack- Your job is to get a product out, so that includes some management and creativity, while also doing the other tasks that distract (biz dev, etc.)<p>6) DO learn to hack yourself (not for the business, but for yourself)- I'm learning Python and it gives you a better perspective of what your hacker partners are doing. Don't hack for your business, choose some problems that you want to tackle yourself and do those on the side.<p>As to hacker recruitment, hire slow and make sure that person can work with your folks.

Aren't growth companies supposed to be reinvesting profits in their own growth?""<p>Yeah, dividends-off-profits.  The growth-company thing is an issue for the initial ramp-up phase: it'd probably be 10 years or so before the fund would start having additional capital to invest.  But in the steady-state, older non-growing businesses throw off cash that can be reinvested in small growth businesses.<p>""So if Berkshire invests in a value company that throws off 3% dividends per quarter, that's great. But it's only great because they can get their cash out at any time.""<p>Berkshire <i>can't</i> cash out of their value companies at any time.  Their typical modus operandi is to buy 80% of a successful privately-held business, leaving the other 20% to the founders.  The companies remain privately held, and their stock is not sold on the open market.  The only way Berkshire can cash out is if they find another buyer, like a private equity firm or large conglomerate, to take the whole business off their hands at once.<p>Also, dividends thrown off by private companies are often a lot more than 3% (public companies have such lousy dividends largely because shareholders lack bargaining power).  Take See's Candy, one of Berkshire's early acquisitions (<a href=""http://valueinvestingresource.blogspot.com/2008/03/sees-candy-magic-formula-stock-from.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://valueinvestingresource.blogspot.com/2008/03/sees-cand...</a>).  They bought it in 1972 for $25M on earnings of $5M.  Since then, See's has required capital infusions of $32M and spun off dividends of $1.35B.  That's a dividend-to-profit ratio of 98%, in comparison to the normal Wall Street averages of 30-50%.<p>Of course, few startup entrepreneurs would be willing to sell 80% of the company from the outset.  Berkshire functions in reverse to VC firms, providing liquidity and multi-million-$ payouts to firms that have already gotten successful.  But what if you reversed the terms?  10-20% of the equity for the chance to be your own boss?  With the investor's dividend payouts protected by a legal clause in the investment documents, guaranteeing that after certain profitability and cash reserve milestones are met and growth has fallen below a certain amount, X% of the profits are distributed as dividends?<p>This is all idle speculation, since I don't have money to put where my mouth is.  But if I had a billion dollars or so, I'd definitely want to try it.  Because if these assumptions are true:<p>1.) Startups are the most productive part of the economy<p>2.) A small initial investment would let many more people quit their day jobs and found startups<p>3.) Getting bought destroys most of the efficiency advantages of being a startup<p>Then a logical consequence is that a firm that buys-and-holds small profit-oriented startups should do better than one that invests in large public companies.<p>Besides, it'd be a cool financial hack.",1207337251

When they're too crowded, some people are forced out and it moves down to a more reasonable equilibrium.  That's like saying that a theme park will fail because it gets too crowded -- when something is too crowded to be worthwhile, people stop going and it then becomes not too crowded anymore.",1207335737

I think I can design a product to take the stupid out of the processes I saw working in medicine.  I also think that my solution to the problem I see might work as a platform for other health care innovations.  Once our demo is working, we will decide together how to go forward, but I probably will be focused on design and medical aspects and hire a person for the business aspects too.  Because our company is basically applying design and tech to medical problems, this means I will be CEO, so our focus stays there.  However, my style includes being aware of my limitations, and delegating 100% of tech to the hacker, who wants to grow into CTO.  A large aspect of our company will include components like creating a medical protocol, clinical trials and medical demographics, with tech being about 30-45% of what we need, so we may be substantially different then most Y startups in that respect.<p>I'm working on setting up a wiki to help organize our information and communication and preserve spheres of influence.  I used to do some minor hacking as a kid back in the day, but just enough to have some respect for hackers and know I'm (way) out of my league if I want it done right.",1207335645
