Consider rewording.<p>The vast majority of MySQL deployments conceal the MySQL connection handler from end-users --- in the vast majority of deployments, it's the web app stack talking to MySQL, not the client. Virtually all security testing of MySQL is done to that service model.<p>""Partitioned"" MySQL is a totally different service model, where the attacks aren't simply string escapes or column truncation through HTTP post-args, but arbitrary SQL syntax, arbitrary MySQL commands, and the MySQL network protocol itself. That service model has received <i>very little</i> security testing. Some data points for context:<p>* The second model implicates vastly more MySQL code, which has to be bug-free for this to be safe.<p>* No major database has survived intensive post-auth security testing; Litchfield's results on Oracle --- a database that got millions of dollars of security attention internally --- were all post-auth; that testing happened after he (presumably) beat the crap out of Microsoft SQL Server.<p>* Even if you ""partitioned"" MySQL into multiple running instances of mysqld running under different UIDs in different filesystem paths --- which is not what this article is implying --- a vulnerability in that MySQL code still gives an attacker code execution on your database server, which would be a game-over problem in a commercial app.",1225396551.0

If you're not so lucky you'll be fighting for post-docs on the type of projects you're talking about. Hopefully there will be only one post-doc, there could easily be 2 or 3.<p>My take is this: Under no circumstances accept the status quo. I've seen so many graduate students spiral into depression because they stuck at it. I know I did, and I stuck at it because of some weird obsession with how I was perceived in the world (by my parents, my old friends, whatever), and because I didn't spend enough time asking myself: What makes me happy?
