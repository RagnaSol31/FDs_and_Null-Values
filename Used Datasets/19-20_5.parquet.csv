And yet the overwhelming majority of raw packet processing code is still written in C, because it's just not that hard.<p>(2) Ok, type checking is kind of the point of OCaml. If you're into that sort of thing, go for it.<p>(3) High level languages are slow and getting much, much faster. Javascript, Python, and (soon) Ruby are getting JIT'd to native code and threaded C calls. And all of them have foreign function interfaces that let you call into C/C++ code when you actually care about speed.<p>(4) I doubt anyone's choosing OCaml over Python for the library support.",1222027125
