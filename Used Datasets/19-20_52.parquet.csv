23,423827,comment,423490.0,423726.0,0,0,mdasen,,,"PostgreSQL was designed ""correct"" from the start.  However, MySQL does many of the same things today.<p>You start by saying you'll have 5,000 people who want 1,000 different pages with some updates, some selects, etc.  Well, once you have more queries than cores, the benefit of splitting work over multiple cores is gone since none of the queries can logically use even a whole single core given the level of concurrency.<p>You go on to say that PostgreSQL was designed to eliminate unnecessary locking so that selects wouldn't be blocked.  MySQL's MyISAM database doesn't support this, that is correct.  However, InnoDB does support the same MVCC model that PostgreSQL uses and likewise eliminates the locking issue.<p>Your argument rests on MySQL locking an entire table to do a write: ""When you have 500 reads and 1 write, and you lock the entire table for that write, it's not a big deal. . . But when you have an array of hundreds of simultaneous reads and writes, it becomes a mess if you don't have fine-grained locking capabilities."" A great article on this problem is here: <a href=""http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2001/05/25/postgresql_mvcc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2001/05/25/postgresql_mvc...</a>.  It's great that PostgreSQL supports that, but MySQL supports it too today (<a href=""http://wiki.oracle.com/page/InnoDB?t=anon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.oracle.com/page/InnoDB?t=anon</a>).<p>There are plenty of things that one can say are issues between the two.  MySQL's inferior query planner.  The fact that PostgreSQL can suggest indexes based on query history.  PostgreSQL's weak replication (Slony-I's communication costs grow quadratically, yuck!).  MySQL's acceptance of February 31st as a real date.  MySQL's poor subquery optimization. PostgreSQL's more limited data partitioning.<p>They aren't equal in all ways and PostgreSQL is a wonderful database, but saying that MySQL needs to lock a table to do a write is just wrong in a very partisan manner.  I've never really understood such partisanship.  Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of multiple products makes you aware of what is good for a project and what isn't.  Even better, once you're using one of them, you know what to do and what to avoid with it.  Not confronting the reality of how alternative systems work just means that the chance of picking the best system is more luck than information.  For what it's worth, I use PostgreSQL in my personal projects.  It's great.  However, it's also important to understand that MySQL of 2008 is not MySQL of 2001.  It's come a long way in the ""correctness"" camp and the old arguments about Multi-Version Concurrency Control don't apply anymore.<p>Oh, and from Power PostgreSQL, Disks > RAM > CPU (<a href=""http://www.powerpostgresql.com/PerfList"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.powerpostgresql.com/PerfList</a>).",1231357026

If you know C, you're likely to know many others who know C. If you don't, you might struggle to name even one other person who does.<p>But this is obviously not because you need to know the right people to know C. It's because a programmer is born not knowing C and must struggle to learn it. In the course of her struggles, she interacts with, works with, and in other ways self-selects for many people who have shared this same struggle.<p>Business is the same. Its goal (at least in capitalist society) is to create wealth. No one is born knowing how to make profit. A person must struggle to learn this skill, and in doing so often associates with many others doing the same.<p>So you have two groups. One whose goal it is to create efficient, innovative, elegant code and another whose goal it is to create wealth. One group tends to end up with awesome software and the other tends to end up with awesome resources. It is perfectly reasonable that it should be so. And yet the developers look at the business people and say ""I guess it must be who you know?"" Aren't we smarter than that?",1231356799
