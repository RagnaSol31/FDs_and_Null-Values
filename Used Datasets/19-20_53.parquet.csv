Here's the list: France, Holland, Spain (and multiple Spanish islands), Turkey and the US. However, when I arrive in Canada I'm sent a nice message saying I can send and receive SMS messages, but I can't make calls. This is apparently considered nice as my phone connected to Rogers, from what I've heard they're the only company with deals to out of country companies.<p>Needless to say I'm happy that the Canadian government is considering legislation to open up the cellular market to outside owners.<p>However, when I go to buy a book I have a nice choice between Indigo, Chapters and Coles. Incidentally, they're owned by the same company. They're the only bookstore I've seen in my whole time here and they're one in the same. Amazon is restricted to hell in what it can do, it apparently can't own warehouses inside of Canada so they struck a deal with CanadaPost that allows them to use the entirety of one of their warehouses in (IIRC) Mississauga as their Canadian distribution center, and apparently Indigo/Chapters/Coles wanted Amazon kicked out of the country, their one and only competition.<p>The monopolies in the country are insane. All big companies are completely protected from outside competition and because of this they exploit it to hell. Bell Canada actually sent out modems to people who aren't their customers and then said if they don't return them they'll charge them $200. Not too long after they'd stopped doing that they started sending us Cancellation of Service notices demanding we pay a late ~$40 off the bill due (IIRC the first one was) July 11th by July 2nd. We were supposed to pay between July 11th and August 11th, they wanted a <i>late</i> payment for that month by July 2nd before they accept payment. After multiple months of that crap we're now switching to Cogeco, only because we've got a friend who works there.

Second, as a person involved in biomedical research, I am very familiar with the bias toward publishing positive results, and leaving the negative results buried in a lab notebook somewhere. There are two root causes for this:<p>1. Funding agencies reward positive results. Of course, the biggest funding agency in the U.S. is the U.S. gov't. The gov't must answer to the people, and the people only want to hear about positive results. Show some interest or at least concern for negative findings (and learn, or teach kids in school, why negative findings are important), and you'll find more scientists publishing negative findings.<p>2. Funding, especially in the U.S., is a competition. Why would you tell your competitors all the things that didn't work? Why give them that strategic advantage? Would you expect Google to tell Yahoo which search algorithms don't work? Reward scientists based on consistent good work, and not based on their ability to beat out competitors, and you'll find more scientists publishing negative findings.",1232566073.0

As far as I can tell, this is a ""cost of doing business"" and other than some common sense rules (don't accept business from Nigerians, East Europeans, or whoever is the ""land of hackers"" this week - check the address and IP addresses - log everything), I don't think anyone will be able to assist you (including law enforcement, who has a hard time getting involved for less than 6-digits of losses). One of the applications I'm responsible for accepts/processes credit cards, and we have 0 chargebacks, but that's mainly because this application is a add-on for a desktop application that costs several hundred dollars.<p>The other one you didn't seem to address is PCI-DSS compliance. If you store the credit card number in any place (including log files), you (and your customers) could be in for a world of hurt if you're hacked (like TJ Maxx did). \n<a href=""https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/index.shtml</a> (see chart on page 4 of the spec, and the checklists at the end may be helpful as well).",1232565277.0

The link between benefits and utilization is that in order to gain future benefits you spend a certain amount on capital goods<p>I'm not misunderstanding you at all.  I'm pointing out that your terminology is non-standard and inconsistent.<p>There is no link between benefits and utilization.  Utilization only affects costs.<p>> Now, you say the connection between utilization and costs is not always strong. No, it's not always strong,<p>The original claim was that low utilization was always unsustainable.  Conceding that the relationship between utilization and costs is not always strong is an admission that said claim was wrong.  It is strong in some circumstances but not others.<p>The specific example was mostly idle computers, the claim being that having an idle computer is unsustainable.<p>> Paying only for the resources you actually use increases flexibility and reduces costs.<p>Not always.  Consider my home PC.  I could have gotten one less powerful for somewhat less money.  The less powerful one would suit my needs much of the time.  Moreover, said computer is idle much of the time.  However, the costs of trying to optimize for utilization are significantly higher than the costs of just having a reasonable computer, even though the utilization is low.<p>The problem with the ""actually use"" argument is that there are costs associated with flexibility.  That's why I mentioned 400MB of ram.  (Which reminds me - that use of ""flexibility"" is somewhat idiocynratic.  Having 1GB of ram is more flexible than having 200mb and going out and renting 800mb on demand.)<p>However, that's just me.  So, let's find out if you're any different.  Do you own any devices that are significantly underutilized?  Why?",1232565158.0
