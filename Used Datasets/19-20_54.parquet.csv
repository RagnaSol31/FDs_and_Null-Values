Could you give some more detail about what operations trigger the allocating? Admittedly, I haven't tried writing a game engine in C++ yet, but I do write a lot of plot rendering code, and I try to keep my rendering loops ""read only,"" so if STL containers are used, only const member functions are called. Retrieving a member from a vector for example, shouldn't involve any allocations on the heap.<p>Unless you're counting stack too. I could see STL implementations combined with a compiler poor at inlining resulting in a lot of extra call depth.<p>Edit: Also, if the original poster is mostly using C++ due to the platform (I don't know what Symbian supports) it's unlikely he has the same sort of performance requirements you do.

Start writing applications using STL and boost immediately (or in your case, the STL plus the Symbian APIs).<p><pre><code>   Both libraries have enough quirks that it takes a significant\n   amount of time and experience to use them correctly. For\n   example, you don't need the std::vector or std::list\n   containers. Simply allocate a sufficiently large array to hold\n   your items, then allocate a larger array when the first one\n   fills up.\n</code></pre>\nThis is how we ended up with so much crappy C++ code in the 90s.<p><i>sigh</i>.  Yes, you <i>do</i> need std::vector and std::list.  Those are the very first two data structures you should learn.  If you're using int[] instead of std::vector<int>, there'd better be a good reason.  Similarly if you're using char * instead of std::string. Learn to use iterators, and learn to use <algorithm>.  Don't be afraid of streams, either.  I think doing it any other way is just wasting time and making it harder to actually become proficient in C++, rather than just using the C++ compiler to give you C with a tiny bit of syntactic sugar.<p>IMHO, it's much better to learn the ins and outs of STL as you use it, not by putting off using it until you master it all (what kind of logic is that, anyway?).  I.e., it's way better to start off using a std::vector exactly as you would an array and learn it as you go than to put off using std::vector entirely until you understand the default allocator and operator overloading.",1208375393

19,165539,comment,165098.0,165463.0,0,0,palish,,,"It would be both counterproductive and a premature optimization to learn C++ by first learning the STL containers.  The only container that the C++ newcomer needs to learn is the dynamically allocated array.  The statement ""vector and map are pretty simple"" just isn't true.  STL and Boost have a lot of subtleties:<p>1) It is important to write STL code in the correct style.  STL containers should be typedef'd before they are used and an iterator shouldn't be used directly to access an item (otherwise debugging becomes more difficult and your code becomes harder to read).  For example,<p><pre><code>  typedef std::list< Puppy > PuppyContainer;\n\n  PuppyContainer puppies;\n  for( PuppyContainer::iterator it = puppies.begin(); it != puppies.end(); ++it )\n  {\n     Puppy* puppy = *it;\n     // do something with your puppy\n  }\n</code></pre>\n... rather than ...<p><pre><code>  std::list< Puppy > PuppyContainer;\n  for( std::list< Puppy >::iterator it = puppies.begin(); it != puppies.end(); ++it )\n  {\n     // do something with *it\n  }\n</code></pre>\n2) STL frequently allocates memory.  Those allocations are also hidden from you, so it is easy to misunderstand the true cost of frequently using STL containers.  Even a simple operation like acquiring an iterator can cause an allocation.<p>I work at a game company.  In their game's code base, the pervasiveness of STL has been attributed to <i>millions</i> of micro-allocations every <i>frame</i> of their game.  (A micro-allocation is an allocation of under 128 bytes.)  The result is hopelessly fragmented memory, which means that:<p>- A relatively small 10MB allocation can cause a crash even when there is clearly more than 10MB free memory.<p>- A lot of code runs slowly because almost none of the code can take advantage of the CPU cache.<p>3) Using STL can add code complexity and make your code harder to read.  Which of these is easier for a newcomer to understand?<p><pre><code>  for( size_t i = 0; i < _numPuppies; ++i )\n    if( _puppies[ i ].ID() == finding )\n    {\n      /* do something with that puppy */\n      break;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n... or ...<p><pre><code>  PuppyContainer::iterator it = _puppies.find( finding );\n  if( it != _puppies.end() )\n  {\n    Puppy* puppy = it->second;\n    /* do something with that puppy */\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe second example isn't intuitively easy to write unless you're already familiar with std::map.<p>Check out my Radix Sort example.  I could have used a couple std::vectors, but the result is equivalent and simple:  <a href=""http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/315/programming/exaples/radix_sort_example.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/315/programming/exaples/radix_sor...</a><p>4)  It takes a <i>lot</i> of time to learn every facet of the C++ language.  And the more you learn, the more other people can't read what you write because of your advanced knowledge.  (Try understanding boost/bind.hpp.)<p>5)  Most importantly, most design problems are architectural and not structural.  As long as your code works and is reasonably clean and well-commented, it is good and safe code.  It is more important to master a subset of C++ than to have a working knowledge of the entire language.",1208374776

For some, it's paramount.  For others, it's not as important.<p>Interestingly enough, a lot of people get stuck in some sort of weird trap:  Their idea is worth so much to them that they won't give up equity yet their idea is worth so little that they won't invest in it.",1208372818

The agency says that registration could take as long as ten days for standard devices like PDAs and laptops and that it intends to confiscate devices that are used without registration. Users who wish to operate a wireless access point or WiFi-enabled home router are expected to go through an even more onerous process that will involve submitting documentation and obtaining a license. In certain regions, like Moscow and St. Petersburg, users will also have to receive special approval from the Federal Security Service.<p>The policy, which was explained to Fontanka.ru by the Russian agency's deputy director Vladimir Karpov, could reverse existing policies like a 2004 government panel decision to provide blanket permission for indoor wireless access point operation and a 2007 policy that allowed use of mobile WiFi devices without registration. According to The Other Russia, the Russian government agency that is responsible for issuing the new policy was created when the Russian media and telecommunications regulatory bodies were merged last year.""",1208372451
