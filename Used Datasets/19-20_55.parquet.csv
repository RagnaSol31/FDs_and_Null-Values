Another task involves optimizing the processes and minimizing the associated cost.<p>The whole raison d'Ãªtre of a large organizational pyramid is cost of processing and transmitting information and handling the associated noise. Middle layers of management filtering and processing information for the upper decision-makers. Keeping the noise down by designing company 'policies', 'strategies' and 'missions' that can be easily communicated to every employee.<p>A manager who designs the most efficient and scalable organization structure wins over the competition or conquers a new market.<p>Here comes the internet with zero cost of communication. Here come high level languages that make it cheap to describe the most efficient processes.<p>Any large organization can in principle be substituted by a code because the organization itself IS a code written in job description language.",1228334391.0

The way to advance in most corporations is to have the corporation grow beneath you, or to leave for another corporation and come back to a higher position.  Promotions and raises inside one corporation do not meet inflation when averaged over all employees.  Loyalty is punished, almost as if in some sense the organization knows it is a bad thing and is trying to kill itself.<p>* The collapse of joint financial organizations that were once emmensely powerful and efficient:\n   * We used to all put premiums into large insurance corporations, and those insurance corporation used their economy of scale to invest those premiums, such that they paid out something like 109% of premiums as claims and still profited.  Today most big insurance corporations pay out less in claims than what they take in via premiums.\n   * We used to all put money into banks, which then made loans and paid interest to the depositors.  Now we don't save, and as of a few months ago, banks don't lend.<p>* The US Federal Government, arguably the largest human corporation, is bankrupt and disfunctional -- it was never a model of efficiency, but in times past it got some things done, built dams and won the wars it fought and etc.  Now it does nothing productive at all.<p>* IBM, Microsoft, GE, GM, Exxon, etc -- the readers here don't need to be told of their failures, but I would additionally point out the trend that they don't want new additions to their organization, and attempt to hire mainly contract, outsourced, non-employee employees these days.<p>* The United Nations<p>One thing to note, is that I think if the trend is away from big organizations, the trend of integrating Europe into one big EU is a bad one.  The trend of increasing Federalization in the United States is probably also generally the wrong direction.",1228334256.0

56,384653,comment,384606.0,384606.0,0,0,swombat,,,"<i>How often does it happen that a rule works for thousands of years, then switches polarity?</i><p>I'm not a historian, but as far as I know from reading various books by Drucker, large corporations didn't exist for much of the last thousand years. In fact, I remember he made the point that looking at the turn of the last century, even the largest business of that day would be considered small to medium by today's standards (and goes on to ascribe that to a lack of management knowledge - it's impossible to manage a huge corporation without management).<p>If ""larger is better"" has only been with us for a hundred years, it may well slink back into the shadows sooner than we think.<p>I think the order in which this will unfold will be highly dependent on what kind of business you're in. Car manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to get small any time soon, at least not until we have perfect simulated models of the human body to get rid of all the human trials, and until we have instant, near-free manufacturing processes available to all. By the time those happen, it seems unlikely that ""corporations"" will look like they do now....",1228331356.0

61,384648,comment,384593.0,384617.0,0,0,smwhreyebelong,,,Thanks for the advice. I did sign a contract but I am not sure if the scope is limited to my work related to what I do at the company.<p>My current company is pretty vast and it's not unimaginable that they could come up with a similar product but it's highly unlikely .. even more unlikely in the coming years.<p>The other thing is that I don't know if the project will take off and I don't wanna discuss it with people at my current company yet.,1228331015.0
