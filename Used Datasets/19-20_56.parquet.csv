For that I alternate releases between adding features and house cleaning (bug fixes, refactorings, etc).

The idea is to emulate God - God stopped creating the world on the 7th day, so we too should not create things on the 7th day. What counts as creating for God and for us are different, but the idea is the same.<p>c: There is something special about the particular 7th day: it's the same day that was seventh after creation. The weeks have been counted continuously for a good many thousands of years.<p>So to ask '""Will using electricity distract from the meditative purpose of Shabbat?"" instead of ""Does electricity 'count' as a fire?""' completely misses the point of Shabbat.<p>You think you are catching the point, but instead you missed it.<p>And BTW the answer to the question is: yes it counts as fire because using electricity causes a fire in the power plant to be increased. But the electricity itself is not fire.",1217877209

Season liberally with local root exploits if needed (these come in bucketfuls on most unices).  This is a classic attack: while it's not terribly practical, it's a whole lot easier than trying to brute force the password stream.<p>I'm not saying local-attacker password security <i>can't</i> be locked down securely.  Simply that doing so is a much more complicated proposition than ""use a library"".  In practice, most web applications are <i>not</i> secured against hostile local users.

So to my mind, ruling out some of the most powerful tools you have (perl's IPC facilities) in a vain attempt to achieve a security level that the rest of your architecture doesn't support seemed silly.",1217876496
