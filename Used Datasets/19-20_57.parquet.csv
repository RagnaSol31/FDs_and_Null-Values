The idea was that, after some years, agricultural DDT caused DDT resistance in mosquito populations. This rendered DDT for epidemic control ineffective.<p>Of course, the whole argument is complicated by the fact that pesticides are needed, in current practice for high-yield rice at the green-revolution scale, without which millions would starve.<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=4&url=http%3A%2F%2Fportalserver.unepchemicals.ch%2FPublications%2FCase%2520study_Agriculture%2520prod%2520and%2520malaria%2520resurgence%2520in%2520C%2520America%2520and%2520India.pdf&ei=IzZySYKjEYHwsAPo_q2fBA&usg=AFQjCNF9ZBb7B1Bz2fBUpe0ghMmj-MSqJw&sig2=_3Q6uADmNIkM8XwP_Kyntw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&",

With these in and no music, you can't hear people talking to you from the same room.<p>They're also significantly less bulky, and more durable. The QCs crack easily, and really require a hard case if you're traveling with them at all.

And this is why having a template engine might be a good thing.  <?= isn't 'safe' because it can be disabled in the php.ini file (and is disabled by default).  If only you had a template language that keeps you having to know that!  Also, the default is that your html escapes -- you can't forget to wrap your variable in the h() function.  So it's already less error prone.  And this is still just a simple example.<p>""PHP's loop: <?while(loop()){?>""<p>It's at least <?php while(list($key, $item) = loop($iterator)){?> to be correct and useful.  And the template engine can inline the code (rather than call a loop() function) for better performance.<p>All those correctly expanded PHP tags intermixed in the HTML makes the template harder to follow.  You might want to type twice as much identical code for each output variable, but I don't want to do that.  It is an advantage that it's cleaner and clearer.",1232221046.0

I'm halfway there, already, even with my anemic cable internet connection. It just requires a shift in thinking. You may look at my setup and say ""you're storing data in a personal hard drive and backing it up online over a fairly slow internet connection"". But someone else could look at the <i>very same setup</i> and say ""you're storing your data online, but because your data connection is kind of slow, you're keeping a big local cache in a personal hard drive.""<p>It's not as if the distinction between <i>storage</i> and <i>backup</i> and <i>cache</i> is necessarily cut and dried. They're amorphous and fluid categories. If called upon to distinguish between them, I'd probably claim that ""primary storage"" is a label for ""whichever medium is most durable"" -- in which case it's not at all clear that the cloud isn't more ""primary"" than my hard drive. There are risks and downsides to storing cloud data (bandwidth, security, fly-by-night companies), but there are also risks to storing local data (crashes, security, fly-by-night system administration :), and it's unclear which is better. The best thing is to diversify and keep copies in several places.<p>I would never refer to my iPhone as ""storage"": I conceptualize it as a cache, a subset of my data that I carry around with me only because the network is slow, not ubiquitous, and not always trustworthy. I now treat my laptop the same way. If I weren't too cheap to buy a whole terabyte of S3 storage, I might well come to think of <i>all</i> my local machines as nothing but local caches of my S3 data, as well as local backups in case S3 gets taken over by Skynet or IP lawyers or some other threat to humanity.",1232220848.0

My internet connection is just barely faster than five years ago, but now I want to ship around pictures, music, and movies wholesale, whereas back then I really didn't care. I'd estimate two orders of magnitude of increase in my data desires... and I was a power user five years ago (as well as today, though epic torrenters have me beat). My wife has gone from email and web browsing to shipping around video, too, for her it could be even more.<p>Is it feasible to expect data growth to level off long term? Tough to say. Audio probably won't grow much, but pictures and movies can get a lot bigger, but eventually you have enough resolution. But in the fuzzy long term, there are other possibilities for large-scale data movement that are harder to predict.<p>That's because processing power is no contest. Local processing power is growing radically faster than anything else, and this will continue. Local processing power is growing so radically faster that it has long since penetrated the architecture itself, and we now have deep, deep memory cache architectures desperately trying to catch up to the increase in local processing power... even reaching out five inches as opposed to five nanometers has a huge performance impact.<p>If you want to take advantage of that, you're going to move data closer to the processor. Processors are quite likely to live in the home, for a variety of legal and technical reasons. (The updated version of rms' Right to Read story is the Right to Compute Locally... long term, you are a <i>fool</i> of epic proportions to give up all computational power to the owners of the cloud!) Due to some fundamental latency issues, and the fact the cloud will always be partially underprovisioned due to simple economic reality, there may still be a desire to move large amounts of data around in the future. Bandwidth is hard, and easily consumed.<p>(And while I'm here, since I've built the foundation: I don't think the cloud is the total future for these reasons. The cloud will never be able to be as reliable as local resources, because the cloud will always be distant, latent (as in latency), and busy. Local resources backing to the cloud is a far, far better proposition than a pure-cloud-with-dumb-terminals-everywhere play.)",1232219794.0

People tend to forget the contexts in which some of these decisions were made.  After using languages like Pascal, the switch to C was truly liberating.  Sure you could do dangerous things, but you could also write good code without fighting the language.  Or take Windows vs Unix.  I installed Unix on my first PC.  I had to pay $500 more for Unix (on 10 floppies) and another $500 for the extra memory and disk space to run it.  Most people in the world made the opposite choice.",1232219330.0
