3,477476,comment,477173.0,477173.0,0,0,cchooper,,,"> Wouldnâ€™t having functions be first class citizens be locking them in the same cage with data structures as well?<p>An important difference between first-class functions and objects is that first-class functions are still <i>functions.</i> Closures are also functions, even though they merge data and code together just like objects do. But objects merge data and functions to form something that's neither data nor a function.<p>This, I think, is a shame. Data and functions are the most important abstractions in computer science. Objects not so much. If you aren't simulating something, then there's no natural ontology that you want to model with objects. By comparison almost <i>every</i> system needs to process data. The data about an object is not itself an object, and it doesn't help matters to conceive of it as an object.",1234382087.0

5,477474,comment,477177.0,477177.0,0,0,MaysonL,,,"The difference between the hacker style and the Dijkstra style is more apparent than real. Both rely on successive approximation.<p>See for example <a href=""http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD316.9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EW...</a> where Dijkstra goes, in painstaking detail, through the process of solving the ""8 Queens"" problem, building up the solution piece by piece.<p>A hacker would probably come up with exactly the same algorithm, though probably written more quickly in another language, and with a few more compile/run/debug cycles.<p>The thing is: the mode of attack - breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems, solving one at a time, and in such a way that you're pretty sure that each step is correct - is used by both successfully. It reminds me of a study I read many years ago in Gerald Weinberg's <i>Psychology of Computer Programming</i>. The investigators studied the work patterns of many good programmers, and one of the variables they studied was number of runs per day (this was back in the day when one submitted ones program as a deck of punched cards to be compiled and (possibly) executed. They found that the good programmers tended to divide into two groups. The first (more akin to Dijkstra) mostly submitted a program which compiled cleanly, and executed, followed a significant time later by another. The second group submitted a program, got either compilation or runtime errors, quickly submitted a fixed version, perhaps iterating a few times, then went off for a while till they went through the quick cycle again. The point is: each group consisted of equally good (as far as could be measured) programmers. Both styles are usable, both styles are necessary to have in your arsenal: you need to be able to think through a problem, and prove your solution correct; and you need to be able to tackle it piecemeal and experimentally when it's too tough to tackle all at once.",1234381992.0

Universities tend to do a very good job of regulating their numbers in a specific field, but the billions of dollars Microsoft throws at research is throwing that off balance. If a researcher can't find a University position, there are tons of other jobs he can find.<p>Normally, it can be argued that anything a company does makes things more efficient in a capitalist system. In this case, a lot of shareholders (and I) and arguing that what Microsoft is doing isn't.",1234379130.0

For the not-so-budget conscious, the discount might not be worth the effort to set up this system and lock yourself to one grocery store chain (people like variety - one week Safeway, the next Trader Joe's).  The grocery-space does need improvement though - who knows maybe it could work?",1234379084.0

Well there is ""one"", but it sounds stilted. Some authors alternate between he and she,  I sometimes use s/he.  But s/him, s/his?  In informal writing, I find myself using ""you"" a lot.

The department stores I saw during (very limited) travels in Japan were all much like the upscale multi-story Macy's you'll see in American city downtown areas.<p>That same style of store may be on a similarly long downward sales trend in the US -- given the rise of other specialty and discount outlets.,1234378835.0

By taking on a project without approval you are basically putting your job on the line.  If your manager approved the project, he would be on the line.  Unless he really believes in the idea, it's unlikely he will do that.  Better to wait and see how you do and then pile on once success seems more assured.  You will find the same thing with investors -- noone wants to give you money until you are already successful.",1234378827.0
