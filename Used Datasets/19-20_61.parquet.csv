A few friends who I email with pretty regularly, and are on Facebook, <i>and</i> uploaded their email lists (which I am most certainly on) didn't come up as possible-friends <i>ever</i>.

Early in the interview Daniel admits that he even published his first story without approval from TechCrunch editors.<p>I spent almost three years writing for The Escapist (<a href=""http://escapistmagazine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escapistmagazine</a>) and started when I was 16. When it came to writing and researching, I was given free reign. However, when it came to PUBLISHING, it was made pretty clear that an editor would have to vet the story before it was released. Editors would prefer that I call them on weekends and at least give them a heads up on the situation before releasing a story.<p>We might've differed from TechCrunch in that we strove for quality as opposed to breaking news. Point being that the Escapist editorial system worked very well, with everyone knowing the content going onto the site.<p>2. TechCrunch didn't have Daniel sign any paperwork or give him a title when he joined as an intern in June 2009.<p>3. In general, Daniel does provide a really good insight into how TechCrunch operates: management structure, the editorial process, etc.<p>4. Admits he doesn't really have any technical background.<p>5. Says the company involved was one that TechCrunch had covered multiple times before.<p>6. Says he never received the Macbook Air and the type of post the company requested was never written.<p>7. Says he has not extorted companies for products, but received products from Intel for an unrelated project he was involved with that he discusses on his blog.<p>8. The evidence used against him were joking IMs and emails.<p>9. Received an iMac from a friend who works at a tech company as a thank you for making an introduction to another company, not for TechCrunch posts. Then later wrote about one of the companies that was involved in a big legal discussion with Apple (iPod Rip).<p>10. Advice Daniel received from Mike Arrington the night before Teens in Tech (Daniel's conference): Neither party wants to have a public fight about this.<p>This was another quality Mixergy interview revealing Daniel's side of the story and more details about a still mysterious topic. The entire interview is worth viewing.",1265572441

You have to do a HMAC like digest on the ""random bytes"" and send it back so that H.264 works.<p>Of course all of this was reverse-engineered before the spec was released, but later with the release of Player version 10.0.32.18 it stopped working.
