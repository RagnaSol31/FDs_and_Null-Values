He knows human nature well enough to understand that people love polarization, and he exploits human weaknesses in order to accomplish his goals. Who has ever heard of Cryptome or Steven Aftergood? Very few. By contrast, everyone knows Assange these days. You may find his approach distasteful, but you can't claim it's not effective.<p>In any case, why shouldn't the ""collateral murder"" video have been editorialized? I don't care if the soldiers were obeying the ROE and had the right to defend themselves. They still are the invaders, and the invasion is still illegal. Ultimately, I don't blame the soldiers, for they were following orders. I blame the American people for blindly trusting their government and failing to demand accountability from the morally challenged elected officials. A docile populace is the first step towards tyranny.<p>If Assange stokes the masses and gets people angry, I am perfectly fine with that. Anger in the face of tragedy is preferrable to utter indifference. If Assange is self-aggrandizing and has an agenda, I am fine with that too, for he has done a great job so far and it would be enormously unrealistic to demand zero self-interest from a person who has amassed such immense power in such a short period of time.",1278877985.0

That code becomes something I can't quite get out of the back of my mind.<p>Also, I don't buy your readability argument.  I can read and think in SQL just fine.  Yes, SQL can be complicated, but only when the problem requires it.  It maps very directly and naturally on to the problem of querying.  There isn't much in SQL that isn't necessary.  There isn't much in SQL that is missing.  It's already as simple as can be.  To make it any simpler makes it worse.  Mixing the asking of a question with the processing of the answer makes both parts harder to understand.<p>Perhaps it is easier to read for some people, but I think that's likely because they just aren't very good with SQL yet.

In general (and more so today with spell check) I would say that no native speaker is thinking about the letters that compose a given word....

It's not about helping the user, they don't send these types of things for users who are active on Facebook otherwise, but not directly interacting with you.<p>""Reconnect"" to a dead friend is pretty worst case, but it's also insulting to be told to ""reconnect with Bob"" when you go drinking with Bob every week.

I can take some stabs at what doesn't work:<p>* Hiring people who have posted amazing stats inside other sales orgs but who have never done sole-starter early product sales<p>* Hiring people at moderate to high base pay to move an unproven product --- there are plenty of people who flit from role to role in gigs like this, never moving anything<p>* Hiring people for their rolodexes --- <i>every</i> A.M. can talk about a rolodex, and it almost never actually matters on the ground with your product<p>* Hiring ""strategic"" salespeople who don't want to cold call or do traditional sales but would rather spend their time on psuedo bizdev which, not coincidentally, can't easily be measured for varcomp or retention purposes<p>What I have actually seen work: learning how to sell, yourself, before bringing on a salesperson.<p>If you look around you'll probably find a couple dozen decent posts that address this question.",1278875005.0
