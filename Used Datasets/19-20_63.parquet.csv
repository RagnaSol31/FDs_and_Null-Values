I am not yet sold on the idea that all shared state is evil (since I think there are problems that are easier to deal with when using shared memory)<p>There absolutely are problems that are easier to deal with using shared memory. Clojure takes a middle ground here, and recognizes that shared state is sometimes necessary, but is often overused, mainly because the language makes it easier to make something mutable than immutable.<p>Just as you mention about Erlang, ""With a process, you have to think about where you draw the 'error boundaries'"", in Clojure you can paraphrase that as 'With refs, you have to think about where you use shared state'.<p>To create a local, immutable variable, you would write<p><pre><code>    (let [x 42] ...)</code></pre>\nIf you wanted to make that mutable, it would be<p><pre><code>    (let [x (ref 42)]...)</code></pre>\nYou have to explicitly say the variable is mutable. This change in defaults alone goes a long way in making Clojure a more correct and loosely coupled language.",1247687957.0

With barriers to interstate insurance removed, the industry is also free to concentrate itself through M&A.<p>While that's happening, the adverse selection problem with health insurance continues to fester, as our ""free market"", in enabling ""the pursuit of happiness"" for everyone, especially 20-something bachelors, cons the whole consumer market into believing they can free-ride into their 40s (or their first child) and then get reasonable insurance, while draining the entire risk pool of all the low-risk patients.<p>Those same 20-something bachelors show up in emergency rooms, bankrupting themselves over broken bones --- but no problem, by the time they're old enough to care about their credit rating, the only people who will care about this health event are the hospitals and doctors, who will raise rates on everyone else to cover.<p>At the same time, nothing is done to address the fundamental problem that even in the most consumer-friendly venues, tens of thousands of totally normal families are unable to obtain private insurance coverage at any rate because of preexisting condition coverage.<p>I'm totally sold.",1247687905.0

And the problem I have is the blatant hypocrisy of Arrington et al in the handling of this story.<p>The first post he made about this attempted to make the case that this was standard operating procedure, and really isn't anything out of line with the way things are normally handled. If that's the case, then why write a story talking about the fact that you've been given stolen documents containing large amounts of previously secret information.  Then go on to say you won't post the personal information,  and you're only posting the parts you find newsworthy.<p>If it's so normal, wouldn't you just post the stories, and mention that your source was some leaked documents you'd been given?  You only do that if you feel you have something to justify, something to explain.  In otherwords, you think you might be wrong.<p>So instead of handling this like they would any other source, for any other article, they've justified the source <i>well</i> in advance of actually using it.  It's hypocritical and proves that all of this was just another stunt to drum up traffic.<p>Personally I'm done with TechCrunch.  I won't follow links there, if I end up there by mistake, I'm closing quickly.  I won't support this sort of blatant hypocrisy and grandstanding.  It's not professional.
