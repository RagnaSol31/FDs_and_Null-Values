There are some but they're in the minority, especially if we're talking about a company that can employ a lot of people.<p>The whole employer-employee relationship has inherent friction due to pay. This affects trust and loyalty. It is an employee's responsibility to ensure they maximise their earnings for the skills they have and it is the company's responsibility to keep outgoings low. Such a scenario will always breed suspicion if the working relationship is not sweet and parties do not spell out their long-term expectations.",1255723154.0

4,886057,comment,885656.0,885752.0,0,0,gwern,,,"> Thing thing I've come to realize is that it must be an integrated system that is automatically indexed and searchable, tagged by date, time, location as well as having speech recognition and face detection in order to be truly as useful as it should be.<p>Absolutely. But do we need those systems to exist <i>before</i> we start life-logging? As long as the data is available, we can always go back and then index. As it is, it looks like the recording capability will be there long before the software is polished to perfection. If people wait until the software is perfect, then every day they wait is a day they'll never be able to put into the database.<p>> I also think there should be a 30 second rolling frame buffer so that you can hit 'record' and capture five minutes of full-motion video starting 30 second earlier so that you can fully capture important conversations and the like.<p>Short-term optimization. The real goal is just default full-motion video; collect everything. The long-term storage space is essentially here already: you can right now buy 1.5TB for ~100$ (see <a href=""http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822152175"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822152...</a> ). The problem is on the collection end - I mean, a fish-eye camera with 1gb for $800? How much is a 16gb flash drive these days, 30$?<p>Instead of hacking around the limits, let's just do the right thing: a small video camera hooked up to a couple dozen gigabytes of Flash.<p>How much? Well, I've heard that a minute of H.264 480 x 272 is about 3.5mb, let's call it 4mb. Recording sleep is useless, so 4 * 60 * 16 = 3840; 3.8 gigs per day means that even a basic flash drive would suffice for multiple days of video, and that we fill up our 100$ 1500mb hard-drive in ~394 days, or more than a year.<p>(I keep wondering: is it really that difficult to have a small video camera, that all these researchers keep using still cameras? Why don't we have easy life-logging <i>now</i>? As you say, all of the tech exists.)",1255723079.0

Also, whenever I see a piece of emacs is written in C I think it's best to just use the C function as written and not even try to understand it.

Use shared_ptr and scoped_ptr, and you won't have memory leaks due to exceptions.  Use RAII consistently, and you'll find it's actually easier to handle resource management in C++ than in Java.  Java's resource management is superior for memory but inferior for every other resource.",1255720881.0

That's exactly the way I do it.  In my C++ career I've only overloaded math operators for math types, * and -> for smart pointers, [] for container-like types, and () for callable objects.  At least in production code... I did some crazy and irresponsible things in college, just like everyone else.<p>If there's one point I've been wanting to make over and over again in this discussion, it's that misuse of language features is a much smaller problem than people think.  (In practice, it is even negligible next to the overhead of reading poor error messages from the STL.)  C++ is a very bad programming language for people who fear their coworkers, but so are C, Ruby, and any Lisp with macros.  Even Java isn't protection against stupidity:  a bad Java programmer on your team can't confuse you, but he can bury you.<p>Just think of defmacro as implicitly adding an infinite number of infinitely complex language features to Lisp.  If you can deal with defmacro in a responsible way, operator overloading shouldn't bother you at all.",1255720184.0

I'm not arguing for so-called ""poetic mode"" code (I hate it actually), but I think languages like Ruby and Python strike a really solid balance between lack of line noise and clarity if you follow what one might call normal coding conventions established by the community.  Of course, these aren't canonized for the most part, so it's hard to know exactly what they mean, but I think everyone can agree that ""x = foo bar, baz"" should be clarified to ""x = foo(bar, baz),"" if nothing else because it will eliminate any parser confusion if you add a predicate conditional or something like that.<p>Anyhow, my point is that I can write C or Java or whatever else that's just as unreadable due to its lack of clarity, but that doesn't mean I will.  It's a skill issue more than a language issue. ;)",1255720163.0
