Comparisons are made mostly to help folks understand the differences not to argue superiority. One argument is that a schema-less approach solves the issue of dealing with schema evolution. Having worked with O-R mapping issues for years as well as OODBs and persistent heaps and so forth I think document databases provide a fresh look. The technology choices of JSON over HTTP, Javascript and Erlang all the way down are also very compelling. It strikes me as just good timing. YMMV",1245959818

That's not to say that a formal education is bad -- it will just never be a substitute for real personal motivation.  If you have the motivation it takes to start learning a subject on your own, then I don't see any reason not to use every vector available to you to increase your knowledge, including college.<p>So, I don't think that a formal education is the biggest factor in one's ability to pursue interesting projects.  However, there are some cases where a college degree could come in handy.  At least in the initial stages of pursuing your dream you'll probably need a day job.  Unfortunately, many employers dismiss out of hand resumes that do not meet their education requirements.

Bed mattress has cooling pipes to control mattress temperatures.<p>4.  Lot of control systems to monitor air temperature, mattress temperature and body temperature and keeps them all in check.<p>5.  Integrated lighting in the dome of the bed is used for waking and mood setting<p>6.

For example, I wouldn't write ""consummate intellectual bully"" to describe him anymore. He was more subtle than that (though his language was not) and had a kind of integrity that bullies don't. I hadn't read enough of him to grok this, but recent posts by his intelligent admirers caused me to take a deeper look. Truly a fascinating character.<p>Online communication is a limited medium that is prone to feedback loops of escalating misunderstanding. It's easy to slip into thinking that one is talking to a computer rather than another human being because, in a way, one is. At that point, why bother with anything other than the intellectual satisfaction of formulating what you have to say in the sharpest, most absolute way possible? Many of us are prone to this. Naggum took it to an extreme. I still think there's something to criticize here, but perhaps not in terms like nasty, cruel, etc. It has more to do with dissociation (as when the cognitive apparatus becomes disconnected from emotional or other information). Which is another something many of us are prone to.<p>One other point about Erik Naggum that deserves a little more attention than it's gotten: during much of the time he was writing this stuff he was suffering physically pretty badly.

57,674233,comment,674123.0,674123.0,0,0,Confusion,,,"Given the available research on consumer behaviour and given the available data on website popularity, isn't it to be expected that websites in a certain segement will start to resemble each other more and more, as they converge towards an optimally consumerfriendly design?<p>As the recent Coldplay - Cat Stevens - Joe Satriani love triangle shows: it isn't just website design. By now, the amount of output in any kind of creative activity is so large that there is inevitable overlap. When the output is filtered by the selection criterion of 'what the average human (in Western civilization) likes', chances of similar designs surviving becomes even larger. It would be more surprising if this <i>didn't</i> happen.<p>This is interesting for entrepeneurs, in that you shouldn't be discouraged by ideas and 'designs' similar to yours popping up everywhere. It's inevitable and it's the details in the execution (or the fact that you are executing it at all) that matters.",1245957432

BTW, it weighs as much as an iPhone. Linux on mobile phones is at a dead end. Even Motorola is jumping to android. And actual useful MIDP applications are few and far between.<p>If you wanted the cheaper phone then just say so.

It is somewhat dated, and the arguments weren't very convincing, in fact they struck me as typical marketing FUD.<p>Sure the Postgres folks have years of experience and so forth but it's not like the literature is not available to be incorporated in new approaches. CouchDB hits a certain sweet spot in combining a few new ideas together and the folks hacking it are some of the best. I highly recommend giving it a hard look.<p>I also hear that the canonical folks will be bundling it in an upcoming Ubuntu release so it will be easier than ever to check it out",1245956948

67,674222,comment,673515.0,674087.0,0,0,yardie,,,"I agree with you on the locking and the price in India. I wasn't aware they made you pay full and the phone was still locked. But you can't compare every phone to smartphones. A lowly Nokia 1100 costs less than $30. But it's your basic mobile phone. You won't find people doing a lot of browsing from it.<p>But if you don't like the terms of deployment you are free to develop for other platforms. Usually, someone will come along and brag about how they won't develop their application for the iphone. But there are thousands of others that put up with it everyday. The fact is Apple took a page out of the microsoft playbook. They got the developers to invest early which brings users, which attracts more developers. Compared to the price to get a person with brains 99$ is just the price of doing business. Paying full price for an iPhone to test in is also the price of doing business.<p>But I've met a few Indian developers working on the iPhone. They need them to do their job so someone is buying them. Even if it is only a few Indian iphone developers.<p>What the $99/299 price is a small barrier to entry. It's like Apple is saying we want only serious developers submitting stuff to the Apple store. The world is full of good ideas but littered with half completed projects. This is one way of getting through the noise. And if $99 is too much for you then you weren't serious about it to begin with.",1245956676
