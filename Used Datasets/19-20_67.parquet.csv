And the number of processes will only be increasing because of multiplying CPU cores.<p>I think the biggest innovation in systems programming would be to merge a VM with Linux kernel, i.e. the kernel should have a garbage collector and byte code compiler built-in. This would bring tremendous performance gains and programmer's productivity improvements.<p>Microsoft is slowly moving towards that direction: .NET is already tightly integrated into the OS: at least all standard .NET libraries are pre-compiled, and shared across processes: using C or C++ on Windows makes absolutely no sense right now. By introducing GC into Obj-C Apple is doing the same thing. Next step for them would be to bring in LLVM and suddenly JVM on OSX will look even weirder than it does now.",1239220585.0

I don't know much about Parrot, but it seems heavily skewed toward making dynamic languages fast whereas I believe LLVM aims more toward static languages. Not that you couldn't implement any language on top of either, but take for example the fact that Apple's support of LLVM was (I think) in part so they could use it as a JIT compiler for OpenGL shaders in their software-fallback drivers. It has good support for cross-platform SIMD instructions and such, which will benefit numerical computation greatly.<p>-------------<p>Also, why don't you both use something like flex and bison? Is writing a lexer/parser by hand still that much of a nerd rite-of-passage? That's the most banal part of implementing a language.

23,553304,comment,552764.0,552973.0,0,0,arohner,,,"Clojure deals with this by having strict namespaces. Every function and ""global"" variable belongs to a namespace. At any time, you can refer to a function by it's fully qualified name. At the top of a namespace declaration, you can import other namespaces and alias (rename) other namespaces. It's a compile error if your declarations create an ambiguous name. i.e.<p><pre><code>    (ns :foo\n       (:use classifier)\n       (:use active-support))\n</code></pre>\nUse allows you to call all of the functions in the namespace without a fully qualified name. In this case, there would be a compile error, because both use statements try to alias a function sum in the current namespace. The alternative would be to use require, which doesn't bring the functions into the current namespace:<p><pre><code>    (ns :foo\n        (:require classifier)\n        (:require [active-support :as as]))\n</code></pre>\nThen you call the two sum functions like<p><pre><code>    (classifier/sum [1 2 3 4])\n    (as/sum [1 2 3 4])\n</code></pre>\nThe huge advantage is that since there are only functions, there are no methods on objects and every function is subject to namespacing.<p>If you want to monkey patch, there is a function called binding, which changes the value of a variable, but only within the calling scope, in the current thread. i.e.<p><pre><code>    (def x 3)\n    (println ""x = "" x)\n    (binding [x 5]\n        (println ""x = "" x))\n    (println ""x = "" x)\n</code></pre>\nwill return<p><pre><code>    => 3\n    => 5\n    => 3\n</code></pre>\nSince named functions are just anonymous functions stored in variables, you can use the binding trick to monkey patch. It's very clean because you can't interfere with any other code.<p>Binding affects fully qualified vars, which makes it very difficult to stomp on someone else's function.",1239219903.0

CS is a discipline, not a church.<p>As an exercise, get a full list of all your processes and do the math by replacing them by hypothetical JVM instances [one per process] and I suggest paying attention to ""shared pool"" size for each process too. I guarantee you'll be shocked by total RAM consumed by an ""empty"" OSX or Vista. Just imagine: every little tiny process, even simple background services, will have a full copy of your entire userspace layer in its address space.<p>Moreover, with 12-core CPUs becoming a reality very soon, the issue becomes even <i>more</i> important. With proper code sharing on OS level 12 instances of a process should (theoretically) take not much more RAM than just one. But because of VM overhead you'll be essentially duplicating it 12 times.<p>More code duplication also means more I/O hits on disk and system bus and CPU L1/L2 cache drain.<p>This is why Java is for enterprise/web software only. It is simply retarded to build on it in a true multi-process environment.<p>OS-level code sharing is hugely important. Your hard drive is full of code, gigabytes of it, and you can't just clone big chunks of it into every process who needs it. Without code sharing you'd have to wait a few more years for an iPhone.

A lack of a robots.txt rule doesn't imply ""I can take other people's content, reproduce it wholesale, remove it from context, and put it on other people's sites or otherwise do what I want to it"" does it? A lack of a robots.txt rule doesn't imply ""I can ignore copyright law"" does it? A lack of a robots.txt rule doesn't imply that the /author/ of the stolen content, perhaps with some suggestion of an implicit endorsement, wants it shown on some random 3rd party site does it?<p>I'm sorry for being so old fashioned as believing in the simple concept that when I comment on site A it doesn't mean I automatically want it reproduced in full on site B, C, D and E. I'm sorry for being so old fashioned in believing that as the author it removes value from /my work/. I'm sorry for being so old fashioned for complaining when these ""advantages"" aren't ""advantages"" for me but rather some 3rd party company or blog who are trying to profit from my work instead, perhaps even suggesting some implied endorsement, and being so old fashioned to /dare/ raise an objection when they try and do so.<p>Sorry for being so old fashioned that thinking that any company that is based around the concept of taking other people's content and reproducing it wholesale without considering the wishes of the copyright owners or authors is fundamentally flawed as a business and raises many dubious ethical and legal questions.<p>Or, perhaps, I should put my objections in a more concise manner that you'll understand. How can I, as an author, do this:<p><pre><code>  User-agent: *\n  Disallow-Author: Halo\n</code></pre>\nOr, perhaps the bigger bolder question I want answered is /why/ should I have to do that, and what makes you believe you have the right to take my rights away from me? Why is it more acceptable to take this same prose and put it elsewhere as I wrote it as a comment instead of an article?
