12,655314,comment,655009.0,655104.0,0,0,pixcavator,,,"Considering multiple layers doesn’t provide more insight here. The atmosphere form one ""thick"" layer around the Earth and the air moves within this layer. Assuming that this layer is closed (does not gradually comes to nothing), what we have is a ""thick"" sphere. Its Euler characteristic is still 2, thick or not. Now you can think of the wind as a continuous transformation of this solid. This map is homotopic to the identity map and, therefore, has Lefschetz number equal to the Euler characteristic, i.e., 2. Hence there is a fixed point. With some extra work you can show that this implies that the vector field has a stationary point. At that point the wind speed is 0, and not just the horizontal component. That point, certainly, does not have to be a cyclone. However, there is nothing wrong with the conclusion about the weather presented in the article; it’s just more idealized than this.",1244836027.0

47,655277,comment,654631.0,654631.0,0,0,jmagar,,,"Let's just start with the simple fact cable quality does matter when working with HDMI.  I'm not here to argue about the price of one manufacturer versus another, or their relative quality and worth.  But I will point out that ""cheap cables"" and the expectation that for the same $9.99 you'd spend on a serial cable you could get a reliable HDMI cable is somewhat laughable.<p>HDMI is really bad design, and due to its DVI legacy they've pushed the up against the limits of what is possible.  Right up against the limit.<p>1) it's twisted pair technology instead of coax\n2) it's parallel instead of serial\n3) it's very fast (10.2 Gbps)<p>If you just spent money on a new 7.1 AVR, and a Deep Color Blu-ray player then you'll be needing cables that have been manufactured and tested to a highest HDMI 1.3 standard.  Resistance, skin effect, impedance, capacitance, cross talk and inductance all conspire to disrupt the data and since it's digital, you will be left staring at a black screen or hearing pops and audio dropouts.  This kind of quality control is not cheap, and is much more than a simple continuity check on each line within the bundle.<p>I've tested some really expensive HDMI cables and seen what is possible with them.  I've ignored the ""Direction of Flow"" arrows on some long lengths and had them fail, reversed the cables and had it work.  There is real engineering that goes into these things, and that is what you are paying for.<p>So for short lengths (3-6') the cheapest HDMI cable might be good enough, and you will probably be happy.  But I'd still be looking for the HDMI 1.3 logo on the package, at least then you can be sure it has been tested against the upper ends of the spec.",1244835077.0

The third product made it because of good press. It seems like talent and hard work has gone into making these products, and the first two shouldn't have failed outright. What went wrong?<p>In one word: Sales. This is an often overlooked component of doing a tech-startup. founders spend their time making a great product and rely on the techcrunch effect (or the slashdot effect, word of mouth, call it what you want) to sell the product. Unless you're really lucky, or have an extraordinarily good product this approach won't make you money. The article is a great example of someone making a product, and then giving up when noone comes to the website to buy it. Selling it is at least as much work as creating it. Pick up the phone and call potential customers, go to tradeshows, stop people in the street, sell to all the people you meet in your local bar. It works.<p>Note - I'm not in anyway trying to degrade the author (or anyone else). It's an easy mistake to make, especially if selling isn't really your thing.

That's the usual progression of sequential logic into parallism (as in set up your parallel threads with data, fire them off, then hang about waiting to combine the results and tear down any constructs). In my tests I found it was <i>better</i> (both in terms of speed and sanity) to give each parallel segment of a program (be it a thread, a process, a computing node) as much autonomy as you can. The wrapper around all of that, the stuff that splits your logic up has to be damn clever - because portioning code on the fly is complex - but what it actually achieves shouldnt be all that much. Recieve some logic, chunk it, farm it out. Done.",1244833739.0

102,655222,story,,,5,3,3pt14159,Ask HN: What are the best data warehouse and BI resources in print and online?  ,,"I started formally practicing data analytics a little under a year ago. Since then, I’ve really ramped up my Ruby, C++ (w. boost), bash, and (especially) MySQL skills. I’ve always been a MS Excel geek, but I love the power, versatility, and reusability of MySQL charged Ruby scripts. Excel is now just the final step for most of my analytics and market intelligence reports. I use Excel to generate pretty graphs, and to calculate the occasional statistical distribution or linear optimization. I’m at the point where I will still need to do these types of things, but I would like to expand into other things that I think will help the stake holders at my company. Real time dashboards with our key business metrics, recurring automated reports, and (possibly) automatic neural networks. This is the type of stuff that a good Business Intelligence (BI) solution would provide painlessly.<p>After a bit of research around the internet, I discovered that I need a rock solid data warehouse if I’m going to effectively implement any of the BI products out there. My question is this: What are the best books and online hidden gems about building data warehouses? I need to fully understand not just why a certain method will work better for my circumstances, but also how to implement that method. Code examples are a must. I’m willing to spend a fair bit of time and money on learning this and I know no other place to turn for trustworthy advice. Thanks a ton, you guys and gals are the best!",1244833237.0
