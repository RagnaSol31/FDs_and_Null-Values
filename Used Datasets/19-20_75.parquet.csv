Hangouts is a nice tool for that, but for the hacker crowd what sort of hangout would work the best?<p>Just my random idea. How about a weekly roll call. Just a very short chat where each participant says what they got done last week and what they're thinking of doing next week.Hopefully the people would gradually get to know each other well enough such that they could not only provide empathy, but could also offer possible solutions to the problems the participants are having.<p>Another idea would be to have a piece of code from each participant sent to all else.

Who are the women that contributed to developing it?<p>That's not my point in that part. I was questioning the invention of the Internet as an easy to identify fact, while trying to explain that what we understand from the Internet is much much more than TCP/IP, for example HTTP, SSL, SMTP, IMAP, and many many more. And that's not even counting all the programming languages like HTML, CSS or even JavaScript.  On the other end, you have all the different routing algorithms and all the hardware created to support the Internet. Where does it start being the Internet and where does it stop? That's why the list would never stop and/or be enormous.<p>> No it doesn't. It means that women did not contribute to the invention of the Internet. Anything else you read into that is purely your imagination.<p>I think that's clear because otherwise you wouldn't say it. It's like saying that the car's invention was a white people thing. Just look at the first paragraph: ""Without men, we would never know what our friends were doing five minutes ago."" We wouldn't have it if we didn't have women and if we didn't have humans and if we didn't have children. That sentence is true, but it does not do any good or adds any information more than implying than men were the only capable of creating the Internet.<p>But that's part of the interpreting part of the article. Of course we can differ. I think, in this case, either way could be a possibility, but from the tone of the article I believe that it is implied that women could not have created the Internet.",1338753037.0

You will never hit the proverbial fastball if that is the sort of junk filling your head. Rather, creating and shipping products needs to be muscle memory.""<p>That's a vague statement, but I interpret ""muscle memory"" to mean ""have a good default toolset"" in this context.<p>It makes a lot of sense to have a default toolset -- tools that work well in a lot of situations that you understand very well, which together cover most of the problem space you work in. That frees you from getting lost in the weeds trying to decide which tool to use each time. However, it still very much matters what tools are in that default toolset.<p>It takes a lot of effort and study to understand and choose the right set of default tools. If the options are MySQL and Postgres (or ruby/python, etc.), you need to pick only one as your default choice, otherwise you get distracted trying to make that decision for every project. It's not so much whether the technology overlaps or not, it's whether you perceive the applicability to overlap. For instance, if you perceive MongoDB to be useful as a primary datastore, it can't easily coexist in the default toolset with a SQL system; but it can if you perceive MongoDB to be more of a caching layer or for special-purpose processing.<p>Of course, you should recognize the signals when you're dealing with a different kind of problem that may require a non-default tool.",1338752236.0

I detest the idea of using ""more appropriate"" examples, to me illustrating deep concepts from interesting fields like electronics and mathematics via computer programs was the gist of the book. Also, all the ideas used in the programs are very high-level, explained in the text, and you don't have to have any in-depth knowledge from any field outside of CS, you just have to have some basic maturity with respect to dealing with abstract concepts. I know because I for example solved all the exercises related to mathematics (differentiation, power series etc.) in SICP before I actually learnt any calculus, which I later did largely being inspired by SICP. Anyone aspiring to become a good programmer has to be able to learn basics of a new domain quickly, just knowing how to program is useless in itself. Besides, the more interesting the domain, the more interesting the programs, I think SICP gets this as right as possible.<p>SICP in general is a damn good book, there were already quite a few attempts to ""improve"" it, but I am not convinced any of those have really superseded it. There is for example ""Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming"", which is basically what you wish, SICP without digging into any particular domain:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Techniques-Models-Computer-Programming/dp/0262220695/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1338750648&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Techniques-Models-Computer-Pr...</a><p>There are certainly lots of valuable programming concepts explained in this book, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone with a deep interest in programming languages, but by using ""dummy"" examples, I think it simply became much more boring and less intellectually stimulating.",1338751153.0

Also, if it didn't come across I really like CNC machining and I think it will have an important part in manufacturing for years to come.<p><i>1. Limitations on geometry</i><p>The set of shapes that can reasonably be machined certainly contains a lot of useful items. However, the limitations that the machining process places on the design are subtle to learn and sometimes limit the process fundamentally. Of the examples you mention dental implants and jewelry are actually rapidly moving to 3D printing specifically because of geometry limitations. As an example pretty much all hearing aids are nowadays 3D printed. The geometry limitations are mostly driving adoption of 3D printing in high end applications like human implants, aircrafts, complex machine parts etc.<p><i>2. Tooling cost</i><p>I think there is a slight misunderstanding. Tooling cost does not refer to the cost of the tool but to the cost of changing the configuration of that tool from manufacturing item A to manufacturing item B. For machining centers that cost is very high, think of it as the work you go through when you switch milling bits, workpiece holding, alignment etc. For 3D printers that cost is virtually zero.<p>As for material choices I have several copies of the croco fob in question printed in steel. They were ordered through a 3D printing service and costed about $30 per piece. Aside from the fact that the croco fob can't be milled there is nowhere I could order three of them for that price.<p><i>3. CAD software/Tinkercad</i><p>We could certainly add CNC toolpaths but there is a lot more people who want to 3D print than mill. Given how easy it's to 3D print through one of the printing services compared to the hassle of going through a machine shop I can't really blame them. The main benefits of CNC toolpath generation would be home machinists, like myself, who could then use Tinkercad. That group of people is pretty small.<p><i>People can draw things and make a machine make them already.</i><p>This is the part where we disagree. Or more properly I think your definition of people is a few magnitudes smaller than my definition of it. To use your analogy, machining is like plotting and 3D printing is like raster (matrix) printing. I think calling it an implementation detail is missing the point.",1338750820.0
