1,629040,story,,,77,107,TiredOfCoding,Ask HN: I'm Tired of Hacking. What Do I Do? Please Advise.,,"I have been developing web apps for almost 8 years now. I worked at agencies, development shops, I freelanced, I was CTO of an startup, had the six figure salary, etc. I just can't do it anymore. I hate sitting on my ass all day writing some code. My neck has been hurting for two years for spending so many hours in  front of the computer. I kind of have been hating my career for a couple of years now and I have no clue about what I should do. I'm in my late 20's and I don't have a lot in savings left (six months of living costs at the most). I quit my job last year to work on a webapp of my own. I finished about 50% of it and haven't been working on it since. I got some freelance web maintenance work just to help cover some of my bills I get paid monthly and it's really easy stuff but I find it very boring as well and I wish I didn't have to spend any time working on it. I'm not lazy I just got tired of writing code and this industry in general. I always delivered the best work. In all of my previous jobs and was usually the best developer, engineer, etc.<p>Has anything like this happened to any of you?<p>What do you recommend I do?",1243454206.0

One or two interceptions could lose a game where you otherwise dominate, and turn a loss into an embarrassment. The laboratory for ""let's do something crazy and see if it works"" in football is college ball, though you are seeing pro ball get more adventurous in recent years.<p>Basketball lends itself well to ""systems"" that work well statistically over the long run: you get dozens of possessions, and the other team gets the same number, so you just maximize your average-case possession outcome (offensively and defensively) and the variance will wash out in a seven game playoff series, or a 90 game season. (Which is why boring teams like the Spurs succeed).<p>But soccer? In soccer, 95% of what you do has <i>no impact at all</i>. Even if it is theatrical, the average case outcome for a soccer play is that a goal isn't scored at all. So you can play systematically, except like football, a fluke play in soccer can win or lose the game. But unlike football (where interceptions are usually more the passing team's fault than the defending team's credit), soccer allows you to create fluke plays. You can spend most of the game doing almost nothing of interest, pull off a fluke play (at the very end, if you have a flair for the dramatic), and beat a team that had a slight advantage the whole game but never capitalized. Turkey repeatedly did this in Euro 2008 and it was the most fun I've ever had watching any team play any sport ever.<p>If you're an underdog, and you're going to take a risk, best check which game you're playing, and whether you're good enough for that risk to pay off.",1243451649.0

Humans are so arrogant to believe that other species of animals, (humans <i>are</i> animals, don't forget) do not have emotions or thoughts or communicate with each other in a manner more complex than what we hear as a bark or a chirp.<p>How do we know they aren't communicating concepts as complicated as ""Be careful there is a human approaching and it looks dangerous."" with one syllable?<p>If you look at trends in human communication, across all languages, then you'll find syllable reduction increases as the word frequency increases.

Who knows?  Just because we don't understand them doesn't mean they aren't complex, perhaps the very reason we do not understand them is <i>because</i> they are more complex forms of communication than human communication.<p>Why too then can't this same principle be applied to their concepts of right and wrong? Their morality?<p>I don't know any animal, other than humans, that will kill another animal just for the sheer pleasure of it.  That seems quite morally corrupt.  Animals kill other animals for what appear to be rationalizable reasons, food, competition, self-preservation.<p>Even when fighting for mates, the loser of a battle is allowed to escape with its life.
