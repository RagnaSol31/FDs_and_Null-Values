Real vegan cheese is <i>appalling</i> and no amount of processing can make up for it. ""Soy"" cheese that uses milk protein is much better... and there are a lot more simple vegetarians than radical-Shiite vegans. Nor is there always a bright line. I have heard good arguments over whether honey is or is not vegan.",1246305587.0

It is a speculative, after the fact explanation: ""We used computer-generated simulations to get this research result. I hope that in the future we'll be able to verify this result with real data through a long-term ice thickness measurement campaign.""

But it is not evidence, nor is it conclusive.  There is simply no reason to believe Powell's explanation over the explanation I cited in my previous comment.  The NASA explanation is based on actual observation rather than computer simulations.<p>The climate is so complex that you can always come up with an after the fact explanation.  The only way to judge science is either a) by the predictions it makes or b) following the chain of deductive reasoning.   Predictions are not really possible with climate science in the short term because there are too many variables.  So that leaves b).  I have not studied the science behind sea ice changes closely.  But many of the global climate models have been subjected to egregious tuning: <a href=""http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=2475"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=2475</a><p><i>Given what we know about CO2, hard to see how it could be otherwise, but not worth arguing over.</i><p>The effect of CO2 on temperature is both a) logarithmic and b) non-cumulative.  For models to predict a levels of warming that are actually alarming, the models must include feedback loops.  No one knows if these feedback effects are real.

Even worse, sometimes potentially harmful ingredients are not necessarily listed, or are listed by some rarely-known name.<p>If you wish to have good control over what you're eating, whether that means avoiding gluten, casein, animal products, soy, etc; your best bet is to prepare all of your own food. Don't eat out, don't buy preprepared foods at the market.<p>Disclaimer: I'm not quite disciplined enough to follow that advice, and I know that I end up eating small amounts of gluten.

Temperature is a function of space. If you fix the spatial coordinates, you can tell if the temperature increased at that point between time t1 and time t2. However, there are an infinite number of points, and thus you need an infinite number of bits. And to make it worse, all these bits only tell you what happened at time t2 relative to time t1.<p>No need to bring quantum entanglement to the discussion. If temperature is a function of space, it's an infinite-dimensional problem. You can discretize space and transform it into a finite-dimensional problem. Still, there are an enormous number of points at which you need to measure temperature.<p>Last but not least: the atmosphere is some 80 Km thick. You need measurement at high-altitudes, too.

It's about avoiding the hassle of paying.</i><p>I think the power of free is mostly about money. Look at Freecycle(.org) - the hassle in offering something that you give away for free, sifting through all the responses, going through the whole arrange time/place shennanigans, then somebody has to drive for miles to get to you - sure the person posting it has some non-monetary satisfaction about keeping something out of the landfill, but the person getting it? They are coming because it is free. If you offer one item on Freecycle for free and one on Craigslist for a cent, I bet you will have better uptake with Freecycle, even though 99% the hassle of the transaction is unrelated to paying.<p>That said... I agree that in the case of online news content in particular, the payment hassle is a factor, because it is a barrier to people (like me) who are not averse to paying. For example I would be perfectly willing to throw $100 in a yearly pot (or whatever a subscription to one newspaper would really cost), spend a year reading whatever I wanted hassle-free and upvoting (karma-style) the stuff I liked, and then at the end of the year have that $100 get distributed in the same way I distributed my karma.

Windspeed can also be measured. One can't really measure a storm, but one can measure how violent the storm is, roughly speaking. If you discretize physical space and assign values of temperature, pressume, etc to each cell in the grid, and you log them over a certain period of time, then you obtain a microscopic description of the ""weather"".<p>The laws of fluid dynamics and heat transfer define the dynamics of the system. Knowing the inputs, we obtain a trajectory in a very high-dimensional state-space. This is too much information for humans to digest. Hence, the order of the model is greatly reduced, and instead of microscopic description, we have a macroscopic description which we call the ""weather"". After all, we need to know if it's gonna rain or how cold it will be, we don't need to know the temperature and pressure at every single point in space, nor do we need to know how fast each droptlet of rain is falling.<p>I agree with you. In my view, the dynamics are the same, and the ""climate change"" people talk means that the trajectories in state-space are approaching regions they usually don't go to. But since trajectories are inherently dynamic, I think the word ""change"" is weak. That is why I proposed the word ""crisis"".",1246303265.0

Another hypothesis is that the placebo effect is only subjective, but that these subjective effects can indirectly lead to objectively measurable effects. For example, if you are in pain and the placebo effect decreases your perception of that pain, you might expect your pulse and blood pressure to drop. If you are asthmatic and are wheezing, any psychological factor that reduces your anxiety level or helps you relax might indirectly ease your breathing symptoms and even allow your constricted bronchi to dilate. In this view, the placebo effect doesn’t really cause objective effects, it allows you to have a different experience of your symptoms and it is that different experience that indirectly affects your physiology.
