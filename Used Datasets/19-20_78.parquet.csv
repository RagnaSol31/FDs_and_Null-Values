Seriously, I have always wondered why isn't the solution for all the financial worries of startups and the VC play.<p>This is the ""change"" that would make a lot of things easier, ensure startups keep up their momentum and not waste in VC fund raising process. More you have angels who are truly angels backing founders. (I understand this can hurt lest rational thinking is lost)<p>Micro financing at angel level (be it 5 friends/colleagues or more) is great. Someone needs to institutionalize this or have some learnings on how to deal with accountability, resolving dispute and the like.<p>For people in India, Israel, Ukraine and the rest of east Europe the startup costs are quite low. $100K is like close to upper end angel funding.<p>I know of at least 6-7 ex-Trilogy startups in India - brilliant guys, doing it right, when it comes to funds Indian VCs are most risk averse they wouldn't invest in anything other than jobs, matrimony, real estate and travel. I have always wondered why would it really bother for couple of ex-Trilogy in US to invest. For 2 guys to put something like $50K it would be hardly anything.",1226606169.0

AI therefore invovles building machines \n> which have that level of generality. \n>\nThere is a bias when you think of ""programs"" to think of programs that a human would actually write or consider useful. But in fact, this is only a tiny (and nontrivial to specify) fraction of the space of ""possible programs"" - see for example _Foundations of Genetic Programming_, by Langdon and Poli, for some next explorations of general program space. Most possible programs are completely useless and uninteresting to humans (same with proofs, grammars, etc. etc.).<p>To do AI you have to realize that in the sentences: ""Humans have general intelligence and can solve problems in many domains"" and ""Breadth-first search is a problem-general technique that will always find a solution if one exists"" the word ""general"" does not mean the same thing at all! (cf. the huge literature on inductive bias in human cognition).<p>For a nice list of program induction problems solvable by search (with a system called ADATE), see <a href=""http://www-ia.hiof.no/~rolando/Examples/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-ia.hiof.no/~rolando/Examples/index.html</a> .",1226606086.0

But maybe I'm not used to reading Academic-ese, because it didn't seem to me that they were taking a complete shit on the AP.<p>In any event, I don't disagree that the AP and IBO need work, I just haven't seen a proposal for what we should be doing instead.<p>(Maybe if those people learned to say what they mean directly, the non-academic advocates of school reform would have an easier time sorting things out.)<p>A lot of the AP course problems seemed to stem from the 'teach to the test' mentality, which occurs because college admissions and school rating agencies use the test results in ways the Collge Board/AP did not intend, so schools and teachers are rewarded by gaming the system.<p>In that respect, almost everything bad you can say about the AP or IBO courses can be said about regular classes thanks to NCLB. At least where my children attend high school, about 2/3 of all classes suffer from the same issues as AP classes, due to the need to put the kids through the state testing grinder.<p>In that context, the difference between the two is that the AP classes, at least in math and science, while far from ideal, do expose the students to more advanced concepts than they would encounter otherwise.<p>So, given the choice between AP classes, and non-AP classes that have the same fundamental problems except the course material is easier, what would you do?<p>I expect your answer is neither, and you would propose something else? Do you have pointers to that info? I really am curious.",1226605996.0

25,363485,comment,362440.0,363382.0,0,0,jderick,,,"It is more just a set of techniques for generalizing theorems.  At this point in time I would say there are a few roadblocks to doing some kind of data-driven probabilistic search for inductive proofs (like ACL2 does).  The first is that there just aren't that many generalization techniques already implemented to choose from.  The second is that most provers don't even have the basic backtracking mechanisms built in to support that kind of behavior.  Although this may seem surprising, the search space for a typical theorem is so huge (technically infinite, but practically speaking just too complex to bother with) that usually if you don't find a proof right away with a high-confidence technique, then you are probably just going to go off into the weeds.<p>Now that more processing power than ever is available, I'm sure this will gradually change.  But a lot of theorem proving technology is very old (dates to the 70s) so it may take some time.<p>The main technique I came up with looks at a particular finite case of a conjecture and generates a proof for that case using simple rewriting.  You then look for patterns in that proof and use them to create a generalization.  As a simple example, imagine your trying to prove a theorem about lists.  First, I consider the case where a list is only 4 elements.  Since this is a finite case, I can prove this easily with rewriting.  Now I look at that proof and notice that rule X was applied 4 times.  If I do the same thing when the list has 5 elements, that rule is applied 5 times.  So in the general case, apply the rule n times.<p>One novel thing about that I came across in this work is something I called ""Hybrid proof terms"".  I found that it is very difficult to find patterns in sequences of terms (the typical way of representing a rewrite based proof).  So I used this representation that factors out the things that do not change from one line of the proof to the next.<p>Feel free to email me if you would like to discuss any more details.  I'm not really working on this project anymore but I still find it a fascinating area of study.<p>Also, for your friend who is thinking about working with ACL2, he should know that the acl2-help mailing list is quite friendly and helpful.",1226605134.0

I don't know if the following should qualify as an edge case generally, but it does in Matlab.<p>The controls lab in the aerospace department at the U of W had a wonderful inverted cart-pendulum device that a grad student was doing some seriously freaky non-linear control research on. We were tasked, as part of a lab, to write a controller in Matlab that would balance the pendulum <i>and</i> move the cart to a designated position. After trying for days to come up with a combination of gains to result in stable control, I decided to write an evolutionary algorithm to choose a controller.<p>It was dead simple. The genome was a list of gains. The code created generations of genomes and then ran them through the simulation. The tricky part (for me at that time) was finding the settling time (walk backwards from the end of the data, checking for values outside of the tolerance). Choose the winners, perturb, preserve best performers, and go around again. Doing all the steps by hand worked wonderfully.<p>When I ran the code, I got combinations of gains that resulted in massively unstable systems; systems that overshot off the chart as soon as physically possible given the hardware. What was going on?<p>It turns out, when I ran the simulation from the command line, Matlab graciously accepted my 5-second simulation time. However, when run from a script, Matlab ignores that parameter and runs the simulation <i>until the output careers off the chart.</i> Because I was looking for a minimum time with no overshoot, my algorithm was finding combinations of gains that overshot steeply enough to convince Matlab to stop simulating ASAP! It was bizarre. My secondary condition was minimum overshoot, so I got solutions that were exactly steep enough to cause the simulation to stop when the output hit the desired value!<p>A friend of mine stumbled on to a workable combination of gains.

There is more to this story than meets the eye.<p>GM is a factory with a semi-skilled labor force. They produce very expensive goods. Because of this, they don't produce at maximum output all the time. If sales numbers slump one month, they cut production. To cut production, they have to cut their workforce. When they cut their workforce, they don't want to fire someone that has a lot of experience because they may just need him/her next month when sales pick back up again. So they pay this person to keep up a relationship until they need him/her back at work. They may not even pay this person his/her full rate.<p>Consider that while one car's sales are dwindling, another's might be picking up. Well, a person putting doors on a Chevy Malibu can probably do the same thing on a Chevy Trailblazer.

No one doing serious work on quantum anything thinks anything in the form X is Y.  That worldview has been dead for 100 years.  You can't play the speculate about quantum stuff game until you have changed your language to remove outmoded century old logical flaws you aren't aware of, which are built into the rules of a grammar you aren't conscious of, which governs the language you think in and predisposes you to make huge errors (like thinking there are cases where 'A is B').<p>You seem to think reality is actually one way, and our goal is to understand how reality is.
