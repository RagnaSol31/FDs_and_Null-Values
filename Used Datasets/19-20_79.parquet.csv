The general intelligence factor is a factor analysis of intelligence and is a measure of “innate” intelligence and attempts at “boosting” this fails. The test that measures this the best is Raven's progressive matrices which is culture and language negative. The general intelligence factor is highly correlated with IQ and highly correlated with future success. The performance of a person in these tests has to do with the physical make-up of the brain (there are a lot of online articles by (dr/prof) Haider that is fairly readable that sheds light on this subject.)<p>> Here is a list I have compiled. IQ scores may be disputed, but the intelligence of these people generally are not.<p>A note about your cited IQs – it is probably not correct. The popular press like to “guesstimate” the IQ of historic persons – but this is of little value. Rigorous intelligence tests (such as IQ tests) is a 20th century phenomenon. Leibniz lived in the 17th century – well before these tests. So to try and determine any IQ or measure of intelligence from him is a waste of time.<p>Also – you collected only a point sample - I bet someone could get the same example with selecting a different group of famous persons. You also only selected the top 1% and not the general populations – so to draw assumptions of this sample to the general population would be wrong.<p>I do agree with you that the study is somewhat worthless. Here are several conflating factors:<p>People involved in menial labour (i.e. without tertiary qualifications) generally get children at a younger age. A lot of older financially secure men would generally marry younger less intelligent women (trade-up/Russian bride phenomenon). The age of child bearing of different social classes differs significantly.<p>Also - a three point IQ difference with all these conflating factors would probably fall under the heading ""not statistically significant"".",1236887993.0

I think that's one of the hardest things to do, so kudos to you for getting something out there.<p>I kinda like this idea though I'm not sure I'd pay $9.99 a month for it.  Also, if you were industrious enough you could do this yourself with a private WP blog that you email posts to, but obviously not everyone knows how to do that.<p>A few thoughts about your web site that after a first look.<p>1.) The first thing that grabs my eye is the ""A Diary + Twitter = LifesBook"" yellow block in the center of the page and it immediately confused me.  I first thought that the app somehow integrated with Twitter and then thought ""There's no way I'd post my private thoughts to a Twitter stream.""  At this point, peeps who feel the same way might move on.<p>2.) The phrase ""(SMS type functionality)"" in the yellow box only confused me more and I still have no idea what it means even after realizing that you can text thoughts to your service.<p>3.) The next block under the yellow block focuses more on features than benefits.  I wouldn't lead with ""SMS Diary Entires"", ""Memory Bank"", and ""Locked and Secure"".  Those don't mean much to me as the user.  Try something like ""Post from Anywhere"", ""Never Forget a Thought"", and ""We Keep Your Secrets"" instead.<p>4.) Small typo under the Spare Change heading on the home page.  You end with ""Seriously just got nuts.""  I think you mean ""just <i>go</i> nuts"", right?<p>5.) Others may disagree, but I don't love the name.  I think my biggest fear of using a service like this is that I'd be posting my most private thoughts out into the cloud, so a name that somehow let me know that you're storing my secrets as securely as possible would be a plus.  Sorry I don't have a good name suggestion right now, but it's something to think about.<p>Anyway, best of luck to you.
