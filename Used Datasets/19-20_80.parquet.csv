In return, I assume everybody else works similarly, and post accordingly. It's a policy that leads to people contributing lots of fleshed-out ideas, and it keeps noise way down.<p>Of course, by that definition it's possible to be both hostile and polite.

Despite the inherent inefficiencies and abuse that comes with any sort of regulation, I'm sure it helps consumers by providing strict rules for cabbies and cab companies.<p>Except, we're not talking about a Cab company because it's not licensed as one. If I want to drive people around in my car all day for a fee and I put an ad in the newspaper that says ""Tom's Kinda Cab Company; I Drive You Places"" why should that be illegal? If someone asks ""Is this a regulated cab service"" I say ""No, but it's half the price!"" Either they use my service or they don't. If I get turned down by so many people that it's not viable employment, I guess it's time to look elsewhere.<p>And, perhaps I'm being naive here, but I have no reason to believe that if I were to provide a horrible service that it would somehow affect the bottom line of Yellow Cab. I'm all about giving people choices and letting the market decide. If you decide to order a cab from some deregulated company you've never heard of and you get kidnapped and tortured instead of driven to the bar, well, that's your own fault. It's certainly not ""all the cab companies'"" fault. And that cab company probably won't be around long.",1226517234.0

I'm pretty sure he covers that topic.  You may be able to get acces online via your public libraries web site (you can in seattle, at least).<p>There are the obvious issues with file uploads, they can take a lot of bandwidth, and disk space, but there are a lot of less obvious problems.<p>1. File uploade take a lot longer than most web requests, both because of the size of the data, and because most client connections download faster than they upload.<p>2. As a result, file upload requests hold server resources longer than other requests. This usually comes down to memory, but there can also be file handle and socket limits.  Also, more in the past than in the present day, just the CPU overhead from dealing with lots of open sockets could get to be an issue.<p>3. File uploads often carry a lot of memory overhead. The braindead simple way of handling way fileuploads in PHP, etc ends up buffering the whole file in memory until it the upload is complete.  That can really add up. Furthermore, the process handling the upload request has the memory overhead of the PHP (or ruby, or python...) interpreter, and any code and libraries associated with your application. This overhead is carried even though most of that code and data structures are unnecessary for most of the request durration.<p>This memory useage really stacks up when each upload request lives for seconds, or minutes, rather than the milliseconds required for most requests.<p>There are lots of ways to deal with the resource issues. Writing the upload to disk as it arrives is a big improvement. You can go further by having a separate app/server instance that is tuned to minimize the size of each app/interpreter instance is another.<p>There are also ways to take advantage of file upload features built in to a front end webserver (like nginx) to buffer the whole upload to disk before your app has to get involved. Not to mention the amazon examples mentioned.<p>Turning to a specialized custom file upload server written in Java or C seems like an optimization you undertake if you outgrow the other solutions (including more memory per server, or more servers)<p>Imple",1226516671.0

Unless we're reading Wired during the dot.com era, where any yuppie anywhere could do anything via laptop and internet.<p>Seriously tho:<p>-Real Engineers are often professionally licensed. Sometimes they have to get certified in every state they operate in. Some require a minimum of 5 years of experience before you can even apply for them.<p>--Real Engineers use software that often doesn't play well with laptops. VLSI/VHDL apps come to mind at first. Huge PSpice sims come next. AutoCAD and all that come next. Run into issues like needing to have a license server, or hardware dongle. And some of those special engineering programs cost $25,000/license. Not free in any sense of the word.<p>--Real engineers -- civil engineers I'm looking at you -- are not extremely active and passionate. They are punch clock engineers. Even in undergrad civil engineers are known as 9 to 5 engineers. Being home every night to kiss your wife is apparently one of those awesome job perks in a field that's barely changed in 30 years (i'm specifically singling out highway development in civil engineering here. This isn't meant to be flamebait.)<p>--Real engineers often need real budgets. Which is why governments or large corporations pay for us. With government, there's a chance you might need a security clearance. No more international travel unless its cleared with the state department.<p>The real truth is you become an engineer to solve the really hard problems that nobody else thinks about. Like how man will colonize Mars. Or what we're going to do with all these mountains of garbage piling up. Or what's the cheapest way we can deal with nuclear waste that doesn't involve dumping it into the ocean. Or how do we effectively managing the supply chain of a nuclear power plant so it can turn a profit (this is one I'm proud to say I've tackled.). How do we get military goods from one side of the world to another on a daily basis?<p>You have to want it.",1226516424.0
