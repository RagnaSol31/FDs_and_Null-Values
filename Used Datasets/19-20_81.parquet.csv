It's a personal opinion, but one I think is pretty well grounded in my own experiences.<p>What isn't opinion is that opting out results in wiping out almost everything from your profile.  That's a fairly punitive action to take against someone who doesn't want to opt in to an ""opt-in"" feature.<p>And saying that ""Facebook actually tests the UI"" means pretty much nothing to me.  Do they publish the tests and the results?  How confusing can a feature be before it's scrapped?  Does the importance of the business function the feature supports affect that threshold?  On top of that, given FB's history of privacy screwups and subsequent rollbacks, why should I have any faith in the company at all in this area?  FB has always seemed more than comfortable with the ""ask forgiveness rather than permission"" model.",1271877651.0
