It's really convenient, for instance on a google result page I get all the results in one go, no scrolling at all. If you have a second monitor attached to your machine give it a shot, I'll bet that after a day you will not want to do without a 'rotated' screen.<p>That's not really what the article was getting at, but it definitely was the first thing I noticed when browsing around, the absence of the vertical scrollbar on most pages.<p>Another advantage is that it is much less 'wide' than a normally rotated screen, which means you're not occupying more space than a standard desk provides.",1261079916

I demand much more confidence from my decision making process because the risk-reward is so different.  Further if I update my priors in a Bayesian manner the fact that of the sample size of 1 person going into the river, 1 person got eaten is somewhat worrying.  But because you're not giving me any information, my prior is impossible to calculate.  If this is a river in California I would be rather surprised to see a crocodile.  If this was the Nile delta I would not.  Etc.<p>Here the downside to getting things wrong is much smaller, so it's much easier to hold out for more precise data before making any claims.",1261079902

It now me, 6 tech support people and a couple of other people.<p>Our service has caught the attention of a fairly large media company in our vertical.  They are wanting to partner with us in a revenue share deal.  There plan is to re-skin our application and make sign-ups and logins available from their portal.  They want us to handle all the back-end stuff, customer support, etc.  Basically - they want revenue share for referrals.  They <i>do</i> have the potential to pump a lot of targeted referrals our way.<p>Are there any resources or places where I could get some ideas for how to structure a fair revenue share arrangement?  I had a phone call with the CEO and they started off by asking if we'd share ""50/50"" which I flatly said no to.  I friend of mine suggested something more in the 20-30% range (for their share).<p>I, frankly, don't know what to do.  I'm a half-decent programmer who is pretty decent at marketing, but ""deal making"" is out of my element.  I don't want to pass up a good opportunity but I also don't want to get screwed.<p>I've asked them to provide me with numbers of how many subscribers they have on all of their web properties, email newsletters and print publications, and to outline for me how they plan to promote the co-branded service and how often they will promote it.  That should give me a better idea of the potential, and, frankly, bought me some time to stall since I don't really know.<p>Any feedback, help, or pointers toward resources would be greatly appreciated.",1261079211

You need the other party's account number, their name, and city.  It's free for both parties; instantaneous (money is no longer available to your account, and is immediately available to the other party); can't be done if you don't have a high enough balance (no bounced checks); and can be set to be recurring.  It makes the US checks/fees/delays look like a joke, but doesn't provide 10 different revenue streams for the banks.<p>* You can use your debit card (called <i>pinnen</i> or 'PIN-ing') at any stores that have a scanner.  There are no fees, you have to enter your pin.  Most places (supermarkets, restaurants) will let you PIN, but don't take credit cards.  Like transferring money, charges are immediate, done in the order they are received, and don't go through if there's not enough money.<p>* All debit cards have a little smart chip on them, which can be used to 'ChipKnip'.  You load small amounts of money directly onto your chip, and you can now use your card to pay for small things (parking meters, printers at a university, etc).  It's insecure (no PIN required) and if you loose your card the money's gone.  It also (I think...) doesn't require a live connection to the ATM network, so transactions can be run later<p>* Giro.  Giro is the opposite of a check (it's a credit-transfer instead of a debt-transfer).  Sometimes bills are sent with a GIRO slip, which the payer fills out and eventually makes it way to the payer's bank, where a transfer is initiated to the recipient.  I've never used a GIRO in the 2+ years I've been here.",1261077347
