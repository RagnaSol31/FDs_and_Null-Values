The R68-type[1] trains always had some seats fill faster than others.<p>For instance, the three seats lining the wall (see diagram), with the two seats perpendicular to the direction of travel always had the seat 3 fill faster than others (It's next to a window, has guaranteed leg space and you can put your feet on the radiator; it's pretty awesome). Seat 4 gets filled later since you have more leg space and can avoid person in seat 3 more effectively if you don't know them. Seats 0-2 have the potential to be squeezed awfully close to a stranger.

Glucose, generally, requires insulin to be absorbed by the muscles, liver and fat cells. However Fructose doesn't, the cells then convert it into whatever form necessary, the liver usually converts it into glucose for storage. Yet muscles are capable of using fructose directly.<p>Glucose can directly be turned into ADP or ATP, or it is converted into Glucose-1-phosphate, which then can either be turned back into glucose or follow the path to be turned into Fructose-6-Phosphate (fructose incidentally directly turns into this). F6P is then converted into triose phosphate, a change that cannot be reversed, and can be directly converted into fat. Fats, when needed, are turned back into triose phosphate and can basically be directly converted into ATP.<p>Essentially fructose needs <i>less</i> processing than glucose to be readily stored. The aim of the human body is to increase its fat reserves for winter when food becomes scarce. Glucose is readily available and readily usable by the body, but all this depends directly on insulin to get it into cells to be useful. The notable cell that <i>doesn't</i> require insulin are brain cells, however these readily process fructose too.<p>So it's actually possible to completely remove glucose from the body, in the event it was ever needed then fructose can be back-stepped into glucose-1-phosphate. However, the body can more than adequately produce energy directly from fats, so it would seem extremely rare that the body would need glucose.",1238700919.0

I don't want to make any judgements, but seems like you do not appreciate the real value of the technical implementation. Your CEOs may have all the connections in the world, but if you cannot afford to have your product build, you still have nothing.<p>There should be nothing wrong with outsourcing the implementation details to a bunch of code monkeys in a developing country, but the point is that monkeys execute blindly. They are cheap because they do what you tell them to do (communication problems aside), no more but sometimes less. You cannot expect them to understand your problem and interpret a somewhat subjective description into a comprehensive requirements document. If they could do that, they would not be monkeys and would not want to work for peanuts.<p>If your resources are limited, you need to bring in at least one local reliable guy who wants to work for equity. His first job would be to build a rough prototype that will help your CEOs to harvest their network for additional cash (in the form of partnership, pre-sale money, whatever). The second job would be to lead a newly hired no-monkey team to build version 2.0, and provide the insight gained with version 1.0 to make this project successful.<p><shameless_plug><p>If you still want to cut some costs by hiring a foreign based team, I would recommend to pick a Latin American country... Mexico, Brazil, Argentina... We are not as cost effective as Asian developers, we have a huge advantage by being in about the same time zones. Mexico is Central and Mountain time, Central America is Atlantic I think. I am not sure about South America, but it is pretty close also.<p>Having access to the customer in real time pays big time when you are doing agile development. If you only share a few hours per day, or not at all, the cycle times will be in terms of months instead of weeks. You will have to rely more in Big-Design-Upfront style of development.<p></shameless_plug>",1238700138.0
