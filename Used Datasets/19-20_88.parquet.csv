Some of what he is saying is a little shoddy, since Fisher actually came up with a much more robust, but less used, method of inference called Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which currently stands with The Bayesian Theory as the competing (yet partially complimentary) theories of statistical inference. Strict, but arbitrary, distinction between the null H0 and alternative H1 hypotheses, which is what p-values suggest, is as careless as the article points out.",1269978959

Just as an example, a person can indeed act effectively in uncertain but somewhat ordered environment but virtually no human being can tell you anything like the probability distribution of the events which they deal with in daily life.<p>So basically, we do indeed need new approach different from both the probabilistic and the pure-logical approaches. But problem is that melding these various existing approaches into something coherent and usable is far more easily said than done. One clear problem with any such system is that the complexity explodes for a formal specification which involves both probability and logical process.<p>I suggest people call their approach ""a general theory"" <i>after</i> they do something impressive with it.

Say a systems administrator instead, they have knowledge of how to use keyboards and software and things, such details are unnecessary for the formulation of good software engineering, surely this can simply be skipped .<p>That's utterly crazy on the face of it, so why is it ok for designers to waste the time of developers?<p>For literally hours on end it is several million permutations of ""move it 2px to the left, no, right, no, up, no down, I mean right align, I mean center, I mean split it, I mean add that element, I mean do this, do that"" and <i>worst of all</i> ""What do you think of x"" like I have any opinion on the aesthetics / presentation of any given site.
