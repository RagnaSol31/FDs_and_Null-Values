Nodes in that graph can be native to the platform, or external.<p>External nodes/users can decide how much they want to share with external providers, on a provider-by-provider basis.<p>Each provider, thus, would have a record of how each of its hosted nodes perceives each external provider, trust-wise.<p>In order for a node to find a new external node, they would use their contact's email address. The provider would send a request to all providers it has on record. Depending on how the requestee perceives the requester, he can either ignore or answer the query. If he ""knows"" the email hash, he can prompt that node/user for permission to send data to the requester - and what level of data to send. If the requestee does not know the hash, the request recursively travels throughout the social platform providers.<p>One of the necessary requirements to being a part of this kind of distributed social network, of course, would be the ability for a user to download their social graph (nodes of email hashes connected to them) and easily port it to another provider. Sort of like exporting your email box contents to bring to another provider.<p>If we throw out the idea of users having unique IDs other than their email address, it would be possible to have different social networks on different providers - e.g., business from one provider and family on another. If a user deemed it, they could potentially also link several email addresses to the same account on one provider.<p>This kind of scheme would have the qualities of being:<p>* Robust: any platform which follows the protocol can participate; Potentially, if a platform goes AWOL, and the nodes within it had sufficient transparency to nodes outside of it, any given provider could rebuild their social graph for them.<p>* Trust: Based on how the nodes on a given provider dole out their social graph / user information to other providers, that provider can perceive the general level of trust its users have about that provider. It can pass this metric on to other providers who request it.<p>* Portability: need I say more? :)",1273348798.0

27,1330779,comment,1330607.0,1330607.0,0,0,grayrest,,,"XSLT was created to allow for document tree translation in an implementation independent manner. The main problem I have with this concept is that document translation is that 99% of the time you're doing it, it's to get the document to the format your app needs or from the format your app needs. In other words, the vast majority of translations depend on the implementation, so what's the point of an implementation independent translation language?<p>So on its own as a templating language, XSLT 1.0 had problems of varying size. The biggest by far was that the 1.0 spec had the absolute worst string handling of any language I've ever come across. It's erlang bad with the syntactic elegance of being an XML language. This is somewhat corrected in more recent versions but I think this is the primary reason the language has failed to gain adoption. If you're doing whole node manipulation, XSLT is adequate. It's not elegant, but it's flexible and I generally don't have problems getting the results I want in short order.<p>I do like a number of ideas present in XSLT, particularly the concept of templating documents as trees (guarantees well formed output) and transformation by pattern matching. Those both carry over into my preferred templating language, Python's Genshi, which some people like and some hate. To me it provides a good balance between purity and practicality.<p>As to your specific questions, I did one site in pure XSLT back in 2003-2004 and vowed I'd never do it again. I have a guy at work who really likes Symphony and produces good quality stuff with it. If I had to do PHP it'd actually be one of my top choices (I don't like PHP either...). I've never regretted learning xpath, since it seems to pop up regularly in unexpected places and isn't THAT complex. The complexity in xpath comes from many implementations not fully implementing the spec. HTML 5 has an XML encoding, so there's no reason that XSLT would work worse with HTML 5 than it does with XHTML.<p>XSLT will never be the one true path for templating, but its presence as a standard will always attract people who appreciate that sort of thing (I'm not one of those people) so it's not really a dead end either.",1273347622.0

Instead, it would reply with the appropriate (email, id, provider) tuple when asked for an email (hashed or not) that it knows about, and return nothing or an error or whatever when asked about an email that it doesn't know about. In either case, as arethuza points about elsewhere in this thread, it is essentially an email address validity oracle for emails that it knows about -- hashed or not -- since a spammer can sit there all day and ask it about random email addresses and record its responses. If you hash an email address, the only thing you buy is to make the spammer add a line of code to their script. In short, I think that using a hash is functionally equivalent to not using a hash, at least for spam purposes.

I've known engineers who will do <i>weeks</i> of research before writing a single line of code, driving everyone mad, but proving themselves right afterwards. You have to be patient enough to think about your code before you write it, follow best-practices and some conventions when you write, constantly re-factor you old crap, write good comments, write Makefiles, etc. You have to be disciplined enough to do testing, have a test environment and a deploy workflow. Write proper documentation (if required), write commit messages, and so on.
