There are 6 major mac product lines (mac pro, imac, mac mini, macbook, macbook pro, macbook air).  All things being equal, each product line should expect to get 1/6 (or about 16%) of sales.<p>Of course, all things are not equal.  The macbook and iMac will sell a lot more than the Mac Pro or Macbook Air, by design.  As a result, you would expect the percentage of high priced products, like the Air, to be <i>less</i> then their fair share.  The fact that they are holding steady is a pretty good sign.",1203019143

5,116033,comment,115723.0,115723.0,0,0,tx,,,"I spent a full week evaluating Amazon, PayPal, Authorize.net and a couple of smaller players (don't remember their names). I even posted a detailed report here somewhere in August.<p>Authorize.net <i>is</i> the big daddy of online payment processing. I found it to be most developer-oriented too. Amazon suffers from unnecessary complexity and tied to their own stuff too much, besides not a single support person (on the phone) knew anything about it. PayPal was not very ""customer friendly"", in fact their sales people sounded like typical scammers/car salesmen and overall PayPal not as developer-friendly as authorize.net<p>In the end I implemented everything (one-time payments, scheduled payments, etc) in just two evenings using a couple of PDF downloaded from authorize.net.<p>By the way, another reason to use them is the dev. community. Thousands of devs built stuff for authorize, i.e. there are libraries, code samples and docs on numerous blogs for every imaginable programming language/framework.",1203018726
