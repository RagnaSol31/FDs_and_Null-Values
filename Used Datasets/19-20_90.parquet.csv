And this is useful when you use cheap disks.<p>> The checksumming is a nice feature and desperately needed as disk capacity continues to explode but bit errors remain the same, but in practice probably the biggest risk is bugs in FS code:<p>This is not true. At some point, a heavily used disk will start failing. It is really nice to be protected against that - and very important to know when it starts happening.<p>I talk from experience - I had a zpool scrub detect silent file corruption once. Curiously, it never happened again with that disk. But I keep using that disk (of course, with frequent backups) - and I would never do that (continue using a disk that failed) with any other Filesystem.",1251748709

By the time I got to the <i>second</i> business, I had my first gig, setting up a small network.<p>That gig led to others, which led to others. I installed printers. I created small database applications. I had this one job that for two weeks I just ran around downtown helping users at their desks -- it was a lot of fun! The guy said ""You're filling in for me. When this beeper beeps, go to the person and help them with their problem"". He handed me the beeper, it immediately beeped, and I spent the next two weeks running around like a madman. Had a blast.<p>Later on this ""odd jobs"" method of starting led into project work, then into programming-consulting.<p>A lot of getting started is just having a good attitude and being able to figure out answers for people's technical problems. I found starting out to be the most enjoyable part of building a consulting career, actually. Have fun!",1251748575

5,796591,comment,795358.0,796441.0,0,0,haberman,,,"> Just to make sure I understand: you could view a PEG as having an ambiguity that is resolved by implementation.<p>I wouldn't quite put it that way, because PEGs are defined abstractly, not in terms of any particular parsing method.  For example, lpeg (<a href=""http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/docs/peg.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/docs/peg.pdf</a>) parses PEGs also, but does not use packrat parsing to do so.<p>> It's a small and subtle difference that both LL(* ) and PEG grammars are by definition unambiguous and produce only one tree; they just accomplish it in different ways.<p>Yes, though I will editorialize a bit here and say that PEG's method of defining away ambiguity makes it impossible to know when there are true ambiguities in your grammar.  With PEGs, if you have:<p>a -> b / c;<p>...it is undecidable whether this is the same as:<p>a -> c / b;<p>Take a common ambiguity like the if-then-else problem (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else</a>).  This is a real ambiguity that will affect how programs in your language are interpreted.  But a PEG based tool will never tell you that an ambiguity exists, because to a PEG there is no ambiguity.  It gives you no help in understanding whether any of your language's productions are ambiguous to a <i>user</i>.",1251748512

19,796577,comment,796302.0,796302.0,0,0,steveplace,,,"Hi, post author here. A couple notes:<p>1. It seems that the comments are focusing on the value as related to the student-- that's certainly one part of the equation, but don't forget that there is value for the financing companies that give easy credit access to students, and I feel that is where the excess demand is coming from.<p>2. This is a very volatile argument, especially in educated circles because people take it personally. Whenever I have this discussion it seems to boil down to anecdotes and how <i>my</i> degree is of value. That's something to avoid.<p>3. This is part one in a series and I'm currently working on the data to test the hypothesis. I will be looking at per-major opportunity cost, total amount financed versus {cost, time} and a couple others.<p>4. Just because I'm calling it a Bubble does not mean I'm calling a top in either tuition rates or financing. As the recession begins to hit states harder, more budget cuts will trickle into state public education and revenue gaps will need to be filled somehow. IDK if it's through fed stimulus or spending cuts, but it possibly could lead to an increase in tuition rates as financing is still available and the students won't recognize the true monthly cost until after graduation.",1251748144

Then if your single disk has a sector or two go kaput, ZFS will notice the bad CRC on read and get the other copy.<p>I've also heard of other improvements for single-disk, and SSD specifically, but alas, I can't find citations right now.<p><i>Time Machine really stole the thunder on this for regular users.</i><p>Time Machine's ""snapshots"" suck.

61,796531,comment,796302.0,796302.0,0,0,amalcon,,,"""College"" really represents two separate asset classes:  education and credentials.  Education leads directly to productivity.  Domain-specific education (like what college provides) is not a commodity:  its value is not directly market-based.  An education does not become more valuable based on demand.  The value depends on who has the education, their ability to apply it to the current situation, and the current state of the domain.  It can also depend, to an extent, on the number of people with similar education, but this is a very slow-acting force:  it can take generations to have any effect.  That sort of ""slowness"" will tend to retard bubbling.<p>Credentials are a tricky subject as well.  The particular credentials we're talking about have value because people trust in their correlation with education.  These are much closer to a commodity, because the job market is aware of credentials.  Demand for credentials can increase their value.  Credentials can, therefore, bubble.<p>Now, if you're going to college for the education, that's fine.  You'll get the same result regardless of what the market for credentials does.  If you're going for credentials, you might get caught in the bubble.  What's worse, if you're going for the credentials, your education <i>will</i> be of a lower quality than someone going for the education.",1251746759
