When I'm at school, everything vies for my attention.<p>I've discovered that the public library is extremely useful. The thing is, the soon as my project takes off I'd be willing to spend money, but with my resources so constrained, I really have to be frugal.<p>If you perform a service for the public good, I have a feeling that within a few years, it will start to pay back in some way. Whether it puts you in the black from providing free service is another question.<p>The public library doesn't have much to look forward to because the people that hang out there are mostly old. However, a service where people are creating value is likely to turn over into something useful to the service provider in some way. You might want to consider offering the free service to students for a year and watching the conversion rate.<p><pre><code>  If nothing else, you'll certainly help train the next generation of software engineers which will certainly turn into something useful for everyone.</code></pre>",1231185535

Allow students to put in their edu email as well as their personal email because I really only use my personal account, as do most of my friends. Just send a confirmation email each semester or something as recommended by another commenter and that should be strong enough verification. Some people may try to cheat the system by either using an alumni email address (which you should filter: alumni.*.edu) or purchasing an edu domain to host their own email on, but those are both very unlikely and I doubt you'll run into them often if at all.\nThere is at least one school that I know of that doesn't give out email addresses to its students anymore (Boston College or University, I forget which one); for those students just put a note next to the .edu field saying something along the lines of ""Your school doesn't give you .edu addresses? Just email us and we'll help you out.""<p>I don't think there's much else you can do to verify student accounts. If you're really ambitious you can ask for the student's ID number, full legal name, and university and then call up the registrar office to verify their registration. My school also participates in the National Student Clearinghouse: <a href=""http://www.studentclearinghouse.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.studentclearinghouse.org/</a> but it costs money for each verification. Obviously these options are kind of extreme and I'm pretty sure only banks and hiring agencies would spend the time verifying an enrollment this way.",1231185403

ACLs can't handle real law because they're not Turing complete.<p>~11:20: had a business manager learn Ruby, had him implement poorly specified/tough features --> result: he modified/eliminated requirement<p>~12:20: a bunch of if statements are easier & better than an ACL<p>~13:50: in one case, 1000 users and 1000 containers would have required 270,000 ACL entries to implement one compliance rules; and 5 minute polling updates, because rule was time-based; --> couldn't audit, handle real-time changes; would've required 12 beefy boxes to execute.<p>14:40: Instead, re-write all rules in 400 lines of Ruby; analysts could read the code and say if implementation was right.<p>15:45: So a language wins, right?  No -- ""this is where the Suck begins"" -- where management comes and crushes your soul.  Bad product was substrate for document management system.<p>17:50: How do they sell this stuff?  Connections, subterfuge?  No....

Synergy!  Synergy!'""<p>21:00: MBAs are trained in <i>manufacturing</i> -- programming is <i>not</i> manufacturing -- you're going to work in an environment where they think you're worker bees on an assembly line.<p>22:00: So what to do about it?<p>1) Managers see people sitting there, they think nothing is going on.  If management says ""I demand all of your creativity but trust none of your judgement,"" you have to gather evidence that makes you more credible.  You have to be objective.  Try out whatever crappy technology that they're proposing.<p>2) Develop alternatives: if their crappy technology is good enough, stop; but if not, try out alternatives before suggesting.<p>3) Statistics; develop some pretty graphs.  E.g., Zed's team built a demo server, showing slow performance.  Without those, he would've had no evidence to contradict the sysadmin who was saying his tweaks had helped.  Be prepared for intensely technical arguments, too.<p>4) Admit technical deficiencies.<p>~29:30: If none of this works, and they won't take it, build it anyway and then sell it to them or their competitors.  The client can be your first customer.  Good way to start a company.<p>~30:00: our doc management system is very simple, 4400 lines of Ruby plus some Samba modifications, and better than anything else out there.<p>Drools -- JBOSS rules engine -- ""blows ass"" -- just use Ruby instead.<p>~31:30: Figure out Roles first, with a Role Resolver -- draws on LDAP etc. -- 30 lines of Ruby -- now, ~200 lines of Ruby, covers all bizarre corner cases, easy to add new rules, easy to fix existing rules.<p>~33:30: And they <i>still</i> wanted the crappy older thing.  At this point, it's <i>all</i> the social problem.  What <i>mattered</i> was the old product had the same name.  ""Document Store 2000"" vs. ""Document Store New Gen"" -- completely different, but easier to get through manager's manager's procurement process -- ""that's the stupidity you deal with in the real world"".<p>35:15: How do we win?  We kept hammering.  They sent out their best guy.  I had him implement the toughest rule, the one requiring 200,000 ACL entries.  Then had him explain to his managers why it wouldn't work.  Had nothing to do with tech.<p>36:15: This stuff will kill you.  How do you keep your soul through all of this?  [Poll audience for years of education] -- ""It don't matter"" -- you're a factory worker.<p>37:30: ""Business leaders don't really like you, because they need you, and they don't understand anything you do. ... And the sales people know this; they know if they go to your boss, and give them steak and strippers....""<p>~38:40: Fight your hardest not to be a corporate coder: your life as a geek or a coder should be all about exploring some new domain that no one else gets -- you can only go to conferences and talk to other geeks about what you do.  A corporate coder works only on the stuff he's supposed to on one language, and never touches code otherwise.

I'd like to elucidate this problem once and for all, I really \ndo believe we can both agree on a conclusion.<p>I'd like you to notice that your new table of probabilities imply that I have a chance of 1/6 to guess the gender setup of a \nfamily of 2 children. I don't think that makes sense either to you.<p>Let's make the experiment a bit clearer :<p>- We gather a number of families who have 2 childs.<p>- For each family, we announce the gender of one of the child, but we don't know wich one.<p>- We are then asked to guess the sex of the other child.<p>At this point, you believe that the probability to guess right is 1/2, and that the 2/3\nprobability doesn't make any sense. My claim is that you fall in the Monty Hall problem trap,\nwich is very counter-intuitive and doesn't seem to make sense at first.<p>But here is some clarification of the problem :<p>- What we are really asked is to guess the _gender_ setup of the family. So we need to establish \nthe universe of possible family setups before answering. What are they ?<p>Even if we don't care about the order, we must acknowledge that there are 2 childs in \nthe family, so there must be a first child, and a second child.<p>Setup 1 : both childs are boys : M/M<p>Setup 2 : both childs are girls : F/F<p>Setup 3 : the first child is a boy, and second child is a girl. M/F<p>Setup 4 : the first child is a girl, and the second child is a boy. F/M.<p>Why order matters in setup 3 and 4 ? Because M does not equal F, while M=M and F=F. We investigate not the individual itself, but the property of the\nindividual (in this case, the gender). Therefore, M/F is not equal to F/M, and in the real\nworld there must be a first and a second child.<p>If you are asked to write down all the possible setups of a family of two in the real world, you would write the same\ntable. You'd say that :<p>Some families have 2 boys = 1 setup<p>Some families have 2 girls = 1 setup<p>Some families have one girl and one boy = 2 possible setups (1st one is a girl OR a boy).<p>Your argument of F/M = M/F implies that all families have _either_ one of the 2 setups, every first child is a boy, \nor a girl. But it doesn't work like this in real life. That is why order matters.<p>Conclusion : if we agree that there are 4 possible setups in a family of 2 childs, then we have a probability of\n1/4 to guess the correct setup of the family given NO information. But if we are informed of the gender of \none of the child, then one solution of the setup is removed (F/F or M/M), and we have a chance of 2/3 to guess right IF we chose the opposite gender (see Monty Hall problem).<p>And if we are informed of the gender of one specific child (1st one or 2nd one), then it leaves us with only 2 solutions ! And here, the probability \nbecomes 1/2.",1231184345
