1,722276,comment,721577.0,722126.0,0,0,tom_rath,,,"Joel Spolsky summed it up pretty well in his last Inc. article:<p><i>""...The Web consulting business was great, but it had one problem: limited margins. You could charge only so much for an hour of some consultant's time -- in those days, maybe $200. Some of that went to overhead (say $20) and some to pay the consultant's salary (maybe $70). That leaves you with a mere $110 per hour in gross profit. That's a lot of money, but it paled in comparison with margins in the software industry, in which you can produce additional copies of an application at virtually no cost.""</i><p>So, if a body-shopping service company is competing against another body-shopping service company, they're facing the same per-employee costs and will have no problems in their market.  However, if a body-shopping service company is competing against commercial software for the exact same product and market, commercial software will face lower costs and receive higher revenue for the same work and so will have more resources to bury that competing body-shop every time.<p>Also, if our company receives a service call, we regard it as a failure of our product to address our customer's needs.  If a 'commercial' open source company receives that same call, they regard it as money earned from a support ticket.<p>Given that difference, which software product would you prefer to run in your business?",1248465503.0

14,722262,comment,720957.0,722146.0,0,0,gruseom,,,"Original rectangles are not required. What's important is only that the new rectangles cover the exact same portions of the plane as the original rectangles. This rules out computing the convex hull and then decomposing, because that would fill in any holes, i.e. the new rectangles would be covering space that the old rectangles didn't cover, which won't work.<p>Maybe I can explain this more fully. We are doing computationally-intensive processing of different regions of the plane. The order in which the regions get processed is unpredictable. We need to quickly, precisely and compactly answer the question: ""which regions have been processed so far""?<p>Suppose you hire a guy to paint your wall. He's very anal (or, let's be modern about it, has Asperger's) and only ever paints in axis-parallel rectangles. He's easily distracted and liable to paint rectangles in arbitary locations, so the process doesn't proceed in any linear way, but he does cover the wall eventually. Paint is expensive, so you instruct him never to paint over the same area twice. Our problem is to efficiently answer the question, ""What portions of the wall have been painted so far?""<p>Obviously we could just keep a list and add each new rectangle as it gets painted. But as the wall gets filled in, many painted areas will blend together. We'd like to keep the list as small as possible, i.e. we want the painted-so-far rectangles to be as large as possible. If we didn't care about that, we could just divide the wall into pixels and track the state of each.<p>It's not a disaster if we paint a few spots twice, but it's really bad to mark an area as painted if it hasn't been. That's why we can't ignore holes in the bounding polygon, i.e. space between painted rectangles. (Edit: actually no, it is bad if we paint the same spot twice. Imagine that the paint explodes if you do that. :))<p>The painting analogy can be extended to include color. In the original problem, we're painting the wall with a single color and all we care about is painted vs. not-painted. But if we introduce multiple colors, then we want to track not just ""which areas are painted"" but ""which areas are painted blue and which areas are painted yellow"". We still want to answer that question with as few rectangles as possible, but now we're not allowed to merge blue areas with yellow areas. That being said, a non-color solution would get us a long way.<p>NP complete problems are found everywhere in this space, no question about it. But there are also often useful results around approximations and heuristics. We don't need the optimal set, just small enough to make what we're doing fast.<p>Edit: the above also sheds light on why spatial indexing structures like R-trees don't work for this out of the box (though maybe they can be adapted to do so). These structures let you add rectangles and find them again. But they don't merge rectangles. If our painter takes a fancy to one-centimeter squares and decides to paint a thousand of them all in a row, an R-tree would end up with a thousand rectangles, even though the total painted area is a single n-by-1 rectangle at every step. Something like an R-tree with a ""compaction"" phase would be close to what we need, but maybe not close enough, because insertion into an R-tree is expensive.",1248465235.0

Especially\nsince in political calculus $$ equals votes. It's quite popular to spend\nmoney on some crackpot idea then issue a press release bragging how a\nrepresentative is 'doing something' about the problem.<p>In the occasional year where we have an unexpected surplus do we use the money\nto pay down our existing debt or bank it in anticipation of a future rainy day?\nNo, we spend it on new projects, but we don't simply spend it, we float bond\nissues which obligate us to spend a like amount of money yearly over 30 years.\nOur base spending level keeps growing. We have no flexability to spend less\nduring a bad year because of entitlements like school spending (which by\nconstitutional amendment consume approx 40% of the budget), existing debt\nservice and third-rail special interest issues.<p>Our representatives exhibit the drug seeking behavior of addicts,\npawning a neighbor's tv to buy their next fix. But, it's not crack or PCP that\nthat has them in it's deadly grip. It's money. Cold. Hard. Cash.<p>Our elected representatives in California are boxed into a corner. Any\nmove they might take to cut spending risks alienating the special interest\ngroups that dole out the political contributions. Take prisions, for example. \nIn California we incarcerate a larger percentage of our population than most other states (moreso than some countries, even). Our spending on prisions is nearly \nequal to what we spend on education. (Yet, our prison health care system has been\nput in the hands of a trustee by the federal courts, since we have been killing\none prisoner per day due to inadequate prison health care). Any attempt\nto cut prision spending (and thus endangering the employment of members of\nthe CCPOA union) brings immediate and harsh retribution by CCPOA.<p>So, don't blame Prop13 or the supermajority rule. Even if those were not a\nfactor, we'd still be lurching from crisis to crisis, but we'd have tax rates\nthat are double of what they are now...<p>Joe McGuckin",1248463756.0
