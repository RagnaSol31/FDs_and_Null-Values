If there is any disappointment at Google with Android, its related to the direct to consumer model, and not the phone itself.<p>Today (in the US), most consumers purchase through retailers (wireless carrier stores and 3rd party retailers), and the phones are directly tied to specific carriers.  The Nexus One was an attempt to marginalize this model by providing a direct channel together with a menu of carrier choices for the consumer to pick from.  So far, the sales of the Nexus One show that direct to consumer hasn't worked.  However, as the choice of carriers available for the Nexus One is just now more plentiful, its a bit premature to judge whether the al-la-carte carrier choice will have significant impact.<p>The problem I see for the Nexus One is that its now approaching middle-age for a mobile phone, and newer phones are certainly going to emerge in the coming months that steal the attention.  So the al-la-carte carrier choice model may be too late in coming to have an impact, and therefore may not be the force for change in how consumers purchase phones and choose carriers.",1269200654.0

It's nothing like the unexpected things you get in software. The software equivalent is that of a buggy component whose specification is well understood - if you rewrite the component, you'll get what you expect.

It wasn't.<p>The insurers colluded with the providers to set artificial, market-oblivious standard prices for procedures on a region by region, hospital by hospital basis. From what I understand, prices were often set by allocation schemes negotiated between the payers and the providers, with no apparent regard to the actual cost, supply, or demand for the procedures. At the same time, even as they managed to drastically distort the pricing of health care, insurers apparently negotiated special payment processes directly with providers, thus creating not one but two artificial tiers of pricing.<p>It's meaningful to talk of ""sugar daddies"" and ""insurance"" only when there's a real market for health insurance. But no such market exists. For mainstream medical procedures, for the standard of care that Americans expect (a visit to a doctor, completion of the lab work the doctor requests, some form of radiology, and then a procedure or perscription to resolve whatever comes out of that diagnostic work), unless you are either willing to play chicken with the providers and say ""no"" when they try to collect debts, or willing to pay <i>incredibly, drastically inflated prices</i> for basic procedures, there is no way to get care without involving your insurer.",1269199085.0
