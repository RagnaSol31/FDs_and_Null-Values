Beyond changing how the Muslim world perceives terrorists, we can help ourselves make smarter counterterrorism choices by being more realistic about the profile and aptitude of would-be attackers...Even small investments in training for police and airport-security personnel can make a big difference, as these are the people most likely to encounter—and have a chance to disrupt—an unskilled attacker.</i>",1276458661.0

31,1428025,comment,1427784.0,1427950.0,0,0,macrael,,,"I agree. I see two other big differences between now and the PC OS battle of old. First, compatibility problems were a much bigger deal 20 years ago than they are today. If you and the person you wanted to share information with weren't both running the same program on the same OS with the same data storage hardware, you couldn't collaborate at all. Today, we have the internet, which has created a lowest common denominator for communication. Everyone can understand HTML. We have Google Docs, email, Twitter. Different OS's can have different client applications but can easily talk to the same services as other devices.<p>This leads to my second, related, difference. Microsoft aggressively sold Windows to businesses first, everyone else second. Many many people had Windows machines at work, so when it came time to get one for their home, they picked the same OS for familiarity and compatibility reasons. I don't see that as being a large factor in the handset market. The phone isn't as important to getting work done as the PC was and is, so people have more latitude in picking what phone they want to use.<p>So, again, I agree. There is room for more mobile OS's in this space than the two we got in the PC space. I hope more device manufactures realize this and try hard to make something compelling. We'll see.",1276458088.0

Less ink tends to be faster.<p>Tufte frequently mentions the importance of saving ink when drawing charts, going as far as the rule of thumb that if any line can be erased without changing the meaning of the chart, the chart is better after doing so. But of course, it's not really about saving ink itself, it's just that total ink is a good proxy for the presence of distractions that impair clarity (chartjunk).<p>Similarly, fast-to-write notes like the fishbone also tend to be fast for trained practitioners to read at a glance. Though they may not be exactly what we'd come up with if starting from scratch with reading speed as the sole criterion, they get much closer than the typical lab results report.<p>Current electronic alternatives tend to be optimized for something else entirely: ease of printing on a fixed-pitch line printer. We can improve readability greatly by broadening the formatting options beyond that, to include options previously only possible with freeform pen and paper.<p>An ideal layout optimized for readers and free from obsolete constraints (such as writing speed and legacy print engines) would probably abbreviate fewer words compared to handwritten notes, because unusual abbreviations slow down the reader. At the same time, it would get rid of common words that ended up being frequently repeated on computer reports (medjunk). It could include better graphical and formatting cues (selective boldfacing, symbols, sparklines, spatial layouts like fishbones, etc.)<p>We can also take advantage of handheld devices like the iPad to allow trends and ranges to be brought up by tapping on a result, instead of trying to display everything all at once.",1276456116.0

To use the PC Operating System comparison we’re still in the period where people thought OS/2 and DesqView were viable competitors.  Yes Apple and Google are currently the frontrunners but you have some big, successful companies like Microsoft and Nokia who will literally do anything to get a foothold in this market.<p>My second issue here is this analysis ignores the vast number difference between PC shipments and Cellular Phones.  Windows really cemented control of the market with Windows ’95 but the year after that only saw about 80 million in total PC shipments.  Compare that to the Cellular Phone market which is projected to hit 5 billion this year.  It’s much harder to dominate a market of 5 billion and I really don’t see any company controlling 90% of that.<p>In the end I suspect there will be a lot of competition out there with certain platforms becoming more popular in various countries (I suspect the U.S. will stay Apple vs. Google for example).",1276456082.0

To make a very long story short, most of the rule components had a 1-to-1 translation to a Smalltalk code block (or collection of blocks), which was then compiled and executed.  This would be a great way to implement a Rules engine in Ruby.  Define a very simple language, all of whose components have a 1-to-1 mapping to a small subset of Ruby.  Generate the Ruby code and compile it.  If your subset is kept simple, you can easily use a compiler-compiler or just hand code a top-down parser.  With a strict subset of Ruby, you could also make everything a method and get the s-expression for each method instead of parsing it yourself, but this makes it less straightforward to restrict your subset of Ruby to exactly what you want.  (You may want such restrictions if you have non-programmers maintaing the rules.)<p>The framework I was working with also had components where arbitrary Smalltalk code could be used.  In retrospect, this is a bad idea.<p>All of the rule components were stored as strings with bits of metadata using an Object Relational framework.<p>Also note that the entire Rules repository only amounted to about 5MB of compressed data.  I suspect this isn't unusually small.  Rules can be cached locally with the system only checking for updates.<p>(EDIT: DO NOT naively think you can use a bunch of regexps instead of a parser of some kind.  You can make this work, but it's a hack.  If you don't know enough about automata and languages to know why this wouldn't work, you probably don't know enough to be certain about the results of such a hack.)",1276455982.0
