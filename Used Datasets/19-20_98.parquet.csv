30,908587,comment,908275.0,908471.0,0,0,jdrock,,,"Hi,<p>I recently read your article entitled ""Where's the Money in Casual Web Game Development?"".  Our firm, Plura Processing, provides a really easy way for online games to make money through grid computing.  If a game developer embeds Plura on his site, we will pay him up to $2600/month for every 1000 concurrent users.  This revenue source is a completely new and incremental source of money for game sites, which means it does not have to replace other revenue sources, like advertising.<p>We entered beta a few months ago and currently have a handful of online games as affiliates, including the game you highlighted in your article, Desktop Tower Defense.\nWhen people come to these sites to play games, a Java applet is initiated, which connects the user's computer to our grid computing network.  Our customers use that computing power for a variety of fascinating problems.<p>A game site owner just has to include 1 line of iframe code in the HTML body to use Plura.  An example of this is:<p><iframe src=""<a href=""http://ourserver.com?affiliate_id=xxx&cpu=0.7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ourserver.com?affiliate_id=xxx&cpu=0.7</a> scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" width=""150px"" height=""100px""></iframe><p>The parameters you see in that code can be adjusted, so site owners have pretty much complete control over how Plura is run.<p>We've designed our applet to be very lightweight and secure.  It follows and is restricted by the Java sandbox model (<a href=""http://java.sun.com/sfaq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.sun.com/sfaq</a>), so it doesn't touch anything on the user's computer and runs completely in\nmemory.  We understand that player perception may be a challenge, but we feel the security and control we provide to site owners helps mitigate this.<p>I can share a lot more detail with you if GigaOm is interested in discussing this more.  You can go to <a href=""http://www.pluraprocessing.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pluraprocessing.com</a> for more info.  Because we're currently in beta, we're working with site owners on an invite-only basis, but we do consider people that are interested in Plura and would be a good fit for us.<p>We feel that Plura is a great opportunity for game developers to boost their revenue and profitability.  We would also love to hear what the GigaOm community has to say about us, considering your focus on computing technologies.  If GigaOm is interested in discussing Plura, please let me know - thanks!<p>---------<p>N.B. Keep in mind that some of the technology has changed since then (Plura now focuses on desktop apps).. also, I now work for Plura's sister company, 80legs.",1256759384.0
