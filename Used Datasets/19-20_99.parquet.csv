This would provide evolutionary ECC.<p>You would also need some mechanism to signal people in the far future that the lobsters were data carrying devices.  Otherwise they wouldn't have any reason to randomly decode sea creatures.  Perhaps you could program the lobsters to develop spots on their shells every century which denote the first 10 prime numbers.,1281297444.0

Obviously in principle the British paid lip service to a caste-free society, but in practice they were the authors of apartheid.<p>Also when you look at his views closely, especially after 1925 or so, he moves into a position very similar to that which you will see of modern Christian theology, where you hear much talk of the importance of personal choice. So people should follow a caste and so on, but that's not the place of the government to enforce. That's a much more moderate and workable position than abolition, and much easier to implement. Absolutes do little good when aiming for radical societal reinvention.<p>Even Sati was pushed out bit by bit, by various reformers. But again, from a vegetarian Hindu perspective large-scale livestock slaughter is a similar if not worse evil than Sati, and unless you can provide a proof that animals don't have souls, your rationalism has no place in that discussion. You might as well commend the Communist party for bringing about gender equality as a counter argument to someone railing against the gulags.

Why shouldn't we just keep a hackable computer with detailed visual instructions and specifications?

Also, we could even have a haptic output with which people can interact with the computer.<p>Let's assume that we have a nuclear battery made out of Technetium. Now this feeds into a bank of capacitors and high performance rechargeable cells. Slowly over time the batteries are kept topped off and they are ""exercised"" by the computer. Further, for redundancy 4 or more computing units in parallel could be placed that would wake up sequentially and call the others to check how the entire unit is working.
