However, if the ban is ONLY on the use of the mark as inappropriate button and not for anything else, then I doubt it would actively scare users.<p>You'll note that my proposal does not include a ban of anything, not even the ""mark as inappropriate"" button.  I just suggest letting the bad users keep putting in their bad  ratings, and using that information in the opposite manner as they intended.<p>You could even have some sort of Bayesian (naive or Markovian, depending on your computing resources and scaling needs) classifier set up to see what words or phrases in a post make any given user more likely to mis-rate.  Then you could separate out a user's probably-bad ratings from their probably-good ones.",1196369798.0

Its reasonable to expect them to have a command of everything from database indices to cross-platform JavaScript. (Bonus points if they are handy in Photoshop and Illustrator.)""<p>-- This is pretty retarded.  While most decent developers have toyed around with lots of technologies,  it takes a lot of work and time to know one in depth. Anybody that claimes that knows everything:<p>1. Usually are jack of all trades but master of none.  Basically they have mocked around with everything, but they are pretty mediocre and never had the chance to involve in a technology in great depths.  <p>2.Are the ""heroic"" types, the especially young ones that have played or mocked around with certain technologies, and the ""claim"" they know them.    This is more a naive interpratation of being familiar with a technology is the same as knowing it, and this guys are about a rude-awekening when they actually have to do something serious on their technologies they ""know"".<p>\nYes, I mocked around with photoshop/firwork, but I am not a good designer, I have done some PHP work, but I am not good at it,  I have designed some databases, but I am not that knowlageble person to know everything at least I admit it.<p>Be wary of people that don't admit they weakness, but appear to ""know everything""",1196369261.0

Not to start a flame war, just pointing out a simple fact:  RoR doesn't handled i10n and l8n nearly as well as Python/Django does, for instance.
