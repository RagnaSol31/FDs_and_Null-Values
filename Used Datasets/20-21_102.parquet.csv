The idea is to have fun, productive sessions on open source software where I can talk a little bit about what I am doing.<p>I envision a future where a lot of programmers use their open source, side-project, hobby inspired hacking sessions and that allows a lot more people to learn how to do stuff.<p>Today (in 2 hours) i will be streaming for 3-4 hours doing a Google App Engine application that interacts with an API I wrote for Noticias Hacker( a spanish version of HN) to get the list of github users. Then i'll use the github api to store some information and try to do a nice dashboard where you can see what the users of NH have been up to in the last week in Github.<p>I will start from zero, create a GAE app, a github repository and use some task queues and cron jobs.<p>Please join us @ www.livestream.com/dfectuoso<p>We will have some people on Skype and hope to get some nice feedback from the chat!",1303678631.0

23,2479584,comment,2479124.0,2479548.0,1,0,Mz,,,"I have eliminated all unnecessary expenses.  My health issues are still quite pricey and the past three months have been very ugly in that regard, which is a big part of why I am so stressed out about the whole thing.  The debts I owe are a lot <i>for me</i>, given my current income and situation, but not a lot in the grand scheme of things (like compared to what my medical condition typically costs to treat using conventional approaches).  It's very, very frustrating because I am saving gobs of money for other people in terms of taxes not spent on keeping me alive:  I am a former military wife and could have kept my military medical benefits and had nearly ""free"" medical care at the expense of taxpayers.  Doing the right thing is all coming out of my hide financially and it just feels like the universe is pissing on me.  I could be rewarded for keeping my problems alive and not solving them but can't seem to catch a break for actually rolling up my sleeves and fixing sh*t.<p>It would make financial sense in the big picture -- not just for me, but for the national economy - if I could get some support so I can leave my job and work on this.  Even if others with my condition don't get well, even if all they do is get less sick and need to be hospitalized less and need half as much medication, by my estimate the US is spending around $3 billion/year on medical care for roughly 30,000 people with my condition and most of that is covered by insurance, state aid, federal aid, charities and write-offs (when they can't pay their medical bills).  And that doesn't begin to factor in disability payments and other forms of support that chronically ill and dying people often qualify for.  But I know of no way to tap into that $3 billion and I know of no way to fund-raise to put myself in a position to work on this.<p>I think I need about $50,000 or so to resolve my financial issues, walk away from my job, and have some money in the bank to live on while making the transition to some kind of entrepreneurial income based on my various websites.  I know there is ""demand"" for some of what I know and a couple of my websites have been around for several years (one of them is about 8 years old, another is over 5 years old and I have a couple of newer things).   I don't know how to monetize it and, given the health issues in the family (I and my oldest both have CF), trying to put in the extra effort to achieve launch while working a full time job is proving to be too much.<p>Thank you for replying. I really didn't expect much (if any) help.  I have figured out how to ""cure"" cystic fibrosis which most of the world says cannot be done.  If resolving my financial problems were a simple matter, I imagine I would have done it by now.  I'm not bad with money.  I've just been doing ""the impossible"" and there are consequences for that.<p>Peace.",1303677785.0
