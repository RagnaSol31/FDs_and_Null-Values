It's a left-wing activist organization.<p>You can't have it both ways. You're either one or the other.<p>The notion that Wikileaks was in some way obligated to ""market"" this material is nonsense. Virtually anyone else in the world could have contributed the ""marketing"" once the material was out there. There was no need whatsoever for Wikileaks to trade its credibility for promotional value.

What am I missing here? Is it that you think that Greenwald doesn't recognize or understand ingrained and universal bias?<p>Is it that you think Wikileaks should simply not have any opinions and only relay the facts? I guess that might be an improvement in the sense that they don't impart an incomplete or biased narrative? Isn't that called marketing? Should activists not market? Only information-related activists? Which activists are not in the information business anyway? Is activism within the media inherently and broadly frustrating to you too?<p>There's some piece of information missing I think that connects the dots of why humans at Wikileaks having opinions and marketing them is frustrating to you.<p>ITN news from the U.K. used to have a policy of impassive presentation of the facts. I loved it. But not many people watch ITN news, in fact I think they've gone away or changed or something because it wasn't viable or something of the sort, I need to look that up.",1276894478.0

It's <i>possible</i> that by ""access to a network of places to stay all over the world"" they mean access to a network of places they own and operate, but I'd take it as hinting otherwise. The ""places to crash"" and ""instant friends"" especially makes me suspect that these apartments will be owned by other people, possibly even inhabited by them? But it's rather unclear. If they <i>did</i> own them all, I'd be impressed that they were able to quickly build up an international network of property holdings, and the support staff to clean/maintain them!<p>If they don't own them, then the novelty seems like it'll be in the payment/pricing structure, which they seem to hint will involve ZipCar-like membership fees and daily pricing.
