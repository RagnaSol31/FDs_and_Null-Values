I got so into JS, that I started writing more logic in the client, because I could, and because JS, with it's loose typing and object notation was just a fast place to write code.<p>Now, two years later, I've embarked on a large project, an HMI in an industrial sector, and I of course made heavy use of jQuery. After 4000 LOC, the program needed some serious re-factoring in order to handle the next level of complexity.<p>To handle the complex demands of the application, I decided to use the Closure Compiler, which is great! The only problem is, that now, I'm writing typed code, in a non-typed language, and there's not much to really like about the language, besides the fact it's on all web browsers and has a ton of third-party support.<p>I guess my point is: I think tools like Closure Compiler and others which produce ""compiled Javascript"" are the future, if anything is. Maybe we'll see Python, or Java get JS like support in the browser, but if I could talk to the me from two years ago, I'd tell him: ""Start using the  Closure Compiler, and use less jQuery.""",1289075805.0

39,1877701,comment,1877294.0,1877294.0,0,0,jwr,,,"I disagree with the author. I've yet to see an abstraction layer that doesn't end up as the lowest common denominator of all databases supported or becomes a leaky abstraction.<p>Databases are different — accept it. I use PostgreSQL and Redis — there is really little they have in common and I use them for completely different purposes. I can't see how you could stuff all that into a single abstraction. I mean, in my Clojure code I use SQL transactions in one part of the program and Redis' optimistic locking (WATCH/MULTI/EXEC) in the other. They are _different_ and they are supposed to be different.<p>I also believe that the whole story about how difficult it is to ""switch databases"" is a red herring. If your code isn't a pile of spaghetti, then your database access functions are grouped together, not spread all over the place. This usually means that instead of abstracting the database with a generic database API, you abstract the database with <i>your</i> API, which only performs the operations you need.<p>If you do that, then a) switching databases isn't that difficult, b) your ""database DSL"" becomes <i>your</i> DSL, not somebody else's.<p>As a practical example, my code has a namespace called ""distributed"" which abstracts distributed synchronization using Redis. I can call (distributed/register-server), or (distributed/dequeue-job). The functions are very short, and really consist of redis-clojure calls with minimal database logic. Now <i>that</i> is a DSL I like.",1289075698.0

(Evidenced by, say, Mathematica.)<p>Intuition is a more organic form of rational though; generally unchecked for errors (before your rational thought process gets ahold of it and examines it thoroughly), but exploring possibilities for solutions that may not immediately follow from the data you have in front of you. It skips the intermediate steps and delivers an abstract pathway to your solution, which you follow, and prove to work, with your rational thought.<p>Intuition is more like +N un-processed rational steps at once, with a higher probability for error. As long as we assume there is some difference, they're are co-dependent and just as valuable as the other; you need equal ""amounts"" of both to solve the difficult problems.",1289075136.0
