We (Polar Rose) do very intense image processing (Java combined with native C++ code) and never have more than NCPU worker threads running at the same time.<p>We do have a whole bunch of threads running around that for network services like JMS, JMX, etc. But you can basically ignore the overhead of that. It's like having idle UNIX processes. Or are you also saying that having more then NCPU processes running is sloppy?<p>S.",1210539243

Will it be ""put our ads on your blog, and we'll split the profits"" or ""pay for Disqus or we'll put ads on your site""?

It might be smart of the company to either remove it or minimize its presence because I've seen so many take the route of ""analytics? whoop dee doo.""<p>Also, if Xobni would like to be a stand-alone email/CRM one day, integration with as many email applications is quite necessary.",1210538481

Could be something as simple as having attended the same University, holding the same religious/theological beliefs and practices, or speaking the same non-English language (in the US).<p>To assume that ""most people don't want to date people with the same interests"" is a very big assumption, but then again, I guess you can always put your money where your mouth is. :)<p>That being said, I do think many dating sites are broken, but in my opinion it has more to do with the structure of the sites, and also the ratio of men seeking women to women seeking men is often unworldly disproportionate.<p>You are defining dating and relationships in your own eyes ""show me everyone within 10 miles of 14850 except those whose profiles contain: jesus, single mom, smoker, republican, pulp-free orange juice, george bush, herpes, bbw, us weekly, horses, etc."" but that may not work for everyone.",1210538031

23,187009,comment,186659.0,186892.0,0,0,nickb,,,"Yep, I think those are called branding exercises. Only big companies engage in those types of advertising since they are not easily gauged for effectiveness. It's very hard to convince some smaller company that they should spend $5M on some blimp and slap their logo on the side or something crazy like that. Big companies (car companies spring to mind) have that kind of money and advertising budgets and they do run these kinds of branding campaigns all the time.<p>But the issues with these campaigns is that they're the first to go when recession hits. In times of recession, first thing you cut is branding advertising since you can't measure it and you can't track it.<p>Online banners, and especially google adwords, will fare better in slowdowns since a company must advertise if it is to survive and get some revenue in. They will probably pick something that's effective and something that they can track right away.",1210537362
