8,790024,comment,786508.0,788844.0,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, I have to admit that it's been a long time since I've read the code (version 2.x).  I don't find Hungarian notation offensive, as long as naming conventions are consistently applied.  If they aren't consistently applied in SQLite, then I guess that'd be a problem worth complaining about.  I also don't find terseness and compact functions offensive.  Whitespace is good, but not mandatory, as long as there is consistency...humans are adaptable, and once accustomed to a particular whitespace convention (whatever it is), it's usually fine.  More lines fit on a page, anyway, and that has some value.<p>So, even if naming conventions are inconsistent and there's not enough whitespace, it is still a nice piece of code.  The interfaces are very nice and clean (which does apply to internally used interfaces, as well, as I recall it), which is extremely important.  It is also among the best tested pieces of C code in the world, with ridiculously high test coverage, which is good, too...it also means it is better documented than a lot of code, since the tests tend to provide a second tier of code documentation (you can see how the interface, both internal and world-facing, is used and what it's supposed to return).<p>I won't argue that Linux or WebKit aren't nicer.  I've spent more time in the Linux kernel sources than any other major C project (except maybe Squid), and it is definitely a really great codebase.  I don't know WebKit, at all, so won't comment.  Linux has dramatically less test coverage than SQLite, and is also tersely commented and documented. I kinda suspect your opinion of the SQLite bits that are poorly commented comes from the contrast with the places where it is commented in vivid and verbose detail (I seem to recall there was/is some form of literate programming going on in SQLite, but maybe that was another project).",1251406539
9,790023,comment,789870.0,789952.0,0,0,tsuraan,,,"The biggest issue with copyright today is that the law itself is contemptible, so people do not respect it.  Our constitution (for those in the US) allows the government to create a time-limited copyright law, for the purpose of promoting the arts.  As it stands today, no work has returned to the public domain in most people's lifetimes, and very few people expect it to happen.<p>Copyright is an agreement between society and creators of art, literature, music, etc.  It says that if they will share their creations with society, then society will allow them to profit from that for a time.  After that time is up, everybody gets to share the works freely.  Society has been granting the artists the monopoly on distribution, but we haven't been getting the ability to share them after a period of time.  It's this imbalance that causes people to lose respect for the law.  I don't think copyright should be abolished, but I do think it needs to return to its original term, and I believe that retroactive extensions are an abomination against what copyright is supposed to create.<p>I'm not terribly eloquent, but Thomas McCauley was.

Also, the landlord owns the place, but that doesn't give the landlord carte blanche to enter the apartment anytime they feel like it.  Sure, they ""own"" it, but that does not make it any less wrong for them to barge in and gain access.  If they need access, they must provide sufficient notice and must do it for a specific reason.  This is a very similar situation.<p>Particularly interesting to me is that they had the technical means to restrict the virtual machine via a configuration change, but instead chose to ""trespass"".<p>According to their terms and conditions, ""Misuse of System Resources"" is prohibited, but their only listed recourse is to ""restrict, suspend, or terminate"" the account.  It is arguable that they had no right to access the data for his server, since they had other means to restrict or otherwise limit the VPS (which they already did). They should have just paused the VPS without accessing the data and send him an email.  Adding your SSH key to a customer's server without notice or approval is a good way to tarnish a reputation among the hacker crowd (their customer base).  I wouldn't allow them to have root access either.<p>Their argument would have been much stronger had they provided any sort of evidence of CPU load of his server.  However, that probably would have shown how oversold the machine really was.",1251406484

I don't think $100,000 a year (after 20 years of service) is too high a price to pay for a competent professional who can have a positive impact on hundreds of lives over the course of his/her career.<p>In fact, the argument could be made that it is not enough, and that is why traditionally those working in education are not as talented those in other, more well funded fields like finance and medicine.<p>The scariest part of Steven Brill's article is many teachers' aversion to quality metrics that could actually measure performance and hold them accountable for their work.<p>Two quotes:\n1.  <i>Our schools are indifferent to instructional effectiveness,""the study declared. Under the subhead “All teachers are rated good or great,"" it examined teacher rating processes, and found that in districts that have a binary, satisfactory-unsatisfactory system, ninety-nine per cent of teachers receive a satisfactory rating, and that even in the few school districts that attempt a broader range of rating options ninety-four per cent get one of the top two ratings.</i><p>2.  <i>I asked the woman for her reaction to the following statement: ""If a teacher is given a chance or two chances or three chances to improve but still does not improve, there’s no excuse for that person to continue teaching. I reject a system that rewards failure and protects a person from its consequences.""<p>""That sounds like Klein and his accountability bullshit,""she responded. ""We can tell if we’re doing our jobs. We love these children."" After I told her that this was taken from a speech that President Obama made last March, she replied, ""Obama wouldn’t say that if he knew the real story.</i>",1251404702

82,789947,comment,789559.0,789559.0,0,0,chriseppstein,,,"Salary is important and in more ways than just having more money. Titles vary at different companies and have different meanings, so salary is the easiest way for a bigger company to place you into a title at that company. Once you're in the company, sadly, title matters since most people at a company don't know what each other make. So if you want to advance your career, you actually have to get raises with every promotion. Don't accept a promotion without a corresponding pay raise -- since promotion means either more work or more responsibility.<p>Changing jobs is the easiest way to make more money. If you change too often, you'll be pegged as unreliable, so the strategy only works to a point.<p>Your job should be giving you annual reviews, this is a good time to get a raise and if you don't get one, complain about it. If you don't get annual reviews, asking for one is a nice way of saying you'd like a raise and feedback is actually really nice in either direction (compliments, points of improvement).<p>Threatening to leave is the worst way to get a raise. But it is important for your employer to understand that you can leave and that you choose to stay -- such loyalty is rare and is something that should be rewarded, with money.<p>If it comes to it, get an offer in hand from the new company that you are going to go to. Then quit. Don't threaten to quit. And don't bring up money as the reason unless they ask why you decided to leave. Then say ""I needed more money, I love working here, but I understand your budget constraints and didn't want to put you in a tough spot."" It's business. You're not an asshole for leaving. There's no contract that says you must stay and don't think for an instant that you're so effing awesome that you wouldn't get layed off if they had to do it. It's business. Because it's business and money is now in play (assuming they asked) they might decide to make a counter offer. If they don't, you're taking the new job. If they do, it's because you deserve it and they've decided that the cost of replacing you (explicit cost and opportunity cost) is higher than your raise. Yes, you're replaceable, and despite what others have said, your NP is not fucked. They will survive without you.<p>By the way, if you're awesome and your boss is awesome, this is never an issue, I've asked for raises casually over beer or whatever, and got them before. A few thousand here, a few thousand there adds up in time. Keep a 5 to 10 year perspective on things.<p>Lastly, I would point out that salary is not everything. I've made more at other jobs than the one I have now and hated them. It's hard to put a price on happiness.",1251404400

As you might know, ""Deep Blue"" was more than just software, a big part of deep blue was its massive parallel processing power crunching literally 200 million nodes per second (nps or positions per second), even though source code of deep blue is not available to public, raw logs of the game are available and nothing from those logs suggest that any monkey business was going on (it has been debunked many times).<p>I think Kasparov got overwhelmed by the numbers that DB was crunching and he lost the game psychologically even before the game started.
