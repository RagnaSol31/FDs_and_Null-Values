44,933880,comment,933273.0,933819.0,0,0,btilly,,,"I accept your correction that there is a difference between ""promoting progress"" and ""coming up with ideas"".  (By coincidence I just reread <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/math.HO/9404236"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/math.HO/9404236</a> which argues, among other things, that progress in mathematics can be helped by <i>not</i> proving facts too quickly.)<p>I agree with you on the intent of the design of the patent system.  However in a world filled with overbroad junk patents, where accidental infringement is much better than willful infringement, there are real incentives for innovative people to _not_ read patents.  Because reading them opens you up to liability without teaching you anything you couldn't have thought of on your own.<p>As for the cost of waiting, you are right that the incentive to wait is an inefficiency in my proposal.  However the aim here is to achieve a good trade-off.  Obviously more detailed analysis is required to find whether it achieves as good a trade-off as I think it does.<p>However for many years we blindly accepted very large increases in how easy it was to get a patent without substantive debate, and there is now substantial evidence that this has been a bad thing.  So it seems to me that it shouldn't be hard to improve on the current state, and I think my proposal would be an improvement.<p>Finally I have to say that I don't understand what you mean by ""presumption of validity"".  The way things work now is that if IBM wants me to enter into a cross-licensing arrangements, we both know that they can threaten me with a large stack of patents.  We both know that most of those patents won't stand up in court, but fighting it will impose serious costs on me and they are likely to get me on something.  So even though we both presume the patents are invalid, the threat is still good.<p>How would you change that dynamic?  If your idea is that they spend their money to validate their patent before I spend a dime, how will we know it has been validated to my satisfaction?  In theory that kind of validation is the job of the patent office.  However regulatory capture has made that review a joke, and would eventually eventually ruin any other level of review you could add.  But if I have to spend money in the process of getting the patent validated, then IBM still can threaten me as they would today.",1257885754.0

I thought about her way too often, missed her way more than a normal person ought to, and was pretty much in a constant state of love-induced sugar shock. I didn't want to seem overzealous or desperate, so I tried to play it cool -- and yet, the impulse to post embarrassing, saccharine love quotes to Facebook was overwhelming (I am but only a dork, after all).<p>So I did what any self-respecting geek would do in my position: I computed a SHA-2 hash of her name and put it in that weird little box thingy on the left hand side of my Facebook profile. It provided just the right balance of self expression and social tact. I was happy.<p>I liked the idea so much that I decided I would wrap it in a small application and dedicate it to the object of my dorkitude. As I knew it would take a few weeks to flesh out and things were (shockingly) starting to work out between this lovely individual and myself, I thought that the final product might make for a cute little way of sharing my feelings. The idea of tiny ""cupidcode"" links spreading across facebook and the twitters -- each rooted in my nerdy affection for this particular young lady -- seemed like a terribly powerful way to say ""I really think you're great"".

If they didn't keep an eye on this stuff, those factors of 2-10x would eat them alive.<p>For some value of M and N, having N million users around for M months means that development costs are actually cheaper than compute costs, and I'd assume that they've now reached a point where most new products expect to see more than that magic number of users.
