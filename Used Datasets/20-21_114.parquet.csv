Right now I'd like to ask for your opinion on the pricing model.<p>Our model right now is a free option, which has a limit of 1000 bookmarks for a month, and then it becomes unlimited. This is to avoid people coming in, importing their 20,000 bookmarks and leaving, never to return.<p>There are also some extra features here: http://historio.us/pricing/<p>The main problem, and what we'd like your feedback on, is that every bookmark a user adds is expensive, as we have to store the entire page. Right now the service is profitable, but we'd like to improve it so we can scale it better.<p>What features would make you pay for it? What sort of things would turn you away from it as a free user with a mind to convert later on?<p>A good point we heard for not having a bookmark limit is that, even with 1,000 bookmarks, users would think twice before bookmarking something, and we don't want that.<p>Any feedback you could give is greatly appreciated!",1281905668
