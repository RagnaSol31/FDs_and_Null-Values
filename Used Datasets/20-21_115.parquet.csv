Not to mention that most multi-platform software packages are better supported on Windows (Flash, Photoshop).<p>Related to hardware problems, when coming from Linux, it may be quite true, but in case you're thinking about a future Linux-powered device, search for the ones that are compatible (for example Dell or Acer laptops are usually fine).<p>On both Windows / Linux ... it's much harder to do QA on hardware compatibility when your list of supported devices has all the devices ever created. Try installing OS X on top of an AMD processor.<p>The people I know that switched to Macs have done it because ...<p><pre><code>  * they want Unix and their company only allows Windows / OS X\n  * they love Linux but need commercial software (Photoshop)\n  * they want Unix, but hate Linux's problems\n  * they want to look cool\n</code></pre>\nThat last point shouldn't be underestimated. Almost every Hollywood movie that features a man/woman in front of a computer, it's from Apple.<p>I've never seen a single normal person that voluntarily choses OS X over Windows / Apple over Dell ... because of technical superiority or because of the lack of viruses (if they do, they saw it in an ad).<p>Normal users don't think about such things because normal users blame themselves when the shit hits the fan and they always have a friend that can fix it (over and over and over again). And when they buy from Apple, guess who are they're gonna call when their old webcam isn't supported or when some piece of software they've got from work isn't working :)",1268773163.0

You're right that by mixing plant types, you can achieve better density and get a synergistic effect (another example is planting garlic/onions next to potatoes to repel potato bugs). One problem with large commercial farms is that in order to reduce the labor needs you have to plant at a density that makes it easier for mechanized equipment to harvest and that means that you must generally separate crops.<p>I have seen research projects that used robots to plant seedlings: typically a very labor intensive task. I'm thinking that if you could build robots/smarter machines that could harvest a wide variety of crops instead of just e.g, what a combine can process, then greater density & improved crop mix could be achieved.<p>I've always enjoyed food gardening and more recently I've been thinking of ways to apply technology to large gardens/small farm plots to reduce the dependence on my very limited free time.
