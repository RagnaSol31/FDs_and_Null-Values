In practice, no.  Most people agree with this statement.  However, you don't <i>need</i> to eat or wear animals to lead a happy, productive life (e.g., I know someone who has been vegan for over 30 years).  So eating meat is optional--it's a choice people make.  It's not necessary.<p>As far as the suffering goes, the suffering that occurs in factory farms is the worst imaginable.  For example, it's routine for male chicks to be ground alive and for chickens to have their beaks cut off.  And more than 99% of livestock is factory farmed.<p>So this is where theory does not meet practice.  If people really believed that ""we should avoid inflicting needless suffering on animals"" then the majority of the population would be vegetarian.<p>""set stray cats on fire for entertainment""<p>To me this is morally equivalent to eating factory-farmed meat because you enjoy the taste (provided you are aware of the intense suffering of factory farms).",1267304068.0

35,1155796,comment,1155213.0,1155677.0,0,0,strlen,,,"I think what the parent meant is that there are now tools available to implement the algorithms used by Amazon et al for recommendations. It isn't about having more users, it's about being able to keep track of great deal more data and use that data at great deal more points in the applications. That's what Hadoop, NoSQL et al allow you to do (e.g. Voldemort's and HBase's ability efficiently load and serve data prepared in Hadoop; afaik Cassandra has Hadoop integration now as well).<p>Now even if you are okay with low throughput (you don't see yourself become a major Internet destination), you can still benefit from non-relational approaches.<p>Implementing a recommender system or PageRank on top of a relational database is simply painful and requires expertise in that system's SQL dialect (someone who's done this on top of Oracle won't be able to do this -- in the same amount of time -- on top of MySQL or Postgres). With Hadoop\nyou can start with a Perl or Python script (and make use of libraries like scipy or pysvm) and then gradually re-write the performance critical parts in Java. Even if you aren't and will never get to Facebook's or Amazon's scale, you're now able to build intelligent applications on top of your data.<p>You can also sleep sound at night (i.e., not in front of a terminal tailing your logs or watching ganglia) knowing that a load spike (which could be start of a new financial quarter, holiday shopping season; something as positive as a NYTimes article or -- much more likely -- as negative as a DDOS attack) won't bring you to an outage.<p>The algorithms themselves, however, are very difficult and require a background in machine learning; that is even to use an existing implementation of these algorithms (e.g. Apache Mahout). I am not an expert in these topics. I took a graduate course in machine learning, but that only demonstrated to me how little I know and how much more I have left to learn. It's <i>this</i> expertise that coupled with ability to implement a scalable infrastructure with open source/in-house developed software (instead of relying on commercial vendors) that makes your a business idea (you know, the one that the ""business guys"" think they can hire bunch of MSCEs to build in ASP.NET/J2EE/PHP/RoR) defensible from some ""kid"" in Harvard dorms (especially if that kid declined a $1mm starting bonus to work for Microsoft instead of going to Harvard).<p>Don't get me wrong. SQL is an amazingly example of a domain specific language; RDBMs are wonderful works of software engineering. SQL RDBMs are great for many applications (e.g., ERP systems and their functional equivalents like the university registration system patio11 mentioned). Yet they're not made to solve the kinds of problems/create the kind of applications that simply didn't exist when they were created. The fact that they <i>can</i> at times be used for this doesn't mean they should: I can write Russian with Latin instead of Cyrillic Alphabet (or write Lisp in vi instead of emacs), but it's a lot better to use the correct tool.",1267303156.0

I can't remember stuff that I used to remember very good (house&telephone numbers, etc.).<p>For example I go to the grocery store with the idea to buy bread. When I get home, I realize that I bought 3 other things but forgot the bread. It sounds funny, but this has never happened to me before this often.<p>Another problem is that I'm sometimes not able to build complete sentences or put my ideas into sentences, I stutter and I need 2-3 tries before getting the sentence right. Although I think that this is due to my less reading in this language (I'm native Swiss, but read almost every day in English [hacker news, books, papers, etc.], so I'm going to up the German reading to test whether this was the problem.<p>My sleep habits haven't changed (6-8 hours, depending on the day) a lot. I have a stressful daily life (startup work, studying EE, girlfriend) and even there I tend to forget simple tasks and to-do's, which annoys me really bad. I exercise 3-4 times a week (weight training) and eat a balanced diet with a lot of protein (which I supplement also). I do take an omega-3 supplement and drink mostly water and green tea. I haven't used any drugs at all in my life. I was always good in memorizing and remembering faces, etc.<p>This problem also keeps me from focusing on important tasks. For example when I pack my bag in the morning, I go to the kitchen to get my meal ready. I then enter the kitchen see an apple and think ""oh I should take an apple, too."" - wash it, bag it and leave the kitchen, without my meal.<p>I have two possible reasons (I know they are stupid...) for it, but I can't back them scientifically:<p>1. too much screen time (working, watching movies, surfing)<p>2. the fillers in my supplements don't do me any good.<p>Is learning/studying somewhat connected to the short-term memory? Because when I look back, I haven't studied ""real material"" for a long time (after HS -> military -> EE exams in summer).<p>I'm not sure but I believe that only my short-term memory is affected so far.

Murder is an obvious one we can all agree on, intellectual property is hazier.<p>So with the BSD you are guaranteed your software stays free, but other's can stay within practical limits while still benefitting from free software.

88,1155738,comment,1155225.0,1155265.0,0,0,otakucode,,,"Social problems are caused by the beliefs held by individuals in the public, and the actions they take as a consequence of those beliefs.  For example, if many people in a society believe that theft is an act they can live with, there is a high rate of thievery.  The beliefs currently held in most western societies that lead to a lack of defense of personal freedom are that security is more important than freedom, that security can be improved through restriction of freedom, and that the average people in law enforcement and the government have the capability and will to restrict freedom in ways that increase security.  Since most people no longer seek rational justifications for their beliefs and rely on naive intuition, it is impossible for their beliefs to be corrected through rational argument or by better informing them.  Intellectualism is viewed as a form of extremism, and their intuition tells them that all extremism is bad and that truth always lies 'in the middle.'  Therefore, when someone wants to appeal to them to consider the ideological underpinnings of their belief, or the logical consequences of it, they turn off and immediately ignore the person.  Anything that is substantially different from their present experience is rejected, regardless of its rational basis.  For example, when it was found that almost all of the MPs had been illegally using taxpayer money to pay for personal expenses, the concern of the public was never whether this is a behavior that should be punished on principle.  The fact that throwing almost every MP into jail, or even just ejecting them from office, would seem ""extreme"" to them, so they reject the idea out of hand.<p>Were rationality still a valued trait in western society, the public might come to realize the things learned about human behavior over the past hundred years or so and the futility of efforts to improve security by limiting freedom.  They might realize that conditions in prison are caused by the lack of freedom rather than the type of people put into prison.  If prisons were full of plumbers and judges rather than criminals, they would be nearly indistinguishable from prisons full of criminals.  The Stanford Prison experiments and many other real-world scenarios (Abu Ghraib was one that garnered publicity) illustrate this facet of humanity well.  Having your freedom limited strips you of your humanity, and stripping someone of their freedom also strips you of your humanity.",1267301290.0
