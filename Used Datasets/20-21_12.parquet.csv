May it spread far and wide.<p>If you're the kind of person who can't bring himself to follow a simple and sensible plan like Dilbert's, I have the book for you: William Bernstein's ""The Four Pillars of Investing"".<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Four-Pillars-Investing-Building-Portfolio/dp/0071385290/ref=sr_1_2/103-3892353-0078258?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189716378&sr=1-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Four-Pillars-Investing-Building-Portfo...</a><p>If you follow Bernstein's advice you will end up with Dilbert's financial plan, except that instead of one giant index fund you'll have a bunch of smaller index funds - some small-cap, some large-cap growth, some international, and so on. Plus bonds, of course. In other words, you'll be a Vanguard customer. But there's nothing wrong with that.<p>This additional layer of complexity might be good for an additional point or two of growth. Or it might turn out to be a useless exercise in micromanagement. But it's a nice safe way to satisfy your urge to pretend that doing a lot of higher math and complicated bookkeeping is making you richer. The book is careful to steer you away from stupid stock-picking strategies, stupid stock newsletters, and advisers who work on commission (who are, by definition, not on your side).",1189717074.0

I'm stepping outside my area of expertise, but here's my intuition:<p>Radiative cooling and thermal isolation seem to be fairly well understood. They can also (unlike many, many other parts of the problem) be tested on Earth. Basically, any satellite needs to deal with this stuff, and designers <i>have</i> been dealing with it for a long while.<p>Now, if you add lunar dust to the mix, sure, that's a complicating factor, but I don't see it being as bad as some of the other things I mentioned.",1189715951.0

I remember seeing copies of ""7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" as well.

It's cover looked suspicious to me but I don't know much about it.<p>Honestly, though, most managers simply did not read, and those who did certainly didn't read anything about how to become a better manager, unless it was forced on them from corporate.

18,54386,comment,54236.0,54309.0,0,0,euccastro,,,"I think you got this impression from William Clinger's proposal.

Most explicitly ((de)emphasis mine):<p><i>The development of Extended R5RS Scheme might even provide a practical migration path from the R5RS to </i>some future standard that supersedes both<i> the R5RS and the R6RS while unifying the Scheme community to a degree that might be</i> hard to imagine at this moment.<p><a href=""http://scheme-punks.cyber-rush.org/wiki/index.php?title=ERR5RS:Charter&redirect=no"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scheme-punks.cyber-rush.org/wiki/index.php?title=ERR5...</a><p>Note, anyway, that Clinger's manifesto, while probably being an inspiration for the initiative, is not <i>that</i> prominent in the front page.

This has made a lot of people quite angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.<p>Many programmers believe that it was created by some sort of community process, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI believe that the entire Standard was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure.

I'd also call them over-hyped, rather than over-rated (who honestly would rate 'Chicken Soup for the Soul at Work' as a serious business book)?<p>I'd have been far more interested in seeing books selected from the 'recommended reading' list used for (say) Harvard Business School, and then an examination of the merits of those.

22,54382,comment,54037.0,54129.0,0,0,danw,,,Showing old films in cinemas tends not to work well. The hire of the reel is cheaper but an old film draws a smaller crowd. The cinema still has to allocate a normal sized screen to it (150-400 seats) which it could be filling with this weeks new releases instead. This may work however in combination with smaller capacity screens instead (20-50). The exception is when sequels are released.
