It went together quickly enough, but I didn't really feel like ""wow, this was a great web development experience that has changed my life"".  I do feel that way about Haskell for text processing and system programming, ironically.  It definitely beats Perl there.

One of the tasks is to create a client side application as an enterprise solution.  Perl is not necessarily best suited for this even if people try to make it so.  The next is for web development.  I originally started with Perl for this, but PHP came along and made things so much easier.  Using Perl before PHP resulted in me knowing PHP the same day I started using it.  The general concepts were already there.  However, PHP is ugly in the way that the attributes to functions are inconsistent.  I still use PHP for web development, but for my next project, I am going to take a look at a higher level language based on Ruby.  Ruby looks very easy.  While I enjoy complexity in programming, I enjoy productivity during the creation process just as much and products such as Rails look like they are the next step in such development.  Lastly, there is the quick hack.  I still grab Perl for such solutions, but this is code I would never show anyone else.  So, yes, Perl is not dead for me and maybe never will be, but it has had one foot in the grave for a while.  Perhaps a web development kit on top of an existing Perl architecture to better separate the HTML, data, and functions would be the cure, but it may be too late for that.",1257538148.0
