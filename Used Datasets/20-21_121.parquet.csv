In terms of corporate culture Google makes products that do well with the general public, but anything with health is both very niche and mission critical. To really crack that market takes a singular focus -- and that's not just creating the product but dealing with things like lobbying and sales. I'll grant you that the folks at Google are very bright, but very bright doesn't mean you can do anything. And I suspect that this was just a bit too much of a stretch for them (unless they purchased a company that was already in that space).",1309121535.0

17,2699043,comment,2698062.0,2698062.0,40,0,econgeeker,,,"We've been doing this for three years now. This couple seemed to focus on having a year abroad, we've made it our lifestyle, and we're doing a startup (rather than consulting).<p>I started this as a response to the ""how to keep productive"" question, but I'll try to address the other questions people have been asking in the thread later on.<p>We also have the issue of taking some period of time to get back into the productive zone.  What we do is spend the visa limit time in each country.  For americans in the UK that is 6 months, for instance. So we rented an apartment for 6 months.  In the Shengen zone (most of europe) it is 3 months, and last year we spent 2.5 months in berlin.<p>In both cases we spent most of the time working a normal lifestyle %90 of the time.  After our 2.5 months in berlin we spent a couple weeks traveling as tourists (that's where the other 0.5 months went.)<p>I figure 2 weeks on either side of a relocation are not going to be productive, so might as well spend half of that time, or so, doing tourist stuff. By having such great breaks regularly, we are recharged and I think more productive when we are working.<p>The weird thing is, indoors, the only thing foreign really is the outlets... so it feels like we're still in the USA, but then you step outdoors and the language, accents and architecture are completely different.  So you can ""travel"" across the globe every day.   It is really hard to explain that feeling but it is pretty powerful.<p>-- \nTaxes & Visas-- As far as governments are concerned we're tourists.  We present ourselves this way and we get tourist visas.  However, for most visas ""tourist"" and ""business"" visas are essentially the same.  We don't work in any country in the sense that we don't have a job, we don't participate in their employment schemes. We're taxed like americans (the US taxes your income no matter where it is earned).<p>--\nAs I mentioned we're doing a startup. (We did one and we're just in the process of pivoting so what the new one is at this point is a little vague.) I don't feel out of the technology scene at all-- I have all the same connections I did before we left, except that I can't go to local unconferneces, but I didn't really get much out of them.<p>There is one conference that I miss that is done in the USA only, but we started buying the videos for it.   Spending hundreds of dollars on conference videos sounds expensive, but it is cheap compared to actually going there (Even from within the USA).  I don't really miss the networking opportunities-- and we're now networking with a real international network.  EG: we network with the locals wherever we are.<p>The technology scene really is global.<p>--\nBudget:<p>This is a big one. This inhibits a lot of people. However, if you've got an income from your work, and savings to get by in the USA, you can get buy longer when you're traveling.  Even traveling in expensive first world places like europe, right now, we're able to live on the budget we were living on in the USA.  Overall, we're actually spending a bit less, and we spend a lot less when we are living in lower cost places (even places in eastern europe, which are ""expensive"" compared to southeast asia, are cheep.)<p>So, we could have remained in the USA, and spent the same amount of money. I don't think we would have gotten any more work done, and we would have had a lot less fun.  Plus, as our product is global, better understanding of other countries helps.<p>--<p>Health insurance: We have the health insurance we had in the USA. It covers us globally.  There are specific health insurance plans that cover long term travelers and we might switch, we just haven't done so yet.<p>Neither of us are under 30, nor are we over 50.<p>--<p>Crazy?  You hear a lot of people who knock this idea.  Lots of people say ""I'd love to do that  but I've got responsibilities"" or the equivalent.<p>That's fine... just don't presume we're not doing serious work, we aren't doing a ""real"" startup or anything lie that.   These days startups often have employees spread around the globe... we don't have to carry the whole company with us.<p>I think people thinks this is harder than it is.  Or maybe for some people the idea of living out of a backpack is tough.<p>Personally, I relish the challenge!<p>Between my laptop, camera, and assorted stuff, I've got about 7 pounds of clothes etc, and 10 pounds of electronics gear.   Every time we-repack, we actually shed some unnecessary stuff. It is a process... but I love it.",1309121398.0

49,2699010,comment,2695979.0,2698561.0,2,0,kragen,,,"I thought even the Liberty ships were basically craft production, not assembly-line.  But I admit I haven't studied the story in any detail.<p>I don't think producing ten items of any design qualifies as ""mass production"".  Even at complexity levels like ten wooden barrels, at ten items, you're still trying to figure out what the causes of variation in your products are.  You are a long way from deskilling the individual tasks and doing time-and-motion analysis on them (you probably haven't even identified them yet) and you can only afford to produce the most rudimentary specialized tooling for the product.<p>So I don't think ten ships constitutes ""mass production"".<p>Wikipedia suggests that the Venetian Arsenal might have been ""mass production"" when it was producing one ship per day --- but that was with 16000 people, so that's still 45 man-years per ship.  Compare to Edison's ore processing plant (2000 tons of ore per day per employee, as compared to craft  production with 5 tons of ore per day, a factor of 400 times) or the printing press (a Bible now costs two hours of unskilled labor rather than a year of skilled labor, a factor of a few thousand) or Adam Smith's celebrated pin factory (48000 pins per day by ten men, instead of one to twenty pins per day by one man, a factor of 2400 or more).<p>If we could really mass-produce ships, then we should expect their cost to fall by a factor of 100 or more from the cost of craft production.  Everybody could have a yacht.  So far, though, mass production of ships seems to be as elusive as mass production of theorems, software, or happy marriages.<p>Coming back to the 3-D printing idea, printing a newsletter on a laser printer still costs about ten times as much as mass-producing it with a printing press.  But only about ten times as much, not a few thousand times as much.  You probably could 3-D-print workable ships out of fused quartz, although it will take a lot of work to get the necessary resilience out of such a brittle material.  You could surely do it out of fiber-reinforced concrete, as ferrocrete ships have been sailing the seas for decades.",1309120485.0

Deval Patrick (now MA mayor) was one of the key guys on this when he was at Justice, using a number of laws (including the CRA and others) to beat up banks if they didn't lend to minorities at higher risk of default. Example:<p>www.justice.gov/opa/pr/Pre_96/August94/484.txt.html<p>Google around, you can find plenty of stuff that starts using new regs around the CRA in 1993-5:<p>www.ffiec.gov/cra/letters/letter_19950629.htm<p>An analogy: the actual FD&C Act empowering the FDA hasn't changed much, but new appointees differ dramatically on how to interpret the law and which new regulations are consistent with that interpretation. Starting with Clinton and continuing through Bush and Obama, HUD, Justice, and others started to use the CRA as a tool to force banks to extend more mortgages to minorities (""anti-redlining""). Like Ness using tqx evasion to go after Capone, old laws were put to new use.<p>There really is copious documentation of all of this in Ms Morgenson's book; if you're as interested in the topic as I am, it may be worth reading even if you end up rejecting her line of argument.<p>(FWIW, National Review spent the 00s telling people about how Iraq was so important to US security. They had and have as little interest in exposing Bush's complicity in this as, say, MSNBC has in going after Obama. Morgenson is unusual in that she has penned a damning bipartisan indictment.)",1309120202.0

Basically when a company is 'new' its value proposition is unknown, it can fluctuate a lot. Once its known the value rationalizes.<p>The side point that tech stocks are suffering a general malaise because of the fear however should not be missed either. When Sun Micro was young (I started 2 weeks after it went public) I recall being annoyed that IBM (then the dominant 'computer' player) would have a bad quarter and people would sell Sun stock (and it would sink in price). While the whole time Sun was doing great business, growing really quickly, and taking money away from IBM left and right. My financial adviser and I discussed it and I got to learn about what it meant to be part of the 'data processing sector' even if you were the up and coming dominant force in that sector.<p>I agree with Ben that the pendulum is pretty hard over in the 'fear' side, hints of 'bubble' and people flee tech stocks. But solid companies get painted with the same brush just because they are part of the 'tech sector'.<p>One of the things that bolsters Ben's point is that there have not been a lot of individual investors trying to pile on to the IPOs. This is a good sign that they are standing on the sidelines.<p>If you're an investor, you might be watching the tech sector to see when the swing back to the 'greed' side starts and try to jump on and ride it over.",1309119529.0
