A comment system is on my list of features to work on.<p>I think I have been fleshing out an idea like what you are suggesting from the turtle cursor.  I would like to add a step-by-step debugging to WizBang that allows the user to watch variable values and step through each Wizzy (with it being highlighted graphically).  If I implemented that, I think it would be a great way to visualize different sorting algorithms.<p>Edit: I'm also not quite a computer scientist! College drop out! :)",1255121965.0

4,872437,comment,872283.0,872416.0,0,0,antonovka,,,"The argument encompassed two aspects of the model:<p>1) ""Threads are out -- processes are better than threads.""<p>2) Process-per-connection architectures.<p>The first is demonstrably false -- for instance, look at Erlang, which maps lightweight erlang processes to operating system threads, providing SMP scalability at a low cost without running into Github's issues with mongrel ""thread-killing"". More broadly used, look at Servlets and the Servlet 3.0 support for async comet-style event-based request handling. Each request is handled on a thread as necessary. Inter-thread communication (where necessary) is cheap, and this scales just fine.<p>If you use the fork() model and a long-running request blocks the entire process, comet is basically a non-starter. This is why people are interested (and implement) lightweight threads, coroutines, and restartable request implementations.<p>For a conceptual challenge, consider how you would implement a live web chat system that can scale up to a considerable number of clients, with extremely low resource usage, and instant message distribution (no polling). Locally, we implemented this with async servlet support and M:N scheduled scala actors -- a blocking HTTP request doesn't hold a thread or process hostage in the web server or the application, and we can scale up to enormous number of live clients on one machine.<p>The second was merely a lack of understanding of the model. In implementations where fork() is used as an alternative to   threads and multiple connections are not handled per sub-process, you quickly run into scaling issues with subprocess memory utilization. In cases where subprocesses handle multiple connections via an event mechanism, you're just using fork() instead of threads.<p>I'm wondering how many servers github is using to keep up with load -- If each 8 core 16 gigabyte (!!!) server can actually only handle 16 concurrent requests via a pool of 16 workers, that's an incredibly poor (and expensive) scaling model.",1255121868.0

This happened on a regular basis when we changed numeric code, because of the normal limitations of floating-point arithmetic; we just made sure the numerical results were accurate and updated the regression tests.  (The regression tests were quite handy for finding logic errors; they weren't really used to test numerical accuracy.)<p>But in this case I was just adding some error checks, which weren't even being triggered.  Clearly this shouldn't affect the results of our numerical calculations.  Since my code shouldn't affect the calculations, I was convinced that our existing numerical code had a subtle memory or timing bug.  (I knew that floating-point code was tricky, but clearly I was doing <i>exactly the same operations</i> on <i>exactly the same values</i>.)  I spent days staring at code, and then my boss told me to stop working on it since the results were clearly correct in both versions, even if they weren't identical.<p>A few weeks later I read about how values change when they're copied out of the x87 stack into registers.  And I thought, naw, we couldn't possibly be using x87 arithmetic.  But we were.  Which was horrifying, since floating-point calculations could be a bottleneck under some workloads.  But we had been running that way since before I started working on it, so at least it wasn't my fault.  I added a compiler option to request sse2 floating point instead of x87 floating point.

This was actually spectacular performance, since we used custom hardware to do most of the computation.  I wrote the code that interfaced with the hardware.  When the code timed out trying to talk to the hardware, the only sensible thing to do was report the error and abort the program.<p>Unfortunately, this seemed to happen quite often.  Jobs would abort randomly, after about eight hours, sometimes much less and sometimes not at all.  Overheating was the obvious first suspect, so that was investigated and ruled out.  The hardware was running cool and was in perfect working order.  The customer started splitting jobs into shorter batches and combining the results by hand.  We wrote code to help them automate this workaround.  But batches were still randomly aborting.  And I couldn't replicate the bug, despite having identical hardware to the customer.  Something in the customer's environment was essential.<p>Eventually, somebody at the customer figured out the problem.  My boss called me up and said, ""The customer suspects your code is not time-travel compliant.""  It was true.  My code assumed that time always goes forwards.  If time ever went backwards while my code was waiting for hardware, it would immediately time out and abort the batch.  And our customer encountered a bug where time <i>did</i> appear to go backwards occasionally.  I was too stressed out over other tasks to ask for details of the bug.  I just sent them a fix and breathed a sigh of relief when they accepted it.<p>A Google search now reveals that there was an issue with time going backwards under Xen on dual-core Opterons, which is what the target platform was.

Therefore the real difference between current copyright law and perpetual ownership is less than 1% of possible value.  That extra 1% is not material to people's decisions about whether to create new works, and therefore increasing the term of copyright further should lose compared to the economic value of having more material enter the public domain.
