I have beenlooking into reliable alternatives and have failed, but am totally open to suggestions!  Latest idea is to try one of the ip address databases, which claim to be relatively accurate.  However, since a user can create an account and save a location to auto-center on, I haven't tried to hard.  I'll have to update the wording around the site to steer people towards account creation so that location is saved to a profile.",1262638729.0

It's globally available with almost every interaction with other people on the site and the extensive profile information usually results in decent keyword search.  Frustratingly they don't allow you to search by specific personality traits they detect, but sorting by match score actually tends to yield more relevant results than sorting by other fields.<p>I would agree that most dating sites suck, but surprisingly it turns out one of the free ones is pretty decent.  (Being free helps deal with the limited corpus issue nicely as well.)<p>I think they solves the high-dimensional space issues by lazily evaluating match scores and caching.  I have no idea what they're doing on the backend, but I'd guess they don't actually calculate scores for all n^2 matches everytime someone answers new questions.<p>The computer science behind the site is frankly fascinating.  While the site itself doesn't take itself seriously, they seem to take the algorithms driving it very seriously.<p>The bottom line is it's worked for me.  I'm not someone who can't talk to people in person, I'm just someone who's busy and found it more efficient to meet people online.  For me what exists now is actually workable, not limiting and efficient.<p>I'm sure it could be improved, but the two problems you cite haven't been that problematic in my experience.",1262638602.0

43,1031187,comment,1030711.0,1031031.0,0,0,gjm11,,,"Well, it turns out if you look closely that usually the arms aren't exactly the same. Which is rather a clue: the coordinating mechanism isn't some kind of quantum magic that enables the structure in the centre to determine exactly what the arms are like. Rather, (1) the arms all start out roughly the same because the crystal structure of ice has 6-fold symmetry, and then (2) the way growth happens at any place and any given moment is largely determined by (a) the structure there and (b) the external conditions, which vary as the snowflake is forming because it's being blown around. But because the snowflake is quite small, those external conditions are generally much the same for all six arms; so similar arms + similar conditions for each arm --> similar incremental growth for all arms --> still-similar arms, so the symmetry is preserved as the crystal grows.

And because all six arms see the same conditions at the same times, they all grow about the same way.  The end result is a complex, branched structure that is also six-fold symmetric.

I was making simple dishes and baking cakes on my own by age 10. Likewise, my 9 year-old son is learning to cook from me. He likes helping and the look of pride on his face when I let him make up a batch of meatballs from scratch (everything except putting them in the oven) because I was busy with something else had to be seen to be believed.<p>Even something as simple as letting a child mix some ingredients helps. They learn mise en place, how to use kitchen tools properly, basic kitchen hygiene and the overriding idea that <i>everyone can cook!</i>",1262635347.0
