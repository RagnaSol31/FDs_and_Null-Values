1,842180,comment,841287.0,841941.0,0,0,btilly,,,"People did things, no doubt about it.  The wisdom of those things is another matter.  The ERA was a protectionist measure that is today cited as worsening affairs.  Reconstruction finance was a good idea, but started in 1932, after 2 years of financial disaster.  Hoover's initial responses did not take aggressive action to shore up the money supply or failing banks.<p>Of course debates on the causes of the Great Depression are endless.  Which is why I was careful to say that the Great Depression followed, but was not caused, by that action.  However many prominent economists including Milton Friedman and Ben Bernanke have concluded that the primary cause was the contraction in the money supply.<p>In their view the Federal Reserve did not act fast enough to counter the shrinking monetary supply or to prop up failing banks.  The result was multiple rounds of bank panics, the closing of over 40% of all US banks within 4 years, and (after Roosevelt came in) the declaration of a national bank holiday, and an executive order forbidding private speculation in gold.  The rapid loss of 1/3 of the money supply was both a cause and effect for the general economic disaster.<p>Whether or not you agree with this theory, understanding that Ben Bernanke believes it will help you understand why he took the actions he did last year.",1253825990.0

But in the long term as people realize that the green paper is being devalued and they are encouraged to make poor investments things will get markedly worse or at best we'll miss out on what could have been. E.g., people are building windmills and ethanol stills instead of coal plants and oil rigs because the former are subsidized and the latter increasingly regulated. Unfortunately, it's a gamble as to whether windmills will match the effort put into them and there's a growing consensus that ethanol costs more than it affords outright.<p>Think of it this way: If you put a dollar into a decent investment, you might expect a $1.10 in return. Similarly if you made a bad investment you might get $0.95 back. Now expand that to the net worth of the whole country. Depending on how well we manage our existing wealth in spite of the disincentives, it could take a long time to burn through 60 trillion dollars a nickel at a time.

If you look at his portfolio he likes to buy and hold companies.  The CEOs of the companies that he buys unanimously say that they have learned a tremendous amount from him.<p>Therefore there is strong argument for saying that he makes winners rather than buying them.  And the first big winner that he made was a textile company that he bought because he realized it was perfectly positioned to sell insurance instead.  The name of that company is Berkshire-Hathaway.<p>Buffett has another key advantage.  Many of his profitable deals are not publicly available.  For example look at the Goldman Sachs deal he did last year.  He bought $5 billion in preferred stock that pays a perpetual 10%/year, with a 5 year option for $5 billion in stock at $115/share.  They then were able to talk up his investment as a ""vote of confidence"", and he threw his weight into TARP.<p>If we assume a 5% discount rate, he spent $5 billion for $10 billion in future earnings, with a 5 year option that is potentially worth a lot more than that.  That is worthwhile even if he only thought they had a 30-40% chance of surviving.  It isn't hard to come out smelling like roses when opportunities like that get offered to you.",1253823596.0
