I phrased it poorly, my apologies.<p>Abstracting away the hierarchical file system is a positive for my mom, who can never find stuff she's saved, but I have no issues using one in the first place, so my gains are smaller.  She'll be thrilled not to have to navigate an application installer or download some component from the web to run something, but doing that is nearly effortless for me.<p>It's no loss at all to my Mom that the iPad can't run some GPL Ruby VOIP app she wrote herself, because she can't write a Ruby VOIP app.  By contrast, I would be giving up my ability to write and run my own Ruby VOIP app[1].<p>Overall, I (as a very tech literate person) benefit less from the positives and feel the pinch of the negatives more than my mom (or any less tech literate person).  It could still be a good trade for me, but I wind up looking at a totally different values proposition than my mother would.<p>[1] - I have no interest in writing a VOIP app.",1264712380.0

Talk to any company whose been around a while, consultancy or product company, and you'll hear war stories about deals gone bad.

Using libraries is important and something that should be covered in an introduction to a language.<p>My point about operator precedence is that it is clearer because it is explicit.

Then a contract gives them a spiff for it, say $250. So the store charges you $300 for the phone and makes $50 off the sale. IF you terminate the contract with t-mobile or any of these companies before your contract is up AT ANY TIME, that $250 is not paid to the store, or is deducted from what the carrier owes the store. Basically the store (like google) MUST charge you $250 or they lose more money than they made off of your sale.<p>This is why the little cellphone stores make you sign similar agreements.

OLPC is meant to spark an interest in computers and teach people in third-world countries how to program so that they can deploy that skill to bootstrap themselves out of poverty. The ability to uncover complexity is therefore fundamental to the OLPC, and its design hints toward it.<p>iPad is for people who are content to use Facebook.",1264709050.0

Until you've used the iPhone keyboard for a significant length of time, how can you claim that you don't like it?<p>I don't know anyone that would claim that the iPhone has a great keyboard or would want to do any lengthy typing on it.  By and large though, people I know think that it's 'better than expected'.<p>Perhaps with the larger size of the iPad, it might work well for a keyboard.  I'm still not typing for hours on it, but for emails or notes during a meeting, it might work just fine.",1264708936.0

Where were all these people when Sony brought out the PS3? or when Microsoft brought out the Xbox? How about the Wii? DS? PSP? Amazon Kindle? Nook? All of these are <i>specialized</i> computing devices. All of them are officially ""closed"" (though a great many are hackable). The fact that those systems are closed dosen't threaten mainstream general purpose computers. Why should the iPad? It's a device built for a specific purpose: consuming entertainment and media content as well as some work-related tasks like email and word processing.",1264708817.0
