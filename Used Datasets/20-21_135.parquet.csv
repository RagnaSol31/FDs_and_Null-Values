It's critical that any web designer knows enough about HTML/CSS to know the limitations of the medium and what they can design but not necessarily enough to code it.<p>I think ideally, both the designer and frontend developer should be capable of slicing up a PSD. I'm a frontend developer, and I prefer to do that myself so I can save things in the optimal sizes and filetypes for my workflow. If the designer does it, they will be creating slices based on their opinion of how the website should be coded.<p>I don't think the responsibility for JavaScript is a gray area at all, it falls on the developer. It becomes a gray area when you remove one of the pieces of the  puzzle, the frontend developer.<p>I also don't think your photographer analogy is fair. A photographers job can be defined as a person who takes photos. A designers job is most often defined as someone who creates designs.<p>It sounds like you're more of a backend developer, wanting to use a designer as a designer and frontend developer.

The <i>appellation d'origine contrle</i> is not an indicator of quality, but a sort of family (both in taste and location of production, and named after the regional location, because it has a critical influence on flavor) which gets assessed by professionals so you can identify wines without actually opening the bottle. If I'm at the store and I see a Haut-Mdoc, I have some high probability of liking it more compared to a Mdoc, because I like tannic wines, and Haut-Mdoc show more of a bias towards tannin. That does not mean that one is of higher standard (and there are some Haut-Mdoc which actually taste like crap).<p>What might create a link with quality is that some flavors are quite strong and can take time to get used to, combined with subtle tones, and may require some technique to appreciate. You start with very raw, basic wines, then you grow up an ability to appreciate the more subtle ones, like you would go from appreciating child paintings and grow on to like Matisse.<p>Then there is each one's unique taste: there are some very tasteful Sauterne wines, but I absolutely loathe sweet wines, so I can't for the life of me come anywhere near drinking them.",1320006477.0

An ordinary genius is a fellow that you and I would be just as good as, if we were only many times better. There is no mystery as to how his mind works. Once we understand what he has done, we feel certain that we, too, could have done it. It is different with the magicians. They are, to use mathematical jargon, in the orthogonal complement of where we are and the working of their minds is for all intents and purposes incomprehensible. Even after we understand what they have done, the process by which they have done it is completely dark. They seldom, if ever, have students because they cannot be emulated and it must be terribly frustrating for a brilliant young mind to cope with the mysterious ways in which the magicians mind works.

I was the kid who had a really bad life growing up, had friends who chose a very wrong path and read three newspapers everyday attempting to either find answer to the pain in the world or to look at a different journalist's critique of the situation in the hope of finding something positive. I concentrated on every single tragedy I was aware of because I wanted to save them but I could not. Heck, even to this day, I still care about every single life on this earth.<p>At some point you learn not to cry to about what happens. It begins to wear you down. I no longer read the news because I no longer want the negativity. As always, if I can change things along the way I do so. But I'm willing to bet many of you do not.<p>To cry about everything is a child's notion. Adults are not afforded that option.",1320005036.0

A YC S11 founder made it clear to me that YC could help us to fix our communication problems before they became problems, and only then did I apply.  He said YC could help us learn how to communicate to three audiences:  investors, the press, and customers.  I give us a F, F, and C- for those respective audiences.
