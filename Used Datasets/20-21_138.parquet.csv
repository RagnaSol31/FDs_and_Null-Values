Prices depends on supply and demand: if you reduce the supply of something and hold demand constant or increase it, that thing becomes valuable.

Engineers by their nature, tend to focus on the first and neglect the latter. There are some great book on the artistic side, but I particularly ""Vision and Voice: Refining Your Vision in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom"" by David duChemin[1]. This is most definitely not a book about Lightroom but rather about your artistic intent which starts when you first think of the shot and how you carry that ""vision"" through to Lightroom and express with your post-processing ""voice"". The discussion are priceless and it works as a book even if you don't use Lightroom.

26,3280651,comment,3280498.0,3280498.0,20,0,oldstrangers,,,"I trained in traditional film photography for 8 years, worked in a darkroom and developed my own film. The 'technical' details that make a photo ""text-book-correct"" were some of the first things we learned. It was a given that you knew how to properly shoot a photo (and in our case, how to properly develop, enlarge, print, etc). This was the foundation for potentially creating something more than just a snapshot. You only ever really noticed these details when someone got it wrong.<p>With that said, after about the 2nd year, it became increasingly clear that once you knew what you were doing, you had almost no incentive to continue doing things ""correctly."" Critiques at the higher levels became increasingly abstract. It was understood that you could shoot a ""technically correct"" photo. No one needed to see that from you again, perhaps ever. You master the basics and you're suddenly let in on a secret that the basics don't really matter (at least in an artistic/scholastic context).<p>However, I can see why the engineer type would be attracted to the technical part of photography. It is a fun and rewarding endeavor to create things correctly, and not everyone wants to be an artist. Working in a darkroom is extremely rewarding in a technical sense because it rewards those who do things correctly and punishes those who don't. Ultimately, there are all kinds of reasons to fall in love with photography, and those reasons don't need to correspond with mine or anyone elses.",1322340468.0

Coding is the process to getting desired output, which can be totally abstracted out for most common tasks. Look at ruby on rails, It hugely reduces all the mundane tasks that programmers needed to do.<p>If programmers care about DRY principle, they won't design yet another shopping cart.<p>Look at google forms, Its so easy anybody can do it without knowing to code, imagine coding a form with same complexity within the time it takes to set it up.

They tried to keep local fiscal policy and yet somehow together have a unified monetary policy. That's the kind of problem that's blatantly obvious from day one. What happened was a series of complexities that were added to these systems of governance that obscured this underlying reality. This trend looks to continue, with more and more schemes using more and more complex policies and products. It doesn't look so good.<p>Of course, I'm just relating what I've been reading. I can tell you it's been quite alarming and yet strangely placid. Like watching a slow-motion train wreck.<p>I didn't mean the number of people. I meant the idea of smashing up lots of different systems of government and cultures through byzantine layers of bureaucracy instead of just replacing them with a centralized government (which would have worked very well, probably, but it was politically unfeasible)",1322337647.0
