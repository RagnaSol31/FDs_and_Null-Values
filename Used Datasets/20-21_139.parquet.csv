I at least think that every extension Mozilla is currently encouraging use of is hoped to be a potential future standard.  (And no, I'm not claiming this is unique -- some other vendors like Google are also good citizens in this regard.)<p>I also agree that proprietary platforms are hurting the web, and that the web needs new abilities in order to fight the threat.  However, to preserve the openness of the web, new features need to be things that more than one vendor has the resources and motivation to implement; even if Mozilla and Opera thought Dart or Pepper were great ideas, adopting them would put is on a treadmill where Google (with its much greater resources) controls the speed.<p>And no, I am <i>not</i> claiming that Apple/Mozilla/Opera would have adopted Dart or NaCL if they were brought before the right committee at the right time.  Part of getting early feedback means finding out if the community even thinks that your solution is something that's desired in the first place.<p><i>""When Mozilla developed Rust, the first time most of the web heard of it was Graydon dumping a gigantic codebomb into GitHub and it being covered on Lambda-the-Ultimate.""</i><p>This is actually an interesting contrast between Mozilla and Google.  The initial Rust code-dump was a barely-running proof-of-concept; it was shared with the world on the same day it was first shared within the Mozilla community.  Zero lines of the current self-hosted compiler were written at the time.  Most of the planned features (like the task system) were unimplemented.  The first actual release (Rust 0.1 alpha) came a year and a half later, and that first release already reflected significant community feedback and contributions.  For example, the packaging system in Rust 0.1 was written by a volunteer contributor who happens to be a Google employee.  The stage of maturity at which Rust became open source was far earlier than Go.<p>Some things really are different at a non-profit like Mozilla, and the goal of opening everything up as early as possible is one thing that's unique among tech companies I've worked for or with.  We don't always do it perfectly, and we do struggle with the need for people to do some types of design and experimentation without the world looking over their shoulders, but it's very much a unique core principle that affects all of our work.",1328992709.0

I know I am going to get down-voted to kingdom come but I think Java is a better language for big projects mostly because of the static typing (try renaming a class in Python compared to Java).<p>Modern Java is for sure more verbose than Python and more complicated but the languages are extremely similar (Guido has even take some of the design consistency from Java for Python 3.0).<p>The reason I bring it up is Java is very often in various circles crapped on to no end. The reality its basically just more verbose Python. Not to mention Java offers an introduction to Parametric/algebraic typing (generics) and more sophisticated concurrency (futures ... yes actors are better but python really has neither).",1328992200.0

He even made a book on how to work around those, called ""Javascript, the good parts"".<p><i>People always bring up var for some reason. Why var? Why not closures? Javascript is often the first place programmers come across this concept and it always causes confusion and bugs at first. Should we get rid of them?

Copyright is a means, not an end, and utilitarianism is about ends. Specifically, it's about increasing the total amount of happiness among people. Which isn't so different from the public policy approach, which is about improving society as a whole.<p>Neither of these systems hinges on the existence of a copyright system, and even if they did, there are many many ways to <i>implement</i> a copyright system. Certainly, you can't say  I would argue that the system as it exists today flies in the face of both approaches. To understand why, it's necessary to understand the history of copyright. Both copyright and patents<p>Both patents and copyright were justified in a single clause of the constitution for the following purpose (and this quote comes directly from Congress in 1988):<p><pre><code>  ""Under the U. S. Constitution, the primary objective of copyright\n  law is not to reward the author, but rather to secure for the public\n  the benefits derived from the authors' labors. By giving authors an\n  incentive to create, the public benefits in two ways: when the original\n  expression is created and ... when the limited term ... expires and the\n  creation is added to the public domain.""\n</code></pre>\nOr, if a quote from 1988 isn't interesting enough, let's look at a quote form the court in 1829, a date much closer to the initial creation of the Constitution:<p><pre><code>  ""While one great object was, by holding out a reasonable reward to\n  inventors, and giving them an exclusive right to their inventions for \n  a limited period, to stimulate the efforts of genius; the main object \n  was `to promote the progress of science and useful arts;' and this \n  could be done best, by giving the public at large a right to make, \n  construct, use, and vend the thing invented, at as early a period as \n  possible, having a due regard to the rights of the inventor. If an \n  inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the \n  public the secrets of his invention; if he should for a long period \n  of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, \n  and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill \n  and knowledge of the structure; and then, and then only, when the danger \n  of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should\n  be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any\n  farther use than what should be derived under it during his fourteen\n  years; it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful\n  arts, and give a premium to those, who should be least prompt to\n  communicate their discoveries.""\n</code></pre>\nThis is about as utilitarian as it gets. The entire purpose is to help the public, the populace, society <i>in general</i>. Allowing for the perpetual monopoly of ideas, language, and art would be a crime against free speech and <i>harm</i> society. However, failing to protect it at all would provide 0 incentive for artists to create new work. So the most utilitarian balance is to grant protection to artists ONLY if they go through the copyright system, which would soon force their works into the public domain.<p>What we have today is an extreme perversion of this system. The content industries have become the very monopolies we sought to prevent. Copyright was originally 14-28 years maximum, but the content industries have successfully petitioned Congress to extend that to the <i>entire</i> lifetime of the author PLUS 70 years. And why not? They profit tremendously by doing this. But it doesn't help authors (who are usually long-dead), it doesn't incentivize the creation of new work, and it completely fucks over the public.",1328990555.0
