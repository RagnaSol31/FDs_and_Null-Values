And I am very much wishing the venture success. I think that NLIs eventually will become a dominant interface solution for many tasks, search included. I look forward to looking into what you guys have.<p>BTW are you doing anything in domain specific search? Feel free to reply at mjm@anaphoric.com or mjm@cs.umu.se.<p>Regards,\nMM\n",1192308929.0

7,67432,comment,67349.0,67422.0,0,0,anaphoric,,,"Honestly it may be somewhat heretical to say it, but I doubt very seriously that an old Xerox patent really has so much relevance. <p>The academic community has been working with semantic indexes for quite some time. I know many of those involved. The real question is whether they have developed something fundamental recently.<p>As for performance, yes perhaps they have some innovations. But with NLIs its usability that matters the most in the end. <p>At a more technical level I think the question is how expressive/consistent is the logical form they are mapping too. If they have developed a parser that maps to an LF that can lead to actual inferece then that would mean something.\nBut then they need an open domain strategy to actually reason over such expressions in a meaningful/useful way. We will see.",1192307741.0

What most people miss is that PARC had many deadwood/unsuccessful projects (and people and worthless papers ) in its time. <p>I know nothing about what exactly PARC licensed to Powerset, but without more data, I wouldn't automatically assume that it provides an edge.

13,67425,comment,67405.0,67405.0,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Well, there is a big difference between poking around in CSS and creating a design for the actual site. On the other hand basic programming is not really complicated especially if you are technically inclined and are willing to learn. You'll probably have to leave the heavy lifting sooner or later to experienced developers but I would recommend learning to do some code yourselves. Getting developers this early on will usually cost you either money (which you might not have) or a ton of equity. <p>I would personally recommend picking up some Python and maybe Pylons and start hacking some webapps (others might recommend Ruby and Rails, etc).

19,67419,comment,67305.0,67305.0,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This is quite a brilliant little idea.  A couple of years ago I was involved in a newspaper project (Boston.com) that used Squid with ESI to build the page from disparate Zope backend servers, and it resolved quite a lot of problems--like being able to have a fast and database-less server in the front that could make decisions about which backend servers to draw from based on the required content.  The backend servers then didn't need full copies of the database, because they would only ever be asked for content they were authoritative for.<p>DBSlayer takes the web server and the proxy server out of the picture, and puts the site building burden (to some degree) on the client.  It could, theoretically, also make decisions about which database to query, such that the memory caches on the database servers will always be primed with the content that the database is authoritative for.<p>The comments so far seem concerned about security...but DBSlayer wouldn't need write access, or access to all tables.  It could simply be a read-only window into some tables.  I guess that's a foreign notion to folks who do everything in one process, which has to have write access...but it's one of the aspects of proper databases that makes them useful in large scale deployments.\n",1192306817.0

That ""nearly constant 10mph breeze"" is improving fuel efficiency for the cars behind you through reduced wind resistance.\n3. A similar idea for generating power from traffic is through the use of speed bumps as power generators. But that doesn't work either.

The INS likes to look at things you've done in the past (entering the country for pleasure) and argue that you had certain intentions at the time (starting a business, which they could deduce from the fact that you're still in the country and now applying for a visa).

Google has some incredible people working on search.<p>\n A couple of years ago, when the Yahoo vs Google war for search dominance was at its peak, I asked a friend of mine who worked at Yahoo, ""Who is your equivalent of Peter Norvig?
