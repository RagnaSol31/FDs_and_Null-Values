Cappuccino Rocks Da House!!! :-)"" is closer to ""leet speak, fanboi terms, and first post claims"" in general than it is to contributing to the discussion.<p>Why is being told that your post is not contributing considered ""punishment""?  There's only a single axis for people to express their vote on, and thus that's the only effective way to communicate that someone thinks something isn't contributing.  Downvoting is not a personal attack (shouldn't be used as such and shouldn't be interpreted as such), but the belief is that it sufficiently sends a message that such content isn't wanted, for whatever reason (the fact that no reason is supplied is a deficiency in the system itself, having only one axis, not in the use of down votes).",1242853179.0

It's not actually fully 5-dimensional... each 'dimension' has only 2 or 3 states.  The first 2 dimensions are limited by the size of your media.  The third dimension is based on your laser focal plane resolution (think 'depth perception' in a way) and is currently limited to two layers in optical discs.  The there's the color (in this example, 3 colors) and polarization (here, 2 orientations).  So it's 12 times more dense than current mainstream technology, with the added benefit of a tighter placement of data on in the plane.<p>The disruptive technology here is really the use of nanoparticle gold instead of etched polystyrene, and the fact that there is the polarization element.  Unfortunately these points are kind of glossed over and lost in the fancy media mumbo-jumbo.",1242853114.0

People who think that the poor are lazy and shiftless are scum.<p>Some of the poor maybe be lazy and shiftless, but having middle class / wealthy parents doesn't just give you money and education and health -- it also gives you the very habits and abilities (saving, studying, deferring rewards, working hard, etc) that keep people from being poor or staying poor.  Even things like applying to college are different if you have parents who can help guide you through the process -- I read a heartrending account of a (poor) child who got a scholarship to go to a private high school but his parents couldn't afford the transportation and he didn't have the institutional knowledge to know that if they'd told the school that, the school would have helped.  So he declined a great education for the lack of $400.<p>Growing up middle or upper class also gives you all the social markers people look for -- whether it's straight, clean teeth, the ability (and skill) to dress appropriately for a variety of social situations, the proper manners to eat in a range of restaurants from a greasy spoon to a 3 star Michelin, a good suit to go to interviews, acne medication so you don't have acne scars, the ability to make small conversation about art, etc.  If you read the literature, most Americans drastically overestimate the social mobility of America and are shocked when they hear how very heritable wealth is.",1242852940.0

I pay more than that, in time and gasoline, every time I check a book out from the library.<p>Just driving to the library or the post office, spending 10 minutes, then driving back is a 30-minute commitment for me. If my time is worth $20 per hour, that's $10 right there, not counting the cost of gas or the odds that the book I want isn't available. Unless I'm very diligent about checking out books in large batches (and how many books can I really read before my three weeks is up and they become due at the library?) I might be saving money with a Kindle [1], even if each book self-destructed, Mission-Impossible style, three months after I paid $10 for it. Which they don't.<p>I am an old-school book collector; it runs in my family. And, yet, when I look at my shelves I dream of actually owning fewer of them. The world has changed. Amazon and Abebooks exist now. By this point, very few of my books are sufficiently precious and sufficiently likely to go out of print that I need to physically hoard them myself -- such books do exist, but they're much fewer in number, perhaps no more than a single bookshelf's worth.<p>Yeah, I guess the apocalypse could wipe out Amazon and Abebooks, or the copyright Gestapo could create some kind of digital Fahrenheit 451. But, really, what are the odds? To worry too much about that is like hoarding beer because Prohibition might come back. I'm literally more worried about my house burning down.<p>I'll worry when we reach the point that important books are routinely published in electronic form <i>alone</i>, with no paper copies <i>anywhere</i>. But I don't think that will ever happen. Indeed, the preservation of archival versions might become an even more significant <i>raison d'etre</i> for paper publishers -- we really need <i>more</i> archives, and more librarians and editors, to select, print out, and preserve all the great blog posts and HN comments that will otherwise be lost to linkrot, or buried in spam and rendered unfindable, within my lifetime.<p>I still love libraries. Shelves of books make me happy. But that thrill is not what it once was. Because it was the exciting feeling of knowing that you were surrounded by the work of centuries of scholars, that the world's knowledge was within reach. And that's true all the time now. I live in a library 24/7. I have to take special measures, like hiking out of cellular range, to <i>escape</i> that feeling of being surrounded by knowledge. I could sit here in this chair for the rest of my life and never run out of interesting things to read, watch, or listen to, so long as someone keeps paying the Comcast bill.<p>---<p>[1] Ignoring the cost of buying the Kindle in the first place, of course.",1242852645.0

Nobody dealing with a daily flow of business data actually falls behind and ends up making decisions on older and older data because processing is backed up.

If seismic data gathered this morning were processed and available for inspection late this afternoon, that would be ""real-time.""  If an MRI was performed this morning, and the image wasn't available until this afternoon, that would not be ""real-time.""  It's a mooshy term -- it has meaning in a specific domain, relative to human expectations in that domain.  In the article, outside any specific domain, it doesn't mean anything.<p><i>""a succession of data elements made available over time"" and stream processing as ""the quasi-continuous flow of data which is processed in...</i><p>Basically automated batch processing where the ""chunkiness"" lies beneath a certain threshold of perception.<p><i>While ""real-time"" and ""stream"" are too frequently used as buzzwords these days, IBM is actually using them correctly in this case.</i><p>How can you tell?
