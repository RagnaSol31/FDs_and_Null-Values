In most other countries in the world there is a separate area code for mobile phones.  Calling a mobile phone area code is considerably more expensive than calling a land line (for the caller).  To get an idea of the difference lookup rates for any international calling card.  For example the first one I found charges 1c per minute to UK landlines and 5c per minute to UK cellular.  For many countries there is a 1:10 difference in cost.<p>So now we have established that calls involving a cellular endpoint are more expensive virtually everywhere.  In places that have a separate area code for cells it will be the caller paying the additional cost.<p>In the US (and elsewhere participating in the North American Numbering Plan) it would be virtually impossible to allocate new area codes, so there is no way of knowing the recipient is a cellular phone.  The only practical way of dealing with this is to make the recipient pay the extra which is exactly what happens.  But someone is always paying!  And a lot of people don't mind this, especially when mobile service was new.  If you were a plumber on the go you didn't want people to think about calling a competitor on a landline while you had a cell because it was more expensive.  Having all calls cost the same significantly reduces friction for people who want to communicate.<p>Because the recipient is paying for incoming calls and that person is making the purchase of the incoming minutes there is very strong pricing competition.  Incoming and outgoing minutes are relatively very cheap in the US.  So much so that the carriers have to nickel and dime people on everything else in order to make up the necessary ARPU.",1324155068.0

Every time someone says the following about her philosophy I know he has not read her books and only heard things second hand from other people: greed, selfishness (in a bad way), and having no pity for humanity.<p>You have to understand that Ayn Rand came from soviet Russia her whole philosophy is exactly the opposite, it surrounds it self with the question: How to make humanity survive longer, and what was the root of all evil until now?\nAnd her answers are:\n1. Scientists, business men, engineers, artists, doctors, etc basically men of ability are the ones who moved society a step further and made us live longer and better.<p>2. ""These"" people of ability were driven partially by the profit motive, and don't take this in a negative way, all it means is it's been proven that when ""profit"" is taken out of the equation usually these men of ability produce a lot less. Compare free democratic countries like the US and look at the inventions we produced compare to non free countries where your inventions are owned by the GOVERNMENT. Look at Silicon Valley why do we invent so much, why are soo many engineers here? because we are free to do and profit as we please, it's not greed and NO it's not wall street. Wall Street is not an example of a free market at all, it is a corrupt system that is so regulated and connected to the government that it CANT fail this is not an example of something that Ayn Rand will approve or any capitalist.<p>3. Religion, Communism and altruism basically the whole idea that one man is not as valuable as the whole society or god has led to many deaths and wars, because if you can and justify sacrificing one person for the ""good of humanity"" whats to hold you back from killing another million or 2? therefore she sees people as individuals which gives more meaning to each person.<p>So when she mentions selfishness she means HAVING A SELF, having a brain, thinking for your self and not letting the government or some brute tell you your owned by him and your life is meaningless. She does not mean selfishness like most people use the term, a guy that has no heart and is an asshole.<p>Anyways I perfectly understand why people hate her she is an atheist philosopher who champions the individual, praises less government which goes against almost every philosopher out there. This is why a lot of people hate her, all I ask of people is to stop judging her second hand read her stuff and then judge.",1324154981.0

Now in regards to this ad...<p>Micromanagement - To me this reeks of micromanagement.  Firstly they depict an environment where you seemingly have a step by step plan as to how you need to go about your day.  They even have a culture to manage and work you during your lunch break... ""we all eat together; this is another opportunity to keep up to date on what is happening outside your team"".  Also, the ""talking to a pre-schooler"" tone of the ad doesn't help either - saying thing like ""grab your buddy"" are not how you address a professional.<p>Long hours - So at lunch you essentially are at a work meeting with food and then at 7 you have dinner which based upon how lunch goes is probably also a work meeting.  And not only that when a company serves you dinner it usually is because they are expecting that you are staying to do some work later.  So just by the ad you have no real breaks and are working 9-8 (11 hours) and probably more after dinner.<p>Now I'm not trying to say you are wrong - just the way that I personally interpret this, it epitomizes many of the things wrong with many tech companies.  I'm glad that they are upfront though - most employers mention this kind of stuff after you've taken the offer.",1324154958.0

They don't patch it very much and leave it mostly vanilla, focussing their work on system integration instead of modifying to differenciate their offering. That's reflected in the work they've contributed upstream, like PolicyKit support or PackageKit integration for widget installation in the desktop shell (for automatic dependency installation).

I get exactly the same editing system no matter where I'm logged in, and instead of hiding connection problems somewhere that you can't control, it's very clear what will happen when a disconnection occurs.<p>Of course, if it's across a local or very reliable network, all of my arguments disappear and sshfs is an excellent tool.",1324152685.0

Every one of them, from Willie Mosconi's book of the 1940s to the very latest, will tell you that you should stroke the cue forward and back along a straight path, as if it were running in a groove, avoiding swerves, which will be difficult to control. You should particularly avoid swerving your cue and hand during the final delivery and follow-through.<p>But there are a few rare and precious films of Willie Hoppe, possibly the greatest billiards player of all time, who won fifty-one world titles at a time when billiards was one of the most popular sports in America and was played in every U.S. city by every gentleman of taste. Check out Willie Hoppe's billiard stroke, starting at about 1:10 in this YouTube video:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQynRebhP1Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQynRebhP1Y</a><p>From this evidence, it would appear that Willie Hoppe ruled the world of billiards with the worst stroke ever known to man. His cue literally skews through a ten-degree angle between the start of his delivery and the end, and his hand twists too. Wikipedia sheds some light on this:<p><i>Hoppe's peculiar style of stroke was a result of his career as a child prodigy. He barely reached the table and had to stand on a box. In [his book] Hoppe emphatically advised players not to use his way of directing the cue.</i><p>The moral of this story is that grandmasters will take lousy tools and build amazing things, because they are grandmasters.
