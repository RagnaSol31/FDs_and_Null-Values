They are not in business to be martyrs for a cause or to take unnecessary risks unrelated to their core business goals.<p>2. This piece correctly points out that the media cannot be subjected to prior restraints in publishing protectable speech. However, the 1971 <i>New York Times</i> (Pentagon Papers) case left open the obvious possibility that they might be prosecuted criminally after-the-fact and the law is such today that the sort of activity engaged in by WikiLeaks may readily be punishable as a crime (the thorny issues associated with this are nicely discussed in this even-handed piece from Slate: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2276592/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/id/2276592/</a>).<p>3. The furor surrounding WikiLeaks does not begin and end with one senator. The Justice Department, the Pentagon, and the Obama administration generally have indicated that they desire to find a way to punish this conduct if possible and are actively investigating ways to do so. This is not to mention that the overwhelming majority of politicians of all stripes have condemned it. Now, whether they are right or wrong, protectors of the country or boneheads out to suppress civil liberties, this has the <i>feel</i> of a lynching about to happen. And even those who vigorously support WikiLeaks must concur that they are operating in and about the edges of the law. Yes, there may be no violation of the 1917 Espionage Act occurring because the motives of Mr. Assange do not meet the statutory test for a criminal act, and, yes, the Act may not technically apply to the activity here, and, yes, the Act may be unconstitutional if tested all the way up to the Supreme Court in this sort of case, . . . <i>but</i> why would you want your company to be part of the <i>test case</i>? (My guess is that many of the principals behind Amazon, PayPal, etc. actually find themselves in sympathy with the spirit of WikiLeaks but that they are not allowing any such sympathies to color their business decisions). I would sum this point up by saying that mainstream companies do <i>not</i> want to find themselves aligned with high-profile situations skirting the edge of the law. Call it ""turning tail"" but I don't know very many responsible executives who would decide the issue differently (strictly from a <i>business</i> point of view).<p>4. Regardless of business factors, it does look bad for these businesses to be caving to political pressure. They can technically justify their actions on grounds that the WikiLeaks activities may violate their terms of service (whether or not they are in fact criminal, if the highest criminal enforcement authorities in the nation are on a concerted campaign to determine that they are, the service provider is in no position to second guess this). In spite of this, the appearance <i>is</i> one of caving on a point where the provider could, if it elected, choose to stand its ground in favor of principle. Thus, whatever the reality, it certainly looks cowardly.<p>Ergo, a no-win situation for these service providers. I know many in the HN community are outraged over their actions but I think the case is more complex than typically assumed.",1291495235.0

SBCL and other lisp compilers read a source file and produce native code which is then executed.  If certain dynamic features are not executed, then the compiler (also part of the runtime in much the same way as libc is part of a C executable) is not invoked at runtime.  If dynamic features are needed, then the expression is eval'ed by compiling it to native code and executing it.  This is lighter and more powerful (for language reasons) than spawning a process to invoke a C compiler that produces a shared library which is dlopen'd on the spot, but I claim it is a closer analogy to what is happening than a JIT.<p>In summary, I submit that (i) Python eval is no more dynamic than Lisp eval and (ii) it is acceptable to use the term ""statically compiled"" even if the standard library includes ""compile"".",1291494592.0

In 1996 it was all FDDI and HSSI ports, which were an order of magnitude more expensive than GigE equipment is these days.<p>There is very much a precedent for the scenario you describe: Comcast has direct peering agreements with Google. While I can't presume to know if it's settlement-free, I'm almost certain it is. Google's business model, especially YouTube, depends on it.<p>Your conclusion is a little off kilter. Peering is cheap because they do these types of interconnects in these carrier hotels, and as we all know, running a Cat5 cable through a building is cheap. However, space in these carrier hotels is absurdly expensive because of the demand. This is fine if you just have a few racks of equipment and ship all the packets out over WAN links to your datacenters, which is pretty much the status quo. Not just any average joe is going to be able to setup shop in these places.<p>YC companies pay for bandwidth because it's cheaper to do that then it is to build out a network. It's the same reason they don't build datacenters, own office space, etc. Most don't even own or operate dedicated servers anymore. Peering works at certain levels of network scale, but below that, somewhat pointless from a business/financial perspective.<p>Check out SoftLayer's peering page: <a href=""http://www.softlayer.com/network/peering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.softlayer.com/network/peering</a> If peering was as expensive and as uncommon as Comcast claims, why would SoftLayer need a special page for it?",1291494193.0

But progress has gone into reverse over the last year, to the point that I've been trying to spot which competitor will disrupt it. Of course, I have no idea what weighting is given to the various coefficients, but the ones revealed at this talk seem entirely consistent with the cruft I see on my news page.<p><i>Volume and originality of content produced consistently about a topic.</i><p>This would explain why I see so many blogs, one-note websites, and even press releases from lobbying groups or those obsessed with a particular topic. It works OK for broad categories like 'Business' or 'Sport' but allows niche subjects to be gamed easily.<p>You know the most annoying one that keeps coming up? I have a search for 'legal' because I'm interested in news about the legal industry, major court cases and suchlike. 20-30% of stories in my daily news feed about about how someone arrested for drunk driving had 3-4x the legal limit of alcohol in his bloodstream. Not anyone famous, it's just an easy story for local newspapers - 'you won't believe how drunk this guy was!' Well yes I would believe it, because I get this story several times a week.<p><i>Links around the Web.</i><p>Content/policy affiliates networks defeat this easily. I just game up and removed my political news feed a few months ago because both left and right bloggers seem determined to live in an echo chamber of ideological allies, and quote endlessly from each other to drown out any other perspectives. The same thing happens with non-ideological topics that have a strong overlap with large commercial markets; instead of news about health and medicine, I often get information about new services available under medicare that are thinly disguised plugs for commercial products aimed at the elderly, such as mobility scooters. Health & wellness is as favorite topic of content farmers since readers and searchers of these topics are usually highly motivated to learn as much as possible.<p><i>What users do in response to links to that source on Google News.</i><p>To the point where sometimes I prefer not to click on a story, but open up an incognito tab in Chrome and retype the headline to read the story. Earlier this year, I clicked on two stories within the same week, referring to lawsuits involving sports injuries. Although I like my local baseball team, I really don't care for sports in general, and even less for sports writing. I have Google News configured not to show me any sports stories. For months after reading the two articles mentioned above, I kept getting stories about pro football players in my 'top stories' news feed - who was being traded, how well they played, who they're having affairs with, and what-all else. I'd select 'fewer stories from ESPN' if it was a sports-centric website, but WTF. I'm OK with seeing things like who won a major championship or somebody famous getting arrested, but those sort of things are relatively rare.<p>I know I'm not the typical news consumer and frankly I'm not 'where the money is' from Google's perspective, or that of the media in general.

The founder can't take it and buy a car (or a wedding). This seems reasonable. The founder is hungry. So are hundreds of thousands of homeless people.,1291493203.0

Really, there isn't an interpreter/compiler dichotomy, they are just variations on a theme. Or, standard definitions of them are variations on a theme, but often the line between them is very blurred (especially when just-in-time compilers come into it).<p>People typically consider 'compiler' to mean 'static compiler'. It generates native code into an executable, and then the 'program' is the executable. Lisp compilers are clearly very different to this, but GCC falls clean into it.<p>So it's wrong of you to allege that ""you don't need an interpreter"". You need a run-time component. Sure, this can be a compiler, rather than an interpreter, but its wrong to imply that you can support eval() simply with a static compiler such as gcc.",1291493110.0

I don't think Rackspace killed the Quran-burning site because of government pressure, for example; and that situation seems fairly similar to this one. It might be that in this case the reason it was ""controversial content"" was pressure from the government, but it's not clear to me that Amazon wouldn't have done the same thing for different kinds of controversial content where the pressure came from, say, Oprah, rather than the government.<p>What if anything to do about <i>that</i> situation is trickier, which I guess is one reason for the EFF to frame it the other way. If indeed it was explicitly government pressure behind the scenes that caused Amazon's decision, then the analysis isn't nearly as tricky, because it's just government censorship, so what the EFF should do about it is obvious (oppose censorship, like they always do).",1291492869.0
