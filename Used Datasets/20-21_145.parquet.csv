This doesn't mean the world falls apart if kids aren't watching videos at home. As @rubergly says, computers in the classroom allow for individualized instruction and solid data, which humanizes the kids' experience by helping teachers address individual needs.<p>2) On the school front -- there are lots of ideas floating around when thinking about the future, but I can assure you that our primary focus is exactly what it says on the website: ""providing a free world-class education to anyone anywhere.""",1313355560.0

In other words, it wasn't so much that an idea itself was big, but that most people didn't have alternative sources of information and therefore were ripe material for absorbing the given idea. Totalitarianism thrived on persuading people through clever control of the (new at the time) mass-media channels to believe into this or that idea.<p>> nationalism isn't a big idea in the same sense that communism or western democracy are.<p>You are equating ""big"" with ""well-intentioned,"" which I believe are different things. There can be no doubt that nationalist ideas had a major impact on modernity, from Nazism to Balkans to post-colonialism. Regarding tribalism, it can take many forms, not just nationalism. One of the channels which the early USSR used to spread communist ideas was precisely tribalism. Russians were imagined as good and communitarian ""by-nature"" while people from Western countries were portrayed as more mean-spirited and selfish.",1313355163.0

17,2884416,comment,2882356.0,2883470.0,1,0,rubergly,,,"The current model is that 20-30 kids who want to be moving around and interacting with each other are forced into seats and restricted from moving for hours while teachers talk at them until they get distracted and zone out the teacher to think about other things. And then they go home with an assignment to complete which they may or may not do depending on how motivated they are. When Khan Academy flips this, they make much better use of the situation. There's no reason for everyone to be lectured at together, but there's every reason to allow students to interact and work together while solving problems. There's very little motivation to go home and complete a rigorous assignment when you can be playing outside or watching TV, but watching a couple 10-20 minute videos is enjoyable and completely digestible.<p>Personally, I believe that the act of working through problems is often more important to learning and development than watching or listening to lectures explaining how to work through problems. If a student's conditions at home are so unstable that they cannot concentrate on watching a single video, then they are clearly never going to be able to put a reasonable amount of effort into homework assignments in the normal education system. I would rather they fail to watch Khan videos at home and interact and explore exercises in class than listen to lectures in class every day but never put those skills into practice because they fail to do homework at home. However, yes, availability of computers at home is an issue. It would be great if Khan Academy were the cure-all for education and would be perfect for everyone, but this is never what has been claimed; unfortunately, for the time being, Khan Academy is not a viable solution for those without computer access.<p>I'm not sure if the phrasing of <i>drilling exercises</i> was supposed to imply something negative, but the goal of KA's exercises is not to drill students on a question until they can answer it as quickly as possible (this is what I think of when I think of a drill). The goal is to allow students to explore and advance at their own pace, proving mastery of a concept covered in a video and then feeling confident to move onto a more advanced topic. We try to make the exercises as modular as possible (which may make them outwardly resemble drills), but we do this so a complex problem can be broken down into many smaller and easier problems. Instead of making a staircase with huge steps that would take a giant to leap, we're making a staircase with small steps; that way, everyone can advance at their own pace.",1313355037.0

Maybe they could pick it up where they buy groceries. Maybe they could just use email or phone. Maybe they would get less junk mail. It's hard to tell how they would adapt if they had to pay market prices. But they would adapt and that's a good thing.

But I feel a loss in service quality and am not convinced my checkout time (waiting + service) has been shortened.<p>Yes, I don't use them either, for the same reasons. <i>But other people do</i>. They've chosen to use that line. If the lines get too long, I can choose to go to another store. Having 1 cashier for each customer in the store would obviously be impractical too. But an equilibrium forms.

I work with software that supports business processes, manage information and facilitates interaction between humans and machines. In that field (if it is even meaningful to speak of such a broad category as a single field), knowing how to write the most efficient sorting algoritm is fairly close to worthless.<p>I'm sure that if you work at Google, where crunching big data is key; or in a company like Microsoft or Apple, where applications are much closer to the hardware; then these things do matter. But I propose that a major part of software development happens in a space where such things are irrelevant or at least very rarely relevant.<p>Regarding my outsourcing remark, let me clarify a bit. What I mean to say is that while the stuff that is close to the hardware might take skilled workers, it does not require cultural skills. For example, I would suggest that it's a lot easier to outsource a hardware driver than it is to outsource a workflow engine for an order process. For the latter, you need to be close to your users and you need to understand the business you're modeling.<p>Mind you, I think it's fine that we teach this stuff in universities - it's good background knowledge to have. But as a practical skill, I question its value. And in a job interview, I would suggest to test the skills that are actually needed in the relevant job.<p>Oh, and I didn't choose my name; My parents did.

Nobody is going to come up with something more radical on that spectrum.  Its now on to morality and efficacy.  Morally, there are still active debates on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, scope of the government, and cloning.  Everything else is about efficacy, and what actually works.

But i'm not so convinced that if you want to start a tech startup or work for one that College is the most important thing.

I think those which are savvy are able to get opportunities to build experience, even early on when building experience.

People who choose to live in the middle of nowhere should pay the full price of doing so.<p>I'm sure private companies would have no problem delivering mail to the middle of nowhere, but the people living there will have to pay the actual, higher, cost of delivery.  Why is that such a big deal?",1313352210.0

A cop shows up and asks what the guy is doing. Guy says he's an artist. By the guys own admission, the cop was perfectly friendly and polite. Cop asks to see his id, and gives some spiel about how Homeland Security lets them require you to show your ID.  Cop runs his license and hands it back and says he can keep on shooting. Cop leaves.<p>There are two things going on here. First, nationally in some areas there's this push by law enforcement against being photographed, and they try to extend that to public places too. That's very bad and needs to be combatted.<p>The second thing is the flavor of this article is trying to portray this event in the light of the first situation, and it just plain <i>isn't</i>. If anyone is taking pictures of a major installation and it's not something that normally happens, it's prudent to just nicely ask what the person is doing and move on, which is what happened here.<p>The photographer wasn't physically detained or arrested. The cop didn't want to look at the photos or try to make him delete them. Just because you feel like you are being detained doesn't mean you are.<p>I am a photographer too. I got all bristly when I first started reading this, only to reach the end and see that nothing happened. I've gotten face to face with people who think they can can control what people take pictures of.<p>This, however, is not one of those situations.",1313352051.0
