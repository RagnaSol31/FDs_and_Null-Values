It's almost a semantic problem of language and meanings as opposed to a technical one -- I guess the solution would be to find some technical means of adding specificity...<p>hmm, if you have two objects which both support the method 'run', one of which is a jogger that will move into a 'running' state, and the other is a program which will actually begin executing code, and you have them both in say, an array that gets iterated over and every object is sent a 'run' message.. and they both take one argument and return nothing distinctive, well, that's extremely contrived. But such things happen. Scary.<p>I'm gonna start thinking about this. Thank you :)",1281214773.0

At least with my approach to exploratory programming, it's common for me to have large parts of the code at any given time that are broken as I try out things. If the things I try out work, I go back and fix the rest.<p>In statically typed languages, at least the ones I've used, doing that requires a lot of overhead before the language will even let you run the damn thing. Yes I know lots of stuff is broken, but let me try out this one code path that I'm pretty sure works! Or if it doesn't work, fail at runtime so I know where it breaks! Instead, it won't compile at all, unless I go through an exercise of moving broken code out of the way (lots of block-commenting), supplying stub functions to take its place and the place of unimplemented stuff, keeping both an old and a new version of a function around so I don't break code that's looking for the interface with the old version (even though I'm not testing that code right now anyway), etc.<p>In Lisp, I don't have any of that commenting/stubbing/shutting-up-the-compiler hassle. If I want to try out one particular code path amidst an in-transition code base, Lisp will happily execute that code path. To me at least, it feels a lot easier to try out new ideas that way, because it doesn't feel like the code base is this ball and chain I'm dragging with me every time I try to make a change; I can choose to temporarily leave it behind for a bit.",1281214064.0

30,1584268,comment,1583816.0,1583816.0,0,0,Detrus,,,"It's not a purely technical issue. Some languages are more popular than others, popularity means more libraries, frameworks and examples. Languages also attract different audiences, those who code C++, Java and ActionScript 3.0 just love piling on boilerplate code and long names like FactoryBuilderFacadeInterface, ApplicationFacadeDependencyHandler.<p>Other languages, like Ruby or JavaScript, attract people who shorten document.querySelector(id) to jQuery(id), come up with things like Processing (JVM but short syntax school), CoffeeScript, Rails, NodeJS, etc..<p>AS 3.0 is an interesting example. It's the language of the Flash plugin, which used to be popular among non-programmers as it allowed them to hack things together concisely, without having to learn about types or classes, since old AS 2.0 looked like JS. This was an audience the makers of Flash wanted to keep, but when AS 3.0 came out it chased them away. Online examples became polluted with design patterns, commands, factories, optimizations, complex best practices, long names. Libraries were targeted at advanced coders, there was nothing like jQuery for AS 3.0. When non-programmers see obj.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, clickHandler) they start shaking. JS frameworks do obj.on(""click"", onClick) or obj.click(onClick), few irrelevant details.<p>The language attracted serious developers who were used to big projects. Adobe released Flex, a gigantic framework reminiscent of the Java world, 300-600KB zipped for web deployment. Years later efforts like <a href=""http://www.hypeframework.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hypeframework.org/</a> tried to rekindle some of the old flame but the non-programmers are still using AS 2.0 or switched to JS.<p>Did AS 3.0 have to be as verbose? Did it need giant frameworks and Java developers? Did it need types? No. The performance improvements from AS 3.0 types were negligible, they can be left out in a non-strict mode and the difference is 2 FPS, maybe. For typical Flash projects, debugging with types isn't necessary. Supposedly the situation improved performance wise for types, but that's the wrong priority.<p>JS/HTML5 picked the smarter approach. There will be typed arrays for WebGL, they're ugly, which discourages their use unless actually necessary. Type strict mode applied to an entire app means example and open source code will have it, it pushes everyone to use it.<p>When subtle psychological differences are applied to large groups, they create obvious effects. The current division between typed verbose and dynamic concise emerged from social forces more than technical issues. There are efforts like Google's Go, typed Ruby, dynamic C",

Duck typing relies solely upon the methods being used.<p>In duck typing, this means that the user finds out at the time of use whether or not a method is supported by an object. Here, the ""interface"" to a type is not set in stone. It is inherently dynamic and as long as the message you pass is supported, (duck->quack), there isn't a problem.<p>The mental jump which many people fail to make is to understand that Object Orientation is about message passing, not types. The key questions are, ""what message are you sending"", and ""does the receiver have a response"" - it got dogmatized somewhere in small-memory static-land long ago that the best or perhaps only way to tell if an object will respond is through static definitions of complete interfaces, which came to be very strongly associated with our conception of a ""type"". Once the compiler has used it to check interface constraints are unbroken, this information becomes useless and unchangeable.<p>Ruby is an example of a language that does not use that means of answering the questions. Instead, an object has dynamic metadata about what messages it supports (specifically a hash of the method names), and uses that (malleable) data to generate an answer. It is fundamentally different than type inference in a statically typed language.",1281213015.0

It helps to have two parents to provide for the kid(s). Lots of other stuff grows out of this basic fact, including the typical female emphasis on ""attractiveness"" -- because that is (theoretically) how you get a man.<p>Short version of a lot of reading I have done over the years:  European women put a lot of emphasis on getting assistance from society and government with the burden of bearing and rearing children.  This has helped narrow the gender-gap on income, generally without pushing up the divorce rate to American levels.  But in America, women generally have taken the political position of ""Don't tread on me"" and ""Get the fuck out my way and I will show you what I can do, damnit!"", which is a historical American political position dating back to the American Revolution.  This works fairly well -- until you have kids.  Women who are unmarried and childless make about 98% of what men make, given similar experience and education.  But, overall, American women make about 2/3 what men make, the same figure listed somewhere in the bible as their difference in value (ie from about 2000 years or so ago).<p>Some of the most frustrated, baffled women I have known are women who thought they could make it on a man's terms in a man's world and did quite well for themselves -- that is <i>until they had children</i>.  Then it all fell apart and they couldn't figure out wtf happened or how the hell to fix it. I think I am still alive and doing better than I ""should"" be because I never tried to make it in a man's world on a man's terms.  I followed a female path of success.
