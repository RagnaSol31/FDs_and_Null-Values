Instead it spends its processing power on looking as deep as possible.<p>For humans, it's all about the heuristic.  We evaluate a position by examining the ""shape"" of the board in a way that we don't know how to express well enough to translate into code.  The brain circuitry we're using for this is visual/spatial.  Whatever we're doing is not just a deeper tree search: we simply don't have the right wiring that we'd be able to do that at a pace that yields the ability level we're getting.  We're only fast enough to examine a few positions per minute.  An AI that ran at that pace would be laughably easy to beat.<p>Also, the order in which we search is more like ""most interesting first"" than ""best first"": we search the branches which our intuition has the most difficult time predicting the outcome of in advance.",1201035587

12,102418,comment,101920.0,102404.0,0,0,tx,,,"Del.icio.us is exactly the kind I referred to when I said ""web-based to-do lists"". Those are companies that discovered a market need for something technically trivial and filled the niche. While this does sound attractive and ""let's all get rich this way!"", the reality is that the percentage of businesses that had been started this way is very very very small, while number of people who is trying is very very very big and growing because of the media coverage.<p>Media plays a big role here, as always, because it loves such incredible success stories. Publishing an article about boring and typical long way up isn't going to help selling your magazine. When I look at small-to-medium sized companies I personally know someone working for, I do not see a single ""del.icio.us"" - they all took lots of work to get going: coding hours, equipment, office space, etc.<p>One of the reasons young founders succed more often that has not been talked about, is that fact that they DO NOT HAVE full time jobs, mortgages, wives and kids with high medical bills and ""family time"" they need. Young guys have more time and since time == money, they kind of already have ""funding"" when they're starting.<p>Therefore I do not see an answer to the dilemma the author is talking about. If your job pays $7K/month (after taxes) plus about a thousand more in benefits, and your startup needs 12 man-months to develop a prototype, plus 3-6 months of fundraising after that, you're essentially looking at the need to find $110-130K somewhere just to let yourself work full time on your idea. If you have that kind of savings - great. If not, quitting your job won't help since you'll starve to death. Short and simple, not even enough for a good blog post.<p>Just my $0.2",1201034734

The only difference is that those who mastered chess can do some part of the job on a subconscious level and get results of calculations as ""insights"".<p>The entire chess theory that tries to cut branches so to say, and find good ""strategies"" for chess - those methods to my understanding change quite often. Every new chess genius turns the theory upside down. Which only means there is no strategy in chess except tree search.<p>Correct me if I'm wrong.",1201034049

But, as far as I know, there are none in the city limits of Chicago and New York.
