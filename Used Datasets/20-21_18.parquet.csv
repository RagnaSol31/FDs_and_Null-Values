2,138401,comment,138398.0,138398.0,0,0,jasonlbaptiste,,,"Since I can't attach text with it, I figured I'd explain in this article.  We created HearThisPitch, in order to share our experiences with other entrepreneurs.  By open sourcing, we mean: sharing all the feedback we get from potential investors, placing our presentations online, the source files to those presentations, our personal notes, and opening the comments on the blog.  Purpose is two fold:<p>a) Helps us revise and make the pitch better through a community effort.  We're far from being where we need to be and brutal, honest feedback does it best.  Every two weeks or so, we'll update the pitch according to people's input on the site. We'll also post feedback from investors. Anything seriously confidential will stay that way.\nb) This creates a great learning ground for entrepreneurs.  When we started, we knew nothing aobut fundraising (and honestly, still have tons and tons to learn).  If we had a resource like this, it would have really helped us.  Hoping that this creates the same effect that open source does for software, but for entrepreneurs with fundraising.<p>-j",1205701006.0

Sometime it is better to keep the control and give away stake and vice-versa.<p>But following is what i learned from one of the venture blog, its very interesting and educating:<p>Entrepreneurs focus on valuation when they should be focusing on controlling the company through board control and limited protective provisions.<p>Valuation is temporary, control is forever. For example, the valuation of your company is irrelevant if the board terminates you and you lose your unvested stock.<p>The easiest way to maintain control of a startup is to create good alternatives while you’re raising money. If you’re not willing to walk away from a deal, you won’t get a good deal. Great alternatives make it easy to walk away.<p>Create alternatives by focusing on fund-raising: pitch and negotiate with all of your prospective investors at once. This may seem obvious but entrepreneurs often meet investors one-after-another, instead of all-at-once.<p>Focusing on fund-raising creates the scarcity and social proof that close deals. Focus also yields a quick yes or no from investors so entrepreneurs can avoid perpetually raising capital.",1205700723.0

Paul Buccheit says he built the first version of Gmail in an afternoon.  Digg was famously built in fairly short order.  Twitter, Flickr, Facebook-- all would be fairly trivial to clone.  Less trivial to scale, obviously but...  Feature-wise their V1 releases weren't that complex.<p>If you want something that you can do in your off hours AND something that isn't easy to copy, I'd say you might have an unreasonably low opinion of hackers around the world.  Surely there's nothing you could build in your off hours that a few persistent hackers couldn't clone in a few months of full-time work, is there?<p>More on the ""why should you care"" front-- can you name any successful product/company that succeeded cloning someone else's idea?  Maybe you can, but it's the exception, not the the rule.  Now there ARE examples of companies jumping into the existing marketing and cleaning up by doing BETTER (iPhone, Flickr, etc) - but that's not cloning...  That's innovating.",1205699789.0
