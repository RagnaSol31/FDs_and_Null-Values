Through the rise and fall of the stock market at the time I was selling my options and investing the money in other things while most of my friends/coworkers were tracking their paper worth.<p>In the end, I pulled 7 figures from my options while most people I knew just sat there and let the world happen to them and were left with nothing the day Lucent dropped from about $70 to $50 then kept falling.<p>The morale: don't be greedy and don't be afraid to exercise some of your stock and diversify should you find yourself in a scenario where your options become worth something.<p>I also started a company of my own through those years and had a couple of other side interests going on.  All in all it was a fun time.  I recall spotting some trends, like Fore Systems oscillating between $8 and $10 a share for a while.  I would buy 1 or 2 thousand shares on margin, then sell a few days later and cash the check.  The stock market at the time was like a giant ATM if you knew how to play it and didn't get too greedy (there's that theme again).",1218229151.0

Try to explain in a non ad hoc way what it is to see the color red (it's the canonical example).<p>Can a robot ever experience human-like emotions? and, assuming robots experience somthing, or come to experience something one day, could a human experience robot-like feelings?<p>Robert French and David Chalmers (who both studied under Douglas Hofdstater btw) have lot's of interesting insights about these topics.",1218228910.0

Think of all the items one company will go through during diligence and make it a habit to implement the proper process accordingly.<p>If your investor walks in and see that you have well run back end they will be impressed and they will not fool around with you. That will also give them some relief.<p>So from the get-go make sure you incorporate properly, hire an accountant firm, or use software and make sure someone records and categorizes every single expense (yeah add 25c for that Koolaid too), develop a great business relationship with your customers (mostly for startups that charge), document your technology ( I do not know much about this one), write short bi-weekly or monthly report about your traffic, write short reports about your sales etc....<p>You do not have millions in revenue to treat your business like it is, and if you do treat it as if, it is very likely to end up making that much.",1218228478.0

12,271002,comment,270736.0,270736.0,0,0,time_management,,,"<i>The Victorians' discovery of deep geological time was unsettling.</i><p>To them. Eastern religions already had, and used, words to describe billion- and trillion-year time spans. For example, time spent in even the worst of Buddhism's narakas (hells) is not eternal, but is posited to stretch beyond 10^19 years. Somehow, 10^19 years of agony sounds more frightening than ""eternal hell"".<p><i>Only one author, Dougal Dixon, thinks it probable that humans will be extinct within a million years.</i><p>Unless humanity evolves dramatically, as a collective, the odds do not favor a million-year lifespan for the species. I don't envision a war or environmental disaster rendering the whole species extinct, but I could see one leading to a genetic bottleneck that opens the species up to disease. Also, fully modern humans are rather like the (now extinct) passenger pigeon in terms of being requiring a huge flock to survive.<p>Personally, I think there will be dramatic improvements in artificial intelligence, and I expect technological progress to continue throughout my entire lifetime, but I tend to doubt that we'll ever reach the Singularity. I think the greatest discovery-- disappointing from a Singularitarian's point of view-- of the 22nd century will be a strong evidential argument, as close as humanly possible to proof,  that consciousness is, in part, nonphysical, ruling out the possibility of a full-on Singularity.",1218228122.0

I thought that the web was a great way to share information, but that ""web applications"" were boring compared to ""real computer science"" like programming language design and natural language processing.<p>In some ways, I regret focusing so much on traditional computer science and ignoring the web -- I probably could have made significantly more money circa 2000 than I did.  But on the other hand, I just read an interview with Don Knuth in this month's <i>Communications of the ACM</i>, in which Don encouraged readers to do the work that they personally find interesting, not what they think others think to be interesting.<p>I've done some web work since 2000, and that can be fun, but when it gets down to it, my joy in computing really is found more in language processing than in web applications.

Bootstrapping, in contrast, suggests that the company is being funded out of <i>the company's</i> revenues.<p>But it's a rather blurry line: What do you call a company which operates for N months out of the founders' savings and is self-funding beyond that point?  The answer has to depend on N -- at T=0 a ""bootstrapped"" company has nothing to sell, so there must always be <i>some</i> initial period when a company if funded by external sources.",1218226780.0
