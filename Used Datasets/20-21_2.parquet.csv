I think small boats would bring news of approaching ships before anyone could see them from St Mark's.<p>Apparently Galileo did demonstrate his telescope from the top of St Mark's, showing some Venetian senators that with it they could see the sails of distant ships.  For that information to be valuable, though, it would have to be the first news to be had of them, and that seems unlikely.",1184012729.0

Unfortunately it reports ""Invalid Operator"" error when I try to use that bookmark now.<p>We're looking to hook up a credit card processing to our app. As cheaply and secure as possible :) We're running a subscription-based service therefore a solid recurring billing is a must-have.<p>Suggestions?

Supposedly he'd stand in the St. Mark's Sq. Bell Tower watching for foreign ships, and then use this information to arbitrage commodities.",1184011708.0
