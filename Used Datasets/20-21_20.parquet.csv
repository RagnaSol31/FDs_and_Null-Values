7,224417,comment,224312.0,224317.0,0,0,ljlolel,,,"Actually, that does work!  I forget the precise names (this is studied in Behavioral Economics), but there are a number of cognitive biases which cause people to wrongly evaluate their decisions.<p>For example, say you have two choices A and B.  Imagine they have different characteristics along 2 dimensions X and Y.<p>Imagine A is higher along dimension X, while B is higher along dimension Y.  Now, suppose that looking at A and B, you would choose A.\nAdd a third choice C which is more strongly along dimension Y than A or B.  Now, you have a choice A which is strongly along X, choice C which is strongly along Y, and choice B which is a little X and a little Y. Also, you don't really like or care about C.  These results were shown with numerous experiments: presented with choices A, B, and C, you will often choose B.  Notice that before, without the irrelevant alternative C, you chose A.  But add in a choice that you don't even care about, you prefer B.  Rationally, that shouldn't happen, and economists try their best to explain that but fail.<p>As for having a super-high priced item, that makes sense for a number of reasons.  For example, one reason may be the halo effect (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect</a>).  Just the existence of a very high-priced, very high-value item can make people perceive your brand to generally be of a higher quality.<p>Also, some behavioral economists (e.g. Benabou) postulate that people have ""identities"" for themselves which they refer to when making consumption decisions.  So, someone might think of themselves as the frugal buyer, and so they will always go for the cheapest alternative which gets the job done.  A lot of people probably think of themselves as the middle-of-the-road average person.  So if you make an super-double-over-priced option, then more people will buy the over-priced option because they perceive it to be more average.  Plus, some of the people who consider themselves to be big spenders will buy the super-double-over-priced option anyway!",1214167992.0

For the events that actually show on the calendar, I wrote this function that converts positions on the calendar (left and right CSS offsets) to UNIX timestamps (and another function that does vice-versa). In the code below, the parameter ""el"" is a jQuery encapsulation of the DIV that holds the event, the ""isEndTime"" parameter is whether to look at the beginning of the DIV or the end (i.e., start or end of the event), the this.parent.timeStart variable holds a Date that begins at the very top left of the calendar (midnight at first Sunday of the week), the this.parent.timeslice variable is a shortcut/cache for the number of seconds that one column in the calendar represents (i.e., ",

I wish someone would've just stopped me from going to college altogether instead of having to suffer for two years before realizing that self-study was far better for me.<p>Obviously school works for the vast majority of people, but I wish there wasn't such a prejudice against self-directed study. Right now society doesn't even admit that self-study could possibly work, they just tell you that it's a path to guaranteed failure.<p>There was one significant gap in my skillset that I can directly blame on being self-taught through Wikipedia and other web resources: I didn't know how to take a textbook and systematically study from it. I was too used to jumping around or starting from some thing-to-learn and just reading the specific concepts it depends on. This works great when you're studying subjects that are well-covered by online resources or looking up reference information, but it really falls short for more advanced or esoteric topics. Over the last few months I've been consciously trying to develop the ability to study from a textbook and I've been getting better.",1214165566.0

Confirmed trustworthy identities aren't important if you're selling relatively low value goods, but if you're buying and selling cars, houses or industrial goods it suddenly becomes much more attractive to reduce the pool of buyers to those to on whom some due diligence has already been performed.
