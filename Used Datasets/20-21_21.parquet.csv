If it's something long or that I can read later, it goes into the starred bin.<p>What's wound up happening is that I have (I think - Google doesn't give an exact count) several thousand starred items in that list that I have yet to read through. I used to feel pressured about this, but I've recently stopped worrying about it. If there's something important I want to come back to later, I can search through it, and if I didn't read it, obviously it can't have been <i>that</i> important.",1241297663

I never hit anything but the all-items feed and I'm pretty strict about leaving zero unread before I navigate away so I can't just pop in for a quick read unless I've got at least 15 minutes to kill. I breeze past most items and middle-click anything interesting that's longer than a screenful.<p>The downside is I end up having a <i>lot</i> of open tabs with things I want to read.,1241296697

The author went from using a browser, to an RSS reader, back to a browser.  What remains unsolved is the problem of filtering uninteresting stories.<p>The real reason his new solution works is because he's manually filtered stories.  But this approach doesn't scale with the number of websites that are being tracked.<p>What remains unsolved is an algorithm to find stories that are interesting to the author.",1241296501
11,590197,comment,590135.0,590135.0,0,0,rufo,,,"This system is the entire reason I switched to RSS (first with NetNewsWire, now Google Reader) in the first place. I found myself wasting an <i>incredible</i> amount of time just reloading a website to see if anything's new, processing the page, trying to figure out which articles I might have already read, etc.<p>Now, in Google Reader, I typically use the ""all items"" feed and blast through the list, only looking at the headlines. If something interests me, I'll either hit ""s"" to star it (meaning read later, not now), read it inline (if it's a full-text feed) or middle-click it to put it in a tab and read as soon as I'm done scanning.<p>If there's under 100 items, it probably only takes me about 5 minutes to go through them. If there are more, I'll typically load up the most post-heavy blogs (which I keep in a folder) and speed through them, then switch over to all feeds and read through them.<p>My only problem with my current system is that I check Google Reader <i>way</i> more often than I should - but I'm generally fairly happy with how I do it.",1241296358

You don't need to feel guilty. What an RSS reader allows you to do is have a central location to categorize and read updates from all the sites you want to follow, and you get the added benefit of knowing what you've already seen.

Tenure was originally a protection for professors to speak freely without the fear of getting fired. The result however is an ossification of faculty that doesn't care because they've attained a level of job security not found in the rest of the economy.,1241296272

It's still possible to brute force the database, of course, but the time required makes the attack less profitable.<p>I would thus argue that a secure hashing schema is significantly better.

And as mentioned, you don't know which were the ones that ""got away"" -- founders that went back to school because they didn't get in, but would have been even larger successes.  Reddit would have been in that group if you hadn't had a last-minute change of heart.<p>As for the relentless founders, was it really that difficult to recognize that Sam Altman was one of those people?  For the obvious cases, it's apparent to all four of you; and for the less-obvious cases, you lack the data to know how many were false negatives.  All you know is the false positives; but that's going to be the most common outcome anyway.<p>Being ramen profitable working on something you don't especially like is silly compared to what you COULD be making at jobs in the Bay Area.  A website is not a startup, and most of them lack any major potential, barring irrational market exuberance.<p>Considering Yahoo!
