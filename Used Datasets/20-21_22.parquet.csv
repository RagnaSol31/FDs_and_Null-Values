Three months of super-tedious review for the slow students (""this is a hexadecimal number"") followed by perhaps one month of interesting new knowledge (""this is a stack frame""). I never tried to learn programming from a lecture course again.<p>I self-taught my own way through ArsDigita's web programming curriculum in the late 1990s... reading Greenspun's stuff was what convinced me that software was actually worth doing, and the reading list was great: SICP, <i>Learning Emacs</i>, Fogel's CVS book (hey, that's all they had in the elder days... :), <i>Internetworking with TCP/IP</i>, <i>SQL for Smarties</i>, Tufte, etc.",1202417800.0

It contains all the error checking, structuring, documentation, and self-checking that any piece of production code has. It simply is not fully functional. However, once you have achieved an end-to-end connection among the components of your system, you can check how close to the target you are, adjusting if necessary. Once you're on target, adding functionality is easy.</i><p>On day zero, Arc let you construct and deploy every aspect of a useful software system (a web app)... but it took a very narrow and direct path to that goal: emphasis on tables, no Unicode support, borrowing some functionality from an existing Scheme environment, etc., etc. That is what PG was trying to convey in his announcement: the strategic plan for Arc's early days is to work on designing a complete skeleton, but not add a lot of flesh.",1202416842.0
