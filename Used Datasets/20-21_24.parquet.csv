And then you get other problems with EC2 too, the biggest one being it's non-persistent storage (but that's something everyone already knows and is happy to ignore).<p>Yes, it's possible to design an application to either not use a database at all, by storing _all_ your data on S3, or to implement some workarounds that deal with DB master-slave replication, store commit logs on S3, etc etc etc. Question is: is it worth it? In my opinion, no.<p>S3 is great if you want to store images, movies, etc  and aren't very popular worldwide. EC2 is great if you need extra processing power to deal with extra traffic coming from those Digg/Slashdot stories, or doing batch processing like converting movie formats, but going 24/7 on simple EC2 or EC2+S3 (using S3 as a database and not just for storing media files) is more of a hassle than a ""good enough"" solution. VPS is definitely the way to go if you cannot afford to lease a couple of servers or some rackspace for the cheap 1u boxes you can buy at ebay.\n",1185829123.0

From the looks of it, EC2 doesn't have enough of a reliable database solution to justify putting a full production server on it.  If I use the untested methods, I feel like I'm either going to always wonder if I'm going to wake up with my data gone, or if it will die from performance problems.",1185828711.0

6,37766,comment,37733.0,37733.0,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"1 The first was a mobile game distribution network. Developers upload their games and tag them. Publishers get a widget they embed on their site and displays games relevant to their website content. If their audience like a game, then they simply input their phone number in the widget and hit SEND to my phone. It didn't work because I kept changing my direction and I wanted to wait until everything was perfect to launch. Big mistake. Several months of development out the window.<p>2 An location based SMS coupons. User registers for offers they are interested in and add zip code. Advertisers choose a radius to distribute their ad and send it to all users within the perimeter. Too easy to copy and SMS business is costly. Still got some interest from some VIP in the mobile field. The real reason was I got bored with it.<p>3. A RSS to SMS/IM content distribution. It failed because i  just kept changing direction. On top of that the idea was not unique at all. <p>PS> Now i am working on something truly unique. Well at least it hasn't worked so far although a few carriers and handset manufacturers have tried it.If I do not get a call from PG after launching this one, then I will be xtremly surprised.",1185827907.0

Galleries want you to come in in person so they can impress you with their fancy space and make a big production out of bringing stuff out of their mysterious back room.<p>Since we were too poor then to have bought any art from galleries, we didn't realize this was how they worked.

14,37758,comment,37733.0,37733.0,0,0,nostrademons,,,"In this post, I'm defining success as ""The number of people who find it useful is roughly equal or greater than the number of people who I thought would use it.""  I'm explicitly not defining it as financial success - most of the projects I've worked on have been hobby or volunteer efforts, and the commercial ones tend to flame out for implementation difficulties.<p>By this definition, I count 5 and a half successes (auto-uploader and new DB system for FictionAlley, Scrutiny and roomdraw ticker at Amherst, ""Write yourself a Scheme in 48 hours"", and a Netbeans plugin for my current employer is the half), 3 and a half failures (inAsphere, RejectedByYC/Bootstrapacitor and the current incarnation of Diffle), and 7 projects that failed because I or my employer failed to finish implementing them (a MUD, a Gnutella API, SchoolBrain, SecureTunnel, a Scheme-like programming language, collaborative editing, a Ruby plugin for Netbeans, and a Haskell-like programming language).  The interesting part is the failures that were implemented fully, so I'm going to skip the successes and the bad implementations.<p>inAsphere.com was a teen-content dot-com run exclusively by teenagers, founded in 2000.  Had the normal forums, link directories, articles, and polls.  We launched it after a month and a half, folded in cross-x.com and its userbase (an earlier site founded by one of the founders), then found that rather than <i>gaining</i> new members, we were <i>losing</i> the existing cross-x.com userbase.  The investors pulled out after 3 months and the project was canceled.  <p>IMHO, it failed because: A.) we were pompous, elitist, and corporate - the market statement was ""A teen content site for <i>intelligent</i> teens"", thus implying that anyone who didn't like use was stupid.  B.) we really weren't all that smart.  C.) we had very little to differentiate us from every other dot-com in 2000 D.) we talked down to users - while they had felt like they were part of a community in cross-x, it just felt like they were part of a corporate machine with inAsphere.<p>RejectedByYC/Bootstrapacitor was a side-project my startup did after YC rejections came out.  You can see the initial announcement threads at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16234"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16234</a> and <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18233"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18233</a>, though the site itself is down now.  Aside from some of the obvious comments in the threads, I'd put its failure down to: A.) unclear positioning - because of the name and manner of announcement, many people thought it was intended to compete with YC, while it was really intended to serve as an additional resource for those of us who couldn't get into YC/TechCrunch/other programs.  B.) Chicken-and-egg problem - the site gains much of its value by having a community of dedicated & driven entrepreneurs, but no dedicated & driven entrepreneur will sign up unless others already have. C.) Poor understanding of requirements - honestly, I don't think it actually ""fit"" its intended purpose all that well.  As an entrepreneur now, I wouldn't use it myself, which is a pretty damning indictment.  Ironically, my sister just told me today that she thought that idea has more potential than what I'm currently working on, so perhaps there really is something there, and we just weren't willing to spend enough time on it.<p>I'm reluctant to include Diffle ( <a href=""http://www.diffle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.diffle.com/</a> ) as one of the failures, because it was never meant to succeed!  The site as it exists now is basically a bunch of functionality that we need for our real idea to avoid losing out for lack of silly stuff (much like how Google Video lost out to YouTube for a bunch of stupid and easily-correctable reasons).  I could knock off that functionality fairly easily while still employed at my day job, so I figured I might as well put it up on the off chance that people like it.  After all, having <i>something</i> up is better than having <i>nothing</i> up, and we have a completely different name and domain name ready in case we tarnish our brand.  It also gives us a bit of a psychological boost, knowing we have a site that we can just plug our real engine into.<p>In retrospect, I don't think I would do it this way if I had to do it all over again.  If your real idea is any good, you'll have plenty of users begging for you to add the features that you omitted.  And you can find out much quicker if your real idea is any good, and switch to a different one if necessary.  Plus, feedback on something that's <i>not</i> your real product is basically useless, because you draw a completely different audience.  Friends and family that you show it to assume you're doing something different than you actually are, and they make all sorts of erroneous assumptions based on that.<p>Finally, I'm including the Netbeans plugin I wrote for work.   This actually does get used - my boss loves it, and gave me a nice bonus for it.  However, it's not being <i>sold</i>, which is what I thought would happen with it.  The reason is kinda instructive:<p>When I started at my employer, I thought the company did something different than what it <i>actually</i> does.  Like many bootstrapped startups, there's a split between the founder's vision of what the company should be, and the products/services that actually bring in the money to execute on the founder's vision.  I had built a product based on the founder's vision, but I thought that the founder's vision <i>was</i> bringing the profits in, and so was a little disappointed when nobody except my boss uses my software.<p>Also, I think I should mention an observation about the 5 successes: in <i>every single case</i>, I was a member of the community that would eventually be using the software, and I basically just built something I would use myself.  I was an author at FictionAlley before I was a programmer for FictionAlley.  I was a student at Amherst before I wrote its course-evaluation system.  I was interested in learning Haskell before writing a tutorial for it, and in fact basically wrote the tutorial as a way of teaching myself Haskell.",1185827251.0

19,37753,comment,37733.0,37733.0,0,0,rzwitserloot,,,"My previous (failed) startup had the following plan: Identify (university-level) lectures given all across the world, for many different areas of study, that doesn't change much over the years. Example: statistics.<p>Now build a live computer-based lecture with a software architecture to live-test what you know with questions, including skipping ahead once you 'grok' something, and working your way through more examples if you are struggling. Get this right with a sizable budget. Don't just get academic experience on board, but also didactic experience.<p>The amount of value created is staggering; lectures are very boring and relatively ineffective, professors generally want to do research instead of lecturing anyway, and they cost a bundle. Every year, how many professors around the world are lecturing statistics? Thousands, easily.<p>The reason it failed: Video stuff is very expensive, and universities move at glacial speeds.

24,37748,comment,37620.0,37620.0,0,0,uuilly,,,"A financial bubble means that people are buying something less for its inherent value and more b/c they think that other people will buy it for more.  Look at real estate prices.  They should always be determined by people's salaries.  The amount a person can pay for a mortgage is directly proportional to their salary.  Salaries haven't been increasing much lately, but in the last few years real estate prices have gone through the roof.  So home owners accept that they will be over-stretched in the short term in the hopes that they can ""flip it"" for more.  Since people have become falsely convinced that ""you can't loose in real estate"" they are happy buying overvalued houses b/c they ""know"" that the price will only go up.  The problem is you eventually run out of suckers.  Eventually people say, this one bedroom condo is not worth a million dollars.  After the notion that real estate prices ""only go up"" is disproved, the bubble quickly pops.  <p>This is all to say that financial bubbles require lots of ""transactions"" for the positive feedback loop to take hold.  People have to see the price going up up up up up up up enough to get hypnotized.  Since there are very few public web 2.0 companies I don't see how this can happen.  The transactions in Web 2.0 come from angels, VC's and big companies making acquisitions.  Since there are very few transactions in the cycle there is little opportunity to pump the price up and pass it on to suckers.  Also the suckers in question are professional investors and big software companies.  While they may make amazingly stupid decisions from time to time, they are not nearly as stupid as the hordes of unwashed E-traders.  <p>I think the real question is, ""is Web 2.0 oversaturated?""  That's a very different dynamic than a bubble.  \n",1185826011.0
