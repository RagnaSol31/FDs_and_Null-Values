2,73934,comment,73840.0,73840.0,0,0,mrtron,,,"1. Virtually zero barriers to entry<p>Incorrect.  This is where many analysts have been wrong, and hence have been underestimating goog's longevity.  Google has one of the largest barriers to entry of any tech company.  Personally, I think larger than Microsoft's.  Here is why: they solve ridiculously hard problems and make it seem simple and easy, and monetize it well!  Yahoo, Microsoft, and all the 2nd tier search companies cannot hold a candle to Google's ability to search and index.  Why?  Google has the smartest people in the world working hard and enjoying themselves while working there.<p>2. Competition from the other big dogs<p>Incorrect.  The other big dogs are falling rapidly behind.  Microsoft is not doing well on the web, momentum is basically carrying them.  Yahoo is not doing well, again they are doing a decent job at making money being second horse, but they do not do anything innovative on search or advertising, they eat up the scraps.  AOL clearly is dying.  Google's margins are much higher than any competitors, and this is massively important.<p>The other arguments could hold, but I don't agree with them entirely.\nGenerally, I feel the advertising based model allows them to monetize any product they create, from web mail to any of their newer products, including potentially free wifi.<p>Just my two cents.",1193691311.0

I was never so far along the process that I had to tell investors about it so I usually backed off and went to another idea which turned out to be the wrong move most of the time.<p>Just because there are competitors doesn't mean you should back off the idea. It's a good thing if you stumble upon a competitor. It means your idea has some sort of value and since you didn't know about the competitor chances are a lot of your potential users/clients don't either. Even if your competitor is larger they might want to buy you later on to decrease competition or another larger player looking to enter the market might buy you in the process.",1193691146.0
6,73930,comment,73687.0,73875.0,0,0,Shooter,,,"Not many...I'm lazy ;-) I guess I'll just summarize here:<p>I'm the co-founder (and, loosely, EIR) of a $4B alternative asset management firm in Chicago.  We also have a small correspondent office in London. I have two co-managing partners that come from a more traditional background (investment banking, investment management, real estate, etc.) My background is mostly in startups.  I've had a few nice exits in the past, and my pedigreed partners were willing to overlook my lack of polish for that reason only.  The bulk of all of our personal assets are invested in the firm.  We have, all together, around 400 employees.  We have an essentially flat management structure, so a larger percentage of our employees are developers than you might expect.  We pay fairly well, although our culture and our equity/performance share is more compelling to most new hires.<p>I have some limited input with our equities trading activities, but I don't have anything to do with our M&A or real estate activities at all.  I manage all of our software and internet investments.  I don't just sit on boards, though...I play an active role in all of our portfolio companies (except one that is a somewhat special case where we brought in a graybeard with more industry experience.)  I make essentially all strategic and marketing decisions, and most hiring decisions for the companies in my division.  I even write (abysmally bad Lisp) code on occasion to prove a point.  Our internet division operates almost like a traditional VC firm, except the bulk (95%+) of our investments are in our own ideas.  We're open to outside ideas for the most part, but we haven't found many that are worth pursuing instead of our own.  Most of our active investments are in business and financial services, although we also have a few portfolio companies that are in more 'pure play' internet areas.  All of our launched companies are currently profitable, and none rely on advertising for revenue. That record is likely to change once we launch our next three companies, though :-(  Most of our investments are in industries that YCers would probably find boring (pension administration, payment processing, skills assesment, mortgage underwriting, etc.)",1193690949.0

8,73927,comment,73674.0,73744.0,0,0,cstejerean,,,"If the company wanted just someone to code a prototype they could probably get a couple thousand dollars together and hire a contractor to do it. As long as the success of the company is based on the execution of the software you have to hire top notch developers and pay them accordingly. The idea itself is not worth that much, most of the time it's about the execution. And if these guys could raise some money without any code then they should go ahead and do so and they pay market salary. Until they can raise enough money to pay close to market rates they need to pony up equity to developers.",1193690391.0

12,73923,comment,73854.0,73854.0,0,0,dcurtis,,,"I've always wondered why enterprise software is so shitty. The HMO Kaiser uses a DOS-based keyboard-controlled interface to schedule appointments. The interface consists only of white or green dots on a black background. But the computers are all fairly powerful machines running Windows XP.<p>Making an appointment requires the user (secretary, usually) to hold the arrow key down for several seconds as the screens scroll by. It is really the most time-wasting piece of software I have ever seen.<p>The interesting thing is that Kaiser probably bought the software at the lowest possible price, choosing the crappiest company to develop it. But in the end, it wastes so much time, confuses their employees so much, and pisses of their customers so much that it has probably cost them far more than it would have to just buy well-designed custom software.<p>In the future, I honestly think the best enterprise software will be in the form of web-based systems that run in browsers. It's easily updatable, uses standards-based technology, is fairly cheap to develop, and-- perhaps most importantly-- the users of the software have experience using interfaces on the web. Everyone uses the internet, even Kaiser's secretaries, so that will completely eliminate the learning curve of these retarded custom interfaces.",1193689657.0

21,73914,story,,,2,5,NSX2,Ask YC: We have a common challenge; share strategies to overcome it?,,"Stamina.  Or rather the fatigue that results from lack of it.  Ok, so while pursuing my startup effort, I've noticed a desire growing inside of me - a desire to locate some sort of establishment that caters to people like me who need meth-laced quadruple expressos.  I haven't found such a thing yet, Starbucks refuses to even consider the need seriously - let alone research the market viability (I can't be the only one, right? - and my doctor doesn't believe my claims at being depressed and needing anti-depresents to ""perk things up a bit"" ... in the meantime - anyone want to share stamina hacks?  I guess we can discuss workflow hacks to to figure out how to schedule things more efficiently so as to work more productively when starting a startup, but I'm talking about when you've woken up at 3:30am, and now it's 1am the next day, your brain shut off hours ago, and you don't want to eat for extra energy because you fear the blood necessary to digest the meal will hamper what little ability to think you have left as Adult Swim comes to an end.  What do you guys use as ""emergency"" stuff?  Meditation?  Yoga?  Ninja hand seals?  stretching?  Ice cold shower?  Cross-brain stimulation drills?  Go for a quick sprint outside naked?

I don't feel so strongly about some of those points, but they're all legitimate arguments to a certain degree.  However, there's one thing I'd like to add to the author's argument.<p>Google lacks one thing that will prevent its true value from growing into its current market capitalization: trust.  We already trust so much of our lives to Google.  They know what we search for and do on the web, what we do with our time (Calendar), who we speak to and what we say (Gmail), and so much more.<p>People (and the regulatory authorities) were skeptical (and afraid) of Google's acquisition of Double-Click because of the ""scariness factor.""  Soon, Google will hit a point where people will no longer trust it with certain kinds of information.  People's lack of trust, or perhaps anti-trust legislation, will provide some setbacks for the company in due time.<p>Of course, this will leave ""gaps"" for more trustworthy young entrepreneurs to take the stage in certain areas; areas that people no longer trust Google to dominate.  In reality, Google has nearly unlimited potential, but all-in-one integration in our lives can only reach a certain point before we become uncomfortable.",1193688689.0
24,73911,comment,73840.0,73840.0,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Heh. This is the second 'Google is overpriced' article I've seen from the same user. A few new howlers:<p>""Google's core competency - search -- has barriers to entry the size of LEGO walls. If two guys starting from their dorm room were able to topple one-time reigning search king Yahoo!  (Nasdaq: YHOO), what makes you think that Google itself is any more secure?""<p>What, indeed? Well, for starters, Larry and Sergei are probably aware that, if it's 1998 all over again, the next Larry and Sergei are going to eat their lunch. This is sort of how France was aware in 1939 that, if it was 1914 again, the Germans would go straight for Paris.<p>""Look no further than the whopping price Google was forced to offer up for DoubleClick as proof of what can happen when you pit a couple of ludicrously cash-rich companies against each other.""<p>I would suggest looking a lot further, actually. Most of Google's acquisitions go unreported (at least that's the impression I get from people in a position to know). Obviously, the most overpriced deal will get the most attention -- but that's practically a tautology. Google is probably able to buy smaller startups for less because they pay half the cost in dollars, and half the cost in I'm-working-for-Google cred.<p>""That said, binding the company's fortunes so tightly to an approach that has left heaps of corpses in the corporate graveyard is more than a touch frightening.""<p>Which corpses does he have in mind? If he's thinking of dot.coms from the late 90's, he's thinking of the early version of a business Google got right, which seems as relevant as noting that Henry Ford was doomed because look at what happened to to that horse-drawn carriage company down the street. I don't know what else he could have in mind -- television, radio, product placement, and outdoor advertising aren't doing noticeably poorly (and if their returns do start to drop, the first thing to check is whether or not it's Google's fault).<p>""Google forecast: Underperformance, with a slight chance of greatness\nAgain, I love Google, and I have huge respect for the company's accomplishments. The company could innovate itself to outstanding returns for many more years to come. But given the... fat valuation on the shares, I certainly wouldn't bet on it.""<p>That's it.
