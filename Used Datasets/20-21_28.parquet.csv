I'd like to know what Mr King thinks now and how he feels the short story has fared since '07.<p>My personal belief is that the short story, and maybe even the poem, is on the verge of a comeback based on the rise of the eBook in Kindle/iPhone format. I think soon we'll see business models whereby its reasonable for an author/poet to sell an individual short story or poem. And that people will pay to read them on their phone or eReader.<p>OTOH I'm biased since short form is the sweet spot for my textflows technology!",1243716913.0

I am a bit unfamiliar with XMPP, so I had a few unanswered questions.<p>Their protocol uses some custom iq/request, iq/delta, iq/error, etc. XML markups.  What I'm interested in doing is setting up my own Wave server (independent of a client) and see if I can get a working system out of the draft.<p>So, does anyone have a good starting point for this project?

10,634076,comment,631757.0,632323.0,0,0,psygnisfive,,,"No, that's not what it ""basically means"".<p>Firstly, the incompleteness theorem (there's only one) is not about computation but about proofs; specifically that there are some things within an axiomatic system which are true which cannot be proven such within the system itself.<p>Secondly, this does not mean that these things are unprovable, period. For instance, Gödel showed that you can prove these things perfectly fine, you just have to use different system. But this system will have its own unprovable statements.<p>Thirdly, computability was Turing's domain, not Gödels, and has to do with the kinds of algorithms you can use to perform proofs, not the system the proof is for. For example: second-order logic (SOL) can prove things about first-order logic (FOL) that FOL cannot prove about itself, but both systems can by utilized by a universal turing machine.<p>Fourthly, there is no known thing that cannot be proven, period, which is obvious for us humans.",1243716430.0

Not all optimizations take huge amounts of time. And certainly there are some architectural decisions you can take early on that can save you a lot of wasted time later. The most common is to prevent bottlenecks.<p>For example, it's not necessary to make a clustered DB from launch day but coding and managing the UI and middle-ware to be ready for a switch to clustered DB usually takes very little impact. If you don't do this and the site becomes successful, re-engineering your whole site to support a new DB is usually close to impossible or extremely expensive.

21,634064,comment,633973.0,633973.0,0,0,10ren,,,"<i>Evolution writes very poor code. So why is biology research rewarding?</i><p>Because biologists aren't looking at the code, but the product.<p>For example, I really liked NN 4.7. It was responsive and consistent. But the codebase was so poor, that they rewrote it - and nuked themselves.  Joel on Software wrote an essay about how as a codebase <i>evolves</i> to cope with more and more special cases, it gets more complex and ugly. But that's because it <i>needs to be</i> (according to Joel).<p>In other words, no one cares about your code. They care about what it <i>does</i>. If it does something really cool and amazing, people will want to know how you did it. What it ""does"" can go beyond performance and features - what code does can include realizing a new user-interaction approach, or a new algorithm, or a new way to model something. Imagine the jury-rigged prototype of the first telephone, light-bulb, aeroplane - the slickness of the implementation just doesn't matter. The invention matters.<p>If, one day, we work out how DNA codes for a brain, we may be able to code it better. But what we lack is any idea of how to do it <i>at all</i>. Poor code that works is infinitely better and more cool than no idea.<p>This is why biologists might be interested in the poor code: <i>How the hell did he do that?</i>",1243714847.0

Publish your ideas early and often.\n2. Have others debug your work.\n3. Track the ongoing conversation around the idea.\n4. Iterate.<p>That's how things <i>should</i> work, blogging in particular, but in practice people think differently about the medium. Many blogs are really bad, without commenters. But some people use blogging for what I'd consider essay writing.<p>Essays to me are about one person doing the thinking upfront and then publishing after they vetted it; the mistakes they make stay in their heads. In theory, an essay is could finish the issue at hand, but more often it doesn't. I think the best essays do close the issue they address.<p>I like essays -- I intend to write them myself -- but for a while I thought that they've become outmoded. Why let one person vet an idea in private, when it can be done publicly; it's much more efficient, when done right.<p>But there's still value in one person vetting they're own ideas before publishing.
