2,117113,comment,116768,117094,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Yes, I meant Joe Kraus's advice. It's interesting how I took it to mean something different than you did: a bad idea generally, not just if you don't have enough money for it.<p>I suppose you're right and I only found it general advice because it completely applies to my current state in life. Lots of people make that mistake: ""this totally applies to me, it must be good advice generally""<p>After the first $10B, once I start working on a space elevator and robotic asteroid mining, I expect the luxury of a contemptuous initial reaction.",1203194213

4,117111,comment,116929,116932,0,0,especkman,,,"I think the key is the meaning of the word ""distribute.""  I believe it is generally accepted that using MySQL in a web based application provided as a service doesn't constitute distribution (though there are some questions about situations when the app is hosted on servers operated by a 3rd party).",1203193609

Repeat with me: correlation does not imply causation",1203193406

8,117107,comment,116768,117067,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"Ok, I think I get it now if I look at the ""Arc approach to language design"" instead of ""Arc in its present form"".  The problem isn't to come up with a better language, it's to set a good example of the better language production process and in doing so perhaps get a better language as a byproduct.  Here are the morphisms I see:<p>a) Programs in ""high level"" languages can fail to be shorter than their lower-level equivalents.  The simple solution: be merciless in keeping the important things short!<p>b) The overlooked problem in language design is high-level language brevity.<p>c) The ""language design"" problem that needs to be solved is... not sure about this one.  I'm guessing it's the fact that the rate of change in the field is putting more programmers into the role of language designers at an increasing rate and anything that helps them avoid bad decisions based on ignorance is significant.<p>d) deliver informally as possible: when designing a new language, write enough to make the goals clear, address issues in a discussion group and put the code somewhere without sweating organizational details like setting up code repositories, bug tracking systems, regression frameworks, etc.<p>e) crude version 1: implement the minimal stuff using an existing system and don't worry about the fact that to the unaware it may seem just like a trivial program in that system.<p>f) iterate rapidly: don't get bogged down by things like release processes and backward compatibility.  Just focus on getting feedback, experimenting, measuring and looking for improvements.",1203192772

I imagine it's mostly just a matter of adding enough servers to handle their growing load. They must do quite a bit of data crunching as well.<p>Their third party app infrastructure must be quite significant. They're proxying and processing huge amounts of traffic. Almost certainly doing it with a custom server app that's probably quite interesting technically.<p>A huge portion of that $150M must be going towards network infrastructure (where it's damned easy to spend millions) and datacenter space/power, etc.",1203192637

15,117100,comment,116976,116976,0,0,DarrenStuart,,,I have already written off YC because of pg's postings on single founders. I don't agree with it but I can see his point a load shared is a load halved.<p>I have taken my own route and if it works out then I will go out of my way to help single founder companies. My only constraint would be they would have to be hackers.<p>I am 33 and married but don't have kids yet but I am running my own business to fund my time working on my other startup work.<p>I'd like to know out of the single founder applications which got funding were they all hackers?,1203192157
16,117099,comment,116374,116386,0,0,thingsilearned,,,"For the past 2 years I've had great success through editing my hosts file, blocking me from seeing the sties that I tent to get addicted to.  It was interesting (and scary) at first.  For the first month I would still go to digg 6 times a day, subconciously even though I knew it was blocked.<p>Eventually it settled in that I couldn't go there, and I haven't wasted time on there since. Its a great feeling and I get way more done.<p>Editing the host file was a pain though, and was a cold-turkey cutoff.  That's where the idea for 8aweek came.  We want everyone to be able to control their bad habits, but in a nice feature rich app, and not some hack in your system's files.<p>Hope you try it out.  Let us know if it worked for you and what would help.",1203192019
