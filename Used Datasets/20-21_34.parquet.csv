The goal seems right -- making sure that the product is built with the customer in mind -- but from what I've seen the best case is when the technology group can internalize those needs and make the right product calls, rather than having a completely different org. This is particularly the case in a startup.",1216501104.0

10,250873,comment,250824.0,250859.0,0,0,jm4,,,"Yeah, that's what I was getting at. As soon as you need any persistent storage you're chained to BigTable. That leaves a lot of code that needs to be rewritten if you need to move to a new storage model.<p>This isn't unlike the storage problems PHP had quite a few years ago. There was a separate module for every database that was supported and they lacked consistent naming conventions as well as consistent functionality. It was literally one set of functions you used to talk to MySQL and a completely different set of functions for PostgreSQL or SQL Server. This is still reflected in the documentation: <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/refs.database.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.php.net/manual/en/refs.database.php</a><p>For a long time there wasn't a common wrapper for all of these modules so if you started with MySQL and needed to move to Oracle or something you had to rewrite a bunch of code. I had to do that once and I never used PHP again.<p>It seems that's where we're at with App Engine and BigTable. I'm sure there's going to eventually be something equivalent or some sort of abstraction, but I wouldn't want to be holding my breath.",1216500367.0

With App Engine, you're limited to Google's sandbox, that means that third party libraries can't be installed, and Python has many, many third party libraries that make a developer's life so much easier.<p>The initial example was PIL, or the Python imaging library, that a lot of web developers use to resize images for their sites.  App Engine didn't support using PIL because it was a third party library, and when enough developers complained they opened up the API that's used for Picasa's web albums.<p>Another issue that you might run into is merchant accounts and libraries for credit card purchases.

27,250856,comment,250704.0,250793.0,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"That's true, but I hear what mechanical_fish is saying, too. I suffer from much the same problem: many elements on the list are things which I have thought about to an extent that I've worked out every single step needed to make them work. The problem is, I haven't the time to pursue everything I would like to.<p>Let's take the ""simplified browsing"" problem, for example. I worked phone technical support for an internet service provider for a while, and it wasn't long before I saw the need for exactly such a thing. But, it runs deeper than just web browsing and email: there is a huge, absolutely massive number of people out there that need a simpler computer. They don't understand things like firewalls and security, and aren't inclined to ever understand them.<p>The solution? Take a Linux distribution and hack it heavily; simplify the desktop layout, hide all the settings, and set it up so that immediately after booting, a full-screen web browser appears. The web browser defaults to a very simplified portal page; the user logs in to their ""computer"" exactly once (on the portal page), and from there they have access to simplified email (which, for example, doesn't have things called ""Reply to All""), chat, word processing, and other services.<p>Thing is, the previous services that have tried to create such a thing have done it wrong; they tried to release their own computer, hardware and all. That doesn't work, at least not now. This would work though because you could sell a CD which would make the installation process a breeze. You wouldn't have a huge initial development cost for the operating system; a good Linux hacker could probably make the necessary changes very quickly.<p>After, say, 6 months of development by a few people, and with the aid of a crack marketing team, you could start distributing copies of this thing for around $75. You'd be tapping in to an under-served market not just of senior citizens but of every average family that's frustrated at using their computer.<p>You could even build in a secure remote desktop protocol for the operating system, and make tech support -- if you wanted to offer it -- the easiest it's ever been.<p>So, there ya go. Probably a hundred-million-dollar idea, with most of the framework. Lots more details, too many to list here.<p>Got time to build it?",1216498679.0

There's evidence to show direct correlation between sunspots, and the temperature on earth.<p>To label people 'denialists' and 'intelectually lazy' is offensive.
