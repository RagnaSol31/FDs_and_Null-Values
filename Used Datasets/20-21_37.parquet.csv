Data speed has always been better with ATT, but the rest leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion. That said, the speed on T-Mobile isn't as bad as I thought it would be. On my old phone data speed was atrocious, but it's pretty usable on the G1. What's interesting is that I live in an area that T-Mobile claims does not have 3G, but in many of the places I go the phone says I'm on 3G.<p>It's probably worth noting that T-Mobile costs quite a bit less than Verizon and ATT. They also offer some neat features like WiFi calling (not on the G1) that the others don't.<p>In any case, it really sucks that people who don't like T-Mobile have to wait to get their hands on Android. I guess the bright side is that it will eventually be on other carriers unlike the iPhone. I probably would have gotten one of those long before Android was available had it not been an ATT exclusive. These carrier exclusives are terrible for consumers, but the situation only seems to be getting worse.",1224795191

52,341627,comment,339755.0,339987.0,0,0,vrs,,,">  full of either Brahmins or SC/ST<p>These are contradictory. I think you need to pick one and make up your mind on who to blame.<p>By ""full of brahmins"" you are implying the that the forward class controls the power, has a strangle hold keeping down the lower castes. But if that were the case the SC/STs - the lowest of the low per the caste system - wouldn't be there. The presence of SC/STs implies that the system of reservation (whether you agree with it or not) is working and the forward class doesn't have a strangle hold (esp considering that OBCs also have reservations).<p>By ""full of SC/ST"" you are insinuating that the place is full of people who are there because of reservation (ie affirmative action) who don't really deserve to be there. But the presence of brahmins would imply that some people are actually getting in because of merit because the brahmins don't have any reservation whatsoever anywhere. So again, the system, albeit flawed, seems to be working.<p>If these places were somehow oscillating between power hungry brahmins trying to keep everybody else down and undeserving SC/STs I doubt that they would be a cohesive group doing good work which they seem to be.<p>Maybe you are just missing people of your background/religion/caste/language/area?  I presume you are neither a Brahmin nor a SC/ST?<p>You also mentioned in your follow up post that these institution are in the south and casteism is always a problem there as if in comparison to the rest of the country. Casteism is a problem all over India and the following is not to justify it in any sense. But if anything I would say the south is probably better off than the rest of the country. The population of forward castes is below average overall so the lower castes have a much bigger voice democratically. This is also why TN had till very recently a 69% reservation and anti-reservation riots are a bigger deal in the North (remember the Mandal protests?) than in the south. Communal polarization too is in general higher in the North. Bangalore is usually considered a very cosmopolitan/diverse city and having lived there (and not being a native) I agree.<p>From a comparison of the different regions ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_states_rankings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_states_rankings</a> ) the south overall seems to be doing better than the rest of India. The southern states are doing above average (and in many cases close to the top) economically, in literacy, infrastructure etc. The three top  ""technological centres"" of India  that one hears about mostly - Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderdabad - are also in the south. This inspite of the fact that India has mostly has Prime Ministers from the North (except for two - one of whom - P. V Narasimha Rao  - is considered instrumental for our economic liberalization along with our current PM who was then the finance minister). So seems like these states have managed to have better governance. None of these are direct indications of casteism rates and I'm not trying to say that things are just fine in the south and there is no casteism. In general, it seems to me that economic growth/quality of life/good governance etc are indicators of reduced polarization. I don't have numbers to back that up, just an impression. My general impression is that while casteism definitely exists in the south, things are probably better there.",1224792545

It seems like as long as you're not doing the hand-on-mouse-hand-on-keyboard dance then you've solved the Editing Problem.  Maybe some people have become super-productive after switching from one editor to the other, but it seems rare.<p>Personally, I was introduced to Vim a couple years ago by a coworker.  I liked the idea of never using the mouse while editing, so I memorized the new workflow and haven't looked back.  There are two reasons why I haven't been interested in switching to Emacs:<p>1) The Vim key bindings have been burned into my brain over the course of two years.  I even close popup dialogs by accident sometimes, because I often press the ESC key after typing anything.<p>2) The ViEmu Visual Studio plugin ( <a href=""http://www.viemu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.viemu.com/</a> ).  As far as I know, there isn't an Emacs equivalent.  And yet, even if there were, why switch to it?  The value is in the ability to not take your hands off the keyboard, which the Vim key bindings already provide.  So that would simply be trading one set of key bindings for another.<p>In summary, certain tools work for certain people.
