It took me some time clicking, and even then it was cumbersome to get going. Also it would be great to know how many questions are left in the quiz.<p>Then at the end it says ""Please sign in to save your quiz."" but doesn't show me how to see my results without signing up. So, I didn't.<p>I can tell you have put a lot of work into this, but you have usability issues. It is clunky, and not entirely intuitive to use. I would suggest getting people to use the site and watch them while they do so.<p>Hope this is more helpful than not,\nJeremy",1234904399
