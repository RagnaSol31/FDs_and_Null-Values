9,254755,comment,254633.0,254702.0,0,0,lsc,,,"eh, I didn't go to college. of course, when I graduated highschool it was 1997, and I had 2 years of paid experience as a sysadmin, so I was able to jump right into a .com job, and I'm a UNIX SysAdmin-  a computer janitor.  SysAdmins often have less formal education than Developers, so some of this was just that I 'got lucky' - but I do know many others who have done ok without formal education.<p>Yeah, if I had stuck it out, I'd probably be earning another 20%-30%, (just looking at what my co-workers make)  but I'm still comfortably into the six figure range.<p>Granted, that's not great for the bay area, average nerd salary around here is north of $140K, and I don't rate that unless I'm contracting, but it's certainly an OK salary for someone who hasn't hit 30 yet.<p>The key to making decent money without college is to get jobs that  count (really, this is good advice regardless of your other educational plans.  Most places a year of experience is worth a little less than a year of education.  If you can get both, you are golden.)  If you want to be a computer guy, don't take a summer job tending a till-   if you can't find an internship, pester local offices to see if they need a windows reboot monkey, or see if you can get the local web-design place to give you minimum wage to do basic stuff.   Or repair computers for your parent's friends.  Charge $5 or $10/hr if you have to... it's experience and reccomendations you are after at that stage.<p>My first job was at a mom and pop computer repair place... I was paid less than minimum wage, but it was an awesome experience, and it paid off handsomly.  Remember that if you don't have education, you need experience.   Without education or experience, nobody is going to hire you for a 'real  job' (at least for 'real pay')  Find someone willing to let you do a 'real job' for next to no pay for a period of time.  Remember that at these jobs a good reccomendation from the boss is worth many times over what they are paying you.<p>Certifications are nice, but with the exception of perhaps, the ccie, none of them can touch a few years experience doing the job you are trying to get.<p>I wouldn't want to discurage people from getting educated-  I think college can be very valuable (look at my grammar.)  but not going to college doesn't condemn you to poverity.",1216846535

Similarly, Mozilla has evolved into a not-quite-general-purpose platform for interacting with internet services.

The hair stylist doing each girl.  Mom lacing up the corset.  Etc...  This is 3-4 hours, maybe more.  Then over to the grooms room, repeat, only much quicker.  Then slam in new batteries, new CF cards, and jog a mile to the church.  Shoot people walking in, sitting down, etc..  The whole ceremony, which can take hours and hours.
