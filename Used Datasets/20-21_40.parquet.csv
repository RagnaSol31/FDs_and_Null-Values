As we age, we like to believe we know things and feel certain of the way things are. As an infant, we quickly learn about gravity and come to accept that it pulls things to the ground. We put our life in the hands of that belief when we learn to walk. When we start making decisions in life, we like to believe that we know enough to understand everything involved.<p>The older we age, the more we seem to be driven to find answers to things we don't understand. When we find answers that seem to fit we find comfort in locking them in place as pure fact, since they make future decisions that much easier. Children <i>know</i> they don't know, and therefore are more open to learning, growing, and changing. Keeping this process going as we age involves looking objectively at <i>everything</i> and never accepting one answer as the only answer.<p>I've already noticed myself being locked into a particular way: I've been anti-social my entire life and I grew to accept that. I was happy with it, and it didn't bother me. But recently I realized that the one thing I'm <i>not</i> good at should be the thing I work hardest at improving, otherwise how can I continue to grow in life? Children are playful because they're constantly curious, constantly asking questions. Hackers maintain this curiosity, this questioning mentality, which is exactly why they're the ones at the frontier of so many emerging technologies.<p>I'm only 26, so I'll just have to wait and see if my thinking is correct. :)",1229547559.0

So you start from a URL, go to your centralised dispatcher router whether that be your Zend bootstrapper, a mod_rewrite rule in a .htaccess file, your django URLs file or.. whatever. From there you'll be able to work out which controller and action you need to look at. In this case I'm looking through a whole bunch of controllers and then their doccomments to see which route matches. Not pleasant.<p>As someone said, this is pretty clever, but I'm not convinced it leads to maintainable code. Which is the entire point of frameworks and the MVC pattern. There are other ways to implement DRY in a dispatcher without resorting to inlining a pattern into a comment.
