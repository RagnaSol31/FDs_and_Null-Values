Dan reached out to me via e-mail to say thanks for the note.

He was the first real kindred spirit I've found on my startup journey.  He was more than a mentor, he was an inspiration.<p>I leaned on him a lot, probably more than was fair, but Dan was always there to help me out, think things through, or just offer a pick-me-up when I was down about user numbers, distraught about my inability to help my startup because I couldn't code, or whatever else was on my mind.  He introduced me to new ideas and new techniques, but most importantly, he introduced me to a world of new friends.

Call it the Google Effect. The search giant's model, described by author John Battelle as ""a billion dollars, one nickel at a time,"" is a perfect description of how media companies hope to take tiny sources of local revenue and roll them up into big money.""</i><p>I think the New York times is missing the point of how Google makes money and how their income model works. The reason Google makes obscene amounts of money even though they only make a nickel per customer is twofold: They have <i>lots</i> of customers, and their expenses per customer is less than a nickel.<p>While I agree that local advertising is a great potential untapped revenue stream that can be harnessed through local news I think they have a bad business model. It appears that they try to set up an old-fashioned news outfit complete with editors, journalists et al. This adds substantial cost to the venture, and all of a sudden you need to make more than a nickel per customer to cover your costs.<p>In short it looks like an old media empire misunderstanding online businessmodels, namely create a service that might cost you a lot in initial effort but will scale (almost) effortlessly to millions of users, thus making your cost per customer approach zero. An editor and a few journalists for every community isn't cheap and doesn't scale.",1254603052.0

23,859143,comment,859023.0,859100.0,0,0,weaksauce,,,I believe one of the selling points of git is that it does not add cruft to each directory as a general rule as it only has one .git directory in the root folder. The only time you would need to do that is if you wanted to keep an empty directory in the structure of the git repo. If checking out an empty folder with a dot file in it is not desired you could always add a post checkout hook to delete them. Though in that scheme you would lose your empty dirs on checkin I would wager(not sure though).<p>Edit: you could probably do a precommit hook too to inject the dot files into the empty directories.,1254602436.0

People directly perceive and compare the difficulty of reading and understanding a few consecutive lines or blocks of code.  Understanding 20 lines of Perl is on average more difficult than understanding 20 lines of, say, Java.  The upshot is that you need much more than 20 lines of Java to implement code equivalent to those 20 lines of Perl.

They'll all give about the same performance. You should have a general idea what they do, but I don't think it's worth the effort to become a ""neural net expert"". You should know enough pattern recognition so you don't fool yourself (by over-training, for example), and have an idea for how to choose the right features.<p>Where should you put your effort? Into finding useful features for the object you want to classify. And the more image processing you know the more useful features you'll be able to try. How much do you need to know? Depends on the problem. If you're finding cars in the desert then not so much. Your feature set might be ""has long straight lines and is not sand colored"". If you're trying to tell American made cars from Japanese then it's harder (unless they are moving, in which case it can't be American).",1254600345.0

Conclusion, the best web languages at the moment are the ones YOU know well. Unfortunately for me this means PHP until my Python skills are a bit better :)",1254600255.0
