What if you're Michael Arrington? What if you're Craig Newmark?<p>The point where you decide to seek investors is a pretty clear boundary: You need to talk to a lawyer.

It's a digitally reproducible item which makes traditional concepts of property obsolete and it's about time the law and the record industry started coming up with terms which match this status.<p>Piracy does not take money away from sellers. It reduces how much they get. This is not the same thing.<p>The best example I heard was this: say you're a baker and you sell bread. One day it starts raining bread, and people pick up their bread from the street rather than pay for yours. It sucks for you that you aren't getting money from your bread, but how can you blame people for what they're doing?<p>Price is dictated by supply and demand, and there's now a supply which is infinite and therefore, by traditional economics, surely it should be free?<p>I don't agree that you should be able to get stuff from artists etc for free.

There were basically two huge ""next big things"" that were supposed to revolutionize everything.  WebTV, and CD-ROM drives.  Both had <i>massive</i> backing from the major players of the day - Microsoft, Apple, the big TV networks, hardware manufacturers.<p>Instead, it was the WWW that took off, and over the next 10 years, the WWW subsumed both of them.  I don't think that was an accident of history.  Huge game-changing innovations rarely come from big-company platforms (though they often come from hobbyists who were inspired by big-company research labs).  They just have too much entrenched baggage.  Instead, they come from small startups and hobby projects that have the flexibility to become what the market is demanding.  The web succeeded, in a large part, because Marc Andreesen didn't listen to Tim Berners-Lee and added support for inline images even though it was totally not the way anchors and resources were supposed to work.<p>I've got two ideas for what that next big disruptive innovation might be.

They host it, which justifies a higher price for you - provided that the hosting is a valuable benefit for you. They maintain it, and add features, so this is like a maintenance charge, which a business would pay anyway.<p>However - if they retain ""simplicity"" (key to their philosophy) and <i>not add features</i>, what's to stop competitors from catching up?<p>3. They add features in the form of new products (which they have done), and the older ones get cheaper and cheaper til it's ""normal"".<p>4. They have passed (or will) a special threshold of economies of scale, such that competitors cannot catch them. With so many customers, their profit margin per customer can be too low for competitors to enter. Their competitors, offering a comparable price but with fewer customers, would not be able to break-even. They'd need to grow their customer base much bigger. But how long would that take? How much would it cost? What's the chance of success (risk)? (37signals has other strengths, to make it harder) What's the prize worth (reward)? 37signals isn't a madly profitable company, so why go after them?<p>These arguments apply to a for-profit competitor - but what about a non-profit competitor?  i.e. open source?  I'm really interested to hear other's opinions.<p>I'm not the first to wonder this:\n<a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/06/bascamp-faces-competition-in-free-alternative/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/06/bascamp-faces-competiti...</a><p><a href=""http://wisdump.com/business/being-37signals-for-free/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wisdump.com/business/being-37signals-for-free/</a><p><i>EDIT</i> ""By Jonathan Barket on April 7, 2006 5:24 am"" makes some good points (search for him - sorry, no permalink)",1219867233.0
