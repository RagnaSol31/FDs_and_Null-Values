Both are handling very high traffic loads ok  (not spectacular), and I know that facebook is using a lot of C/C++ and some Java on the backend.

Doing a big application from scratch requires doing stuff like requirements analysis, which means you need to understand the universe of tools available to make good decisions.  Then you need to prototype for a while before settling on the final design (i.e. your custom framework).<p>With rails (or whatever) you get something that works immediately, which feels safer to a lot of folks who don't have the deep toolkit expertise required above.  The problem is that while the framework <i>works</i>, you don't actually understand it any better than you do the toolkits, it's just handling stuff for you with (what you understand as) voodoo.  So when it comes time to make big design changes in the future, the toolkit folks know exactly where to start, while the framework people are completely lost.<p>I'm not completely against frameworks, but I've seen <i>so</i> many misused that I'm very wary.

HSA's are great and on average most Americans would come out ahead over their life expectancy.  And I am almost positive, that if more than 50% of the US paid for healthcare without going through an insurance company, health care would become much more affordable.<p>The health insurance industry is broken in this country, more than 50% of claims do not get paid, so doctors jack up the rates 50% to cover the failed claims process.  Not to mention the frivolous law suits, and hospitals adding crazy crap to the bill of better insurance companies to pay for care.  The whole system is more corrupt than the Mob.<p>HSA's offer the advantage to save and invest that money tax free, so that you can put the buying power back in your hands.  Since its your money and you want to save it for old age, you will have the option to opt out of care that is extra.  If you feel fine, you go home.  Hospitals will need to get better at explaining your risks, and the decision are put in your hands.<p>Did you know that if you talk to a doc, most will give you a discount on the procedure if you pay for it out of pocket and up front?  We saw bills go through that were at 25% of a docs normal billing rate when people paid out of pocket and up front.  An example, might be if you had a broken arm, instead of your insurance company paying $1200 for casting, and x-rays, you could walk in and pay $300-600 if you payed up front.  The down side to this, for people who do this and have insurance, come in that it does not go against their deductible, so a future incident that year would need to be covered again out of pocket.<p>In a previous company I started, I set up a $5k HSA for each of my employees, and then they only had a $5k deductible.  It was up to them to control costs, and health insurance with a $5k is pretty cheap, if you know how to shop for it.",1210019004

PHP is not my style.  I like one way of doing things.  I like namespaces.  I don't like all the extra syntax that I feel is useless ({};$).<p>But that's just me personally.  Many people hate python for those reasons - it's constraining.<p>Objectively, PHP allows you to do what you want easily.  The only problem is that taking those shortcuts can come back to bite you later.  If you appropriately use include(), make sure to template out design, and avoid some of those oh-so-irresistible hacky things, you'll be fine.  Digg has done well with PHP.<p>The problem is that it's hard to know exactly where you're screwing up sometimes.  For example, in python, every name used in a python source was defined either in that file or in one of the imports.  That makes it trivial to figure out why that ""I can't find that name"" error is occurring.  With PHP, that name could be meant to be included 10 files back.  They simply all carry over.<p>So, is PHP bad?  I personally think it is, but I'm a little conservative an authoritarian when it comes to programming rather than PHP's more loose style.

So $600 per month post-tax is $857 per month pretax. Thus, the median couple in Massachusetts can expect to pay $10,285 per year for <i>their own</i> health insurance, or about 17% of the median annual income.<p>Now, you could argue that your median couple might be getting their insurance ""free"" from their employer. In increasingly many cases this is not true -- fewer and fewer employers provide health insurance -- but even if it is true it merely raises the couple's real income to $70,285 -- of which 14.6% goes toward health care.<p>Now, that doesn't count the percentage of their federal taxes that goes towards health care for themselves and other people. As a quick estimate, a handy website (<a href=""http://www.nationalpriorities.org/taxday2008"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationalpriorities.org/taxday2008</a> ) tells me that 22% of each Massachusetts resident's tax dollar went toward health in 2006. 60K * 30% * 22% is $3960, so that's another 6.6% of pretax income toward health care.<p>Thus, health care costs consume something between 20% and 24% of the median family income in MA. So, if you ask the median Massachusetts resident if they're willing to have taxes raised ""10-20%"" in exchange for free, guaranteed, universal healthcare the first-order answer is ""<i>hell</i>, yes"" -- even if you assume that the U.S. healthcare system would remain terribly inefficient relative to other systems worldwide. Which I would hope it wouldn't.",1210017787
