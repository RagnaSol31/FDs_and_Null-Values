But here's an innocent question from my inexperienced 20-year-old self:  I wonder, how many marriages or families in general have been torn apart as a result of Apple's highly driven environment?<p>If your manager is asking you to work harder, it's easy to forget work-life balance.  Sometimes, it even feels good when your manager requests you work late.  I once almost became addicted to the feeling of ""being heroic"", which caused rather severe problems in other aspects of my life.<p>As far as I've heard, Apple engineers put in a lot of overtime.  All that said, are the results worth the pain?  Is it worth it to build fantastic products at the expense of others?<p>I don't know.  Personally, I'd say ""yes"", because nobody is being forced to work for Apple.  But it's easy for a company to become somewhat evil by pushing that logic too far.",1233349190

This is what Daniel J. Bernstein believes.<p>If, like most of us, you don't believe it's possible to have bulletproof software, then at some point you need something like the TPM to bind a known-good running kernel to your hardware securely. Without it, any bug in your kernel leaves you with no way to trust your system from that point on.<p>I think the TPM solves way more problems than it creates; for instance, TPM-related techniques will allow us to get rid of clunky hardware crypto tokens, and instead bake them into our machines securely; it will also potentially allow us to have public kiosk computers that are safe to use.<p>My only objection to TPM discussions is that EFF-types engage in a lot of hyperbole about them. It's true that the TPM makes it easier for Microsoft to enforce DRM and copy protection. But that's just a property of having better system security. Most of what the TPM does, you want.",1233348469

They have their own reader syntax (using [] and {} as delimiters, respectively), and all three implement the Collection interface, which means a lot of Clojure functions work equally well on all three.  There is also syntax for destructuring.  And the use of vectors in places where destructuring is possible (like function arguments and let bindings) makes it easier to identify code structure at a glance (a complaint against other Lisps).",1233348440

After lots of years spent practicing, they know as much about body leverage as a lot of judo guys. It can be shocking, and your body often won't realize what's happened because it encounters an overload - there's a foot and two hands touching you all of the sudden, and your brain doesn't know what to make of the sudden stimulus when you're already in a mentally stressed state. I honestly don't think that a lot of the practitioners even realize it, hence the devotion to ""chi flow"".<p>I've spent many many years studying kinetics as it relates to power generation, and the internal artists are amazingly good at it; it's just not immediately obvious what they are doing.",1233346011
