Just take a look at the documentation table of contents to get a vague idea: <a href=""http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/</a><p>- The support for various class inheritance hierarchies is <i>much</i> more powerful than Django's inheritance.<p>- You can customize the default JOINs between object relationships very easily.<p>- You can map objects against arbitrary select statements.<p>- It has supported multiple databases for a long time now  (which only just got added in Django 1.2)<p>- It supports composite primary keys.<p>- It implements the unit of work pattern, so you can save entire object graphs without having to explicitly save each individual node. This is a lot more intuitive, IMO.<p>- It uses an identity map to maintain object consistency. So if you query for the same object in two different queries, the same object is returned (at the Python level).<p>- The docs are <i>excellent</i>.<p>I think Django's ORM is fine for simple web apps where the model objects are just used to shuffle data in and out of the database. If you've got complex domain models, or specific database requirements, though, then you'll probably hit a wall where Django won't do what you need, whereas SQLAlchemy probably does.",1275165188

29,1389227,comment,1388905.0,1388905.0,0,0,b3b0p,,,"One of the main draws of TextMate for me is that it is a light weight native Mac OS X application that can be used to edit everything quickly, has excellent syntax / plugin support to make it a joy to do any type of editing in that really no other text editor I have used seems to be able to replicate as well (lots of plugins for Vim and Emacs, but none seem to provide the same polished and quick feel).<p>What I fear is that if 2.0 ever did reach a releasable state it will no longer be a light weight application I would use to edit everything from plain text configuration files, code, or a simple todo list. It won't have that same light weight do everything feel to it that the current version has. It will feel like a Visual Studio or Emacs. Which are good for their main purposes, but would you use them to edit a fairly small and simple configuration file?<p>TextMate, in my opinion is still by far and away the best modern day text editor available on any platform. I do like vim, but being a native Mac OS X application, TextMate wins out the majority of time (just drag a file onto the dock icon or typing mate . when in the terminal). It's visually pleasing and fast to open, browse, navigate and move around in.<p>The only features I really would like to see added is split panes/windows and full screen mode. Nothing is more awesome than MacVim with full screen mode and 4-8 split panes (on a single 2560x1440 monitor).",1275164705

It was amusing trying to get it working, only to realize that the docs only referenced a much earlier release.<p>I understand the goals of repoze.who and think they've written a very impressive set of plugins, and I understand how it would be useful if your app happened to have multiple types of authentication that made sense to handle at the middleware level: HTTP Basic or LDAP or whatever.<p>But they've done that at the expense of keeping the base case simple: having a user model with a username and password that authenticates at the application level with a login form. 99% of websites use this approach so I was surprised that it wasn't simpler to do, especially coming from Django where this feature ships by default.",1275164503

As I understand the history, some states deliberately crafted legislative districts to reduce the voting power of particular racial groups.
