And I found the brief demonstrations / explanations / visualizations to be terse, accurate, and quite explanatory - near perfect.  <i>Not</i> a book you can casually peruse, it's largely a <i>list of algorithms</i>, though it appears to go roughly in order and build off itself.  Where necessary, it goes into a fair bit of detail (sometimes several pages), but truly most of the code is pretty self-explanatory once you know the purpose.<p>Not a book to skim through, but definitely valuable.  Uses C/C++ (minimal C++ functionality, classes + templates) heavily, of course, but big shocker there given that it's largely focused on efficient, low-level code.  I'd rather have functional C than questionable pseudo-code anyway.  A little of a language called GP and a little pseudocode, but very little from a quick skim.  My main criticism here is that the variable names could be more descriptive, often just a single character or two, but most of the code is small enough that it doesn't matter, you can do it in your head easily enough.<p>Definitely a keeper, IMO, unless you despise C.<p>Disclaimer: I write as little code that looks like this as possible, and have not examined it in detail.

This is what Weissman refers to as a ""Problem/Solution"" story in ""Presenting to Win"".<p>This is all well and good, as a hammer without a nail is not much use to anybody, but someone with an actual bleeding neck wound will tell you (if they had the mental clarity) that they are not too concerned about tomorrow, next week, or next year - all consciousness is wrapped up around solving the (admittedly very important!) problem at hand.<p>The issue is that the scene fixates on this form of storytelling to the exclusion of all others. I was trying to make this point to a member of the Toronto business community the other day by rhetorically asking what bleeding neck wound the iPad solved; the person told me with a straight face that mobile device screens were too small and that laptops were too heavy.<p>The ""build it and they will come"" visionary thinking that brought about order-of-magnitude improvements in the way things are done (the automobile, the personal computer, the Internet) is simply, and sorely, lacking in Toronto.",1275770261

Or nearly every modern browser.<p>Moreover, if you don’t like the Safari UI you can check out one of several Webkit browsers (most notably Chrome).<p>If you could do everything with emerging web standards that you can now do with Flash this wouldn’t even be a contest. The emerging standards would win hands down. You admittedly can’t (yet?) but it really does look as though the scenarios where you need to use Flash are getting scarcer by the day.<p>Apple might be the bad guys with respect to the App Store, they are the good guys as far as browser development is concerned.",1275768249

It's danged expensive, and the version with the full compliment of testing tools is even more expensive. There are several very decent free IDE's not from MicroSoft, and they are primarily aimed at non-MS environments. It's in MS's interest to promote development in their OS talking to their family of software products.<p>2) Open source because MS still hasn't made it a good IDE for Javascript development. Yes it has Jscript Intellisense (nice), but you can't collapse Jscript by {} in the editor. This hampers it as a full-fledged web development IDE if you're going to do any more than trivial JS development. If it were OS, maybe someone would fix this.",1275768160

Regardless of how many history books you may read, for example, it will not shed the same insight as a profound discussion with a highly-experienced academic in the field. This is true for many aspects of the humanities.<p>Also, if you're really interested in a subject, talking with an expert is <i>fun</i>. You're really missing out on the good stuff if you keep to yourself and your books. I think this goes equally for the arts and the sciences.",1275768105

Not, Lopp said, ""seven in order to make three look good"", which seems to be a fairly standard practice elsewhere. They'll take ten, and give themselves room to design without restriction. Later they whittle that number to three, spend more months on those three and then finally end up with one strong decision.</i><p>[Source: <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/03/apples_design_process.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/200...</a>]",1275768059
