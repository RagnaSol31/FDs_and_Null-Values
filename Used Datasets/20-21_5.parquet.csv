Many have not been outside the academic space enough to know what its about.. If they were into startups, they would probably be in the industry rather than teaching. <p>Unless of course they generated wealth and then came back to teach, I've seen that before..\n",1183063872

Consider the fact that when you purchase an iPhone you instantly become married to AT&T (in Guy's personal opinion.... AT&T's not so great customer service as well) for 2 years.  Not to mention having to pay the monthly service fees to AT&T to keep the iPhone up and running.",1183063659

After all, almost everyone keeps bookmarks one way or the other, and most people use more than one computer, so they would need to sync them somehow. And, of course, we'll need a viral hook to help with the marketing. ",1183063008

China and India (and Pakistan, and etc etc) just have a hell of a lot more people than the US does. As such they ought to have more people with a high apptitude for programming.<p>\nd) He uses .NET, ehh, I guess I don't really have a fourth point.",1183061974

20,31449,comment,31402.0,31402.0,0,0,enriketuned,,,"I don't think that you can generalize it the way he did. Sure Yahoo, Google, MS and Amazon are building huge data-centers. That's what makes it into the news. And yes there is a lot more processing to be done since we started to see wide spread use of applications (social networking, search, storage, video, etc...) in the Web opposed to the former mere HTML plus some e-commerce routines here and there. But on the other hand, a lot of software is not physically shipped anymore, and I think this trend will continue. More important, you have things going on like Akamai, and Amazon's S3. I would therefore argue for the exact opposite: Unless your Google or MS, it will probably not make any sense running your own data-centers. My guess is that we will see the creation of more S3 and Akamai-like products. Software companies will develop software but it will not be physically shipped, nor in most cases be self hosted. Specialized companies will due to the economies of scale be much more efficient at that. Software companies will be more lightweight. They create the software and nothing more. Just my personal analysis.",1183061566

But I believe I have a way to inform people of [all] the upcoming events that they {the individual} is interested in but did not even know where happening.<p>Think of the application as your most popular friend in high school - the guy/girl that just knew everything that was going on.  The guy/girl you would call to ask ""what are you up to tonight?""  ""what else is going on?""  And they could tell you all the fun things that were happening and what your other friends were planning on doing.<p>I believe I have a way to provide a more complete version of your most popular friend to the world.<p>I could not go into the other value proposition or sources of revenue without giving away the concept.<p>I greatly appreciate everyoneÂ’s advice.
