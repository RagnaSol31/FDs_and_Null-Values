I use this specific hack always followed by /* IE6* / , and only on cases of rendering discrepances (for example: checkboxes in IE6 have additional padding). I always try to solve rendering differences by altering the markup, not hacking my way in CSS, but there are a few cases where this is necessary.<p>This setup brings me these benefits:<p>* I can see at a glance where a particular attribute is tailored to IE6.<p>* When I have a problem with IE6, I just Inspect the suspicious element with Firebug on Firefox and look at the stylesheet. No need to open a different file and find the selector there.<p>* When this awful program dies, I'll just scan the file and delete all occurences of /* IE6* / (not many).<p>(Sorry about my broken English, it's not my first language)\nEDIT: Formatting -- my first time here :)",1248641808

The slaves were an investment, as were their offspring, where indentured servants' children were free and short-term indentured (the more common kind) had to be freed at the end of their term, so their masters tended to use them up since they would shortly become valueless to the masters.  That was also why Irish immigrants (free men) were used to build the railroads, the work was too dangerous for slaves, since they were a substantial investment of their owners.

Where X is a moving-target project.<p>The fact is, I don't even look at a project where the budget is under $5k.  Every project expands in scope as it goes along.  Every change, feature request, ""misunderstanding"" adds to the time to put together an app.  To a developer, somebody who's trying to put something together on a shoestring budget is sending off vibes of unreliability, of focusing on cost over quality, is going to nitpick and obsess about every little thing.  I realize that's a little unfair, but that's how other developers are going to perceive your request.<p>There's overhead too.  I have to do an estimate; I have to research whether we can really use that control, how do we do this so that the numbskull apple reviewers will pass it, have to budget time to wrestle with the gnarly Apple bugs, have to walk you through signing up as a developer, getting the certificates, filling out the forms right, setting up codesign chains, helping you understand app submission... Doing a ""hello world"" app would probably have 10-15 hours just of overhead, and that's without researching anything complicated like how to do SOAP requests or whatever technology you're using.<p>Also, what I have said, and what others have said: lots of people want iPhone apps, and there are a small number of developers.  There's lots of reasons with for this: one is that (at the risk of starting a flame war) ObjC is harder than some more modern languages because there's a lot of crap you have to think about (memory management) that you don't in, say, Python or Ruby.  I bet a third of my time is spent worrying about memory.  Plus there's a lot of Apple hoops to jump through that forms a pretty high effective barrier for developers.<p>And, when you think about it, all of the good people are working on <i>their own</i> apps.  The only way to get anyone's attention is to pay them more money then (they think) they'll make spending equivalent time on their own app.  Either that or pick a developer so incompetent they can't <i>write</i> their own apps, and obviously that's not what you want (but you'll find an awful lot of them below the $5k price point).<p>If your budget is that small, do what others have suggested and pick up a mac and some books and do it yourself.  It will take you a lot longer than someone who has 5+ apps in the app store, but at least you can do it right within your budget.",1248639693

The problem may be that browser-based apps suck for other reasons. There are really only three ways to build one:<p>Plain old HTML pages over HTTP, with optional CSS. As has been said many times over the years, this is the IBM 3270 model with additional chrome.<p>Flash. Proprietary. Resource-intensive. No UI standards.<p>Javascript/AJAX. Better than it could have been, but relatively slow (modern JS interpreters are faster by leaps and bounds, but as usual their deployment rate is limited by the existence of IE), confusing to program, no UI standards, relatively poor tools (witness the recent complaints about Firebug), an evolving diversity of frameworks and practices that will take time to sort out. (The term AJAX is not yet five years old, and this stuff doesn't happen overnight.)<p>These problems, which have existed for years, have led some to predict that desktop apps would experience a resurgence. By and large, this hasn't really happened, because though many desktop apps are great they still suffer from some big problems: They're hard to install and keep updated (not as hard as they used to be, but the gold standard here is now the iPhone App Store) and they're dangerous (click on a phishing link that installs an app and you'll belong to someone's botnet).<p>The iPhone platform succeeds because: installation is a breeze, security is not much of an issue (every app gets screened by Apple; trojan-horse apps will, when discovered, be unceremoniously tossed out and their developers blackballed); there's a critical mass of customers that are on the same platform and using the same interface; there's a fairly coherent set of UI standards and practices as demonstrated by Apple's own apps; there's the full power of a native development language, platform, and environment that has been refined for years by dedicated engineers at Apple and NeXt.<p>I'm still not convinced that the iPhone platform will grow to the point that it poses a serious challenge to the freaking <i>web</i>.

I keep a very, very small stable of clients (like two), who are solid, reliable, pay me every time I send a bill, follow the contract, understand that when they ask to add a feature it will cost them more, don't micro-manage, accept that I know what I'm doing, and provide me plenty of work.<p>I'd <i>much</i> rather work slightly below market for clients who are <i>above market</i> in terms of reliability and honesty.<p>Anecdote: the other day, a client decided now that he had 70% complete project X in front of him, what he really wanted was project Y (I told him this at the beginning).  He wrote me an e-mail, saying ""You were right, I was wrong, I've done some thinking and I want Y.""  He then paid me for X, and then paid me to turn it into Y.<p>Clients like that are hard to come by.",1248638744

There it said that the majority of independently wealthy women in the early days of San Francisco were single or widowed, and the 1850's were the timeline they gave. However, I may have confused it as the point at which married women could enter into business under their own name. I did a little more digging.<p>The Legislative Act entitled ""Act To Authorize Married Women To Transact Business In Their Own Name, As Sole Traders,"" was passed into law by the California State Legislature on April 12, 1852. California State Printing Office Index to the Laws of California, i850-1920 (Sacramento, 1921).<p>Subject to some restrictions - only married California women-not single, widowed, or divorced women-were required to publicly declare their commercial intentions and to limit their investment to $5,000 or less. Some argue that such restrictions limited women's personal, financial, and commercial freedom and, as such, underscored their dependent legal status.<p>In any case, the laws of California were rather advanced compared to the common law, and advanced compared to other states.",1248638690
