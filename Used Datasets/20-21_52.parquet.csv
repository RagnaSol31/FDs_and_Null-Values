Google struck a small deal with a smaller satellite company a while ago(sorry i forget the name) to offer their ads which this is probably using and im sure google is paying a rediculous premium.<p>Anyways, cable and satelite companies by large will not go for this.  They will make their own and are probably actively doing so.  In other countries there are some deployments.  Their each pushing their new interactive platform, ocap for cable, mediaroom for satellite and with good ad applications could offer services far superior to what google currently offers.<p>For example, they could \n-target specific ads to specific set top boxes.  So you could target demographics better.  Why must I see tampon commercials!?<p>-allow the user to give feedback so to make ads more relevant or blacklist shitty ones they dislike. like fucking heads on commercials.<p>-instant/impulse purchase feature for products<p>-allow the user to choose which ads they want to view by category or whatever<p>-get better demographics on who is viewing their ad, not just the generic ""300k cpm which google does.""<p>-give viewers discounts for providing personal info<p>-interactive ads, forms to get feedback<p>-ability for user the equivalent of a cpc.  if they like an ad they can get more info on it, watch it again, save it, etc.<p>-allowing customers to place ads by location so you could target a block around a pizzeria<p>-allow customer micro purchases so 50$ and it gets shown to ~500 houses once.  cheap high quality camera ppl can make their own. Youtubeish. Googles requires like 8k.<p>All the above will make ads more relevant, increase demand and make a lot more money.<p>Google seems to just be a nice UI connecting ad agencies to people who want to purchase the ad, and a more clear way for someone new to put their ad on tv.  The first feature, connecting to ad agencies already exists, otherwise known as a phonebook.  Plus google is a middleman here probably taking a cut when there doesnt need to be one.

Without an increasing ability to provide resources, consumption levels cannot rise (there would be nothing to consume).<p>2. As innovation and environmental consciousness progress, absolute per capita consumption of scarce resources will hopefully decrease, in favor of consumption of non-scarce resources. (When we can transmute dirt into energy for instance, or finally have solar-powered transportation.)<p>3. The upper end will always rise. Someday the entire human race may <i>on average</i> consume at the rate Americans do today, but there will be some group/nation/whatever somewhere that consumes at a much much higher rate still.<p>---<p>He is right to argue that we shouldn't just assume everyone in the world could live at Western standards <i>right now with our current ability to procure resources</i>, but it takes a long time to raise living standards, and our ability to procure resources steadily improves as well.<p>The current consumption rate in Central America probably pales in comparison to America, but would also probably seem really extravagant by US standards circa 1800.<p>I think the implicit motivation for all this hand-wringing about how much more the West consumes compared to the developing world has to do with some misguided assumption that it is somehow unfair. Equality sounds great in practice, but it'll never be a reality (short of a perfectly altruistic benevolent dictator). Instead of focusing on how unfair it is, why not try and do something to help those at the bottom? Innovate... pull a Dean Kamen and figure out how to cheaply purify water. If his invention works as advertised, he will turn a scarce resource (clean water) into a non-scarce one, which means it can more easily be consumed.",1209672341.0

Or, if you do the math:  30000000*.0006=18000.  Or, after the dollar devalues a bit more and the price of coffee goes up, about enough for a nice latte at Starbucks.<p>For my time and money, I'd look for a different gig that paid more.  That is unless you really want the startup experience and the company is really cool.",1209672184.0
