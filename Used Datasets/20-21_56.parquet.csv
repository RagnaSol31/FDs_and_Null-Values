Neither will any other kind of social solution - I doubt anything will do sort of a search engine that looks at semantics.<p>The real problem with SearchWiki (or other upvoting/downvoting) is that you keep going back to the search page while your search is <i>failing</i>. As soon as you click through and find the page that you want, you stop - you do what you wanted and get on with your life. Whereas if that is the page you need and bookmark it (granted your point that we don't bookmark everything), that is a true and accurate indicator of success.<p>Since HN was explicitly mentioned upthread, it would be interesting to know how many people upvote/downvote stories (which you have to get back to the main page to do) versus comments (which are in your face in their totality when you are asked to vote). I can only speak for myself, but I vote on comments massively more often than I vote on stories, exactly for the reason I described.

Here are some sources:<p>First, read The China Study:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/China-Study-Comprehensive-Nutrition-Implications/dp/1932100660/ref=ed_oe_p"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/China-Study-Comprehensive-Nutrition-Im...</a><p>The incredibly thorough, epidemiological study conducted shows that consumption of animal protein (meat, fish, dairy) correlates hugely with 0besity and diseases of affluence.  Further, more micro studies confirm that animal protein is the cause of cancer actually developing after exposure to a carcinogen.<p>Then walk into a vegetarian restaurant and look around.  People are pale, chunky, weak-looking, and generally the opposite of health.  You'll find the same at most health food co-ops.<p>Then look at a ""health food"" cook book and see the huge amounts of oils, nuts, etc. that are used in the recipes.  You'll notice that most of the food has around 50% of calories from fat.  Compare this to the stats from a McDonalds menu.<p>Now go into a vegetarian Indian restaurant -- most of the people who work there and eat there will be chunky.<p>For more information on some of the downside of the typical ""healthy"" diet in modern America, check out the book ""The 80 10 10 diet"" which really hits hard on the fat content of so-called health food.  Doug Graham advocates eating mostly fresh fruits and vegetables.  The China Study (above) suggests that Graham is a bit more extreme than necessary and that carbs are OK too, but the less refined the better:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/80-10-Diet/dp/1893831248/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1243541101&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/80-10-Diet/dp/1893831248/ref=sr_1_1?ie...</a><p>Bottom line:  Food producing companies know that food products are significantly easier to sell if they are labled ""health foods"".  So lots of foods are labeled that way.  The whole ""healthy oils"" movement is a farce (explained in both books I cite).  No, slathering your food in olive oil does not make it more nutritious!<p>Consider the undisputed fact that big agriculture is heavily corn-driven.  Corn sweetens your cola and cereal, feeds your beef and chicken, etc.  But did you know that corn and soy are a standard crop rotation?  Of course we are told that soy protein is good for you (in fact, the compound soy protein isolate found in many health foods promotes cancer cell growth the same way that meat does).<p>I am shocked that my comment above got modded down.

Unlike physical goods, with information you know practically <i>nothing</i> about what you're buying until you've non-refundably consumed it, almost by definition. The only possible exceptions are very large aggregates such as books. And most available information, by volume, is simply <i>worthless</i>.<p>Let's say that a dime were deducted from my bank account every time I read a HN article, and given to the author. I would feel that most of the money is spent unwisely. Not necessarily because almost everything is garbage (Sturgeon's Law applies!) but because I have not had the chance to evaluate it before purchasing, since doing so is effectively impossible.<p>This makes the common comparison of proposed Internet micropayments to costs such as my electric bill rather specious, since every KWatt/Hour which comes out of my breaker panel is worth the same to me, and I know exactly what to expect from it.<p>I refuse to participate in any scheme which rewards the worthless 90% of a Sturgeon's Law universe equally to the valuable 10%.",1243541221.0
