It's also not by any means 'advanced'.<p>Also, the else shortcut should be seen as having different syntactic meaning. Instead of emphasizing it as a convenient shortcut, it should be seen as a particular variable has a default state and belongs to the lexical scope that the if statement is contained within (even though PHP doesn't recognize block statements as new lexical scopes).<p>Finally, ereg_ functions should never be used. And favoring str_* over preg_* only makes sense when a non-trivial[1] regular expression is not involved. The suggestion is tantamount to saying use a function for it's intended purpose. str_* functions search using a string, preg_* search using regular expressions.<p>[1] By non-trivial I mean a pattern that involves more than a terminal. E.g. '~hello~' is a valid regular expression but is composed of a single terminal, 'hello' (or if you wan to see it as five terminals) but nothing else (e.g. repeating, conditions, etc.) and so '~hello~' is a case where preg_* functions are overkill.",1227041583.0

On the test that Jeff linked to in his post, I scored 101 WPM. Throw in enough symbols and numbers and other non-standard stuff and I am forced to look at the keyboard occasionally which lowers that number significantly.<p>As someone coming back to Vim after years away, this is complicated by the need to memorize and be able to instantly recall a font of often complicated commands. I am so inefficient currently that if a task simply requires some copy/paste operations or I need to work with a very long file I will usually just fire it up in TextMate and use the dreaded mouse to speed things along.<p>I don't believe conventional typing courses are sufficient for gaining the sort of seamless connection talked about here because the focus is on proficiency in typing common characters / words. I much prefer the ""Words & Numbers"" test on that site (<a href=""http://typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed_alpha_numeric.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed_alpha_numeric.php</a>) because it forces the practice of shifting between common characters and less common ones.
