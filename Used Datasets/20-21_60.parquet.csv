Generator expressions, however, quickly become awkward when nested and don't really support joining or grouping data. Python has a groupby method and similar helpers, but they simply aren't as natural as the SQL-style syntax. Also, Linq puts the object being queried first to make it toolable (IntelliSense can offer completion for members in where and select clauses, etc).<p>I don't know much Ruby, but I'd suspect that blocks can simulate Linq far better than Python can. However, the Lambda-inspired syntax is a bit cluttered when compared to the SQL-inspired syntax.<p>Linq is a feature about 3 things:<p>1) Correctness via static typing checks<p>2) Interoperability of various data backends (Microsoft provides backends for XML, SQL, and .NET objects)<p>3) Clean and beautiful code<p>Neither Python nor Ruby can provide ",

I'd have to sign up to use the app, allowing it access to my user data, just to vote.  No thanks.  I bet most people who like the redesign don't want to jump through all the extra hoops to vote yes.",1237493783.0

66,523917,comment,523760.0,523856.0,0,0,arockwell,,,The one thing you're forgetting is that this happens _every_ time there's a new website redesign for Facebook. Its actually very typical for this to happen in general. People despise change will complain about a new design even if the design is much better. In a couple of weeks no one will even notice or think much of it.,1237493641.0

Is it just a way to build your vision, but you don't find it fun (enjoyable)? Both, perhaps? Obviously, this might not be just a black/white issue for a lot of people, too.",1237493623.0

This man makes 400,000 a year!""<p>Of course college doesn't guarantee that you'll come out making $100k a year or more, but also NOT going to college is the same.<p>As happy as I am for this person, I hope no one gets the wrong idea from these posts and just drops out. Having an idea is one thing, putting it together and having it be a success is another. If anything, I would say the YouTube and Facebook guys had it right, they made the product during college, released it during college, succeeded during college, and subsequently left college. Thats the way to do it IF ANY.<p>And for some people, school just isn't there thing. Anyways I'm rambling, I think my point has been made.",1237493545.0
