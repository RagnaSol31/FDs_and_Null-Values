That's not ""normal""- that's the person that has the Dr. Phil intervention on Oprah.""<p>The debt of our federal government is different than the 70k credit card debt of a person who makes 100k in two ways that somewhat cancel.<p>First, the interest rate that the federal government can get is remarkably low.  In fact, if we include inflation (which seems to be hard to peg right now), I would almost venture to guess that the interest rate might be negative.<p>On the other hand, it makes me uncomfortable that people compare the federal debt to the GDP because the GDP is a sort of total income for the nation.  What ought to matter is the relevant part of the income of the federal government.  I haven't found good data on what this income is (anyone?) but I think it is on the order of about 3 trillion.  It was about 2.5 trillion in 2006 according to Wikipedia.<p>Anyway, if we wanted to compare the national debt to consumer debt in terms of a debt load, this is about like having a person who owes about three times his annual income on a mortgage.  There are still two main differences.  One the one hand, there is no home that this mortgage has enabled us to enjoy.
