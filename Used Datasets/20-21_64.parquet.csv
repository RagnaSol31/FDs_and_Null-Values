There's easy-to-setup and use technology in pretty much all mail servers to check for and prevent that.<p>(I'd find it super neat however, if there were a program that took all of the president's emails and inserted extra random spaces/punctuation/etc. so that if there WERE leaks, they'd be identifiable.)",1233608361.0

You can argue all you want about how much <i>you</i> enjoy learning, but I imagine that the vast majority of the people in my high school could have cared less.
