25,478952,comment,478807.0,478807.0,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I feel pretty strongly about this one, and pretty confident in my assessment that more immigration of talented people is good for America. So instead of just commenting here, I took the time to write the author, hoping that I could start a dialogue and maybe understand where he's coming from and show him the other side of the story. Here's what I wrote:<p>--<p>Hi Bill,<p>I read your article about H1-B visas on Info World. I came from Hacker News, a great community where we share and talk about the newest articles in technology. I wanted to share a perspective I've got with you on visas, because maybe I have a bit of a unique one. My first studies before changing majors was in economics, and later I've done work in many countries around the world. In the last few years, I've worked or spent significant time in the United States, Canada, England, Ireland, Spain, Holland, Sweden, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Japan, and Dubai among other places. I'm an American myself, and I've got many American and international friends in lots of industries.<p>With a bit of background in economics and international business, I've come to think that having as many smart, hard-working people in the United States as possible is good for the country. I'll give you an example: A friend of mine in New York just got her green card. She's got two degrees, speaks fluent Japanese and near-native English, and works in medical devices. She'd been on an H-1B visa before getting her green card.<p>The USA is clearly better for her being here: She's done great work in the medical community in New York, and - this is another great part - she's actually created wealth and jobs in New York City. She saves a bit of her paycheck - the rest she spends on the things people spend on: Rent and groceries, movies and clothing, the salon and handbags, occasionally a class, public transit and taxis, and everything a standard American gal would spend on. Her work in medical devices has saved lives, people who can go on and be productive, and those people's insurance companies have paid her company for the technology. This means the company can hire more people into R&D, engineering, and support. The people who owe their lives to her can continue working and making money, and spending that money - thus creating new jobs.<p>I think the biggest potential issue with the H1-B program is that employees are bound to a particular company once hired, but it looks like at least the major companies pay their foreign employees on par with American workers. That means they're not hiring to keep wages down, but instead to get the best people. Great people in technology are able to find jobs quickly - there's a demand for them. But there's also genius-level people with amazing work ethics outside of the States that would love to come here and thrive. We want those people in America.<p>A final thought: Google co-founder Sergey Brin's parents immigrated to the United States when he was six years old from Russia. Currently, his father is a math professor at the University of Maryland, and his mother is a research scientist at NASA. Those are two jobs - math professor and research scientist - that could've been held by American citizens that instead went to newer immigrants. But how much better is the world because Brin's family worked hard to come here, worked hard in their jobs, raised Sergey well, and he created Google? You might have short term gains in helping people find jobs by locking out talented, hard working immigrats, but what do you give up for the future? I say - Open the doors to the world's best and brightest, and we'l come out with the most propsersity, good jobs, and amazing lives that we can.<p>Thank you for your time, and best wishes,<p>Sebastian Marshall",1234471059.0

Banks have ""bad debt"" that they can't value or sell.  It's not the value of their assets are zero they just don't know what that value is so they can't sell it our use it as collateral.  However, in time they will either be paid back or they will not and the uncertainty is going to become known.  As the risks drop off the financial system will start to recover on it's own.  And it's not like we need to wait 30 years for the loans to be paid back or fail, in 5 years inflation will tend to increase home prices and reduce the value of that bad debt.<p>I think having home prices drop and credit dry up is probably really good for the economy and suspect stimulus money spent on useful infrastructure is a much better use of taxpayers money, but I don't know.<p>PS: The banking sector was over valued in 2005, assuming it needs to go back to those prices before it's healthy is a mistake.",1234470680.0

Connections do not equal competence.  The best and the brightest in the service industries rarely need to network because they have built up an impressive track record over 20 to 30 years.  In Portland, you seem to get a lot of 20 somethings that spend all day blogging and tweeting about their skill but have never honed it.",1234469700.0

Our jobs depend on it.""<p>Is anyone going to buy into this garbage?<p><i>There is an infinite amount of work that can be done. The world is in no danger of running out of work, jobs, or good jobs.</i> The United States is much stronger because many of the most talented people want to come work here. And here's the big thing the author misses with his rah-rah-keep-our-jobs sentiment: <i>Additional workers in an economy create NEW jobs.</i><p>Simple example: Town of 100. 10 new people move into the town. Population now 110. They create additional demand for food, housing, entertainment, and other services. So the restaurants hire 10% more cooks and waitresses, the builder hires 10% more construction workers, and the bars hire 10% more bartenders. There's more openings for plumbers, maintenance men, and new businesses. Since there's more demand for people, businesses pay a bit more for them - now these people have money. Some of their money they spend on computing/technology - which creates more money for R&D, engineering, design, coding, etc.<p>Trying to limit highly skilled people from coming into your country is a really, really dumb idea. If some percent of the H-1 program is being used to get unskilled workers over to the USA, refine that. But I'll tell you - a good friend of mine just got her green card after working in medical devices on an H1-1B for years here in the USA. She speaks fluent Japanese and near-native English and has made a positive difference in New York City's medical community. Then she spends money eating out, on fashion and handbags and salons, on books and movies and DVDs and Broadway, and all sorts of other great things. She makes her $60,000 per year or whatever, and spends $55,000 back into the American economy, creating jobs for people across all social classes. Those people then have more money to spend in all sorts of sectors - including technology.<p>The more talented people in America, the better.",1234469190.0

I was an English major / mass communication minor planning to be a reporter until I started playing around with HTML while editing my college newspaper (way back in 1995).  I snagged a grunt job at Cooking Light magazine putting their content online, and just went from there.  I don't know of anyone who set out to become a product manager, but it's a great career for certain people.  Having an engineering, UI design, or even customer service background helps a lot.  For consumer-facing web sites, just being a very heavy web user is an absolute requirement.  Some MBA's are good in the role, but too often they see the role as a stepping stone to other opportunities. Hope this helps.",1234468833.0
