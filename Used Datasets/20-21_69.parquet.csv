An XMPP solution is appealing for the obvious benefits of having a ""presence"" concept, but an AMQP solution keeps us closer to the current reality of Twitter.<p>So we start with a large distributed rabbit setup.  A few clusters scattered across the world, connected via shovel pipes and using some nested queue/exchange plumbing to wire it all together.<p>> full-text search<p>Some queues dump to a FTS setup that keeps recent messages in RAM and migrates them to disk as they get older.  SOLR is probably a better solution here, but I know the Sphinx delta/full-index model better and would reach for that first.<p>> archiving<p>Dump a firehose queue to disk and send copies/updates out to various services that want it.  Pushing it to HDFS would probably be the first choice I would look at, just because it is easy to go from there to various Hadoop analytics.<p>> deletions<p>Nothing is ever deleted, it just becomes invisible.  This is  just a flag to add to the FTS indexes and archives.<p>> dynamic subscription changes, access restriction<p>Handled completely by the message queues.<p>> open APIs with quotas, abuse detection mechanisms, spam fighting algorithms, different authentication protocols, etc.<p>None of these is particularly difficult once you have the general framework setup, and the structure of the system actually makes it pretty easy to wire in things like realtime abuse and spam prevention once you get rolling.  There is only one thing hard about building a better Twitter, getting the userbase to make it worthwhile.

Why? Because not only does this give the user the ability to close a number of tabs in one go without moving the mouse pointer (which Safari does not), it also means that the app does not need to exhibit the ever-so-slightly less normal behaviour of the ‘delayed resizing’ in the most-common case.</i><p>I would also wager that while Chrome is available on other operating systems, it's probably catering to Windows users by keeping the close buttons (be it a Window or Tab) on the right where <i>most</i> user expect them to be. Similarly, Safari, more at home on OSX than any other OS, would cater to those users by keeping it on the left.<p>As for the slick behavior Chrome emits when working with Tabs, I'll admit I never noticed it.

If someone feels the itch to write about something they really care about, and doesn't want to bother with more formal methods of publication, I think that blogging is one of the best things they can do with their time. It is not like they are producing nothing; they are producing something that will -- hopefully -- propagate ideas and critical thinking. This sounds like a very good thing. Not all problems that are looking for an answer will have that answer found in a block of code; sometimes the wetware needs to be refactored.<p>The second is that people who blog more than infrequently are apt to be technically rusty, and should be subject of suspicion. This make me suspicious of those who would assert that. Again, based on what assumption? I agree with the claim that if they blog more they have less time for other things besides blogging; rollover minutes only work on some cellphones. But to claim that because they blog more they <i>know</i> less; this is quite an extraordinary claim. It wants to lump everyone who blogs a lot in with the blowhards. What if someone has a lot to say, and thinks it is important to get those ideas out? It sounds like you would tell that person to shut up and get back to work. I worry about the consequences of this.",1260476195.0
