On the other hand, if you stand up, go to the whiteboard, and start writing things down, while talking them through your train of though (""Well I'm not positive how to do fractions in other bases, but this way makes sense to me"" and then proceed to work out the problem as best as you can) then you show more motivation and enthusiasm.",1205614601
