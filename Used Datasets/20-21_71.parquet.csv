7,660874,comment,659976.0,660120.0,0,0,GHFigs,,,"I've found that thinking love/hate is not sufficiently granular for most problems and rarely suggestive of many solutions. It can be good for making very high level emotionally charged decisions like whether you want to even stay in school or not, but when it comes to implementing those decisions, you often need to be more specific about your feelings to figure out exactly what needs to change.<p>There is a chart in Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's classic <i>Flow</i>, that I've found enligtening.  It shows the ""flow channel"", the desirable state where the activity seems friction-free, surrounded by anxiety on one side and boredom on the other.  Most people don't think of activities this way, where the goal is a mean rather an an extreme.<p>I've found that every instance of procrastination or avoidance in my life stems from anxiety or boredom irrespective of things like desire, enjoyment, or willpower, while all of the things I do get done are things that I don't feel much anxiety or boredom about, likewise irrespective of desire, enjoyment or willpower.  (Those factors only seem to come into play with planning what to do, not in actually doing them.)<p>So it follows that the way to get things done is to figure out whether the problem is anxiety or boredom and then do what you can to counterbalance it back towards the flow channel. If you're procrastinating on something because you find it boring, the way to become motivated is to make it more exciting. Add constraints, make it more challenging, tighten deadlines, expand scope, batch repetitive tasks, turn necessary goals into desirable ones, etc. If you're procrastinating on something because it makes you anxious, the way to become motivated is to make it less exciting.  Remove constraints, reduce the challenge, loosen deadlines, break up tasks into small pieces, reduce the harm of mistakes, reduce risk, etc.<p>What that means specifically depends on what bores you or causes anxiety and how much control you have over circumstances, but I think there is always something you can do on a practical and tactical level to bring any activity towards that channel where you don't have to force yourself into doing it.",1245185733.0

17,660864,comment,660708.0,660708.0,0,0,biohacker42,,,"It has been very interesting to watch the information flow in Iran.<p>Full disclosure: I was born and raised behind the iron curtain so I've thought a lot about autocratic regimes and network theory.<p>It's very difficult if not impossible to stop a human wave revolution. Even if the police have guns and the protesters don't, it is usually impossible to stop, regimes just topple.<p>Violent regime change by small groups of people also happens, but I want to concentrate on the classic <i>thrown off by the populace</i> scenario.<p>To keep a population down, to have a police state and stay in power you need some percentage X of that population to function as police.<p>To do it by brute force requires such a large X that it's hard to function as a state, see North Korea.<p>But you can get away with a much smaller X if you can disrupt the formation of a human wave. And the best way to do that is fear, intimidation and preventing the flow of information.<p>That's why police states spy on their people and control the media. Parades are for propaganda, except they can also turn to bad, see Romania and Ceauşescu.<p>The spying is not about getting everyone who's dissatisfied with the regime. It's about getting at least some of the super links, and intimidating the rest.<p>Controlling the media is about preventing synchronization, you want to prevent EVERYONE going out on the street at the same time.<p>So no braking news, or reports of demonstrations. If there are large demonstrations anywhere, you definitely don't put that on TV, much less live TV.  Even industrial accidents are suppressed and then slowly leaked over time, days.<p>You just don't want to give anyone a reason to panic. Controlling a populace like that is very much like crowd control, it's even somewhat similar to how you control an animal that could kill you if it got spooked, like a horse.<p>That control occasionally slips.  Soccer is huge in the rest of the world and soccer matches are live even in autocratic regimes. And usually that's not a problem.<p>Except when a soccer riot at live soccer match starts a revolution.<p>Interestingly, I recall hearing that North Korea would not show the South Korean team's games in the soccer world cup live.<p>And what Iran is doing is very smart. Evil but smart. Shutting down Facebook and youtube is smart. Why they left Twitter open is anyone's guess.<p>Breaking up the crowds while they are still small, announcing fake rallies is poisoning the information well.<p>Given how important information is to regime change, I am stunned the CIA has not done more to make Facebook unblockable, or at least difficult to block. Or airdropped encrypted satellite cell phones on the crowds.<p>I am surprised and depressed there aren't free information distribution tools being made and given away by the NSA, CIA, etc to everybody living in autocratic regimes.<p>It saddens me to think this is because they fear those tools could be used against friendly dictators.<p>Watching the brutality of the police in Iran, how they beat people, students, women, anyone, I keep thinking to myself:<p>Iran needs soccer hooligans. Iran needs semi-pro, British, well organized, taking-hooliganism-as-a-serious-hobby, with many years experience hooligans. And lots of them. Why are we not parachuting them into Tehran?<p>You can also watch the crowds react, flow around blockades or confront them when numbers are on their side.<p>And the police go from bullies to running away as fast as the balance of numbers changes.<p>Watching has been painful, but Iran is after all the nation that used the human wave attack in the Iran-Iraq war, so I can't help but expect that to happen to the current regime soon.",1245185283.0

He talks about running translators for analog television to provide PBS access to his local community.  He concludes that analog signals are easy to work with, and then contrasts this with digital: 'If you want to really examine the signal itself, you need an expensive device that is able to recognize the signal and help you debug what's going on. Of course, our small TV organization cannot afford the cost of such a device, so most of the time, we can only guess.'<p>This seems misguided, and like an attempt to fix the problem with the wrong tools.  Sure, it's difficult to diagnose the problem with an oscilloscope, but with cheap digital tuner cards available it seems like it should be possible to do a similar analysis in software.  If one was tasked with retransmitting a DTV signal, it seems like the solution would be to decode (with error correction if possible) rather than blindly retransmitting the signal as analog.

How does it aggregate?<p>Draw some pictures - what might it look like, what might it be integrated into a site? Etc.<p>In my mind, reputation is the summary of a series of transactions. Ebay's user reputation comes directly to mind. How they will interact across sites seems challenging -- I have 1000 points on news.yc and 2000 followers on twitter; how do they interact?

(Rule out real-time with my parents' place.)<p>As opposed to our current model where the app writer hosts said new form of spontaneous collaboration (e.g., twitter, skype) on servers and mom and dad discover the service through word of mouth.  Then mom and dad install clients where appropriate (e.g., twitter on both computer and cell phone, or skype on macbook with built-in camera).  And then there's Google Wave which seems like a better platform for new forms of spontaneous collaboration (more robust, easier to determine recipients/access, open & published protocol).<p>The main benefit of the Opera system seems to be the app/service store, which adds discoverability, and the url namespace through its proxy service.  If there is a market due to these strengths, I'd expect Google's new Wave platform to do better.",1245183457.0

It's hard to demonstrate all the things you <i>don't</i> have to care about with GC. Making a <i>good</i> demo that shows you don't need to worry about memory leaks, double freeing, memory corruption, etc is hard. The same is true of making a good demo for STM that illustrates all of the problems you don't have to worry about compared to locks.<p>I think the ants demo is a good idea technically.
