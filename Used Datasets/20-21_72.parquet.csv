No way on earth that an individual piece of rental real estate is less risky than a basket of stocks in my mind.<p>If I were you, I'd stay away from any store of value that is dollar denominated (other than perhaps TIPS), as I believe that the US will have to devalue the dollar to pay its debt.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis reports that between 1986 and 2005, foreign sales of U.S. motion-picture and video products rose from $1.91 billion to $10.4 billion (in 2005 dollars)â€”an increase of 444 percent. As Dan Glickman, president of the Motion Picture Association says, ""Among all the sectors of the U.S. economy, our industry is the only one that generates a positive balance of trade in every country in which it does business."" The same is true for the TV and music industries, and the reach is far greater when piracy is figured in.<p>I rather wonder how much the figures increase when all entertainment is included (sports, video games, etc.).",1256501892.0

The thing I've noticed about San Francisco is the best apartments aren't available in advance.  They go on the market a week or so before they're ready to move in.  The frustrating part here is that you have to put in your 30-day notice at your previous apartment before you have a new place -- super stressful (unless you're willing to pay double-rent for a bit, which is often times economical given the rent break you get in the new place).<p>I've had pretty good luck with Craigslist, subscribing to feed(s) of the various neighborhood/price ranges I'm looking in and <i>hounding</i> that feed.  A lot of places are only up on CL for a few hours before they're taken down or have a waiting list impossibly long.<p>On a related note: it may be <i>much</i> easier if you don't look for studios.  While San Francisco is an older city -- most of the older buildings you'd expect to find lofts/studios in burned/collapsed in previous decades.
