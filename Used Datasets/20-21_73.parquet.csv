Corporations are more “efficient” than the government because of the “natural selection” of our capitalist system.<p>2. Corporations are therefore better than the government at everything.<p>3. Corporations should be the government, or at least in control of it.""<p>That's just plainly not true.  The ""anarcho-capitalist"" bunch may be saying that, but that does not qualify as most Libertaran doctrine, and certainly not the mainstream libertarian doctrine.  Point 1, yes, but not 2 or certainly not 3.<p>Force corrupts everything, especially the production of wealth.  That is why force needs to be separated out.  Individuals and corporations must not be allowed to initiate force against others, that's why we have the government to enforce that.  But since the government can and must use force to do its necessary duties, it is inherently inefficient at everything else.  That is why we need a separation.  Corporations should not ""be the government"" or be in control of it.<p>He then goes on to talk about Libertarians defining ""efficiency"" as ""speed"" and knocks down that position.

The coverage of Khodorkovski's fate was seriously slanted on both sides of the border. Well, unsurprisingly as a lot of money and power was at stake on both sides. Later the coverage of  Russian-Georgian conflict suffered the same fate and just now there is a row over natural gas supplies to Europe which gets some odd coverage.<p>The most interesting battles to watch are the ones where usually rational discourse turns into a foaming-at-the-mouth fight with a lot of stretches.

16,428315,comment,428018.0,428298.0,0,0,smanek,,,"I would contend that bias has to do more with interpretation of facts, than of facts themselves (although, obviously, you can create bias through selective presentation of facts as well). Basically, it reduces to which side of the is-ought dichotomy (Hume) a statement falls on. Anything on the 'is' side is fair game. Anything on the ought side is opinion (which is fine), but should not be enforced.<p>An example of bias might be a professor positing (outside an econ class) that we should bail out the auto industry. That statement, while on its face reasonable, implicitly assumes a number of 'positive rights' that most conservatives don't grant. It further assumes that a bailout is the best way to guarantee those positive rights, which is outside the purview of anything but an economics class.<p>Improper bias may be the teacher grading assignments disagreeing with his thesis (and its implicit liberal assumptions) more harshly than papers agreeing with his thesis. Obviously, this would be very hard to show - but if it is happening, it would be extremely bad.<p>And honestly, you'd have to be a complete moron to think there is right wing bias in american universities. Liberal professors outnumber conservative professors at least 5 to 1 (far more in some departments/schools).
