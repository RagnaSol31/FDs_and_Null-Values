Let's say there is this amazing piece of software that everyone loves, and then the developer decides to stop developing it.

Dealing with related data (in forms and saving) had always been quite a pain and they've done a great job of making that a lot easier.<p>Some things not mentioned in the slideshow that were important (at least in my opinion):<p>* Dynamic scopes: you can say Article.scope_by_XXX and it will allow you to use scopes without explicitly naming all of them.<p>* Batch processing: this allows you to get the results of a query in smaller batches so that you don't have to load everything into memory at once.<p>* Rack support: it's nice to have Rails being able to be deployed in the way that the community is going for Ruby apps.<p>* Try: probably one of the best additions. It allows you to say @person.spouse.try(:first_name).  Normally, if the person didn't have a spouse and you did @person.spouse.first_name you'd get an exception saying that nil (which is what @person.spouse would evaluate to) doesn't have a method first_name - which is true.  This way you don't have to keep saying, ""only call @person.spouse.first_name if the @person has a spouse"".<p>* Application Templates: These are basically shortcut files you can make for setting up a new project.  We all have slight variants and we can set up the default things we want in all our applications so we aren't starting from such a blank slate (and that way you don't forget to do things like create a .gitignore file before you put your database password out there for the world to see).",1238446437.0

11,539123,comment,538473.0,538656.0,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I don't think it's that straightforward. Loanwords happen overwhelmingly with vocabulary, and not grammar. While this is obvious, the implications are thus: the closer to script of the origin language to the borrower language, it is exceedingly easy to take the target word wholesale. Since the grammar is relatively stable, you can easily make the case that the loanword, whose <i>origin</i> is language X, is no longer language X, but language Y, the borrower's native language.<p>That is, words like ""tempo,"" ""crescendo,"" and ""forte"" are Italian in origin, but who's going to say, no, they're not English? They're native enough.<p>Now, let's take a discipline with non-English terms. Take Go for example. There are many terms in Go that are shared between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean schools. They can be written similarly in hanzi/kanji/hanja, with two catches: 1., the same characters are read differently in different places; 2., Westerners, using exclusively the Latin alphabet for their native needs, cannot read the hieroglyphs.<p>The result? What term should English speakers use? Pick one! Which one? Whichever! For Go, the Western world picked Japanese. You have ko, moku, seki... So which was the common language? There are now two answers. First, there was a common <i>script</i>, which was Chinese characters. Second, there was a commonized <i>pronunciation</i>, which came from Romanized Japanese.<p>It's not a ""so happens to be"" thing. It's a speed and scale of adoption thing, and in this way it is a ""majority wins"" game. And here, the winner is the Latin alphabet. To come around, I would suspect there are few disciplines that do not turn into a Latin-alphabet-standardized-, and in effect, English-, field.",1238446257.0

He may be an impressive salesman, but that only seems to make up for the lack of anything remotely interesting about what he is doing for the product <i>now</i>.  Sure, it was an innovative concept when it first came out, but after four years of using Blackboard during college, it feels like he missed the boat on improving a product.  I wonder if Blackboard is so popular now because of a bandwagon-effect instead of because of being a great product.  There's so many things they could be doing to solidify themselves as a truly awesome (and modern) product that they're not.  They still feel like software we were using back in 2002.
