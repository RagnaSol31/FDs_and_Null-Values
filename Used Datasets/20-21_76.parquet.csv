Good for end user experience.<p>Flash on mobile/touch: Not an industry standard. In fact it doesn't really <i>exist</i> yet other than Flash Lite or Nokia's custom version of Flash for the N900. There is an opportunity to move away form Flash here in favor of HTML5 on the web. For native apps obviously Apple would prefer people to use their proprietary platform instead of Adobe's proprietary platform.
