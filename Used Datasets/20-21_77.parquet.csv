Office, then I'll be worried.<p>>  If it's not, everyone is at the mercy of one company.<p>I don't know about that. I've heard it from Stallman's talks but it's too dramatic for my taste. What people should be worrying about is open specs to protocols and file formats.<p>The best example of a software monopoly is Windows, and if Windows was the only operating system available, then we'd surely be at the mercy of one company.<p>But that's not the case and while some people can point to the GPL as the catalyst, that's not necessarily the case. It might be the technology's fast pace or the academia which has always favored collaboration, not to mention that the open source model of development is in many ways just better.<p>I don't think software is the domain in which monopolies can be established indefinitely.",1242248222.0

Nothing can truly be trusted from whether there is any ""me"" to survive death all the way down to the accuracy of memory and the individual perceptions of my senses. Some more fundamental assumptions are more solid than others - such as the assumption that what I perceive through my senses reflects an objective reality that you also perceive through your senses. I only want to lock down a particular assumption in the context of solving a particular problem and only so far as empirical evidence supports. I want to mark down the appropriate set of assumptions (with perhaps a common base that is ""identity"") as known and solid then attempt to solve my problem and move on or revisit assumptions as required. So, my actions and values are in a constant state of doubt and while certain of my base beliefs seem very solid now - so did rejected beliefs of yesterday. This is my only core belief, that it is best to keep an empty mind, a mind free of preconceptions making minimal operational assumptions based only on empirical evidence (as time allows).

And yeah, that's pretty sick from an employee perspective, but great if you want to protect yourself as a company.  When I was employed, I actually read my contract, so I had a side-note added with exceptions.  If you're involved in any open source project, that's probably a smart thing to do.
