The list of expiring domains is of course very long, so I created a little script to help me find just the best ones. I used some dictionaries to match against, and for a while I also had some traffic data. I made a UI around this tool and posted it on the web. People seemed to like it and it got to the top pages of Digg, Reddit and del.icio.us. This was in December 2006. Just a few days after the initial burst of traffic, it was down to 100 visit per day, and is currently at 50 visits per day, making an incredible $5/month from AdSense.<p>I wanted to ask you smart devs whether there is anything you can think of that would make the tool more sticky, to turn the flatlined traffic into a growing trend? I find myself keeping the script somewhat operational, in hopes I would come up with something, but it's now been two years already and my mind is blank.<p>http://expired-domain.bemmu.com/",1228337165.0
17,384774,comment,384698.0,384762.0,0,0,Anon84,,,"This one is pretty interesting also... and from someone with real world experience.<p>66,'Rahul Patwari,'I am not a company, but a physician who works in an urban emergency department. Every day I see the costs of inefficient health care delivery. There is a monetary costs in unnecessary tests and the time delays they cause. There is a cost to patients in that the stretched resources end up inappropriately distributed. There is a cost to physicians who are burdened with an ever growing fund of knowledge which is impossible with which it\'s impossible to keep up. This eventually leads to medical malpractice lawsuits which are a drain to our legal and medical systems. ','A small but significant step in improving all of these problems is making it easy for physicians to practice with the latest standards-of-care. My solution is to use the iPhone as a platform to deliver diagnostic and treatment plans based on the current literature. For example, imagine a patient with a stroke. The physician, using his iPhone, can determine if he meets the criteria to receive blood-clot dissolving medication, or determine if that would pose too great a risk of fatal bleeds in the brain. X-rays can be ordered according to established guidelines instead of the gestalt/gut-feeling of the physician. These rules have been shown to be very sensitive in finding fractures, yet at the same time reducing the number of unnecessary x-rays. The applications are quite broad. ','There is no product like this available. The technology isn\'t difficult, just a bunch of algorithms organized properly: cardiovascular, neurological, orthopedics, etc. Right now the information is there in the medical literature and unwieldy text books. My idea is simply to bring them together into one easy-to-use program. The iPhone is a device many physicians already carry, and if not, are looking at buying. This would be a reason to do so. What makes this device unique is that these decisions/calculations can be done bedside (with the doctor holding the iPhone). When done, it can be easily slipped back into a pocket. ','There is no product like this available. There really won\'t be competition for this product as I intend to give this away for free. There is no reason that the patient in a poorer urban hospital shouldn\'t have access to the same care that a patient coming to a richer hospital would get. If everyone can practice the same degree of quality care, I sincerely believe we can improve our delivery of health care and possibly even to more people. It will be a long while before concrete changes in health care delivery will arrive, but this may help. ','Rahul Patwari, MD. Board Certified Emergency Physician, Chicago, IL.

Subsequently I did my medical training at the University of Illinois at Chicago and completed my residency in Emergency Medicine at Chicago\'s Cook County Hospital.

At some point I'm sure even companies like Google and Genentech, which tried to maintain the startup feeling, start to feel pretty corporate.<p>So I would agree insofar as to say that startups will become the <i>de facto</i> standard method of commercializing new technology, but I don't think they will ever represent a significant portion of the economy as far as the number of people employed. Having such a small percentage of the population involved in startups doesn't afford them much opportunity to affect social norms on a large scale.<p>Short of complete automation, big organizations will always be best at doing commodity things like picking up your trash and making your shirts. Even once those particular tasks are automated, big organizations will grow (often from startups) elsewhere to tackle new commodity goods and services.

More than ever, the airlines and government regulations make life difficult, with lost baggage, long security lines, weather delays, maintenance delays, and confusing gate changes all commonplace. The information necessary to alleviate many travel headaches is actually available, but it\'s not integrated in one place in a usable format, and certainly not in one place that travelers have easy access to. Fortunately, business travelers tend to have money to spare, and they are willing to do anything that will make their traveling experience less painful, however incremental the improvement to their life may be.','The iPhone is the perfect medium to deliver an integrated view of a travel itinerary. Far beyond the dates and times that most people assume itineraries to be limited to, Think\'s iPhone application would bring in data from airlines\' baggage tracking databases, flight arrival and departure information, frequent flier mile numbers and historical information, historical gate, flight number and airline delay information, and weather maps. It could also eventually be used to check into flights without having to wait in line to see an agent or use a kiosk. The bar codes that almost all airlines currently print on paper to create boarding passes could be easily displayed on an iPhone\'s high-resolution LCD screen. Essentially, the iPhone could keep track of every aspect of a traveler\'s life, and it would become an essential business tool as a result. The buzz surrounding the application could boost sales for Think, Apple, and even the airlines themselves, who desperately need the revenue.','Think Computer Corporation has a number of existing technology assets that would be helpful in the development of a web-based solution for the iPhone. Its Lampshade® LAMP framework makes web-based application development quick and easy. Think\'s CommonRoom social network is designed to give professionals and academics a secure way to share data and communicate. (It could be a useful integration point for Think\'s iPhone Travel application later on.) Think also has developed Exponent, a full-fledged business accounting system, similar to Oracle Financials or NetSuite. It could be extremely helpful for providing an easy way to track employee reimbursement expenses in the long term.','The Blackberry could also be used to provide similar features hypothetically, but no application exists to date (to our knowledge) that integrates everything in one place as proposed above.','Aaron Greenspan started Think from his bedroom in Shaker Heights, Ohio at the age of 15. While he attended high school, Aaron grew Think to support more than 150 businesses, individuals and schools across the United States and Canada. He subsequently changed the focus of the company from IT consulting to software development. Today, Think sells a line of web-based applications and software development tools including Lampshade, CommonRoom, Exponent, and Whiteboard.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Aaron was the first place winner of the Junior Achievement Young IT Entrepreneur of the Year Award. He was also awarded the Kodak Young Leaders award, and has spoken at the NASA Kennedy Space Center. In October of 2000, Aaron spearheaded the creation of Think Computer Foundation, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization with the goal of helping children through technology. Aaron invented The Facebook while attending Harvard College in September, 2003. He graduated cum laude from Harvard in three years (Advanced Standing) with an A.B. in Economics in 2004.','Joel Sadler is a graduate student studying Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University.

Or would you argue that a development like that is similarly higher-res?",1228335154.0

If Nintendo releases a new videogame system they'll sell millions the first day, and yet 2/3 of American children still don't get their daily RDI of calcium.<p>The problem is that processes are much more important than products in terms of quality of life, health care, child development, business, education, etc. And while technological progress is increasing exponentially, the rate of best-practice adoption remains flat.<p>It seems like the American dream is being able to purchase the solution to any one of life’s problems in a big f<i></i>*ing box at Wal-Mart for less than 200 bucks. Consumers are already really well trained at this, and we need to figure out a way to leverage this behavior to get them to adopt new processes. The problem as I see it is threefold:<p>1) People don't know about best practices<p>2) They know about a best practice but they aren't sold on it<p>3) They're sold on it but it's too hard<p>So far as I can see it, the only way for America to remain competitive with the rest of the world is to make the adoption of best practices an order of magnitude easier. We might be temporarily ahead of everyone else in terms of getting the smartest kids to go out and join or start their own businesses, but in terms of nearly every other best practice we're falling drastically behind.<p>The reality is that we live in a society where doctors don't wash their hands before surgery, where shoddy farm practices cause excessive soil erosion, where pregnant women eat fish high in mercury and PCBs, etc. America is certainly getting more high-res in response to change, but is the catalyzing change really technological? Corporations are great at buying stuff, it's the best practices they are really slow at adopting. The fact that corporations are breaking down into smaller units seems to be a synechdoche of society at large falling apart due to the same set of failures.",1228335091.0

I'd like to note that (while it wasn't the focus of the essay), many of the expensive ""checks"" aren't there for monetary reasons, but rather human safety and the dire consequences of a poor decision.<p>Working at Motorola on cell phone code could be a great way to give everyone in the modern world a cool new feature - or accidentally break 20+% of all phones out there. A terrible Mickey Mouse movie could destroy a brand. Take it a step further to NASA, vehicle engine design (and safety), oil pipelining and refining, etc. and the cost could be human lives.<p>That said, I'm very interested in the cost of these ""checks"" on those industries.

Anyone who has worked with a pure OO language knows that there's nothing inherently imperative about the approach.  Just because the most popular OO languages (C++, Java) ultimately force you to have a main() doesn't mean that a procedure is <i>required</i> to write OO code.  That's more a reflection of the OS execution model than the language used to write the app.<p>I've personally written CORBA apps that were asynchronous, distributed and multi-threaded -- in C++.

It may not be in the code that is checked out, but it is in the history, which does not look like it can be removed easily.<p>Also, it's awkward to use - you can't be working and then just create a bookmark, work some more, then go back to where you diverged easily - you have to create a new bookmark at the diverge point, which you have to look up.  If you try to create two bookmarks at the same time (so one will stay where you where and the other will move forward) it will (for some reason) move both bookmarks forward (which is pretty confusing).<p>Apparently, the only way to _really_ do what git does with local branching is to do what the hg book recommends, which is to do a local clone.  This takes orders of magnitude more time (depending on the repo), doubles the space taken up on disk and clutters your disk with a bunch of directories.<p>It may be slightly better than the local branches in hg in that it isn't recorded in the commit itself, but 'bookmarks' are very much not git branches.",1228334627.0
