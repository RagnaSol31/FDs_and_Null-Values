I hadn't really thought about going so far as enforcing function signatures, though it's the logical next step after enforcing s-expression validity.<p>There are lots of different types of ""structure errors"" and I think some should be strictly enforced while others shouldn't. In the s-expression case, one example of something that should be enforced strictly is the nesting of parentheses that delimit s-expressions. Fortunately that one is pretty easy. Wereas in a traditional editor you'd do:<p><pre><code>  (|\n  ()|\n  (|)\n</code></pre>\nas 3 different steps, in a structure editor you'll simply have one operation that will do all this atomically so you go from one correct state to the next. In the function arity case, I think a much more lax enforcement is de rigueur. There will always be some editing tasks that will require less rigid rules but I think we should value correctness by default and <i>then</i> introduce laxity in controlled ways where it makes sense. It's a tradeoff similar to how limiting side-effects by default is a restriction that can make a program more powerful, yet sometimes you really want to have some mutable state.<p>edit: I'd add that my end goal for a structure editor is that it may better assist the user in his editing tasks by having a better understanding of the context. The validity enforcement is only a means to facilitate this and should be relaxed wherever it impedes the user rather than helping.",1232311481.0

It's true that a structure editor would probably be more efficient on that level, but it's only a very minor bonus compared to the real advantages of the computer always being fully aware of the editing context you're in (thus helping in ways it normally couldn't), and without the need to write such a complex piece of software as a reliable incremental parser.<p>If you're saying that the keystroke savings are not worth it, I'll have to admit the very simple example I used doesn't make it seem very worthwhile, but the benefits of a structure editor would become much more obvious the more you looked at complex examples of the kind of thing it could do.<p>I didn't even talk about the modification of structure yet.

Names are escaping me but from time to time there've been structure-editing ""text editors"" that have you work at the correct ""syntax"" layer, instead of the level of raw text.<p>What I'm thinking of are various ""editors"" that are not only syntax-aware (like in the syntax highlighting sense) but that literally enforce the program syntax, and make it difficult-to-impossible to input a ""bad"" program (bad as in syntax, or bas as in correct-syntax-but-wrong-argument-types).<p>If that's not what you're getting at you can probably ignore this.<p>Generally these structure editors haven't been that well-received and most die on the vine as academic projects. I wish I remembered the names but ""structure editor"" should help you find stuff.<p>Here's the annoyances I remember:<p>- You're right, if you already have a mostly-correct program in your head a properly-functioning structure editor should help you get it onto the screen a lot faster, and with fewer stupid typo-level errors creeping in. The more the language has stupid boilerplate like html's close-tags, the more keystrokes you look to save.<p>- But: the trickier thing to get right is how to handle <i>editing</i> existing code.<p>If you're just writing html-in-lisp in an ordinary text editor, you don't have much to worry about here.<p>If you're writing html-in-lisp in a structure editor that makes it hard to get into an invalid (meaning: contrary-to-language-grammar) state, even something as simple as re-ordering lines can become a royal pain; this gets even worse the more you do cutesy things like write macros to auto-generate some types of output, or try to be smart about how you parse the program being written.<p>Here's an example: I define a format-product-row function that takes an item sku, price, thumbnail url, and product name argument and generates some html output (python notation below):<p>def FormatProductRow(sku, price, thumbnailURL, productName): BLAH<p>Your super-helpful structure editor sees this definition and memorizes the function name and required arguments.<p>I then proceed to write a bunch of code that makes use of FormatProductRow, and each time I use that function in my code your helpful structure editor reminds me of the arguments it takes and doesn't let me make mistakes by having the wrong ",

Your financial situation is likely not better than it was, but I sold almost $15,000 alone, as did 2 other people in the TV department. As a store, we made 275% to our budget today. And that's even with people mad that it's ""only"" 10% off. Our regular sales blew the liquidation prices away, but it was a ghost town for the last month. That flow would've been nice, and might have been able to save our company...<p>...I don't know what's worse: the vultures at the liquidation companies that mark prices up before marking them down and will fire a CC employee for taking off 11% instead of 10% if their math was wrong, or the vulturesque customers that complain that they're getting ripped off on the sale that they were never forced to make...  Picking at a dead and rotting company's carcass when it could have been saved is why I call you [the liquidation companies and customers] vultures.""",1232309201.0

The most heartbreaking experience of the whole ordeal, were the customers that showed up on that day. These were not the same people that usually came to our store. Something had changed. They all had greed in their eyes. Not one single person that came into the store was the least bit sympathetic towards our situation. Not one person said they were sorry to hear myself and thousands of others would be losing our jobs. No one, not a single one gave a damn.<p>The only thing on their minds was how much money they were saving. They asked how much a certain product was marked down, and regardless of my answer would then demand that I take off more. When I tried to explain I was not allowed to lower the price further, many would become angry, some would actually start screaming! Some without hesitation, would even call me a ""liar"" when I told them the product was already marked down below cost.""",1232309084.0
