In the US, teaching methods are NOT optimized for mathematical proficiency. They are designed to implement a ""progressive"" social agenda, ""social justice,"" that puts ""closing the achievement gap"" ahead of all other considerations. The more rigorous the math curriculum, the more obvious our achievement gap, so the progressive ed schools have decided to de-emphasize objectively measurable math performance and emphasize other things that reveal less of an achievement gap.<p>Instead of reasoning through geometry problems and ""finding the measure of angle A,"" which can be easily graded for correctness, we have them increase the amount of time spent ""engaging in mathematical discourse."" (""Who can name a job that uses math?"") Of course all answers are correct so, voila, no more achievement gap.<p>We de-emphasize calculational proficiency--too likely to produce an achievement gap--and emphasize ""conceptual understanding,"" which sounds great and can mean whatever you need it to mean for political purposes. ""Do we all understand that there are many ways to multiply?"" Sure we do!<p>Instead of ""find the answers to these problems,"" our kids are assigned to ""find pictures in magazines of math being used in real life, cut them out, and bring them to class."" This is called ""engagement."" Who can't cut pictures out of magazines? Bye-bye achievement gap, hello social justice.<p>While the East Asians train their primary math teachers in techniques that have been found to maximize math proficiency, our teachers get a very different sort of preparation for teaching out kids:<p><a href=""http://www.city-journal.org/html/8_2_a1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.city-journal.org/html/8_2_a1.html</a><p>Read the above article, consider what the proficiency-focused Asian schools are doing instead, and imagine the implications for our future.",1284238474.0

I don't see how this is being subservient to anyone.  Wouldn't a better policy be to assume no problem and only raise the issue if they raise it first?

However, as soon as an on-duty public official exceeds his or her authority in an offensive way (like if the officer demanded your help or shot your dog [1]), he or she deserves no gracious human-to-human ""emotional"" kindness from you.  On top of that, I wouldn't consider any of this guy's answer impolite, unethical, or even impractical.  Sure, your exact wording might be better to avoid being hassled, but there's no guarantee of that, plus not everyone is good at wording things tactfully especially when they're being wronged.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mvIWFXbHNo",

77,1682265,comment,1681607.0,1681978.0,0,0,code_duck,,,"Excellent question. Check out the comments. A few members of the community have questioned why they chose this elaborate process, which actually ended up with the new images actually having noticeably lower quality. This was noticed by the artists themselves, too, as Etsy's customers labor for a long time to get the highest quality photos possible. Etsy's response when this was brought up in the member forums was that they 'learned from this' and would take note for the future... a more satisfying response would be ""we acknowledge that the images are inadequate and we'll re-do them"".<p>Why Etsy thought they had to seek new image algorithms rather than just using the ones they already used is the sort of question they very rarely answer. My analysis is that it is related to the fact that they did the processing on an Amazon server. To save bandwidth, transfer time and processing time, they sent over the medium sized images rather than the original, full size image. Of course, that doesn't explain why they decided to do it in 'the cloud' at all rather than, as you say, just operate directly on the file system, in house.<p>They claim to have gone through an elaborate comparison process, apparently with the visual quality comparison being done by engineers - not people specializing in the non-technical side of photography or graphics. They seem to have entirely missed the quality issue, though it was apparent enough to customers that at least a hundred of them brought it up in the forums once the switch to the new image sizes was made.",1284236370.0
