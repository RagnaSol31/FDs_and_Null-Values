I am or used to be a publisher with the top three Burst Media, Fastclick/ValueClick, and Tribal Fusion. Like any ad agency, they have rules. No porn, for example. But more importantly, they target users and in the end let them choose what goes on their website. So with those controls, I, who ran a site regularly visited by children had the option to say no to political, religious, and sex-related ads.<p>The network's filters varied. Some had me choose 'no religious ads' whereas others literally gave me a look at each and every ad that could run on my website and I could reject specific ones.<p>Google's adsense similarly allows a plethora of advertising into their system but give you filters to control your specific site.<p>The same treatment online ad agencies give to website publishers, Apple will likely give to app developers.\nIf iAd launches without these filters, then you mitt have a point but who honestly thinks that they will break away from ad agency norms and do a reckless move like that?

The same type of companies who buy TV ads, magazine ads, etc. Just look at the demos Apple presented: Nike & Disney. You'll probably see lots of ads for video games, movies, music, TV shows, clothing, restaurants, etc. Safe stuff.

I then got sick a few times, and had to be carried back to the hotel by my drinking buddies. I was so high on absinthe, I actually thought I walked myself home (I can vaguely remember the tree-lined streets bouncing along). The friends then unceremoniously dumped me onto my bed, and left to carry on their night of fun. I remember looking at my watch: 8:00pm.

I think in many ways it improved on previous languages and clarified a lot of things that are pretty murky in C++ (like how objects have both a 'dynamic' and 'static' type). And it's nice to hear they're still innovating things.<p>It's just that small things add up. Take class members. In C++, all non-pointer class members are allocated together (like a struct). In Java, each non-array member is basically a pointer. That small little thing spread across say a UI/widget hierarchy adds up and creates a lot less memory locality, etc. Doesn't quite fold as nicely into the caching layers of the von Neumann model.<p>I totally agree with you about there being orders of magnitude more memory than the original machines that these languages were developed on. Actually, just googling 'ipad ram' (and filtering by last week -- man, I love that feature):<p><a href=""http://bit.ly/dioAjU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/dioAjU</a><p>It looks like there's only 256MB or so.

Hence the fire/hire approach.<p>Of course the only way this works is if the people you hire are better than the people you just fired. Ideally firing the worst people improves the reputation of your company, so when you come around to hiring more better people want to work for you (the management consultancies like McK and BCG are good examples of this in practice) so you get better.<p>But if you can't hire replacements better than the people you fired, that's when you need to stop the practice.",1271016561.0
