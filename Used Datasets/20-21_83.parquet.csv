However the District 9 short is far better as a piece of directing and storytelling. I'd certainly hire the Uruguayan guy to do special effects on someone else's movie, but I'm not sure on the basis of this whether he has the skills to actually write and direct an interesting full-length movie.",1261083593.0

If you'll forgive a metaphor:<p>A hard-working craftsman is selling his goods at market, when a thief in servant's livery grabs something from his stall and runs away. Leaving his son to guard the stall, he pursues the thief, following him to the house of a rich man, where guards forbid him to enter.<p>He wails at the loss of his precious goods, attracting the sympathy of a crowd who have followed the chase out of curiosity. Hearing the commotion, the rich man comes to the gate and is embarrassed. He fires the dishonest servant and apologizes fulsomely to the craftsman, praising his handiwork.<p>Now, should the humble craftsman berate the rich man in front of a crowd for the fact of his poor hiring decision, or compliment him on his wealth and taste? Would it help if the rich man was reputed to have a beautiful daughter with a substantial dowry, who had been unable to find a suitable husband?",1261083487.0

My objection was based on the fact that MS has already showed a willingness to do this by issuing an unusually candid and fulsome apology.<p>The wise thing now for Plurk is to accept that apology gracefully and work with rather than against MS to move forward. If they don't want to be acquired, perhaps MS can devote their legal resources to helping Plurk gain access to the China market as a development partner, or lend some development resources to help Plurk package their solution into an API that MS and others can license <i>a la</i> Wordpress.<p>At present, MS is (almost certainly) spending good money on having their lawyers work out a defensive strategy against a possible lawsuit that will cost them a lot in bad press but which Plurk probably can't complete, given the implication that they don't even have funds or expertise to hire a PR company. I presume it's Plurk's Taiwanese business identity that keeps them out of the market in mainland China (since China technically views Taiwan as a rebellious province rather than a separate country, for historical reasons).<p>Some Taiwanese companies do conduct business in China, but Plurk is likely too small to tap the necessary diplomatic channels that facilitate such arrangements. MS could surely assist with that...if Plurk will let them. What Taiwanese diplomat will want to advocate for them if there's a chance it could lead to loss of face down the line? By maintaining their aggrieved stance, Plurk risks being given a grudging payoff to go away, whereas if they respond graciously, they might get the keys to the kingdom.

Your goal should be to structure the deal in such a way that you can meet or exceed the current value of that inventory for the partner and still be economically viable for you.<p>Also, you may want to think about developing a tiered structure that gives monetary incentive to the partner if they deliver higher volumes of leads/sales.<p>Hope this is helpful.",1261082594.0

By ""fold"", don't we mean any part of a page that is not by default viewable upon first loading it?  Does anyone not believe that click-thru rates on a call-to-action button in an area initially visible will be significantly higher than if the button was located on an area of the page that required use of the scroll bar?  Even most grandparents understand that they can scroll to see more of a page, but they might not deem it worthwhile.<p>At least implicitly, I bet people think, ""What's the probability of something good existing down/over there, and does that probability coupled with the value of that thing to me make it worthwhile to scroll?""  If this is true, it creates a feedback loop which exacerbates the ""problem"".  The more that web designers take this thought process into account, the more they'll put the good stuff in the initially viewable area.  Then, because there will be less good stuff found by scrolling, users will lower their estimates of the probability of its existence.  Then, designers will have even more incentive...  This has probably already happened.<p>I'm not even sure if I think that requiring scrolling is a good UI approach for many sites.  I don't like it when I have to scroll back up to reach navigation UI.
