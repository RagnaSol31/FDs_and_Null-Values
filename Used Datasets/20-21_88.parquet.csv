And that's a flawed description of affairs.<p>Deflation is more specifically the normal state of affairs when the government enforces a legal tender law on a scarce, slow-growing currency such as gold. It doesn't happen when the currency is fast-growing, like silver was in the late 19th century, or like tobacco was during the colonial period. And it doesn't happen in a barter system. The establishment of the gold standard was a major political effort that was only accomplished by the McKinley administration around the turn of the 20th century (having been preceded with an even less tenable system of bimetallism that finally collapsed due to the Nevada silver rush).<p>As for whether deflation is a problem, deflation disincents both investment and spending, which means in a very real way that deflation disincents economic growth. The situation you describe would also be possible only with a return to the gold standard, which would effectively price gold out of any kind of industrial use--something that would have negative economic repercussions in itself, and which would likely cause extremely high rates of deflation in the future.",1246395532.0

I have no advice for you, but here's my experience.<p>I hold a Masters in EE (control theory). I have never really found studying Mathematics formidably intimidating, probably because I've been at it for some time now.<p>But I totally suck at the following things:<p>- Solving problems that require really inspired ""crux"" moves. Think IMO level problems, lighter versions of Euler's solution to the Basel problem (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_problem</a>) etc.<p>- Coming up with abstractions and new Mathematics. Think (again) Euler's invention of graph theory or Cantor's invention of Set theory.<p>- Recalling what I've learned just months after their immediate use is over. For example, I had to cover quite a bit of math for my BEng. But if you ask me now about real analysis, PDEs, stochastic processes or fourier transforms, I'd be stumped.<p>I strongly suspect that this is because we haven't analyzed and understood the problem of learning Mathematics well. To give you an example, 200 years ago people were trying to get fit. But it was not until the invention of systematic strength training with free weights and machines, etc., that we could really do a reasonably good job of it efficiently. Early body builders look like sticks compared to monsters of today.<p>I am hoping that such a revolution happens in education as well. Before we learn, we must really learn how to learn. Our knowledge of that is very limited now.",1246394630.0

Assuming your select * where clause has only the index key in it, then select any column in the leaf of the index has the same cost as selecting all columns in the leaf. The expense is the disk read, if necessary.<p>Also, If you select the entire object then linq does a select * because it has to populate every value of the object. If you only need an id column, just select the id column.<p>Then he says: ""Now, retrieving 48 individual records one by one is sort of silly, becase you could easily construct a single where Id in (1,2,3..,47,48) query that would grab all 48 posts in one go.

He assumes that selecting on one id is the worst case and then multiplying it by 48 gives him a total. The true time would depend on whether the index pages were in the cache of the database.

42,681527,comment,681458.0,681458.0,0,0,grandalf,,,"This essay completely misses Ayn Rand's point.<p>Consider your life and the basic problem of deciding how to live it.<p>Being ""selfish"" means living your life according to what is most meaningful to you.  For some that means heading to Wall Street, for others it means being a doctor, and for others it means working at Burger King.<p>In modern terminology, Rand's term ""selfish"" should be substituted accurately with <i>self-actualized</i>.  Her term ""selfish"" was actually chosen as a deliberate synonym for ""self-actualized"" that didn't sound like psychobabble.<p>Now the question becomes, under what circumstances would anyone claim that a person <i>should not</i> be self-actualized? One might also wonder what would be the consequences of living one's entire life in a state of self-actualization vs non self-actualization.<p>It is this sort of question that Rand addresses in the book.  She makes the rather bold moral claim that each human <i>should</i> live a self-actualized life, and that to avoid doing so is to commit a moral failing.<p>Now let's quickly examine the concept from a political perspective.  What would it mean to not be selfish?<p>Suppose you are a young man who is very talented at the Violin.  You know in your gut that to create beautiful music with the instrument will bring you tremendous happiness and pride.  You want nothing in life other than to experience this happiness every day, so you practice long and hard.  That you please others is nice, but it's secondary to your own love of music.<p>Rand would applaud such a person.  Rand's critics would claim that the violinist should have been ""selfless"" and joined the clergy or perhaps become an orderly at a hospital, helping to clean up vomit and spilled fluids.<p>By definition, selfishness is doing something you want to do, and selflessness is doing something you don't want to do.  So what Rand's critics are advocating is akin to self-flagellation.   This is not a new idea, as anyone who has read or watched the DaVinci Code knows -- the wacky priest uses a spiked strap to make sure that he is not enjoying whatever he is doing, since self-sacrifice is his highest value.<p>So what about people who work for non profits, are they selfless?  Not really.  They simply enjoy making the world better more than they enjoy earning more money in each paycheck.   Selflessness for someone who works at a non profit would be working in a job that was truly meaningless... such as perhaps working as a clerk in a huge corporation.<p>Political systems like Socialism which attempt to embody the idea of shared self-sacrifice would view the clerical job as every bit as noble as a more meaningful job because someone must do the clerical work for it helps society as a whole.<p>Rand's value of individual choice and self-actualization -- appreciating and glorifying the occasions when a person truly loves his life's work -- is fortunately not all that foreign to HN readers.",1246394135.0

67,681502,comment,679791.0,680608.0,0,0,Leon,,,"Have you ever tried applying to somewhere considered 'low' when you have some questionably spectacular mentions on your resume?  Most anywhere will at best consider you a joke and at worst suspect.  You really have to dumb down your skills and experience if you're trying to move to a new location or get a temporary job for those with education/experience in a location that does not have the job areas your resume reflects.  (against the rebuttal argument, 'you can always move' - no, you can't.)<p>There is always the charge leveled at the young and educated of being lazy and aloof when in the situation of not having a job yet with a nice resume but, well, it can still be hard.  Even dropping items on a resume paints a picture of little experience and usually ends you up with a position that makes it more difficult to find a job elsewhere.  Do you know how tired you get after a 16 hour manual labor job?  You don't really feel that inclined to brush up on the latest ruby packages.<p>Yet someone almost always brings up the fact that they heard a story or they themselves found a job through some ingenious idea at marketing themselves or spectacular networking in an area that didn't know they needed their skills until they showed them and found a job.  Well that doesn't work for everyone.  Most places are just as boring and closed minded in their business practices as every one assumes, and never try something new unless forced (why do you think start-ups succeed so spectacularly otherwise?).<p></rant>",1246393151.0

There are plenty in embedded engineering, kernel programming, cryptographic algorithms, space efficient data structures, fast image processing algorithms, and in plenty other computing areas.<p>To answer your question, why you'd want to set/unset the right-most 1-bit, suppose you have a space efficient 8 bit data structure that represents 8 devices. Each bit represents if a device is on and off. And you want to turn off the right-most device. Then you could use that hack. Or for example, you want to linearly turn on devices from 1st to 8th, then you can just turn on the rightmost bit eight times, and turn off in the same manner. Or you could have some crazy device that puts data at some memory location and waits you to clear the rightmost bit before it puts new data at that location. Or you have a number system coded in your byte in such a way that rightmost low order bit is always the sign (or some other craziness).",1246392679.0
