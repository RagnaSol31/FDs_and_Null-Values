The blog was written several years ago, so his solution is somewhat dated.<p>I think checked exceptions are a bad idea for a couple of reasons.  First is their most acclaimed benefit: they force you to deal with the exception immediately, even if you have no solution for it.  You have to decide whether to catch the exception or add a throws clause, which changes the method signature and breaks it for any users of your method.  The the default decision for many programmers is to log the exception and swallow it, intending to come back later.  I have had to dig through applications to find sql exceptions that were caught but not dealt with.<p>The second big problem I find is the poor design of exception classes.  It is not uncommon to find a class that throws a half-dozen exceptions.  Every time you call a new method you have a new exception to deal with.  Either it should have a single exception with different error codes for the different cases, or the exceptions should be subclassed from a master exception.",1254083906.0

Those who <i>need to display</i> elitism are those who aren't <i>automatically accepted as elite</i>. Similarly, those who are naturally accepted as elite, don't need make as much of an effort to display their eliteness. This is so established that the act of <i>not</i> attempting to show one's eliteness is often subtler a mark of greater eliteness.

This is just a plain fact of society and asserting your skills and experience is <i>not in any way</i> arrogant or elitist behavior.

It was seen as extreme at the time, but that's moderate. Similarly, some protests today, like the ""don't let companies rob us because we're dying"" protests, might be called extreme by the ""other side"", but they're not really extreme. That's a rational cause and most of the people protesting for it are rational people.<p>On the other hand, last year I participated in a handful of protests, largely because I had nothing better to do, and <i>there</i> you find real extremists. You find people who think that the Jews are all part of a conspiracy to kill nonJews, and you get the people who think organizations of any time are detrimental to society, and you get the antitech people.<p>I remember posting once on a friend's wall that while I appreciated her passion in supporting gay rights, I couldn't help but think gay rights parades were obnoxious and hurting the cause. A friend of hers in turn responded in a rant that said I couldn't possibly understand society if I was heterosexual, I was probably a repressed homosexual, I was actively harming his existence by living, and I was a pretentious bourgeoise without a mind.<p>In response to that unwarranted rant, I decided to become an extremist moderate.

This, unfortunately does not tell the OP which bank offers a small biz account for less than $13/month but does relate to ""what you should be thinking about"" instead of what ""color-of-the-bike-shed decision"" as patio11 points out.<p>1 - I'm not looking for investment and don't need to worry about having a corp structure suited to investors. If that later changes, I'll get hit with some restructuring costs, but I think I've minimize those costs (thats a discussion for a different post).  So an LLC will do and Delaware not required for investment structure purposes.<p>2 - Delaware is well regarded, aside from investor issues noted above, as its court system is ""predictable and efficient"" for many types of business litigation.  Thats a good reason to choose it, right?  I'd say not good enough for an unfunded startup not anticipating investment.  Choosing Delaware for it being predictable and efficient in litigation assumes you may one day find yourself in litigation.  Have you ever been in litigation?  I have.  The first thing I learned is you want home court advantage (the second thing I learned is everyone lies, but thats a different discussion). For litigation you want your home town lawyer that you can drive down the street and talk to, not a faceless law firm in a state where you don't live.  And in the worst case that you have to do some/all of the legal work yourself, you want to be able to drive down the street and file papers on your own.  You can't guarantee jurisdiction being in your favor simply by being incorporated where you live but its a big factor.<p>3 - Income Tax.  One way or another, you will get taxed when you take money out of your entity.  There are various strategies to minimize this and its timing, but unless you're a resident of Texas or Florida (are there others?), you are on the hook for taxes in your state of residence.<p>The above tells me:<p>A - I should form my LLC in Georgia.<p>B - open my bank accounts in Georgia<p>C - ensure all my contracts with my clients unambiguously state the legal jurisdiction is in my home town in Georgia.<p>This buys me a lot of simplicity and peace of mind.  For banking, I do get less than $13 a month, mine is free with a balance of over $300.  My bank is a small solid old local bank that you all have never heard of and no, you probably don't want to use them if you don't live here.  They always answer the phone within two rings and its always a real person.  Most of the time, the conversation starts off with something like ""Hi Jon, are you calling from China?  I just saw your momma yesterday."" ;)",1254082076.0
