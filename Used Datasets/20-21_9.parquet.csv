Taking away the clutter around the search box was a good idea, but wasn't Google's real innovation something like counting links to pages to judge their significance? The Twitter example is better, but one example is not enough to make the case. Are there others?",1199825222.0

10,96102,comment,96057.0,96057.0,0,0,akkartik,,,"For 1 you mean you want to build a <i>parser</i> for arbitrary html that your crawler returns. Hard problem, as others have said. My advice:<p>1. Use an html parsing library. Beautiful soup (python) or hpricot (ruby) are good building blocks.<p>2. Practice manually building parsers for a few sites, then see if it leads you to any insights about how to generalize the process.<p>3. Ignore everything else until you do 2. Just use wget as your crawler. Skip the visual interface for now; just parsing arbitrary pages is a hard enough problem to bite off.",1199824234.0

But scraping against the html structure is a losing battle.<p>A better approach is to use clues in the information itself to guess its content: something with a ""$"" is a price. Something containing ""toyota"" is probably a name, ""blue"" a color, more than 20 words containing ""good"", ""v8"" is a description, etc. That way your scraper is resistant to structure changes.<p>All that is separate from the problem of a crawler. It takes a long time and a lot of effort to convince content sites that what you are doing is a) helpful to them and b) something they should not be doing themselves.<p>It's like jumping on stage with the band and starting to play.
