Let me be very clear SQL is not dead, and it's the right tool for many jobs.<p>However, if you want a cheap, replicated, multi-master, write heavy system - there is no simple way to this.  Oracle is too expensive, I've used mysql-clsuter and pgpool-II etc, but in my experience they tend to introduce more failure points than they remove (at least in projects requiring a short development cycle).<p>NOSQL pushes a degree of the complexity of the data model back to the application (e.g. you end up building some of your own indexes), but the data model is often no more complex in the end (less normalised, and greater flexibility of columns).<p>The reward for this is massively simpler scaling. Something like Cassandra is so much easier to replicate to a multi-master multi-site system than PostgreSQL or MySQL.<p>If you're building any form of semi-mission critical site (where you don't want to rely on or be tied to a single  hosting provider) and you need to be multi-site & replicated from an early point, then NOSQL philosophy has a lot going for it.<p>That said - I strongly hope that the MySQL/Postgres camp will fight back with a simple replication strategy that just works rather than is an bolt-on/afterthought.<p>I find it helps to think of NOSQL being about simplifying the datastore to make it easier to replicate. So far I think only Cassandra does a persistent multi-master solution properly, but others will catch up.",1269809464.0

The rest of them they replace with different types of parenthesis.<p>Brackets, braces, tabbing and carriage returns, semicolons. They are all structure delimiters. In lisp you have one structure delimiter ""()"", in non-lisps you have many.<p>I don't see how it is terrible for complex arithmetic. Lisp order of operations is explicit. Code does not become more clear because you add a bunch of implicitly defined structure, (no matter how much you were drilled in math school, it is still another thing to remember). Besides, what makes math different from anything else? I end up parenthesizing infix math anyway, simply because it is hard to keep track of the order of operations.<p>You are certainly entitled to your opinion, and I didn't meant to imply that you aren't, I was just interested in your reasoning.<p>To me, 'readability' is a vacuous claim, being that they only thing that 'readability' really means is 'what I am used to'.

Replication wasn't introduced into MySQL until 2000.  In 1997, you would by necessity have rolled your own replication system tailored to your needs (much simpler than solving the general-case problem).  That's basically what you did anyway, but you solved it in the most trivial way possible: you 'replicated' by doing a complete database dump and re-distributing the entire DB.  If you'd had a viable open-source relational database, you could have scaled the reads and got more developer productivity by distributing a SQL database (e.g. SQLLite) rather than a key-value database (BDB).<p>I appreciate your standing up and giving a concrete example of NoSQL usage - nobody else has been brave enough to do so.  But it seems that the reasons for it were highly specific to the time: there were no viable open-source databases, Amazon was just introducing the idea of customer reviews (i.e. pre Web 2.0) so data was primarily read-only, memory was comparatively expensive and memcached didn't exist, and you had a comparatively small product catalog where complete re-generation was an option.  I don't think you can carry forward the optimizations you made in that framework into today's world.",1269809200.0

The economical relationship between employer and employee is such that your employer takes upon himself all small and moderately-sized economical risks and in return collects most of the upside. There are exceptions such an outsized IPO (very rare) on one side and layoff (not so rare) on the other. In other words it's a risk swap not unlike car insurance or extended warranty. It's a great deal for someone who can't tolerate cashflow problems (e.g. who is in debt), but this sort of risk swap is unnecessary for someone who has a cash cushion to ride out the rough times.

Even today, MySQL replication is brittle, and master/slave inconsistencies are the rule rather than the exception.  Slave crashes often cause replayed transactions due to lack of atomicity in writing master.info and relay-log.info.  The replication landscape with PostgeSQL is varied and essentially a bag on the side.  Last I counted there were more than 10 different ways of doing it, a number involving trigger based log shipping. It wasn't about open-source vs commercial, it was about scaling the reads.<p>The detail pages weren't pre-generated, they were based on read-only catalog data, which I think is entirely database appropriate.

Any good style book will tell you that there is no ""right length"" for paragraphs (although bad teachers might teach rules like ""no less than three lines, no more than ten"".  A paragraph should be exactly long enough to convey one clear point, whether that takes one line, ten, or twenty.  The same for functions.<p>By the way, I'd like to say that a LOT of the comments on this thread are really insightful (i.e. the include insights that are new to me, but which immediately make sense once I see them written down).  It's pretty humbling to see this community so quickly come to so many valuable conclusions when my poor, bumbling article took so long to get to where it did.

To be clear, I think that online rep is unavoidably going to have impacts in real life.

How this plays out I have no idea -- we are in the middle of a social revolution, see Clay Shirky ""Thinking the Unthinkable"".  I didn't mean to imply that online rep does not have serious pros and cons and potential abuses that many mentioned -- so don't kill the messenger.
