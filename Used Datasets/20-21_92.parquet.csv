""Scheme"" and ""Planner"" (and, I suppose, ""Gambit"") have mostly neutral connotations.  ""Swindle"", ""Larceny"", ""Heist"", and now ""Racket"" are obviously criminal.<p>It's not a good direction, PR-wise.  You end up with people having to justify to their bosses why they want to use something called Racket for work, or justifying to parents why their kids are learning Racket in schools.<p>(And then there's the inevitable analogy: Python : Pythonista :: Racket : Racketeer)",1269637129.0

Concern about the likely outcome is entirely understandable, although I don't believe Democrats lie awake at night dreaming of new ways to inhibit small-scale capital formation.<p>Also (and for the last time, I promise), AFAIK no changes are proposed to the provisions of Regulation D which confer accreditation status on any prospective investor who accepts a directorship, partnership, or executive office in a business, regardless of their financial wherewithal (although accepting such a position incurs obligations of its own, with corresponding costs of compliance).",1269634932.0

I'd love to see more about it though.  Now, relationship graph traversal is an issue for normalized relational systems, but in these cases, things could be split pretty from articles versus recommendations.<p>One big problem I see in these comparisons is when a NoSQL person claims that their box is processing 5000 req/sec, what does that mean?  Are they denormalizing this so much that it's equivalent to 500-1000 req/sec on a RDBMS?<p>Another thing: when Digg was starting their type of site was very novel.

The base approach of the relational model is that there is a professional DBA who makes sure that the mission-critical data is available in a format that multiple applications and multiple department can use directly (the type of data is know but the ordering isn't set). Thus DBA is ""hat"" that most programmers can't ""wear"", especially since a large portion of programmers don't understand the relational model.<p>On the other hand, Nosql and object-databases allow a programmer to just stuff data into the a data-store without worrying about a cohesive datamodel. <i>If</i> we consider this as mission-critical data that multiple departments of a large organization would want to see in multiple forms, then we can find many ways that the approach of <i>""just save this array of values""</i> produces serious problems.<p>But there are many applications where these problems don't appear.
