21,250248,comment,250131.0,250131.0,0,0,mdasen,,,"I love Apple.  I've used Apples since grade 2 (first computer ever touched was a IIc).  I went through the whole gamut of Macs - LCs, Performas, Quadras, PowerMacs, iMacs, G3s, G4s, MacBook Pro.   Apple is going to grow in business, but they aren't going to threaten Microsoft.<p>Why?  Many reasons.  Companies don't like being beholden to a single provider.  With Windows, at least for the computer, they get Dell, HP, and many others to buy from.  There is a huge ecosystem around Windows.  I work at an office that uses Exchange for email/cal.  Entourage always has little weird anomalies.  We have constituent management software that only runs on Windows and we're not going to switch because we have too much data (and it's a terrible, proprietary format).<p>Plus, the biggest thing, businesses like ABI stability.  It's why MS has done so well.  While others would break compatibility on both the ABI and API level, MS has kept it stable for over a decade for the most part.  It's made Windows cludgy, sure, but customers like it (mostly).  Often, when Apple releases a new OS X, there are little things that need changing in programs.  Apple seems to have put this more in the past and I'm really excited about Snow Leopard.  However, if Apple goes the MS route and demands forever backward compatibility, it's likely that OS X's advantage disappears.<p>Apple is poised to make inroads, but part of MS' problem is also its greatest feature - backward compatibility.  Should Apple follow suit, the pace of development would slow and OS X would get more cludgy.  And if Apple ever displaced MS, MS would have the option of breaking compatibility and then leapfrogging Apple like Apple has done to them.<p>Part of the reason I love the Mac is that Apple is willing to break compatibility to make things better/more stable/more lovable.  OS X is at a really great place right now and I'm also glad Apple is going for more stability than in the past, but businesses really want MS-style ABI stability.  I definitely see Apple displacing a good amount of MS in the home, but businesses can be more conservative.<p>I guess I'll see what happens.  As someone who was in the fold during the darkest times, I'm just glad to know the company is stable, profitable and growing.",1216417255

24,250245,comment,249688.0,249866.0,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It's always seemed like that general rule was a not so subtle way of saying, ""you cannot possibly be trusted to manage your assets responsibly, so you should tie them up in a house, so you can't do anything stupid with your money"".  Certainly real estate is historically a reasonable investment, but almost never the best one.  And the additional upkeep costs: new roof every 7-10 years, lawn care, time spent cleaning 1000 extraneous sq feet of rooms, the opportunity cost of all that extra crap to fill up your McMansion, plumbing, electrical, etc.<p>It's also worth thinking about the fact that if you followed the trend of the past ~20 years, and moved further out of the city with each new ""upgrade"", the reasonably sized house you left first is probably more valuable than the McMansion you live in now, because people are returning to cities and paying more for that convenience.  And the suburban mega houses are steadily dropping in price.<p>But, I agree.  It all really went pair-shaped when people imagined themselves getting rich by flipping houses, and so spent more than they could afford--imagining that they'd flip it before the mortgage payments caught up with them, and make huge profits.  Calling it ""gambling"", and treating it the same way, would probably not be incorrect.  I think it's the same mindset that gets people in trouble.",1216417201

You can still write imperative programs in a pure FP language. The most obvious way is to write your code in continuation passing style and pass the new state of the world to each continuation; taking the implicit state changes of an imperative language and making them explicit.<p>The real reason for using monads is that the scheme I just described is inhumanly complicated. Monads are a much more structured way of doing the same thing. Instead of writing these state passing CPS functions, you write functions that build them for you. A consequence of this is that monads perform much the same function as macros in Lisp; they are programs that build programs.",1216415946

Mac shipments grew 9 times faster than the overall U.S. PC market (4.2%) in Q2.""<p>Is basic mathematical literacy too much to ask for?  When your market share is small, it's easy to grow faster.  Apple can cut in to a tiny fraction of Microsoft's market, and growth is huge.  But even if Microsoft converts all Apple customers to PCs, the percentage growth will be small.  When your market share is 90%, it's <i>impossible</i> for your market share to grow more than 11%, and pretty difficult for your sales to grow at 38% (unless people buy new PCs every 6 months, or you find a big new market).  While it's true that Apple's growth is faster, it's hardly as surprising as the article makes it out to be.<p>My company's computer shipments grew over 10x faster than Apple's -- so about 90 TIMES faster than the overall market.  I increased by sales 400% by selling computers to 5 of my friends, since I only sold 1 computer last year.  Get my point?<p>Yes, Apple's growing, but this whole ""9 times faster"", while true, is misleading, meaningless hype.<p>> ""But at the rate Apple is gaining share, it won't be long before Microsoft begins to feel a real bite.""<p>Yes, but as Apple grows, they can't keep growing at that rate!<p>For example, MSN/Live search market share grew about 27% from May to June (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/85321-msn-live-only-major-search-engine-with-higher-volume-in-june"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seekingalpha.com/article/85321-msn-live-only-major-se...</a>).
