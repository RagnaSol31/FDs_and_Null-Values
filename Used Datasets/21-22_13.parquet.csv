In terms of percentages of individual purchases, sure, but if there's a way to scale it up it isn't obvious to me.<p>In Mexico, the same problem exists, although by the sound of things it isn't nearly as acute as in Argentina.  In general, established and professionally run businesses have change; small and informal ones do not.  (I think this stems from security concerns: large and well-run businesses have private security and insurance; small ones do not.)<p>After a while you learn the strategy of making certain purchases at certain places and where those places are.  (This can sometimes leave you in a minor bind when you're outside your regular stomping grounds.)  You learn the optimal amounts of money to withdraw from different banks' ATMs.<p>So, having small change buys you not just goods and services â€” all money does that.  It also buys you a bit of time and saves you from aggravation.  It really sucks to wait 5 minutes to get change back from a small purchase, as the cashier leaves the store to ask all the neighboring stores if they have change.<p>Finally, the same phenomenon exists in stable and well-developed countries too, albeit writ small: just ask someone who lives in a small apartment without a washing machine whether he tends to hoard quarters.",1228426723.0
