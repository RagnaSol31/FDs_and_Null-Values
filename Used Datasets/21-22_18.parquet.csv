I've never worked with it in a project, and I've never quite seen the point: I keep all of my files backed up, my partner does the same, and so if we need to go back and look at something it's not hard. We edit directly from the server, so there's no need to sync information. So: why would I use something like Git or Mercury?<p>I'm not attempting to troll: I'm just curious. Since Github is YCombinator (I think, right?), I'm sure a lot of people use it. So: as somebody who works as part of a two-man group, who keeps his files all stored and backed-up offline, what does Git get me?",1234475940.0

New machine learning techniques appear constantly and are often documented online years before they appear in books.  Some computer scientists say  they prefer conference proceedings over academic journals because the latter take so long.<p>-Further, I'm not sure that the goal of any text should be to cover topics X, Y and Z in any case, which doesn't seem possible for a book to do.  What does seem feasible is to set up a framework for analyzing the performance of different techniques.  So I'd like to hear a comparison of how Bishop does that vs. HTF.<p>-You're of course correct that HTF takes a statistician's POV on the field - the authors are all professors of statistics at Stanford.  They are also accomplished - Friedman was a co-author on CART, for example.  I would instead ask the question:  what can you get out of the book and the framework it offers?<p>-I think that part of the framework in machine learning is to think about bias AND variance, and how to trade them off successfully.

37,479013,comment,478354.0,478885.0,0,0,niels_olson,,,"I just read the New England Journal report. He wasn't infected with another strain. Strictly, everyone with HIV is infected with a distribution of strains because it random mutations happen. The virus can bind either the CCR5 receptor or the CXCR4 receptor. As pressure on the CCR5 pathway increases, survival of CXCR4-tropic variants becomes more pronounced. Essentially, CCR5 is the easier and more common target of the virus, so the wildtype tends to equilibrate toward a cluster of strains that favor CCR5. It's simply more energetically efficient for the virus. It's a thermodynamic equilibrium. In fact, the report explains this. As HAART therapy is used to suppress the virus, the surviving viral genes get better and better at binding CXCR4 and it is a well observed part of the natural course of the disease that CXCR4-tropism develops late in the course of the disease. The patient lives longer with HAART therapy, but dies of a slightly different disease than they were infected with. It's very much the same sort of evolutionary thing that happens with other, less exotic forms of bacterial antibiotic resistance.<p>The big deal, intellectually, for me, is the clear-cut experiment that shows just how dependent on CCR5 the virus really is. Now in my fourth year of medical school, the professors have always been hedging their statements: well CCR5 is a known tropic factor, but we really don't know how big a deal it is, and then there's CXCR4, and maybe there's other factors, so we really don't know.<p>Compare that to ""took him off HAART and the virus came back like a ton of bricks. Reapplied HAART and the virus regressed. Coincidentally, we took the CCR5 receptor site out of his system, then took him off HAART again, and we get an entirely different response: no virus, and any evidence that there ever was a virus is slowly fading from his system"".<p>Hopefully there will be other advances in how to kill the HIV, but this very much a lightswitch sort of event for medicine.",1234474196.0

There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.<p>I'd be interested to hear what you mean by ""simply less broad"" as compared to Bishop's book, which (from having flipped through it) looks pretty comparable.",1234472800.0

Would the generator be powerful enough to provide enough electricity to operate the car?  If so, I have a hard time seeing how you would save weight or how it would be more efficient, since you're going to have more steps in the process, each with more efficiency loss.",1234472576.0

I can't deal with the abundance of passive-aggressive personalities who will seize on tiny errors like this, and discount an individual's intelligence.<p>If you ask me, it comes from the fact that software geeks are primarily young men, many of whom were emotionally abused by their peers while growing up.  When you think the world only values your intelligence, you go out of your way to prove that you're smarter than everyone else.",1234472460.0
