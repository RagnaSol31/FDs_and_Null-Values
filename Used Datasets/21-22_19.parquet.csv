I'd imagine the per person rate on a normal show (especially one with great demos, like The Daily Show) might be higher.<p>That said, you can just buy many of them via iTunes. It's clear that adoption there is very small, but it's not clear why. It could be the price. It could be that you can't stream it to an Xbox or any similar product that anyone actually owns. (My guess is the 8 people who bought an Apple TV probably buy some shows this way.)<p>Also cable with DVR would pay for itself fast if you watch a lot of shows. I don't though, so at $1.50 per I'd still save money over the course of a year.  On the other hand, given that the distribution cost is $0 via bittorrent, I would think the networks would take 1x or maybe even less. I highly doubt they're getting $1 per view on Hulu for instance.",1232402260.0

11,440948,comment,440432.0,440432.0,0,0,Shadow84,,,in my opinion this article (and maybe the book written by the 37signals guys) only looks at part of the equation. To what it boils down for them is being better than your competition. The old credo was being better in total which the article describes as one-up the other. The 37signals approach is being better at a subset. They say you have to focus on things where you can be better.<p>What this leaves out completely is the approach of being different. Why do it the way everybody else is doing it? IMHO there is a huge potential in a lot of areas which could be used by a different approach to solving problems that have already been solved.,1232401821.0

It seems like the TV networks could use something like this technology and just charge a per-episode rate of (X * 1.5).<p>Based on some back of the envelope using the superbowl ($3 million / (30 second spot * 100 million viewers) = $0.03 per viewer commercial * 36 commercials per hour = $1.08. That's probably an upper bound since super bowl ads have a good chance of making the news outlets, talk shows, etc.<p>So would you pay $1.50 an episode to watch commercial free your favorite show whenever you want? For Firefly yeah, but I'm not so sure about The View.<p>Then again my implicit wage rate is $0.03 * 120 = $3.60 an hour so I'm willing to earn $3.60 an hour watching television ads but only if I get Joss Whedon unpaid breaks.",1232401499.0

Buy a dev board closest to your product desires.<p>2. Modify the board as needed and get some of the features working, while laying out a PCB.<p>3. Design the PCB and simulate as much of the hardware as possible.<p>4. Send out a board revision with all sorts of test points and such, including parts for experimental stuff. Jumpers are good to add at this point to, so that certain parts can be tested independent of the rest. (this is expensive, think 1-5k for a small run of small boards)<p>5. Order all the parts, if the board is using a lot of surface mount (SMD) you do not want to be hand soldering, so order a stencil too (for laying the solder paste). Parts will be expensive since you need rolls to feed into a pick and place machine, stencil will be around $300-400 for a good quality one.<p>6. Build the boards.<p>7. Test them and find all the problems and errors.<p>8. Go back to step 3 until the board mostly works.<p>Software development will continue throughout the whole process.<p>If you are good and able to keep the revs to a minimum, and the board is small it can still be relatively inexpensive.<p>But if you plan to sell it, regulatory certifications (FCC, UL) can be another problem since they are slow and expensive.<p>Hope that was useful. Now remember this is the process I have been involved in and others may do it differently, such as when parts are very expensive more simulation is done.
