My eight-year-old nephew picked it up in one game and loved it, and his mother (my sister) liked it too.<p>4) It's fun for 2-4 players.<p>5) The constant shifting of the cards means the game does not get old fast.<p>Anyways, if you have some holiday loot, get Dominion.

I've got a .emacs that rounds some of the corners off, but it's still not perfect.<p>Which reminds me, if anyone knows how to get backspace to close the minibuffer when it's empty like vim does, I can smooth the most annoying corner I run into right now...",1261775239.0

Maybe he is also capable of being a great scientist, but I don't think he needs to be. The practical usefulness is twofold:<p>1. His works serve as food for thought. There are far too many topics for one man to research them all. Providing inspiration for further research is a worthwhile endeavor as well.<p>2. He provides thought frameworks. He reminds me of an old wise man. His writing contains key ideas, while not based on scientific fact, which are useful as rules of thumb. Sometimes decisiveness and confidence is more important than correctness or optimality. Tribal knowledge has its place.",1261774914.0
