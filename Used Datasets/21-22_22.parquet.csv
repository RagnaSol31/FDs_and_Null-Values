35,359767,comment,359056.0,359569.0,0,0,Locke,,,"Okay, here's a situation I've run into:  I want to create a web frontend to an existing library.  Naturally, the existing library already has some nice model-like classes that I'll be working with.<p>What I'd like to do is take those model-like classes and persist them to the database.  It should just be a simple matter of mapping a few instance variables / attributes to database columns right?  Well, it turns out this is fairly difficult with ActiveRecord.  Firstly, ActiveRecord wants all your models to extend ActiveRecord::Base.  But, I already have an existing class and the chances are I don't want to, or can't, change the existing class to extend AR::Base.<p>So maybe I'll to create an ActiveRecord model that will wrap and delegate to the existing class.  Ah, but AR::Base has a huge footprint and uses so much magic that it's downright painful to do delegation.  You can't safely use method_missing because AR::Base does, and you're almost guaranteed to have a conflict where AR::Base and your existing class define the same methods anyway.<p>Here's how DataMapper is different:  You're not required to extend any sort of base class.  Instead, you mixin a module with a tiny footprint.  So, in your web frontend, you can open the existing model-like class, mixin DataMapper::Resource, and map your properties to columns.  Because the footprint for DataMapper::Resource is so light, and it doesn't use any magic, it's unlikely we'll break the existing class.  Even if we <i>do</i> break it with this approach, we're far more likely to succeed with delegation that we are under ActiveRecord.<p>So, to bring it back to Merb and Rails, here's the key difference:  ActiveRecord might be just fine for most projects.  But, maybe DataMapper is sometimes better.  Or, maybe another ORM is.  In any case, Merb will let me work with whatever library <i>I</i> think is best for my project.  Rails give you <i>no choice</i>.  You either take the whole stack as is or you don't.<p>And, that doesn't just apply to the ORM layer.  The same can be said for template engines and javascript libraries.",1226353127

In other words, its current operating P&L sheet is negative. That cannot possibly be disputed, unless there is some magical fairy dust that generates ad-revenue many magnitudes greater than the norm.<p>It's really irrelevant whether you believe that it costs Facebook $100M a month to operate, as Arrington seems to, or whether you figure FB can get by on a $1M a month shoestring budget. The fact remains that, regardless the numbers of users, per capita there is negative revenue generated.<p>Arrington argues that increasing the number of users, while not solving the per capita loss, hastens the use of those capital reserves of $500M. On this point, he is exactly correct. It's basic math. The rest is just semantics.<p>They need to solve the problem that revenue on a per user basis is a negative number. Not only do they need to make that number positive, they need to bring it into the black far enough that they can pay back their $500M in borrowed money, and  give some sort of return. They need to do this before any of their current (or future) sources of funding collapse. This is a very tough problem to solve. (BTW, google was in this position once)<p>My humble opinion is that they won't be able to do this anytime soon, and will most likely fail in the future. As much as they laugh at the ad-driven screenshot in the article, that's probably what FB will look like in due time.<p>I'm just going with the odds.

Personally I've done exactly that at Curves without having to pay a ""middleman"" like pacefit to make it happen.<p>Maybe the appeal is meeting up with other geeks, but I do that all the time, and I don't know if that's the best matchup of people to go working out together. At Curves at least I know all the equipment and fitness programs are designed with women in mind. But how would you match up people online, even if they live in the same geographical area? You'd have a hodgepodge of gym memberships, interests, abilities, goals and more.",1226351370

She never pretends to teach anything other than Objectivism. And while her thoughts are flawed, she has an ability to take complex thoughts and make them easy to follow. Atlas Shrugged is absolutely worth a read.<p>Ironically, your saying that you don't like Rand because other people don't like her is going along with the very principle that Rand most stands against. Make your own opinions, based on your own logic. Don't follow what other people say. Read it yourself and decide.",1226351018

73,359726,comment,359551.0,359703.0,0,0,walterk,,,"Rand never made her sociological understanding of how people become productive explicit because she sort of didn't have any. That's what enables her to view the highly productive and the less productive (or unproductive or even counterproductive) as good and evil, respectively. If she actually understood the subtle forces at work, she wouldn't have been so quick to judge.",1226350976

Instead, he cites the user growth rate, but at what cost do those users come?  Should we somehow assume that every new user has an immediate positive value?<p>The 15bn valuation number is also an often mentioned fallacy.  For their money, Microsoft got some Facebook stock and some advertising impressions.  No one has ever really clarified how much of Microsofts $275m went to stock and how much went to advertising.",1226350872
