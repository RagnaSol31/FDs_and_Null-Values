Part of what I'm wondering is how viable the venture model is when the amount of revenue a category can generate gets quickly reduced from a free competitor that can operate at a fraction of the cost.<p>That's why I mentioned PlentOfFish.

There are only so many of those major categories (like jobs, autos, dating) available.<p>The other trend is that advertising just doesn't pay the bills, even in mass amounts.  I'm familiar with a handful of private companies that are doing millions of uniques per month and can't even pay a modest staff and support cost to stay afloat.
