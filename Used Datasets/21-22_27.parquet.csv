I'm not a lisp user myself, though I'm learning Scheme, so I don't know for sure if the libraries problem is an actual problem. But if it is, you could say that Lisp is a blub for Python, because while Lisp users are spending their time inventing a DSL that's incompatible with everything else, Python users type 'import awesomelibrary' and get the job done.<p>So, really, it depends on your notion of power. In pg's original Blub essay, power is Lisp-y-ness (or macros, perhaps), so by definition Lisp can't be a blub. But if your notion of power is something else, maybe it can be.",1219096484.0

If you're LIFTING, and lifting HEAVY, then yes, it doesn't make sense to go for more than 45 minutes, for exactly the reasons you stated.<p>However, cardio? People will see huge cardio benefits if they run for a long time. There's no ""negative fitness effect.""<p>Yes, you may burn muscle, but it's not like you're going to all together stop burning fat. In fact, when you hit glycogen depletion (the 'hitting the wall'), your body will switch energy burning modes entirely, and start burning a TON of fat.<p>I'm nit-picky about your statement because America, as a whole is in such a crisis. We look for any excuse to get out of exercise. Those idiots at the gym lifting 10 lb weights? Do you really think they're getting a good workout? They're not lifting heavy, and they can go far longer than 45 min doing 7 lb arm curls.

They were good people, with not a lot of money to throw around, so the cheap & quick fix-it-now solution was always pretty attractive.<p>Well, one of the things they needed was a program that would take two input files -- one a current list of products' wholesale costs, and the other a current list of what was in their point-of-sale database and their retail prices -- and produce a report containing all the price changes they needed to make that week.<p>VBScript will make most programmers' blood run cold, but it was a good way to solve that problem at the time. Zero initial cost, simple to hack out, ran on their aging Windows point-of-sale server, etc. So that's what I did.<p>Then the boss came back and said, ""This is really cool. Can you make it do X?"" And I said, ""Sure"", and that process repeated for almost two years.<p>The VBScript program long since got pushed beyond all of the boundaries that any programmer with any good sense would ever push it, and they're still using it today. I have gently refused to update the program any further, or to fix any of the odd bugs it exhibits occasionally, mostly because updating the program is now too expensive.<p>It really does need to be rewritten from scratch in something more useful, like Python, with a clearer idea of all of the features that they'll want in the end.<p>I think my point is, sometimes you start with something simple, and use the methods that make sense at the time, and then it grows beyond the limits of its actual architecture. It's often impossible in a situation like that to just refactor portions of the code in a useful way. So, then it might be time to (carefully) consider rewriting the whole mess. You have the benefit of having a clearer idea of what you need to create, right from the beginning, and you can avoid the architectural mistakes that were made with the first system.",1219095208.0

The age of the code makes no difference (actually, it probably does...you probably need to be more respectful of old code, because it probably knows about stuff, like edge cases, that you've long forgotten).  You can always gradually improve your code.  I get a vague feeling that you're looking for someone to tell you, ""A rewrite is just what the doctor ordered!""  And, I can assure you that no one with more than passing experience in the field will suggest it (and I note that others have already pointed out good resources on why not...but they mostly boil down to: you'll still hate the code when it's rewritten, and you'll be months or years behind where you would have been had you not rewritten from scratch).<p><i>The system has gotten so big and bloated over that time.</i><p>That's what living systems do.  If it were useless, it could remain tiny and pretty.  But real world systems have ugly problems and sometimes uglier solutions.<p>Your job is to use it as a learning experience.  Every time something new is added, require yourself to make adding that new feature easier, and <i>then</i> add it.  e.g., if you need to add support for a new data format, take it as an opportunity to abstract out the import/export routines so adding additional data formats is trivial.  Once you've abstracted it out, and you have the original data format code working in the new model, then you can add the new data format.<p>If Lispers have one really undeniably great notion, it is that the tools should match the job, so they build the tools for doing the job, and then they do the job with the custom tools.  Most languages aren't quite as malleable as Lisp (though Perl, Ruby, and to a somewhat lesser degree, Python, come pretty close on many fronts), but you can still think of your task as being, ""What would a library or subroutine look like that would make adding this new data format really easy?""  And then you build that library or subroutine rather than jumping right into writing the data format handling code.<p>And, of course, every time you have to touch a file, leave it prettier than you found it.  Even if it's just mild improvements.  Slow and steady wins the race, and such.",1219095139.0

The most important, in my estimation, is whether the revenue lost from license fees would be offset by taxes gained on the new economic activity generated by the entrepreneurial use of said spectrum.  I would need a good deal of data in order to make this call.<p>Although it is true that the US has the 2nd highest corporate tax rate in the developed world at around 35%, we actually collect very little revenue from it.  The reason being that the high tax rate encourages some tax sheltering activity and other bad behavior that, in the end, costs us revenue.  So even if the new economic activity is generated, we have strong historical evidence that new tax revenue from that activity would be somewhat less than forthcoming.<p>Why do we need the revenue? A large national debt. Additionally, it seems, that this debt will only get larger over the next 10 years whoever wins the election.  About 3 or 4 trillion in growth under Obama, and between 4 and 5 trillion in growth under McCain.<p>On the other hand, perhaps the new economic activity would generate a sizable windfall.  Even accounting for the inevitable tax sheltering that corporations will engage in.<p>I think we need some REALLY expensive data to make this call.<p>In short, my choice would be driven by a desire to keep our national checkbook balanced.  Or more precisely, to use the spectrum to generate revenues that may begin the process of bringing our national checkbook back into balance.  I realize I am very much in the minority here, that said, I think it's a useful way to look at the issue.",1219094362.0

The reason I run marathons isn't primarily for the races themselves but rather for the motivation the races provide to get in shape. You can't easily wing it or cram for a marathon (Lord knows I've tried), so the races' looming deadlines provide an escalating urgency to one's workouts. The resulting workouts are fairly short (amateurs rarely run full marathons in training, and only hit high distances near the end), intense, and irregular (ie, increasing over time with rest days interspersed as opposed to the same routine every day) -- qualities which match DeVany's own recommendations for how to exercise as related in the TimesOnline article.

That's also useful if you only use a particular library occasionally and just don't remember how it works.<p>Lucky for me, I can have those things with languages like Perl and Ruby without having to resort to an IDE.<p>> on a 500k+ codebase there are probably enough methods named ""add"" that just doing a text search is going to be pretty painful.<p>The kind of tools you describe as being better than a text search are, in essence, just text search (and replace) tools.  They're obviously much more powerful than the search and replace tools familiar to many MS Windows users thanks to the style of search functionality offered with editors like Notepad, Wordpad, and even MS Word -- but then again, so are the search tools available in a typical Unix environment, especially when using an editor like Vim or Emacs.<p>> I think that there are other situations, primarily for working on larger projects but also for people new to the language or who use it less frequently, where the benefits of a really good IDE would still help out Ruby.<p>I think that applies more for people who are used to an IDE approach to programming, really.  The kind of development done with Ruby without an IDE near at hand actually uses a very different approach to development than an IDE-centric approach, and for someone used to that IDE-centric approach, having an IDE to help make the transition might be very helpful.<p>Maybe an IDE for Ruby will eventually be a clear win, but before that happens I think a whole new set of IDE features will have to be invented -- features that are both necessary and otherwise rare for tools suited to developing in Ruby.  In other words, IDEs as they currently exist probably won't ever cut it as the best way to develop for a language like Ruby, even if the dynamic nature of the language can be accounted for to make the current common IDE features work with it where they don't already.<p>> So personally my work style is now tailored to using an IDE, which slows me down when I have to shift out of that mode, and I'd use a great Ruby IDE instead of Emacs if one were available.<p>That makes sense.  As Oliver Steele pointed out in ""The IDE Divide"", language-centric and IDE-centric approaches to development are almost mutually exclusive in a way that supports the idea that for some people, IDE-oriented languages coupled with excellent IDEs are more productive, while for others, languages that (currently) are not well-suited to IDEs because IDEs that interact well with their more powerful capabilities are the more productive choice.<p>I'm not sure I buy Steele's reasoning, exactly, but he makes some excellent points about the difference in development approaches between IDE-centric developers (what he calls ""tool mavens"") and language-centric developers (what he calls ""language mavens"").<p>Err, the URL, in case that sounds like a topic of interest:<p><a href=""http://osteele.com/archives/2004/11/ides"" rel=""nofollow"">http://osteele.com/archives/2004/11/ides</a>",1219093919.0

If you can't do compromise on that issue, you probably won't be able to compromise on much, and thats a bad recipe for starting a company together. I would also suggest nailing down an exact number, the ""lion's share"" isn't exactly accurate.<p>As far as majority control, I'm a big fan on someone having majority control to prevent deadlock. But with minority protections built in. You can have one person with majority control, but at the same time require two votes to make certain decisions, like selling, buying another company, changing compensation, changing the operating agreement, etc. That way, even though one partner has more equity, that can't completely screw the other one over.",1219093797.0

It also seems obtaining limited liability would go hand in hand with putting your agreement in writing, so I'm failing to see your potential co-founder's reasons for not doing this. Unless you're going on a handshake (which I doubt), you'll decide on how much equity is ""the lion's share"" and then divide it using some form of agreement or equity division. You can't have equity division without a company to divide, and the company you start will hopefully limit your liability.",1219093528.0
