It's not the company that is doing the deed often but an overzealous employee who doesn't think of his/her actions. We experienced this with forum posting from a competitor. When we found and I talked with the owner he was as confused as me, but he phoned me back a few days later to say that he had tracked it down to an employee. He apologised and contacted the forums to remove the posts - I had a lot more respect for them after that. We're still competitors and fight hard, but fair, with one another",1232229470

In other words, the CPU cycle penalty of java's (and most other language's) exception mechanism can be virtually eliminated. The other benefits (resuming, for example) are a different issue.<p>The issue that I think the lisper of the OP is talking about is something like this:<p>try {\n  something();\n} catch ( SomeException e ) {\n  //don't ever even look at e's stack, and do something else.\n}<p>Assuming the exception occurs, then to be safe the VM has to build the entire stack, which involves unwinding a lot of JIT work if you're unlucky, even though at the end it wasn't actually needed. However, assuming it matters that this is slow, which pretty much means that this is in a tight loop someplace, then a JIT compiler can detect that this situation always occurs, and simply avoid creating the stack.<p>There are still very interesting applications, such as logging and resuming, for not unwinding down the stack before giving the handlers in the chain an opportunity, but the CPU argument seems void to me.",1232227947

That huge amount of data comes with a lot of complexity as well and much of the data is only really valuable if you can share it (video) or combine it with data from others (data mining). If data needs to be close to the CPU, it could mean that both live locally or both live in the cloud.<p>Local resources are idle most of the time. I wonder if that's economically sustainable in the long run. On the other hand you're always going to need idle resources to cope with peak demand. It's never going to balance out completely, even in the cloud.<p>I don't think data growth is going to level off. There are so many untapped sources; sensor data, 3D models, biometric data, etc. But I'm not sure people will process all that data locally. I'm not even sure where locally is. People move around, so the latency issue does not just arise when they're at home, next to their game console super computer thingy.<p>I worked on location based systems in the past. Latency was a big problem then (and probably still is), but having a PC at home with 16GB of RAM and a TB hard disk doesn't help.<p>The scarcest resource in mobile devices is not memory or bandwidth or the CPU, it's the battery. So for the time being, serious number crunching is not going to happen locally on mobile devices.<p>There are so many factors and I know so little of potential technological breakthroughs or even plain physics. Technology doesn't advance linearly. Batteries could suddenly sustain 24 hours of biometric number crunching. There could be Gigabit WiSuperMax in the air in 5 years time. I don't know.<p>But I feel people don't want super computers at home. I even block flash simply because it keeps my laptop fan busy. I tried that world community grid software a while back, but I just couldn't stand all the noise and heat.<p>I doubt that people will keep buying high powered general purpose computers.

It gives you an api for 'give me a new server', 'attach an ip address', 'create a new volume', 'attach volume' etc. So you have to learn this stuff just to get your basic hardware in place. once you have that done you will still be faced with all the sysadmin tasks involved with configuring everything to mount and format these volumes and configure every service you need to run. Of course you need to know what the proper setup for a ruby app in production is and learn all the different webservers and monitoring tools.<p>The idea behind ey-solo(and the soon coming ey-flex) is that you don't want to have to learn all that stuff.

However, last I heard, stations had started automating away most tape duties and merging the master control and tape operator jobs into one.  Master control is not a ""lot of downtime"" kind of job--there are interruptions every few minutes, though I imagine it's seen some automation improvement since then.<p>System administration positions often have a lot of downtime, since if you're doing your job well, nothing is urgent and everything just hums along real pretty-like.  Night watch in a hosting data center would probably be a great choice.  If you're still in school, night shift in a university tech center would probably be a good choice, too (assuming it's open 24 hours...I think most large universities do have at least one center that is open all night).<p>Finally, have you considered contract work?  This is a different model altogether.  Instead of taking a job where you can half-ass it, and work on what you really want to most of the time, you take jobs every few weeks where you work your ass off, get paid a metric ass ton (like $100-$150 per hour), and finish the project in a week or two.  Then you're free to hack for pleasure for a few weeks before taking on another paying gig.  This has mostly been what I've done since leaving college and the television station.  I usually billed $1000/day plus all expenses, if travel or whatever was involved, and often made more than my friends who worked full-time at regular jobs...it only takes a few projects for that math to work out.",1232227124

Unfortunately, I would think that for you the cafes in general are more distracting than working from home. I prefer a noisy environment for some reason and find it easier to get work done.<p>Another thing to check out is the co-working groups in some cities. There are usually places you can rent a desk, or there are groups of independent web-workers (like Jelly) that meet up occasionally to work together. There's some networking involved, but most of the time the meetings are pretty quiet and productive with everyone going out together for lunch.",1232227040

So, a lot of walking around, and not a lot of just sitting beside one projector.  A friend of mine from high school wound up in this job, and it sounded pretty awful when he was describing it to me.  He seems to enjoy it, though, and apparently does get to watch most of the movies eventually (but, then again, his is a smallish theatre with only a handful of screens).<p>Since my friend dropped out of college, and his prior experience was working in a toy store and a couple of video rental stores, I would think anyone with a pulse could obtain such a job (he's pretty charming, though, so maybe he did have to interview well to end up running the machines rather than running the register at the concession or cleaning the aisles).",1232226385

In absolute terms of wealth and success and impact, you're probably right. It's much more likely that Rolle would play a larger role in the NFL (after all, the turnover rate is high, so there's room for many superstars).<p>Here's what I think is the catch. Going to Oxford is a double win, because 1. it's a different culture, 2. it's the elite of a different culture. The value isn't in the books. It's in the environment and the discussion. It's in how the experience will change his worldview, and will prime him to think with an expanded mindset.<p>It's a bit unscientific for me to say this, but I have become convinced that global thinking is literally impossible to people who don't actually live through it; for those who have, the later they experience it, the less they are able to appreciate it.<p>So Back to Rolle: if he had two options of seemingly equal value, say, 2 years of NFL superstar + 2 years of Oxford, or the other way around, I would always pick the latter option, simply because it's earlier.",1232226317

Freelancing to pay the bills, and my start-up stuff to exhaust whatever surplus I have, which is--thankfully--a lot more lately thanks to my new niche. Noise is high (especially Thursday through Saturday nights due to parties) but I like having noise going on most of the time. If I want some quiet, I can just wake up earlier.<p>Rent is high, but I see it as an opportunity to find a great way to work that will provide even more surplus/tangible income when I move to somewhere cheaper after school.<p>I focus on speed of production and finding several small gigs a day. As a designer, it's a lot easier than being a programmer in this regard; lately demand has been at $400 a day but I am only willing to supply $200-300. I don't keep a backlog either, so my rates still have room to grow. This lets me cover my bills and still keep my main focus on my startup (an iPhone app currently, but I have several projects in line, such as <a href=""http://www.epictee.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epictee.com</a>).<p>Here's my setup.
