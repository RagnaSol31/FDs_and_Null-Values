Then you look at another breed, like the Standard Schnauzer that it's very rare to get an unhealthy dog.<p>If you inbred a small group of NA German Shepherds it wouldn't take long before all puppies born would be virtually guaranteed to have displasia.

Wall St. is getting bailouts about 100 times bigger without almost anything to show for them. Silicon Valley has no credit to pay for its growth.<p>I hope Silicon Valley wakes up and realizes it doesn't need Wall St. or the help of the US government. It would be great if something like a broad cyber-scrip currency shows up. Or some other way. I'm sure California will join in as they are insolvent already anyway, making it really scale.",1239225445.0

The granularity of the web framework has changed from the single monolithic option handed down by the programmers to the gem level. Now we get a default framework from the programmers and dozens or hundreds of remixed frameworks provided by people with specific configuration needs.<p>These people are doing the same job that the creators of linux distributions are doing. It's up to them to resolve compatibility issues and create any patches needed to make their distribution work. You find the custom framework that does exactly what you need or if it doesn't exist you create it and become an editor yourself.<p>Now take the component granularity down to the level of a single language extension or monkey patch. Gems might have gem recipes. The authors of the classifier gem would require  array",
