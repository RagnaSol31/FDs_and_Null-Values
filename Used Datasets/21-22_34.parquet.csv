When I built my first app, I thought about spinning off the billing layer into a separate service, but then realized that established companies like Auth.net have all of the real leverage. We'll see how this plays out in the long run, but I have a feeling that these types of services are in for a bumpy ride as their customer base is probably the least stable of them all (start ups).",1258495190.0

36,947277,comment,946288.0,946514.0,0,0,easp,,,"I think the strategy google is pursuing with Chrome, ChromeOS, SPDY and even google docs is to make web-centric computing more widespread, both among the established base of existing desktop and laptop users, and among non-users like people in developing countries, and people who aren't doing mobile computing yet.  Google benefits both because they are well positioned to monetize this type of computing, through both advertising, and fees for services like Google Apps; and because this kind of computing devalues the cash cows of their largest rival.<p>The tactics they are using are to drive down costs (ie give Google Apps away to small businesses, and make it a lot cheaper than running exchange, deploying office, etc, for larger orgs), and to enhance the overall experience (ie make web apps faster via SPDY, fast javascript, etc).<p>Against this background, projects like Chrome don't have to achieve market dominance to be successful, they just have to achieve broad influence.  I don't think just delivering better performance when Chrome users visit Google's properties counts as success, though; I think they need to get other browsers and services to change too.<p>I think SPDY is most likely to take off on mobile devices first.  First, latency is a much bigger issue for cellular data than it is for WiFi, etc.  Second, it looks like Google is going to get decent browser share on mobile devices.  If Google implements SPDY in the Android browser, then makers of mobile web apps will likely embrace it.  If that happens, then Apple, etc will feel the need to support it as well, lest the iPhone end up at a big disadvantage.",1258494186.0

I'd love to hear any age appropriate suggestions that are other than what you might imagine parents choose for something like this. Two ideas I've had so far: Dawkins letter to his 10 year old daughter (already vetoed by the teacher - this one I felt compelled to get prior approval), and one of the dialogs from Godel Escher Bach (maybe Contrafactus?) the ""geek-by-association"" from which would probably fade by high school in time for him still to be able to date...<p>Anyway, from those two examples, you get the gist of my nefarious intent.

The system was very clunky when I used it in law school in the 1976-78 era but has since been highly refined and is highly useful for those willing and able to pay the high price associated with the service.<p>Lexis eventually undercut the West monopoly and sent West scrambling for a competitive response (hence, Westlaw).<p>The competition between Lexis and Westlaw <i>did</i> lead to far better pricing for some users, from the old ""x dollars per minute"" model to flat-rate pricing for users in specific categories (e.g., small firms), but this still involved hundreds of dollars per month at minimum (anything beyond the specific categories remained x dollar per minute).<p>Of late, other services have cropped up (LawNet) that have made a lot of the case law available at much cheaper fixed pricing (e.g., under $100/mo) but their offerings were incomplete.<p>The trend is unmistakable. For Lexis and Westlaw to compete, they will eventually have to lower their pricing considerably. Even then, there is a serious question whether their resultant margins will leave them with a viable business model. Only time will tell on this.<p>By the way, the downward trend for Lexis/Westlaw is tied to the vast disruption that has occurred with Big Law, which, in its heyday, was a massive user of such services that paid little attention to the cost aspect (costs were simply passed on to clients). In our cost-conscious era, Big Law is reeling in the short term, as are Lexis and Westlaw.",1258491746.0
