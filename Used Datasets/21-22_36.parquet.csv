What does Chuck write?</i><p>The largest available program listing for the GA144 that I'm aware of is an MD5 hasher: <a href=""http://www.greenarraychips.com/home/documents/pub/AP001-MD5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenarraychips.com/home/documents/pub/AP001-MD5....</a><p>All I know of Chuck's current projects comes from his blog and the fireside chats he gives at the Silicon Valley Forth Interest Group's annual ""Forth Day"". They can be found here, along with many other fun presentations: <a href=""http://www.forth.org/svfig/videos/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forth.org/svfig/videos/index.html</a><p>It seems he's written some temperature-monitoring and signal processing code, a number of routines for generating VGA video signals and he has begun work on building a ColorForth compiler that can run on the GA144.<p><i>Do they provide a foundation for building application-oriented languages in the classic Forth style?</i><p>Based on my observations and my own experience tinkering with a softsim for a single F18, the resource constraints of the processing elements make it very difficult to write genuinely reusable code, beyond discovering idiomatic opcode combinations and design approaches. The only way to make your code fit is to code like Chuck- simplify brutally. It would be interesting to see how well an optimizing compiler could take more relaxed, modular Forth (or another language) and squeeze it onto an F18.<p><i>What I really want to know is whether this architecture would be suitable for dataflow, i.e. whether you could build a spreadsheet on top of it. It seems not unlike the systolic array architectures that were a hot research topic 25 years ago, and those were thought to be suitable for dataflow.</i><p>I concur with your comparison to systolic arrays- the GA144 is more flexible than most of those old designs, but has a very similar character. I think calculating something like a spreadsheet on a grid of F18s could work well, but would need a much larger array of processing elements to be effective. Interconnect is also an issue. The parallelism that can be extracted by dataflow architectures is often a product of the rate at which calculations can fan out, and a grid-based architecture enforces a strict cap. As I'm sure you are well aware, spreadsheet formulae frequently gather input from a large number of other cells and are in turn used in many places, often with only a tenuous relationship to the orthogonal neighbors of a cell.<p>Your discussion of re-entrancy in spreadsheets raises some interesting ideas. F18 cores in a GA144 are designed to very easily push code to their neighbors to execute- it's the basis of deploying code through the grid. The same capabilities mean that you can write code that dynamically reprograms various parts of the array at runtime. Extensive use of self-modifying code is widely regarded as deep magic nowadays, but I've often imagined programming for a huge FPGA where an OS can assemble new purpose-designed cores on the fly instead of spinning up new processes- these chips could be used in a similar way. Like I said, there's a great deal of new CS theory lurking in this design space.",1324850150.0

Instead of:<p><pre><code>    my_program :: Config -> Result\n    step1 :: Config -> Arg -> OneResult\n    step2 :: Config -> Arg -> SecondResult\n    my_program config = step2 config . step1 config\n</code></pre>\nYou'll write:<p><pre><code>    my_program = runReader config $ do\n        x <- step1 42\n        return . step2 $ x\n</code></pre>\nSo let clauses and parameterized modules are not even in the running.

Name theft in the sense of the law would be theft but it wouldn't be like stealing a car, because stealing a car would have negative repercussions even if it were legal.<p>Enforcing everyone has unique names might have a high enforcement cost, which is why it may not be worth cost to society. Likewise enforcing copyright for consumer use has become harder and harder as well and at some point it won't be worth it either. Enforcing property laws however is cheap because it's hard for everyone to mass-steal cars and protect their own property.",1324847854.0

I think he's all talk and almost no results, and he's trying to spin that into a success that then justifies him tooting his own horn as a ""strategist"" (what the fuck?). All over his blog, all over his comments on HN, he makes himself out to be this amazing business guru, juggling 27 world-changing projects at a time, upending major industries with a stroke of his pen. This is from a comment in this thread:<p><i>In the last four weeks, I was able to hire like 30-40 people or so, keep six or so projects running, do a deal with a top hotel chain and top jeweler, put out a book in a week, lead a struggle for reform against traditional publishing, made $38,500, shot a bunch of videos, had a bunch of fun, hired an architect to build an orphanage in Ulaanbaatar, and so on.</i><p>I call bullshit on all of it. Well, almost all of it; maybe he had fun. Sebastian is always waving his hands and declaring things like this, but there's just no evidence. None. Zip, zilch. Why doesn't he ever post any proof of his results? Why no links to any of these projects, no naming of the major companies he's helping change? He clearly has no problem with self-promotion, so it's not out of a sense of modesty. Anyone who has ever hired knows that if you managed to hire 30-40 people in a month, you don't have time for anything else. My guess is that he emailed 30-40 people on the internet and maybe hired one or two for some small contract work.<p>Even in this whole thing with S&S, he seems to miss the possibility that not only might they not really care that they lost him, they might be <i>glad</i>. Maybe they took a hard look at the drivel he was churning out and realized that they were better off with the relationship severed.<p>Enough talking, Sebastian. Put your head down and fucking build something, then you can write a book in ten or twenty years and tell us about it. We don't need another vapid self-promoter selling books exhorting people to manifest themselves to greatness.<p>And if I'm way off and you really are what you portray yourself as, post some fucking proof. Don't just give us the old ""you're free to believe me or not"" bullshit that every scammer says. You want some real personal brand equity? All it takes is some proof of the results you're constantly harping on.",1324847166.0

Eventually, I need the constants to be loaded from a config file or command line and now a huge swath of my code, which was perfectly pure, needs to be  dragged into the IO Monad and the refactoring effort involved is huge, as no function that is even indirectly touching the so-called constant is now pure.
