Each of Chopin's Preludes is self-sufficient, but they were composed, like Bach's, with one for each major and minor key. Since nothing follows them, one may ask what these works are a prelude to...</i><p>Excellent article, but this little bit is inaccurate.   The article gets the above almost exactly backwards, because one could make a case that it is the fugue that needs the prelude - but I say ""almost"" because both are self-contained pieces and neither needs the other.  Rather, the prelude exists as an aid to audiences with untrained ears.  That is, it is not the fugue that needs the prelude, but the audience who ""needs"" it, for it was intended to help them make better sense out of a fugue, which were considered to be sufficiently complex to warrant a little extra context prior to listening.<p>The prelude helped them by being a less complex piece but in the same key as the fugue it precedes. Listening to the prelude prior to hearing the fugue helped to ""establish the key"".  By the time the prelude was finished, it would have taken the listener's ear on a brief journey around the notes of the piece's scale, resolving to (and thereby drawing the listener's attention to) the note that serves as the key's tonic, and also to whether the 3rd was a major 3rd or a minor 3rd.  Once the ear was calibrated in this manner, it was thought that the interweaving lines of the fugue would be easier to follow.",1283032585

(This must be a little awkward in reading pages of mixed text, surely?) Nomura found that meaning was extracted faster from kanji than kana words, and thought that kana pronunciation was data-driven and that kanji pronunciation was conceptually-driven. Morton &  Sasanuma (1982) also claimed that evidence supports the intuitive belief that kanji can give direct access to the meaning of words, but that kana always require translation into a phonological code when they are being read, and there is no development of automatic visual recognition of the kana symbols. One of the most intriguing ways of studying what differences there may really be in processing is in observing brain-damaged patients - following certain lesions some patients can still read kana but not kanji, while other insults to the brain leave the ability to read kanji but not kana.""",1283032265

But he refers to Brokep as ""BRO-KEP"" (which is how most people assume you pronounce the name).  If he had spoken with him (like I have) he would know his name is pronounced ""BROKE-P"" (short for Broke Peter).<p>It's probably nothing but it's a bit weird and I don't understand how someone who has met the guy AND interviewed him on camera would make such an fundamental mistake.<p>Secondly, it all feels the wrong order of things - he says he's already done the filming and NOW wants funding for editing?<p>Simon Klose clearly has editing skills himself and so I don't understand why he wants to bring in an external editor at this point.  A ""better"" editor can only work with the footage he has, so if Simon was going to bring in an editor it would have been better to have started working with the editor pre-filming to consider + agree a documentary style, angles, overall narrative, etc.<p>To his credit, I would point out that Simon Klose is a Swedish national - and that gives me a lot of faith.  I've found that the TPB folks are quite suspicious of talking to anyone who isn't Swedish and so I think a great merchant-of-record documentary on the subject needs to come from a Swedish film maker.<p>I might still donate something but given the end-footage is going to be released as CC-NC I'd like to know what will happen from the proceeds of the commercialization of the footage by the rights holder (Klose)",1283031736

I was educated in China until the fifth grade - by that time I could read most newspapers and contemporary novels.  I never felt the process as gruelling, dry, or a significant time investment.<p>Most of the character rote-learning and grammar occurred in kindergarden, first, and second grade.  The ""rote-learning"" part was writing each character five or ten times, then use them in sentences.  It took maybe half an hour of class + ten to twenty minutes of homework each day.<p>From the third grade on the focus shifts toward idioms, styles, poetry, etc.  Essays began in the second grade.  By the end of the sixth grade students are expected to be functional writers.  I think high school focuses more on Classical Chinese and western literature.<p>As a native learner, the process actually felt quite effortless.  Most of the student's time was spent on math, science, and classical music, which were much, much more painful for me in terms of the sheer amount of practice and rote memorization.<p>Character amnesia had never been a problem for me while I was in China (this was before computers were popular).  Admittedly it is a problem now, since I haven't written by hand for 10+ years, but the characters come back to me if I write them out a few times.",1283030306

You also need to know the age distribution of founders who <i>apply</i> to YC. It's silly to assume that the age distribution of applicants is unlike the age distribution of those invested in if you don't have the data to make that claim.<p>If, for example, 20% of YC-invested founders are in their 30s and 20% of applicants are in their 30s, then in all likelihood age is a complete non-factor in their investment strategy. YC applicants are just disproportionately likely to be younger, due to the fact that older people are more likely to have financial dependents and commitments which make it far more difficult (if not entirely impossible) to do the 3-month-long YC experience.",1283029736
