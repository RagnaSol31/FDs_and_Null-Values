31,384872,comment,384606.0,384723.0,0,0,ssharp,,,"Economies of scale come into play when the increases in revenue are outpacing the increasing in spending.  This is best shown with fixed costs.  If you pay $10,000/month for office space and sell 10 widgets or 100,000 widgets, you're still paying for the same amount of office space.  So it's always beneficial to scale so long as your fixed costs aren't increasing enough to override the benefits.<p>It could be that PG meant that large corporations were more willing to take these bets as they had less to lose than a small company.  Taking advantage of economies of scale will generally require some investment upfront as well as adding something to your fixed costs (building a new plant for example).  If things don't pan out, you're left with the new expeneses, debt, etc.  The financing gap between big companies and small companies has shrunk a lot of the years.  During the times that PG is talking about, a small company would have difficult time getting the same amount of financing as a large company in a comparable amount of time.

There are a lot of expert systems for medical diagnosis, including some which were accessible on the web (hundreds were at Revolution Health), but they are really not useful: they take far too long to use and are not sufficiently accurate. In fact Revolution Health removed most of them. One of the main problems is the terrible bandwidth of answering questions posed by a wizard.<p>But, at least, if it's on the iPhone, the huge costs of building and dealing with hardware are dealt with. I wish them luck, though I expect they are ignorant of the challenges ahead.<p>Some time ago, my strategy was to focus on high priority automated diagnosis, using much higher bandwidth channels, like microphones and cameras and so on. I had some machine learning algorithms for detecting skin cancer that I thought would significantly improve on the best existing algorithms, reaching 80-90% accuracy on a single viewing (higher than physicians which get around 60%), and nearing 100% if the moles were tracked. There were two major, but surmountable problems: I needed to do a lot of preprocessing to remove the variability of different cameras and shots and conditions, and I needed to get a good dataset to train and test (those are hard to acquire.) Ultimately I shelved the project because my cofounder wanted to work on something else (which I shelved because now I'm working on compressed air powered vehicles.)",1228339544.0

Read the summary and focus on what <i>in the adult nervous system</i> means.<p>""DNA methylation is a covalent chemical modification of DNA catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). DNA methylation is associated with transcriptional silencing and has been studied extensively as a lifelong molecular information storage mechanism put in place during development. Here we report that DNMT gene expression is upregulated in the adult rat hippocampus following contextual fear conditioning and that DNMT inhibition blocks memory formation. In addition, fear conditioning is associated with rapid methylation and transcriptional silencing of the memory suppressor gene PP1 and demethylation and transcriptional activation of the synaptic plasticity gene reelin, indicating both methyltransferase and demethylase activity during consolidation. DNMT inhibition prevents the PP1 methylation increase, resulting in aberrant transcription of the gene during the memory-consolidation period. These results demonstrate that DNA methylation <i>is dynamically regulated in the adult nervous system and that this cellular mechanism is a crucial step in memory formation.</i>"" (added italics)<p>PS: Sorry, if you where all just joking, but the summary is worth a read.",1228339230.0

As soon as one company develops a blockbuster molecule, others begin testing chemically similar molecules, hoping to ""get in"" on the category (e.g. statins). This is because there's a higher rate of success in developing a profitable brand in an established category where one successful molecule is already known. It's not necessarily a bad thing-- for example, it's quite good that Lexapro is available for those who might otherwise resort to the older and more side-effect-ridden Prozac-- but this leads to a proliferation of very similar molecules and devices, instead of research into entirely new approaches.
