19,3633933,comment,3632922.0,3632922.0,5,0,tzs,,,"There's one thing about cracking DRM that has me puzzled. Consider DRM on music, for instance. Suppose we have a 4 minute song, stored as an MP3 with DRM.<p>The ideal crack results in a 4 minute audio file, without DRM, that is the same audio quality as the input MP3, and is about the same size.<p>If we didn't care about size, there would be an easy way to crack the DRM. Just play back to music and capture the digital audio stream, and store that as a WAV file, or compress it with a lossless compressor. That preserves the audio quality, but the file is bigger.<p>If we are willing to give up some audio quality, we can do the above, but use an MP3 encoder. That should get is back down to near the original size, but the decoding and re-encoding as MP3 will cause some audio degradation.<p>Let's think about the MP3 format in an abstract way for a moment. Consider the set of all possible 4 minute audio streams. Define a given stream as being ""perfectly representable"" as an MP3 of bit rate B if there exists an MP3 encoding at a rate of B that decodes perfectly to that stream.<p>A general purpose MP3 encoder takes an input stream, and produces an MP3 file that decodes to a perfectly representable stream that is close to the input stream--ideally only differing in ways that people can't hear.<p>So here's the question--if the input stream to an MP3 encoder is perfectly representable, why is the output usually a file that decodes to a <i>different</i> perfectly representable stream?<p>It seems to me it should be possible to design an MP3 encoder with the property that under the operation of encoding followed by decoding, the perfectly representable streams are fixed points. I'll call such an encoder ""representation preserving"".<p>With such an encoder, removing DRM from an MP3 file consists simply of playing it back using whatever is normally used to play files with that DRM system, capturing the digital output stream, and then re-encoding with a representation preserving MP3 encoder. The result will by a DRM-free MP3 with exactly the same quality as the MP3 you started with, and compressed to about the same file size.",1330206417.0

Yet, monogamous marriage has spread across Europe, and more recently across the globe, even as absolute wealth differences have expanded. Here, we develop and explore the hypothesis that the norms and institutions that compose the modern package of monogamous marriage have been favoured by cultural evolution because of their group-beneficial effectspromoting success in inter-group competition. In suppressing intrasexual competition and reducing the size of the pool of unmarried men, normative monogamy reduces crime rates, including rape, murder, assault, robbery and fraud, as well as decreasing personal abuses. By assuaging the competition for younger brides, normative monogamy decreases (i) the spousal age gap, (ii) fertility, and (iii) gender inequality. By shifting male efforts from seeking wives to paternal investment, normative monogamy increases savings, child investment and economic productivity. By increasing the relatedness within households, normative monogamy reduces intra-household conflict, leading to lower rates of child neglect, abuse, accidental death and homicide. These predictions are tested using converging lines of evidence from across the human sciences.""""",1330205690.0

It actually includes the recipe in the back too(1).  Coke has had many imitators over the years and fought vigourously to keep their name.  They did want to stop using coca leaves, but that then loses meaning and protection for the ""coca"" part of the name.<p>In the early part of the 1900s they used to sell the product at soda fountains in malls etc.  At one point two businessmen wanted to bottle it instead.  Bottling at the time was not particularly advanced, product often spoiled, refrigeration wasn't widespread, and they are heavy.  Coke figuring they had a couple of chumps then sold them worldwide perpetual exclusive bottling rights.  Oops. Coke has managed to buy back around half of those rights from people around the world.  You should look carefully at the bottles and cans.  They usually tell you if they were produced under the authority of the Coca Cola bottling company (the company from those businessmen) or Coca Cola itself.<p>(1) Ok, so you have the exact recipe and can make something that is identical to Coke.  What are you going to call it? How are you going to market it?  Which retailers are going to buy it from you?  How many years of funding do you have for lawyers?<p>Anyone can make a cola flavour drink.  The hard part is marketing, logistics and sales.

71,3633881,comment,3632821.0,3633560.0,5,0,zecho,,,"Excellent points.<p>For example, I'm specifically referring to things like in the rising card, having the person place the card in the ""middle of the deck"" and holding out the entire deck minus a single card. That's not out of frame at all. It's a reframing of the definition of the middle of the deck. It's in plain sight and depending on the size of the crowd, it's impossible to completely control all your angles.<p>Another example would be the double or triple lift where the magician lifts more than one card as though they are a single card. This always happens in frame. Everyone is looking at the cards. Even sloppy lifts, from a magician's standpoint, usually pass without detection, regardless of the speed of the lift. I've always figured this is because people focus their attention on the pattern on the back of the card and not the edges of the card.<p>Lastly, in pickpocketing tricks, the lifts always happen right in plain sight. For example, I may ask you step forward ""so I can do card trick,"" lift your wallet, and with your wallet in my hand (in plain sight to anyone looking at my hand) reach into my own pocket for a deck of cards. I'll try to limit people noticing the wallet by gesturing to something with my other hand. I'll do a card trick or two and then move into the routine that involves your missing wallet. This is what I think Teller means by ""out of frame.""<p>The misdirection needs to be there, but if you watch, they happen several steps before a reveal. Savvy members of an audience might watch other parts of a magician's body, but they don't have the correct timing. They're thinking cause, then effect. Not cause, some random things in the middle, then effect.<p>Anyway, in that time between, people tend to wander in and out. In one moment they may be trying to figure out the trick, in the next, they're being amazed by the trick.<p>So, I guess to clarify: Once the illusion is completed, people have given up trying to figure it out. They allow themselves to suspend their disbelief in that moment.",1330204963.0
