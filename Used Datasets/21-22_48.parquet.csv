3,744365,comment,743053.0,743053.0,0,0,cema,,,"I did some work with CM in early 1990s. Parallel programming (""fundamental algorithms"") was based on using a special version of C language (C*) with a bit of parallel syntax. (Other groups worked on parallel compilers which could support automatic parallelization of Fortran programs.) As usual, the real trick was not to use this or that language, but to develop interesting algorithms, specific for the parallel environment. So the effort was in developing the algorithms first, then mapping them on the underlying software platform. The latter was almost straightforward, partially because we took the platform into consideration when working on the algorithms.<p>We also used a Cray machines, do not remember the model numbers now, which were physically located on the other side of the country. Our CM-5 was just two floors below us; I looked at it several times, just to get a pleasant feeling.",1249509277.0

18,744350,comment,743080.0,743477.0,0,0,arakyd,,,"It's not a fundamental difference, it's a consequence of the fact that hardware people are at the bottom of a very big stack and have a massive financial incentive to be as solid and predictable as possible. Higher up the stack everyone prefers to use relatively cheap programmers and build stuff quickly.<p>The problem is not having to deal with software APIs, the problem is the sheer size of the stack and the sheer number of accumulated assumptions that are built into it. Moving more pieces into hardware might improve the stack's overall integrity and reduce bugs, but it won't do much to reduce the size.<p>The real issue, IMHO, is that no one wants to admit that the general reuse problem is hideously, horrifyingly difficult. The biggest problems it causes are diffuse and long term, and in the short term everyone can do things faster by hacking together their old code with someone else's 95% solution library, so that's what everyone does. Putting enough thought into each new application to really do it right tends to be hard to justify on a business level, and most programmers have neither the inclination nor the skill to do it anyway. It's so ingrained that even people who are frustrated with the way things are think that a different operating system or language would solve the problem. It wouldn't - it would only start the process again, with at best a percentage reduction in stack size and corresponding percentage increase in time to frustration. I think it boils down to the fact that code reuse is basically a 2^n problem, and the bigger and more opaque the stack gets the harder it is to cheat that 2^n.<p>The only potential solution I've seen is what Chuck Moore is doing with Forth chips. He's now at the point where he can design and manufacture chips that are cheap and simple in design but are very good at running Forth very quickly. Of course the tradeoffs are (perhaps necessarily) as horrifying as the reuse problem in that it demands a lot more from programmers in general, and in particular requires them to learn a radically different way of doing things than they are used to while at the same time strongly discouraging reuse at the binary and source levels. In other words, he's spent decades designing a small core language and hardware to run it, and that's really all you should be reusing (along with data transfer protocols). Needless to say, no desktop or web or server programmer (or said programmer's boss or company) is ever going to go for this unless problems with reuse become far worse than they are now. (Even then the supply of cheap programmers might grow fast enough to keep masking the problem for a long time.) Most programmers are not very good, managers like it that way, and most of the smarter programmers are nibbling around the edges or looking for a silver bullet.<p>In short, there are no easy solutions. If you don't like the direction software is going, think about becoming an embedded systems programmer.",1249508982.0

Why? Because if the banks failed as you described, nearly most would have as well and then anybody holding cash in a bank (read all of us sans the mattress crowd) would have been in horrendous trouble. Remember, the government had to backstop not just investment banks, but money market funds as well (which were failing due to the related crisis of confidence issues). Remember the northern rock episode with huge lines of people unssucessfully trying to withdraw their money in the UK?<p>Imagine not being able to withdraw your cash from a money market or savings account. Banks being structurally exposed to runs and therefore requiring government backstops is actually a well understood issue. The point is we all benefited from the federal backstop, and this argument that, why should banks benefit from an implied or explicit backstop ignores the fact that all of us are backstopped by this as well, whether you realize it or not. Nobody can claim that people keeping their life savings in a money market or savings account and earning 5% interest a year is not also implicitly benefiting from government backstops in general, so let's not single out the investment banks in this case.<p>As for AIG, this has been discussed in infinite more detail so the interested reader can look up articles on this, but the essence of the point is that of the 13 billion owed, most of it was already collateralized (which means they would have just kept the US treasury collateral had AIG collapsed). Yes, there was a smaller portion that was hedged via CDS that could have failed as insurance, but let's not claim this is the entire 13 billion, in fact, it was far from that. And let's also remember had CDS truly failed it would have reflected a state of the world where most banks were in default, and forget about some investment bank not being able to collect their insurance, we are talking about ATMs not working anymore at this point. So the point is the backstop prevented things from getting to this nightmare, saving banks but also the rest of us as well.",1249507322.0
