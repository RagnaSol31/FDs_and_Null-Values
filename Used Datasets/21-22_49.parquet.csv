This is true, writing long responses on the iPhone is a pain because of the keyboard (which your app doesn't seem to solve) and because the iPhone text editor doesnt put scrollbars. That is true, but I genuinely wonder if people try to wrote really long responses on the iPhone, at least long enough to blow away the size of the box.<p>2) tiny arrows -- personally it's a nonissue for me because I would have to zoom in anyway to read the text.  I could see how this is an issue for those who vote before reading the article.<p>3) Comments that fit the screen width -- I can appreciate the argument, given that you group conversations, but it's sometimes hard to see the full relationship between comments if you hide the sub replies.  For example, some people reply to a comment of a comment with a new root comment, and that new comment doesn't make sense until you read the other tree.<p>I don't mean to be a negative Nancy it's always important to ask about the value add to the potential customers.  And this is my opinion.

So from their point of view, it's not a very good idea to help push the web forward to make (web) apps cross-platform.<p>The reason why they might've changed their mind a bit lately, is because they also have cloud offerings now, and they'd rather have enterprise (mostly) customers continue to use IE instead of moving to a competitor's browser.<p>But it seems they still don't really want to go fully cross-platform. This is not obvious yet, but I think we'll see it with IE10, where they want to tie the hardware acceleration to the Windows OS.
