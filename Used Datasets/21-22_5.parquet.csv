It has nothing to do with marketing. I took me 8 years since I started blogging in 2003 to have a community and it is no marketing. It is about sharing every day thoughts, tips, advise, learnings with the community.""<p>Um, but that is marketing. If marketing is ""the process or technique of promoting, selling, and distributing a product or service"" then by building a community you are marketing yourself and thereby marketing your product whether that is your intention or not.

Why?<p>I'm in my 20's and haven't had any major health problems, but don't want some random disaster to wipe out my consulting business. I also pay really high taxes on my profits, like to save money, and enjoy buying stocks.<p>With an HSA, I can put away ~$2,700 a year for health expenses, and that money isn't taxed. I pay Aetna $62 a month, which is $744 a year. How much would I have been taxed on the $2,700 I put away? Probably $700-800 dollars. So it has the benefits of a traditional IRA. While the money is in my HSA, I can make some conservative investments such as buying an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 or if I want more growth, maybe invest in the BRIC's (Brazil/Russia/India/China) or some tech stocks. That money can grow tax free and is reserved in case of emergency.<p>What if I live a perfectly healthy life and nothing happens? Well, I can withdraw all of that money tax-free when I'm 59.5 (yes that's a long way off). So it has the benefits of a Roth IRA as well.<p>If you don't have many health problems and have a few thousand in earnings that you can put away each year, I think it's a great deal.",1211752349.0

6,199747,comment,199279.0,199725.0,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"So are you arguing that it isn't useful to know about racial differences, even if they're true? I hear about them all the time! People wonder why there are so many black people in prison, or why there are so many Asians earning PhDs. Some people have good explanations for these phenomena. One problem with ignoring data about racial differences is that you end up being forced to argue that some races (or all races) are viciously racist -- that white folks want Africa to be a hellhole, and are willing to sacrifice all kinds of natural resources to keep it that way. The world makes more sense if people vary in abilities and tendencies, rather than being absolutely equal in every way, except that some people are evil.<p>You would really be indifferent between finding yourself in Boro Park or Bedford-Stuyvessant? I understand the rent is very cheap in the latter (I lived there a while). Bed-Stuy doesn't have sub-Saharan Africans (or if it does, they're very smart immigrants who are likely to move to a better neighborhood in a few years), but the people there are from roughly that group, plus some admixture.",1211751975.0

Whenever I feel RSI coming up I start typing more slowly and make sure that every movement becomes very soft and gentle.<p>You'll also learn that when you type more slowly you can still get as much done because your mind has more time to think the problem over while you're typing the code you've already decided you are going to type.<p>You'll start to notice the little stresses you've learned to ignore and every time you notice a little bit of stress you'll adjust your movement into a more gentle way of interacting with your computer.<p>As you do this more and more you'll find that your shoulders start relaxing, your neck becomes more relaxed; your breathing slows down and you adjust your computer so that your arms feel featherlight and then your wrists start moving in more fluid movements and your fingers start moving across the keyboard with less resistance until the point at which you might notice that the only stressor left is the tactile pressure of your keyboard and the curvature of your wrists; and then you're ready to try out the keyboard that works best for you and your problems are gone.<p>When you do this it will become automatic and you'll learn to speed up and slow down back into this mode whenever you feel stress building up again.",1211751751.0

To an illiterate audience. To an audience of all deaf people. and so on. It would make such a big difference. I try to get a lot of my Mac friends to enable voiceover (the screenreader) and the screen curtain (makes your display black, a key combination you can't remember is less tempting than turning off the display) and test out their sites and apps. It's a completely different world sometimes.<p>And nowadays, I don't see people ""reading"" the whole page..they do the equivalent of scanning, I guess, by going through the whole page and skipping irrelevant things.

An intellectual might object to the word's use in this context simply because it is bad writing.<p>The goal of writing to communicate. Unnecessarily using obscure words clouds communication.

16,199736,comment,198964.0,199378.0,0,0,silencio,,,"In regards to XML: haha, they are ""human readable"" but I can't read them either. But the thing is, that is still better than nothing. In fact that's scarily like fancy gmail vs. the newer yahoo mail interface - the former is like some xml formats, the latter is nothing at all. I know many webapps cannot be translated so easily into linear and text-only pages, hence I think at least some comment up at top about different options for doing something similar or an informational message about what is required for this app is a good idea if all other options have been exhausted.<p>I understand some apps are inherently inaccessible and there's probably going to be no good solution for presenting them in an accessible manner, but the number of those are very small. e.g. Gmail does not fit into that, think of what webmail was before web2.0. I'm not even talking about some of the fancier features of the webapp like chat, just the basic email functionality. So no, it's not quite like requiring that CNN do that. Just that they provide a CC feed. The rest are not so relevant.<p>Nor do I want to force every site to be accessible, as it really depends on what the site is. But like i've pointed out, yahoo mail is a horrible reminder of how a big site with a popular product is just ignoring a bunch of people. I can't even count the number of folks I've had to move to gmail from hotmail/yahoo mail because the latter two are just becoming a mess in their screenreaders.<p>Might I point out that this isn't just for the visually disabled. I have an iPhone and no matter how much Steve Jobs goes on about how I can see nytimes.com in all its full glory, it sucks. In fact, a lot of regular sites suck a lot in mobile Safari. My fingers ache from zooming in and out and trying to click on tiny links and getting unexpected behavior. Like, I use sigalert.com daily on the phone, and I can't click accident/traffic reports on the map because whoever designed that was expecting someone with a mouse to click, not a fat finger on a small display. If it works and I actually pressed the right thing, the ajax popup of accident/traffic detail shows up somewhere totally different.<p>But, I have the option of going elsewhere on the same site for a list of accidents by freeway. It sucks, but it's still something, and something a LOT easier to look at on my phone. And most sites can do something like that, hence my bitching. I would be hard pressed to find a site where the same information cannot be presented in a more accessible manner. Sure it's not as nice and for the average user it's pretty dumb, but it is better than nothing.<p>Lastly, I think what you're looking for is <a href=""http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria</a> which is a start.",1211750794.0
