We can't fix the fact that your friend is mad with power, and has a weak grasp on the value of an idea without someone to execute it.<p>You need to talk to your friend, and tell him you would love to work with him on this, but the opportunity cost only makes sense if you are an equal partner in the venture.  You simply can't take those kinds of risks, accept so little income, work those kinds of hours, without a reasonable expectation of equal sharing in the results of the work.  If he wants you to work for him, rather than be a co-founder, he should be offering competitive market rates and benefits (or contractor rates and no benefits; you could even offer him the ""friend"" rate of $100/hour rather than the regular rate of $150/hour).  He'll either realize he's being a douche, or yell at you to GTFO and never call him again.  Either way, you come out ahead and you don't get screwed out of a couple of years of your life just to wind up in a crappy job where you're under-appreciated and underpaid.",1247608793.0

If you use the $100 price point, that's $200K/yr just to review funding apps for 2 months.

He said that, in passing laws related to copyright, the government is, ideally, acting entirely to maximize the benefit to the public. He says that copyright exists in order to encourage authors to produce more works, because that should benefit the public.<p>> I don't claim to know where the balance lies between these two considerations, but I do know that there has to be a balance, ....<p>Stallman doesn't agree with you. He specifically states that the idea that copyright should balance the rights of various parties, is a bad one. Read the section titled, The first error: ""striking a balance"". It ends: ""Since the idea of 'striking a balance' between publishers and readers denies the readers the primacy they are entitled to, we must reject it.""",1247608625.0

Certainly search engines don't seem to care too much about it (with respect to page ranking).  They have been having to deal with tables for layout since they many of them started.  I therefore don't think there is any evidence that you will be ranked badly from using them. Am I wrong?<p>Also there are many high ranking sites which use tables such as Jakob Nielsen's UseIt.com (http://www.useit.com/). Admittedly this site is old, but it has a Google Page Rank of 8/10?<p>Also many pay-per-click search engine marketing (SEM) sites use tables for layout.\nSuch as the ones created by Chance Barnett.
