It buys you time, to match their improvement, or even improve on them. Therefore, in tech, I think competitive advantage should be measured in <i>time</i>  * : our good image gives us 1 week; user inertia is 1 year; adapting to another interface is 3 weeks; our server farm speed is 6 months; PageRank is 2 months.<p>These times only come into play when a competitor offers something better in some way (if there's nothing better, then these timers aren't engaged). It's like a better product is a pressure or voltage differential, and the competitive advantage is the resistance.<p>Of course, when you're ahead is the time to grow your competitive advantage, even though it's not needed, so that you have it when it is needed. It's an investment. The parts of the model are: the users you have; the relative attractiveness of a competing product; and what stops your users from switching.<p>Actually, I think this is just one kind of competitive advantage, and it only covers existing users (not new ones). For a start up, it's not enough to just retain users, you need to get them in the first place. You're better off focusing on getting them (by increasing the relative attractiveness of your product) rather than stopping them from switching... but Warren Buffett is always going on about competitive advantage - what exactly does he mean?<p>[ * ] for half their users to switch",1243892343.0

It uses <canvas> heavily so no Internet Explorer either, sorry microsoft (and google's ex-canvas doesn't do the trick, it doesn't have all the features iconfu needs).<p>In a previous life I developed web applications at a bank and occasionally we needed icons. Finding the right icon was next to impossible, and MSPaint was our only option for drawing.

There are some neat features I'd like to add - layers, more HSV controls, multiple parallel edits for example - but not yet.

And those things have actual racing pedigree with tons of wins under their belt.<p>Anyways back to the sports car market. Yes its a saturated market, but its so much bigger than the offroad market. There is plenty of space as long as you build something people will want. And you have the whole build by people like you thing going for you, which would have helped.<p>To me, if I were in your shoes I'd scrap the whole offroader idea and build a sports car.
