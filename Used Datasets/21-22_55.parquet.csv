A group like you suggest does loosely exist anyway without Sony, and it fails in a similar way - it is lacking is a cheap, sexy content delivery system & an ""integrated experience"".<p>Apple has a system from the music distribution right down to the playback device. It's an exercise in consumer manipulation.<p>Open formats wouldn't have fixed that problem. Look at the other digital music player makers: they suffered the exact same problems. IF Sony had pitched and sold an economic model and open format that worked from the distribution side right down to the player then <i>maybe</i> it would have worked. But they would never have sold that to the media companies and music rights holders. Apple got the mass content it did by using the proprietary format to make the rights holders feel safe. NOW such an open model would work (and Apple are heading that way, right) but Sony are too far behind now for it to be worth the investment.<p>They messed up, IMO, by trying to compete full stop. Once the Ipod had market traction as an iconic piece of tech they had lost that battle. They should have focused on more niche markets (sports markets for example, or REALLY high end devices etc etc).<p>EDIT: what you suggest in terms of the PC style eco system potentially might occur. But I highly doubt it for 2 reasons. Firstly because the Ipod has got so much more market traction that Macs ever did. They are the height of cool and <i>always</i> leading the way. Even the awesome might of Google is struggling to beat the Iphone into submission even though it is a technically superior more hackable infrastructure.

You can see this because the device didn't get popular right away. It was the second mover advantage of iTunes, which avoided the first mover's problems (Napster) that led to Apple's dominance.  Apple went with closed tech on the iTunes store, which combined with device lock in to drive the iPod success.  It was as if they had all of the music, and you could only play it on an iPod. They made the player compatible with MP3 (the open part Stringer refers to) so you could use all of your old Napster downloads easily, and made the iTunes client capable of ripping CDs easily.

It will likely pay attention to the maze to try to figure out how to get through faster next time. But if the mouse can figure out how to get around the maze, maybe by climbing over a wall, don't be surprised or angry. The mouse doesn't like the maze at all; it's just an obstacle. The mouse just wants the cheese, not the maze.<p>Advertisements are like the maze. In early days, people were forced to sit through them in between parts of shows on the radio. Print ads had to be looked at so that people could find the articles. Nowadays, people are able to get around these 'mazes'. Morally, people might want to support the content-creators, but if you ask any newspaper executive or journalist, guilt can't get you very far for very long. Technology has enabled the blocking of advertisements, and a few mice have had a taste of the easy-to-reach cheese. These mice will almost certainly not go back to trudging through the maze as they did before.<p>Many critics offer a better solution: Make the mice <i>want</i> to go through the maze. This is certainly a more difficult solution than making a banner ad with a logo. It requires a fair amount of creativity, time, and effort. But some advertisers are already doing this. Take a look at the Burger King games: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt2do5oV2-8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt2do5oV2-8</a><p>Burger King has made their brand fun and engaging, making the consumers <i>want</i> to consume the advertisements. In fact, they pay for them! Now isn't that ingenious?<p>Another example is woot.com. People want to buy stuff, suppliers want to sell stuff. They connect at Woot, and are directly engaged with the product.<p>This is the way marketing is supposed to work. Plastering noise and garbage on a webpage <i>will</i> drive your users to clean it up. They <i>will</i> find a way around your maze.",1242077264

Some ads are intrusive, yup very. Example in point, the economist. It has so many ads, I hate being on that website for more than a bit. What do I do, click away. Problem solved. I still have the power you see, without necessarily punishing the other webmasters who aren't as intrusive.<p>Now, of course it is a free market economy. The advertisers want sales so they become intrusive, the publisher wants revenue so they hold the ads, the visitor wants free content so he bears the hassle, or of course being smart installs an adblock and leaves the previous two in cold water. Fair enough, power to him who has the knowledge that such option exists, but no need to come back playing the fox saying you do not really want to give them such option. You clearly are providing a service and that service is attracting only low subscription currently, if it was higher subscription then your service would go cold as the webmasters would adapt. But seriously if by definition a blocker of ads does not destroy advertising then perhaps it should change the name to blocker of something else.<p>P.S. No wonder I hardly get revenue from Firefox users, perhaps as a way of regression every webmaster should block the smart firefox users and be stuck with the hell of internet explorer.",1242077154

68,604349,comment,603847.0,604282.0,0,0,tc,,,"<i>But Microsoft wasn't taken to court for doing a great job with Windows 95. They were taken to court for exploiting that success technically, contractually, and financially to suppress entire other markets that concerned them.</i><p>That is correct.  But let's be specific [1].  So MS went to Dell (let's say) and said, if you sell only Windows, we'll lower your buy-rate from $150 to $75 (I'm making this part up as a representative example).  Or they went to one of their channel partners and said, if you push any other operating system than Windows, we're going to stop passing customer leads your way.<p>If any other company in the world did that, we'd all just consider that a deal term, something to be considered, priced into the deal, and negotiated.  At no point did Microsoft commit fraud or threaten or use violence.  If Dell decided to accept those terms, it was because they felt it was in their best interest to do so.  It isn't as though there weren't other perfectly good operating systems around they could have used for free.  They had other options (NeXT seemed to manage without doing a deal to buy Windows licenses).  They chose not to take them.  And the channel partner might have decided that those leads from Microsoft were worth the loss of other options.  So what?<p>Anti-trust laws use the government to force Microsoft to not do things that are perfectly moral (or at least, not immoral) and reasonable to do in business (even if they are not very nice things to do).  And if Microsoft isn't willing to comply, the government is willing to steal the company from them for the benefit of the ""public good.""  So while I'm not trying to castigate you, I really don't think my terms are too harsh.  Instead, I believe the abstract nature of the political process [2] leads people to make different moral judgments than the more reasonable ones they would make in the normal course of their lives.<p>[1] I can't believe I'm about to defend Microsoft here.  Please don't conflate the idea that what Microsoft did should be perfectly legal with the idea that how they operated was ""good"" or even ""right.""  Not everything that is bad should be illegal.  Breaking up with your girlfriend via a post-it note is ""bad,"" but should clearly be lawful.<p>[2] That is to say, the greatly increased distance in time, space, and intermediaries between the moral judgment and its real effects on other people.",1242077105
