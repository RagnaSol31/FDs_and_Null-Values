And it really is quite different than Italian in many ways:<p>""She's a beautiful girl""<p>Italian: E` una bella ragazza.<p>Venetian Dialect (at least one version of it): Xe na bea tosa.<p>Lots of words change, and even the grammar a bit.  Indeed, with many italian ""dialects"" it's quite likely that they evolved from Latin on their own, rather than there being some standard ""Italian"" that then diverged.<p>It's really amazing, too, how much it changes over short distances - I can't hear it myself, I don't speak it that well, but you can ride an hour by <i>bicycle</i> from here and people recognize that you're from over there...<p>Edit: another good bit of dialect would be appropriate for the comment by Mark_Book below, ""xe un mona"".",1278280738.0

I think it's fair to say now that Android and iPhone are running neck and neck.  iPhone 4 leapfrogged Android, but note, they actually had to leapfrog Android.<p>The new Android devices (EVO and Samsung Galaxy in particular) are just as good, if not better in some respects than the iPhone.  Froyo as an OS is better and worse than iOS4.  And from what I've heard about Gingerbread,I think Android will again take a lead against the iPhone.<p>I think the real difference between Android and Apple is that Apple is good at finding a market and coming out with a compelling product.  That's in their DNA.  But what is also in their DNA is their ability to lose that market due to slow innovation after day one.  The only real exception here is the iPod.  And they won that battle on fashion as much as technology and UX.<p>If I were Apple I'd be really worried about Android.  I think it's conceivable that iPhone sales could plummet in a given year.  I plan on getting a Galaxy phone as my next one.",1278280697.0

Eating slowly is probably akin to eating foods that do not cause spikes in insulin levels.

The first, and most likely, is that the government could order all ISPs to stop the flow of data through their pipes. Theoretically, they could also shut down some of the root nameservers (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_nameserver"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_nameserver</a>), many of which are owned by the government. But again, this wouldn't truly shut down the Internet, it'd just stop browsers from being able to turn addresses into IP addresses. If you knew the IP of the site you were trying to visit, they couldn't stop you with that method.<p>Edit: also note that since DNS resolution is a redundant system, they'd have to shut down EVERY root nameserver (or at least the ones in the US) to stop resolution completely.

The danger of such definition is that it overshadows the other languages spoken in Spain. The definition <i>British English = English proper</i> is one thing, but <i>British = English</i> is another, as it obscures the fact that there are other languages spoken in Britain and, thus, is somewhat ""imperialistic"".<p>In any case, I have never met a Spanish person who said ""I speak Spanish"" in Castellano.

The work that one does to bring facts into the brain instead of leaving them in external storage allows those concepts to be quickly brought into the short-term ""working memory"" system where they can take part in cognitive activities.  Eschewing practice and memorization limits the rate and scope of your thoughts.   Worse yet, you won't know what you're missing.

However, this would only affect those with an existing record cached for an unavailable node, no new requests would be directed that node. Futher, a Mammatus cloud can also be used as a back-end service for another front-end service which can evade the cache by prepending a random string or timestamp to the subdomain, i.e. 123.mammatus.thimbl.net. Mammatus ignores subdomains of it's subdomain, so this works. Also, information from research into DNS rebinding attacks shows that browser based pinning drops it's cache when it gets a failed requests, so a re-request would also work after failing once. Mammatus is not meant to replace all other HA techiniques. Certainly for organizations with the appropriate budget, there are potentially more robust options for front-end systems. For many situations, this is a good technique, considering how inexpensive it is. Also, this same issue exists for systems like dynamic DNS, which remain quite popular in many use-cases.",1278278891.0
