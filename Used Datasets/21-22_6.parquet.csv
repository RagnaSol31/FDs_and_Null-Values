There are many languages to choose from (python, perl, php, C++), so you can go with the one you are most comfortable.<p>Also, since you are not depending on one vendor, you can use the same tools for a longer time -- no need to change to the latest visual studio, for example.

I think that the answer is, that VC's aren't going to be able to fund web based software startups as much.  We just don't need the money.<p>Who does need the money?  Green Tech, Biotech, hardware/embeded, enterprise software.  Those companies can use the capital and might actually be willing to jump through the hoops necessary to IPO.  VC's only really get paid off when companies IPO or get acquired for huge sums of money.<p>I think that this is going to be a water shed in Silicon Valley culture.  One of the reasons that there are so many software engineers in the Valley, is because there have been a lot of VC funded startups and jobs since the first bubble in the 90's.<p>VC money is going to start chasing different kinds of companies, which means more green tech, biotech and hardware/embeded, enterprise software jobs.  That means more electrical, genetic and chemical engineers and less software engineers in the area.",1228513683.0

He goes on to suggest that these are hard to measure.<p>""It's not that good developers can churn out 10 times as many features as the bad ones. It's rather that good developers write code that have less bugs, more extensible and more maintainable. These are the things that you can't measure by statistics or figures.""<p>I've given a few examples of good developers making systems that are orders of magnitude harder to complete, in the same time. In many cases it's not within the current talents of most programmers to write those systems at all. Another good example is the Quake engines. Additionally, in programming contests or student assignments there are many examples of people completing the same task in vastly different amounts of time. Finally, he states that reliability, buglessness, maintainability and extensibility are things you can measure with statistics, but many people have quantified uptime, maintenance, density-of-bugs, and extension time, to moderate success.",1228512138.0

Often on, for example, TopCoder, the top competitor can solve a set of three problems in 15 - 30 minutes. The median competitor, even in the upper division, solves zero. Some of the problems at only the 'medium-level' in those sets are in fact so difficult that they are given as two-week assignments in university courses, and only a fraction of students can complete it. This doesn't seem like a difference in reliability and bug count, it seems like a difference in kind in both algorithmic ability and productivity.",1228511503.0
