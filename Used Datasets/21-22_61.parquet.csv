Fear of being inadequate to the task.  Fear of not having the support of your spouse (which is generally the spouses version of fear of being broke, I suppose).<p>But, in all our Hackers and Founders meetups, I've never heard anyone say, ""I want to start a startup, but I'm scared of having so much responsibility"".<p>We're arguing a very small point of the essay at large.

But I don't see where ""turn over large sections of the world's economy to climatologists to make the earth their private lab"" is true. That sounds like a scare tactic itself. And Physics did pretty decent work in it's first 100 years. The next 100 were even more revolutionary. I see no reason why Climate Science, with 30 - 50 years under its belt, can't mine important insights, and suggest and test changes, within our lifetimes.<p>As to the connection between science and politics, I really think it's inevitable. Politicians fund science in every democracy. We need to lobby them on the importance of the work. Unfortunately that sometimes means grandstanding and fear mongering. But the alternative is the science doesn't get funding. I sort of have skins in the game so here my own objectivity gets dicey.<p>I agree with you on your philosophy of science. But I don't see huge changes in public policy. Kyoto hasn't done much. What's the real risk of cap and trade? Some marginal costs go up? Even as it may appear scientists are running roughshod over and through debates, they're constrained by political and economic pressures, as they should be. The bigger the change in America, at least, the harder it is to pass through Congress, even with one party holding a supramajority. More problematic for climate scientists is the need to get all nations on-board, including developing nations. I don't see that happening. Debates among nations will prevent what you're most worried about up until it's clearly an asteroid.<p>Just coming back to your main point, on conjecture versus hypothesis-driven research, it seems pretty clear to me what the prevailing hypothesis is: Humans are responsible for some measurable, and significant, changes in the climate. I'm still unclear on the alternative hypothesis and, more importantly, how it can be tested. Can you enlighten me?",1248729821.0
