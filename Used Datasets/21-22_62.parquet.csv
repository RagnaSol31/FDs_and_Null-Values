Take that away, and you'll end up with even more corruption.<p>My mother used to bring me bananas in a shoe-box, hiding it from her comrades because the economic rebirth of my country required sacrifices such as limiting the import of foreign goods and exporting most of our internal products (so food was in limited supply). To buy a kilo of meat you had to wake up in the morning and stay in line for a few hours. Electricity was also cut off for a few hours a day.<p>All of this while the leaders enjoyed such a luxury that would make the Playboy mansion fade in comparison, while mass-media hailed economic growth ... and this was the picture projected to the outside world too.<p>So yeah ...

47,1216961,comment,1216679.0,1216871.0,0,0,mansr,,,"A 64-bit instruction set is about more than just the size of a pointer.  A 64-bit CPU has 64-bit general-purpose registers, and it has versions of arithmetic and logic instructions operating on these.  Because 32 bits is enough for most purposes, instructions must also have a variant operating only on the lower half of the registers, the upper half being either ignored or sign-extended from the lower as appropriate.  This makes the CPU core a fair bit more complicated, meaning larger silicon footprint are higher power consumption.  I agree a 64-bit ARM is unlikely in the immediate future.<p>Extending the physical address space beyond 4GB is possible without any changes to the instruction set.  See x86 PAE for an example.  In short, the MMU translates a 32-bit virtual address into a wider physical address.  This allows running multiple processes with a total memory requirement of more than 4GB.  As the vast majority of applications never need more than 4GB of virtual space anyway this isn't much of a restriction in practice.  I reckon this kind of thing is something we might see in an ARM core relatively soon, at least if they keep growing in the netbook market.",1269466720.0
