6,999842,comment,999696.0,999696.0,0,0,lmkg,,,"I disagree with the base assumption that a manager's job is to make employees engaged or inspired. A manager's role is to cause work to be done (by other people). Effectiveness of management is measured by productivity, not surveys.<p>More generally, there's a tendency to conflate management and leadership. Management is about operations and efficiency and production. Leadership is about inspiration and engagement. The two are related, to be sure, but distantly. Certainly, if I'm engaged, I'll work harder. But inspiration alone isn't going to streamline workflow, or increase accountability, or acquire the right tools, or choose the correct problem to be solving in the first place. It's not even going to do that great a job at keeping people on task and in scope.<p>To be sure, engagement is a useful quality. But first, it's not a necessary one, and second, it's not the role of management. If it's anyone's role, it's the role of executives. The ones with vision making bold statements and sweeping changes, not the ones down in the weeds doing the tactical work of maintaining the metaphorical tubes of work in the plumbing of productivity.",1261000532.0

During the Reagan era the mental institutions were emptied, and the mentally ill were basically thrown out on the street.  It's possible that San Francisco just has more mentally ill people than your typical American city (maybe because of the prevalence of drugs in the city, I don't know).<p>That's a lot of guess work on my part, but I've yet to hear a better explanation for why there are hordes of homeless in SF.<p>Saying that these people are ""just lazy"" because of their dependence on handouts and would just ""get over it"" if the help was taken away is just the sound of resentment without an ounce of compassion or understanding of the people who are really suffering.",1261000475.0

What I did, who it was for, why they needed it, and what they accomplished with it.</i><p>What of the developer who works on something ambitious that ultimately flops and becomes a total write-off for the company or client? What of the developer who coasted along doing nothing on a team of people who built some billion dollar product? What of the developer who can't really itemize their contribution in dollar amounts because they don't have the foggiest idea how much in dollar amounts they contributed, apart from how much they charged for their time?<p>Failure on a project is not a communicable disease that spreads to other projects through developers; success is likewise. Failure is so common that a developer without decades of work experience runs a non-negligible risk of not <i>having</i> a big success. And having a big success does not predict with a high degree of certainty future successes.<p>To add to the trickiness of this problem, we can't just tell people ""sniff out projects that smell of failure, and avoid."" How would they know? Developers are not clairvoyant, so the solution to this is to use heuristics. Some of these heuristics are unique to one individual who got burned in some particular way. Some are as ubiquious as development best practices. Either way, they can be wrong for a particular context, or sometimes wrong in general but kept in peoples' minds by inertia and repetition.<p>This is a harder problem than just quoting dollar amounts, and assuming that zero net dollars means zero talent. I can't help but think that when someone can put on their resume ""Built a site that made $x million dollars,"" it may be as much a reflection on their luck of being at the right place at the right time as it is on their ability to execute after finding themselves there.",1261000010.0
