But you need to be motivated, you need to invest time, you have to fight with the (foreign and abstract – non-intuitive) basic concepts and many people won’t have the time to do that. Becoming a lawyer is quite hard enough, thank you.<p>Just as it’s hard to be a doctor and a lawyer at the same time, so is it hard to be a programmer and a lawyer at the same time. Even if you only know a bit about medicine. Even if you only know a bit about programming. That’s not to say you can’t do it, but it’s not easy and many won’t do it.<p>It’s frustrating: I (not being a programmer) spent a few hundread hours of my life understanding programming and programming. Heck, I can explain bisection search or bubble sort to you. I can write cute little (clumsy) programs that do stuff (useless stuff, that is). But that’s not enough to save me hours in Excel. The most frustrating part about this is that I know what kind of automation is theoretically possible but I can’t actually do it. That knowledge is so often so unbearable. But I don’t have the time to invest a few days worth of work into understanding how to go from theoretical to practical, not for this one specific problem.<p>But that’s just how it is.

However, we can do the next best thing, and, indeed, we now have several good studies since 1999 that do just that. Some of these studies are epidemiological; some are ecological. What allows us to use them to reject the hypothesis that mercury in vaccines is an etiological agent that is either associated with or causes autism is a very simple but powerful prediction that the hypothesis makes. Quite simply, if the hypothesis is true and thimerosal-containing vaccines (TCVs) cause autism (or are even merely a significant contributing factor), we would expect that the removal of thimerosal from vaccines would lead to a rapid decrease in autism incidence and prevalence within 2-5 years.<p>""There have now been several studies that examined this very hypothesis in countries that removed thimerosal from their vaccines before the U.S. did. For example Hviid et al3 reported that autism prevalence in Denmark increased from 1991 to 1996 despite the removal of thimerosal from vaccines, while Madsen et al4 looked at the time period from 1971 to 2000 and concluded that autism diagnoses continued to increase after thimerosal was removed from vaccines. Neither study supported a causal link between TCVs and autism, and they were a prominent part of the dataset that was used by the Institute of Medicine to conclude in 2004 that there was no good evidence to support a link between TCVs and autism. A more recent study by Eric Fombonne5 in Montreal examined 27,749 children born from 1987 to 1998 attending 55 different schools. Cumulative thimerosal exposure by age 2 years was calculated for the 1987-1998 birth cohorts. This exposure ranged from 100-125 μg from 1987 to 1991, 200-225 μg from 1992 to 1995, and then none after 1996, which was when thimerosal was completely removed from vaccines in Canada. The result was that autism, ASD, and pervasive developmental disorder diagnoses continued to increase in all periods, demonstrating no relationship between TCVs and autism or ASDs. Even more recently, a large study6 failed to support a relationship between thimerosal and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, a result that led one of the investigators in the study, Sallie Bernard, a proponent of the thimerosal hypothesis, to disavow the study in a case of sour grapes, because it did not show what she had hoped that it would show.""",1264801314

(not a typo, rs30 vs rs9000). In a nation of limited resources surely the first priority needs to be getting the basic vaccines to the rural poor. But the vaccine companies aren't interested in spending Gates' money on low margin vaccines, they want their foot in the door of a national program.

But: \n1) a large system often requires hand-crafted SQL anyway. \n2) hand-crafted SQL performs MUCH better for anything but the trivial stuff.<p>The biggest issue for me: FRONT-END development.  Most web apps are pretty simple on the back-end, and coding database access by hand doesn't take long at all, I can live just fine without ActiveRecord.<p>Where I end up spending 90% of development time is on the front-end.  Writing HTML code by hand (and visual tools don't help here) makes me feel like I'm in the dark ages: I miss one character and have to spend ages hunting down design issues.  Javascript isn't much better for that matter.<p>IMO What's needed is server-side UI libraries, along the lines of windowing toolkits for desktop apps.<p>Reason I say server-side is because client-side libraries exist already (eg GWT) and most web apps still need SEO, perhaps unfortunately.<p>ASP.NET and Java Faces components don't really count either - you still have to write HTML code by hand to glue things together.<p>Ask any designer what a pain it is to get the layout correct in all the different browsers.  How many CSS hacks are required?  Just look how long it took Google engineers to make those Gmail buttons.  Crazy.<p>Why can't we pull all these ""best-practices"" of laying out and rendering common components into a server-side UI framework, so a programmer can use his knowledge of the programming language of his choice to build a web application?<p>Moreover, encapsulating everything into components leads to re-usable code with proper inheritance (instead of html template ""inheritance"") - something every programmer appreciates.<p>This is what I'm working on now - a java library to do just that.<p>Sceptics will say this is a ""one-size-fits-all"" and it won't work.  That's not what I've experienced so far.  Sure, some web app may need a custom ""component"" - so you need to write one yourself.  But from then on - it's re-usable.<p>Will all apps look the same, like on Windows?  Although that may not be a bad thing, they won't - proper separation of concerns allows designers to style components to their liking with CSS.<p>The aim of a GUI framework like this is to make sure web apps stick to proper design guidelines, instead of a developer deciding that he'll make his own ajax scroll-bar cause it looks cool, though most visitors can't figure out what it is.  There's a reason Apple apps look so professional.  They are designed around human interface guidelines.  Why re-invent the wheel for each web app?<p>I'm only doing this cause I got too frustrated with all the frameworks out there when trying to create my new web app.  They don't solve my UI needs.<p>Who else feels the same way?  I plan to open source the code, so if anyone wants to help, give me a shout.",1264799855

The teacher's guiding the student through the ""proper"" reasoning was convoluted, and not effective teaching. The presenter concluded that if you teach estimation, you should use an example like 209385324579+394875293745, where estimation is actually faster and easier than exact arithmetic.<p>Now, what real-life example demands systems of equations?

122,1087548,comment,1087182.0,1087182.0,0,0,jayair,,,I've noticed this behavior on quite a few sites recently. It was annoying since I was trying to quote a bunch of sites and I had to remove the links at the end every time.<p>Now it makes me double check every time I copy and paste. At first thought this might not seem too bad but modifying basic user behavior should be frowned upon.,1264798828
