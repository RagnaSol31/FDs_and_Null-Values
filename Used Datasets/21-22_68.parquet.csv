6,735484,comment,735270.0,735270.0,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"You seem obsessed with this topic, but I question the quality of your sources and analysis. Of course if there were an exponential rise in money supply or similar absent a different fiscal, monetary and regulatory climate then this would be deeply alarming. But I feel you're making a meta-version of the same mistake many economists did, of over-extrapolating from a short trend. Massive policy changes inevitably result in discontinuities of quantitative data, so it's a mistake to apply the trend which obtained up to the discontinuity to the new discontinuity.<p>To take an oft-used metaphor, suppose the economy is a car or truck and money supply is one part of the steering system. If you notice you're heading for a crash, well you're going to spin the wheel hard or slam on the brakes - there's your discontinuity. The path of the car, on the other hand (which is GDP), will change more slowly. And once you've observed that the new course takes you out of immediate danger, you can then moderate the control system which you had drastically changed. In other words, slamming on the brakes (or accelerating out of danger, or swerving - adjust your metaphor to taste) does not <i>in itself</i> damage the car, but aims to substantially alter its vector.<p>In the bigger picture, addressing the question of whether the US economy will be in the toilet or at least near to it for years to come, of course it will. Just as the unpleasant effects of a hangover can often go on longer than the drinking party which induced it, so it will take time to unwind and recover from the serious structural imbalances of recent years. Obviously, I have a more sanguine view of this process than you do, as I believe it will still be possible for opportunity and growth to take place in the US. If you find my view dangerously laid-back, I guess the appropriate thing for you would be to invest heavily in defense contractors and raw materials.",1249077497.0

Byte order is undefined.  Structure layout is mostly undefined -- you pick field order, but you can't choose packing, alignment, or padding rules.  The sizes of the integer types vary by platform and compiler.  Bit field layout, packing, and alignment are almost completely undefined.<p>What you're left to work with are unsigned characters, pointers, and bitwise operations.

There is a technically correct term for two notes played simultaneously (double stop also works for stringed instruments):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(music)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(music)</a><p>Of course, his instrument included a hundred or more voices, and several of them were on different octaves.  So, I think one can say this was a ""chord"" by the general definition of ""three or more notes from a key played simultaneously"".<p>And, musicians do frequently refer to dyads as chords, as long as the third is there.  The fifth has less harmonic weight (and never changes from major to minor) and the whole chord can be implied with just the first and the third.
