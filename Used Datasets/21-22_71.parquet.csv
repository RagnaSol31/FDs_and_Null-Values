Since the era of expansion in higher education and private research labs driven by the baby boom and cold war came to an end in the 1980's, the scientific job market hasn't been matched to the number of qualified applicants.

But our 10 minutes was quickly consumed with their excitement with our existing sites (and not on our new initiatives). Our existing site <a href=""http://bug.gd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bug.gd</a>  is a long-term play, not a quick growth play, and, given the 8% drop in Dow the afternoon before our interview, it was understandable that YC would be looking for something more aggressive. We just had a bit too much to discuss in only 10 minutes and I'm pleased to see the new video interviews giving YC'ers an opportunity to demonstrate more of their plans.<p>We continue to grow bug.gd with the launch of our error database for companies projects, errorhelp.com, but it remains a project of constant (but not explosive) growth. We have some exciting features planned, though, that I can't wait to get finished.<p>But the service we wanted to pitch to YC was our other crowd-sourced dating site, Yumbunny.com. Two months ago we launched to public beta and were covered on TechCrunch and other news. The site continues to grow and we're super excited about it.<p>As a publicity project for YB, our team also squeezed in time to put together Tinyarro.ws -- a URL shrinking hack that relies on unicode/IDN to create the shortest URLs possible. It's been getting great traffic due to its oddity and the inherent viral nature of url shrinkers. (All the silly discussion about URL shrinkers being evil lately has helped that, too.)<p>All in all, we're having a great time and are plowing ahead.

Look at all the features that your programming language of choice doesn't have, even though we've known them to be good ideas for 40+ years.<p>Finally, data is not some sacred thing that is set in stone forever.  If you need a different schema for a different application, then translate it.  When I worked in data warehousing for a large advertising company, we had to translate the data that was collected from the ad servers and translate it to a variety of forms; one for archival analysis with specialized tools, and another for showing the data in the web interface.  The schema that could cope with tracking millions of hits a minute did not do well for the off-the-shelf analytics tools or the web UI.

44,551722,comment,551617.0,551617.0,0,0,Tangurena,,,"One reason not mentioned in this article (but mentioned in others like at The Chronicle of Higher Education) is that changes in immigration and visas post-911 have strongly discouraged students from coming to the US. Many of the students who would have come, are prevented by ICE. Consequently, many don't even try for student visas in the US and seek higher education in other countries (for example, UK and Australia).<p>Another reason not mentioned is the soaring cost of education in the US. Rising far faster than inflation, higher education has become unaffordable for many. Post-baccalauriate degrees are even further out of reach.<p>And as for domestic students, the salary difference between a bachelors and masters (at least in electrical engineering, which was my first bachelors) would never pay for the time and money needed to get the degree. When I got my BS back in the 80s, the difference between BSEE and MSEE was $5k/year salary differential. Between the money and time lost getting the degree, presuming zero cost of money, going for the masters would have paid off after about 30 years in the workforce.<p>People in engineering are likewise worried about where the next generation of engineers are going to come from. Students have been voting with their feet and wallets to get away from short-term professions like engineering (the half-life of an engineering career is 7 years, which isn't long enough to pay off your student loans before you have to find a different career).",1239140393.0

On your competitor's site, you're able to quickly scan the page (and use the mouse scrolly to get more items instantly).  I see the scrolly does work on your horizontal scrollbar, but it's slow, and counterintuitive.   I didn't even think to use the scrolly to move back and forth. Intuitively, the scrolly is a vertical thing.<p>Key phrase: <i>Form follows function</i>.  I would almost certainly not want to buy something from your site because it takes the whole point of ecommerce (find and buy quickly) and replaces it with the brick and morter approach (find something, check the price, set it down, check something else), and does so sluggishly (clicking left and right, or using the little js scrollbar takes like 5-10 seconds to load - way to slow).<p>Your site looks nice and clean, but that's about it.

My machine isn't exactly old (core2duo, 4gig ram), and it feels like playing a modern FPS game on a netbook.<p>What's wrong with just using a div with overflow:auto, rather than over-designing it.<p>Another thought: perhaps allow the bottom part to stretch fill the whole page, so that you can see more items at a time.
