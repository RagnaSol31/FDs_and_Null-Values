Below are some details on my current skill level, what Im looking for, and what I can offer. Im located in San Francisco.<p>I know what I'm offering is limited in value relative to what you are offering me, so I am open to give you anything else I could reasonably offer for this mentorship.<p>Current Skill Level:\nI know the basics of Python and have gone through How to Think Like a Computer Scientist and written some small scripts. I understand how Django works and have been through some simple tutorials.<p>What Im Looking For:\nIm looking for someone who could efficiently guide me through learning, i.e. what tutorials/projects/resources I should go through. More a mentor than a tutor. Maybe wed meet once a week to code small samples. I would email you for help if I got stuck.<p>I do already spend time self-teaching, but I think I could learn much more efficiently through someone elses guidance. I think this, because I have self-learned a lot of things and have found with a little guidance, things go substantially quicker.<p>What I can offer:\nI can teach/guide you through learning:<p>- Account Fundamentals (understanding the 3 financial statements and how they flow together; balance sheet, cash flows and income statement)<p>- Interest theory, fixed income/debt/bond valuation<p>- M&A analysis and Valuation (Discounted cash flow, comparables/multiples, accretion/dilution)<p>- Options/Futures fundamentals (I think there is potentially an opportunity for adept programmers here to apply their skills).<p>- Bankruptcy/distressed corporate situations<p>- Crash course on how to dig through and interpret SEC filings (the only reliable free primary data source if you want to invest in public markets)<p>Why would you need these skills? I think they are crucial if you are:<p>1) An entrepreneur who will ever raise capital or sell your company<p>2) Someone interested in learning how to invest in the public or private markets  this knowledge will serve as a solid foundation/prerequisite<p>3) Someone in optimizing the financial efficiency of their business<p>Id like to think I am at least acceptably good at teaching. I used to tutor economics, accounting, SAT prep, etc. and have received good feedback.<p>Credentials:\nIve worked as an M&A/restructuring analyst at a reputable investment bank and have had offers from well-known financial institutions/hedge funds. Ive also had the fortune to have some excellent mentors in my past. I can provide more details if you want over email.<p>My email is in my profile, I look forward to hearing from you.<p>ADDITION: email added to profile.",1305409211.0

Some examples:<p>* How do you handle organizing the company into effective teams and projects with competing goals of growing revenue in existing products and establishing newer (though riskier) product development efforts?<p>* As more people come in, how do you best get them started, introduce them to corporate culture?<p>* Longer term employees often have a serious lack of people management skills; as you bring in new people with those skills, how do you start to build a management strength in a company?<p>* When is the ideal time to establish performance reviews?

It gives them clues as to how to get themselves healthier when all else has failed.  I talk about what worked for me in large part because I have zero interest in giving advice per se.  I think that is part of what is wrong with conventional medicine:  Doctors routinely prescribe treatments with short term benefits and long term costs, which is not so bad if you are basically healthy and can take the hit for an acute problem.  But it's deadly if you have a chronic health issue.  And the fact that they take this basic approach is no secret.  It's done quite openly:  We all know about the huge fold-outs detailing the negative side effects that come with most prescription drugs and the waivers that have to be signed before they will perform surgery.  Since getting myself healthier relied heavily on trading short term costs for long term gains, I have zero interest in replicating a system that I am convinced is part of the problem.<p><i>So your best bet is to sell sympathy and motivation. My suggestion: make it more of a forum, allow other people to tell their stories as well. Focus on sharing emotions as much as sharing solutions.</i><p>I own several email lists.  I cannot for the life of me get conversations going on them.  I also briefly had a forum for the site.  It was overrun with spam and had maybe three members (myself included).  So I've tried that route and failed, quite consistently and miserably.  It works better for me to try to get people sharing info when someone else owns/runs the discussion space.  And that is a piece I am working on elsewhere, for the purpose of helping people help themselves.  I'm also not interested in selling sympathy or motivation per se.  There is a saying that ""an example is the best lecture"" and I have found that to be true.  So I do offer myself as an example in hopes that it inspires people to feel ""If she can do it, I can do it"".  But I have zero interest in being some cheerleader.<p>Again, I was not asking about monetizing the site.  Only about getting traffic, a question you have not addressed.
