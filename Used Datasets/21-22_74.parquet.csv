Argh!) with too much funding, then crash and sully the reputation of entire fields with their profligate spending and successive failures.<p>The scientific grant system is even worse! With the rate of grants being accepted at 5%, everyone becomes extremely conservative. Many professors spend most of their time fundraising, not doing science. There is a good case that science would be progressing faster with no government funding at all.<p>There are <i>obvious</i> things the government could do to improve entrepreneurship. Like simply not kicking our entrepreneurs out! Stapling a green card to our graduate's diplomas -- the fact that we invest nearly a quarter million dollars in each STEM PHD and then don't let them stay has been a known absurdity for more than decade, yet they still don't fix this problem.<p>Or how about taxing oil and gas like everything else! Even ignoring the trillions of dollars spent policing the persian gulf region, the tax policies surrounding oil amount to an enormous subsidy, making it cheaper in the US than almost anywhere in the world. Simply taxing it would save the budget and dramatically improve prospects for green energy.<p>The list goes on. I'm stunned by the collective incompetence of the government in stimulating startup growth. Maybe there are good, structural reasons for inaction in the short term, but these issues have been around for years!",1323554373.0

There is a long-standing doctrine that SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES ABOUT NATURAL LAWS AND PROCESSES should not be patentable.<p>If a discovery is made about the correlation between a measurement of something NATURAL in the body, and a dosage of a drug that should be administered, or between the dosage that is administered, and the effect is has on the body, this is MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE. THIS IS SCIENCE. It is not a patentable thing, because doctors cannot dispossess themselves of this knowledge once being told it. They are always able to USE THE KNOWLEDGE IN THEIR HEAD when treating a patient.<p>Therefore, this development seems to me to be atrocious, as it represents the first step in patenting KNOWLEDGE of natural phenomena.<p>IP law wants to encourage creativity by giving exclusive monopoly rights in creations, but at the same time BALANCE it with giving the public the freest possible access to the results. This is now being attacked at every turn. MPAA, RIAA are lobbying for SOPA and PIPA. Copyright lengths are still being extended. And now, new forms of patents are being considered.

And I think it might be.<p>Here is Andrew Revkin on Klein:<p><i>Naomi Klein, the author of a string of provocative and popular books including The Shock Doctrine, recently took on global warming policy and campaigns in Capitalism vs. the Climate, a much-discussed cover story for The Nation that has been mentioned by readers here more than once in the last few weeks.<p>The piece begins with Kleins conclusion, reached after she spent time at a conclave on climate sponsored by the libertarian Heartland Institute, that passionate corporate and conservative foes of curbs on greenhouse gases are right in asserting that a meaningful response to global warming would be a fatal blow to free markets and capitalism.<p>She challenges the environmental left to embrace this reality instead of implying that modest changes in lifestyle and shopping habits and the like can decarbonize human endeavors on a crowding planet.<p>Please dive in. The piece is particularly relevant this week given the continued standoffs and disconnect between stated goals and behavior at the climate treaty talks in Durban, South Africa. Whether you embrace or dispute her conclusions, the article is a worthy and substantive provocation. I disagree with her in pretty profound ways, yet some of her points echo my assertion awhile back that greenhouse-driven climate change is not the story of our time but a symptom of much deeper issues</i><p>So indeed Motls' piece ties in with Revkin's as part of an ongoing web-wide conversation on the ramifications of the proposed solutions to global climate change.",1323553158.0

However, the rest of this article relies on weak connections and examples from other industries to argue that medical patents must die. If medical patents die, medical innovation dies.<p>For a moment, let's apply the realities of ""medical innovation"" (researchers across private and public fields) to internet innovation. Imagine that every app you published took four years and $100M to get to a testable product. Keep in mind, this is still unusable. You go out and spend millions more testing it on ""fake users"" (animals). If this works, you need to go raise hundreds of millions more to test it on your first batch of real users... then a second... then a third.<p>Billions of dollars later, you realize that your app doesn't work as it was intended. You've just spent 6 years and billions of dollars figuring that out.  There is no fail fast, in this world.<p>Lets say your product actually makes it to market. Congrats, now you need to compete against copy cat app developers who can replicate your app at a fraction of the price. How do you defend yourself? Innovative marketing? Large email list? Good SEO? SEM? None of that works in medicine, because the switching costs are positive for a patient.<p>This is why we need patents. Without them we would see a significant reduction in medical innovation. When markets don't create enough risk-adjusted incentives to promote innovation, the government must step in to create those incentives. I'm not saying our system is perfect, but it's better than nothing (at least in medicine).<p>I spent a long time working on a medical startup and it's orders of magnitude more complex than most of the apps we see celebrated in our hacker community.
