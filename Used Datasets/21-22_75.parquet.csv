I agree that there is relatively little division of labour in science, compared to engineering; or at least the labour isn't divided in the same way.

There are very few observations incoming that actually add to or question the prevailing theories of a given field.

To be useful as a scientist, there's a good change that you'll need to be an expert in at least two things.<p>I don't think it should be surprising that generating novel knowledge requires substantially more overhead than does acquiring and exploiting it (eg. engineering, or any practical pursuit where division of labour works so well).

Also, relying on a URL shortening service introduces the problem of link rot. Lastly, I think the novelty of simply taking a picture of a QR code and being instantly taken to a site rather than typing out a URL makes them more likely to be used. It's still a good idea to include a URL, but a QR code could certainly have some additional benefit.",1268859899.0

I could see myself using it if it limited itself everytime I went somewhere (ie: 2 minutes for hacker news, since I check it too damn much), but there is simply no way I'm going to go to your site first and then enter it.  The bookmarklet is a good attempt at a fix, but it really needs to be seamless and automatic.  For me deciding how much time I need on a site each time I go to it requires a fair amount of thought and consideration, whereas I could get used to getting everything I need out of HN in 2 minutes unless I was there for a lengthy stay.<p>Focus on an FF plugin maybe?",1268859820.0

It's not a huge application, probably around 300 hours of work.<p>Coming from a framework stack of WebWork/Struts2, Spring and Hibernate, it's a total breath of fresh air. Everything is there that you ask for, even nice little helper methods like encrypting strings, resizing images or serving byte arrays as documents.<p>We keep expecting to find some big shortcoming that brings about loads of painful refactoring, but it hasn't happened yet!<p>The templating engine is simple, clean and gets out of your way. The hot reloading really does work. The fact that there is NO XML configuration in our app is blissful and a real wake up call to how absurd Spring and Hibernate configuration used to be. The error messages are almost always enough to show you straight away where the problem is.<p>The only downside is that it completely shuns the entire Servlet API (although I appreciate that this is where a lot of the simplicity comes from). As a result you cant leverage any servlet-based components. But maybe that's a good thing.<p>I'm seriously impressed. I thought my company was going to have to make a jump to python or ruby to get such a clean, simple well thought through full-stack framework, but we dont.",1268859785.0
