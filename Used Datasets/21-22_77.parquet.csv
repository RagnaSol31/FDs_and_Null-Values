59,1798911,comment,1796861.0,1797469.0,0,0,SeanLuke,,,"> Memoization is top-down dynamic programming.<p>It really is not.<p>Memoization has the same time complexity as dynamic programming.  But it has much worse space complexity.<p>First some approximate definitions:  The tasks to which memoization and dynamic programming are typically useful are \nthose in which a problem can be decomposed into subproblems, and subsubproblems, and so on, where problem->subproblem dependency is many-to-many, not one-to-many.  That is, the dependency graph is a DAG, not a tree.  By <i>memoization</i> I mean the process of computing the solution to a function by first looking up in a hash table to see if the solution has already been found, and only computing the solution and storing it if it has not been found.  By <i>dynamic programming</i> I mean the bottom-up process of first solving all of the lowest level decomposed subproblems, then solving the next higher level subproblems using the solutions found at the lower level, then the next higher level using the solutions found so far, and so on up to the desired top-level problem.<p>Whether memoization will do the job depends on the nature of your task.  In some tasks the higher-level problems depend on simultaneously knowing the answers to all of the subproblems at every level.  For those kinds of problems memoization will be just fine.<p>But for <i>many</i> dynamic programming tasks, you don't need to keep around all the low-level problems: just the most immediate ones.  For example, it's often the case that once you've computed problem layer N, you can get rid of all the layers 0...N-1.  They're not necessary to compute problem layer N+1.  For these kinds of problems the space cost of dynamic programming is just in keeping that immediate layer N.  But memoization has no way of forgetting these layers, because not only is it top-down, but it's also typically depth-first.  As a result, by the time you solve the final layer, you have <i>all of the previous layers</i> stored in your hash table.",1287264463.0

Publishers' current revenue model for ebooks is an extension of that for their print books. These are colossal organizations. At the Startup School today Reid Hoffman (founder LinkedIn) talked about the ability for organizations to pivot. Small startups can easily pivot, these large corporations take time and money to change direction. Publishers have not changed their production processes to respond to ebooks. They have just added another step in the process.<p>Would I pay more for an ebook than a print book? probably not. Most ebooks available have less features than a print book. Ebooks are portable, cant get wet, font can be resized, etc... Print books dont expire or change formats, I can share it with my buddy, and I can scribble in it. Unless the ebook costs less I probably wont get it.<p>Does an ebook have to cost less than a print book? of course not. There are a lot of cool features an online text could have. Searching the book is just the beginning. Integrated audio, video, games could bring new life to stories. The author can continually update the text and interact with readers. The problem is ebooks dont have any of this stuff right now.<p>Whether any of the large publishers innovates, or new companies rise, the future of publishing is through adding value to the digital texts. By adding value to the texts, the publishers can embrace open content allowing sharing and remixing of text. As the book marketplace moved online, barriers to publishing will also be removed. This will enable authors to receive a greater share for their work.",1287263940.0

This is a very long list of <i>requirements</i>. They are indeed charming, and they do indeed sound all the right geek dog whistles. But they are all about why the candidate will be valuable to the company.<p>It's definitely better to be explicit and evocative about how important the role is going to be, and that does make this ad better than most HR job ads.<p>But an even better job post would spend the majority of its words selling the job to the candidate.<p>(Also, the skills list at the bottom is a straight-up unforced error. There are obviously candidates who are very  much worth considering who will not meet all these requirements. From bitter experience: give anyone an excuse to believe that they're not qualified, and chances are they'll take that excuse. A constant thrum of feedback we get: people aren't applying to Matasano because they're afraid they're not ""good enough"", which is shocking for us to hear. Our only spelled-out requirement is ""ability to code in any language""!)",1287262818.0
