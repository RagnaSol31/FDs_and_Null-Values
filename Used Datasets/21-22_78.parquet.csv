I will admit I was a SQL employee working on a component that was shipping in VS2010 (there's a handful of teams that did this, Entity Framework being one of them, although I wasn't actually on the EF team, they are a pretty visible example). My team really grew to dislike DevDiv and their practices quite a bit in a lot of regards (however, in other areas I enjoyed DevDiv a lot). To be totally blunt, SQL has their shit together a lot better than DevDiv does. And to be perfectly blunt again, it was the thought of doing this all over again for Dev11 that was a major motivator in me wanting to leave MS.<p>And is 2010 worth the upgrade for most people? Hard to say. There's nothing in it that is truly mind blowing or ""must have"", it just iterates and improves a ton of stuff.

Adobe's proprietary attempt at creating a cross-platform layer is thwarted. And Apple counts on having enough developers for new apps who already have a background in (or are willing to learn or relearn) Objective-C, C, C++ and JavaScript. It's simple and pragmatic.<p>That said, I'm a developer and I generally only use FOSS products for software. But I give Steve Jobs and his advisors more and more credit for business intelligence.<p>A lot of these comments are about Android. Could be that Apple learned from Sun's mistakes, whereas Google wasn't old enough to be around for the full cycle of that. I love Lua and Scheme. I wouldn't be surprised if senior engineers at Apple also love various different VMs, etc. And yet they would fully support this strategic move by Apple.<p>Why? Steve Jobs' genius has less to do with his douchey presentations and more to do with seeing the big picture dozens of business quarters before everyone else. When you've been seeing that far ahead for three decades, and have all the experience and confidence from succeeding with that like fourteen times, controversial decisions like with Section 3.3.1 aren't as difficult. They are one of 50 decisions that you've made 6 months ago with many different things in mind that won't be released to the public for quite some time -- many of them involving hardly black-and-white tradeoffs (see the Wikipedia entry for Jobs quoting Wayne Gretzky).<p>Apple has a model that works for them. And free software, free digital rights management, openness  -- if it gets in the way of their business strategy, by default they're going to plan around it.<p>If you really want Apple to change their policy, get the CEOs of businesses who develop apps to voice concern to Jobs. Show that Flash and Lua and Mono or whatever are mature enough technologies from a business standpoint. Make the argument that it's too much of a gamble for the iPhone/iPad 3GS to be without flash support with other tablets on the rise. (Apple is of course betting on HTML5 pretty heavily.)<p>I guess my point is that: 'Five rational arguments against Apple's 3.3.1 policy' is a good start. But those are mostly developer-based arguments. As a developer whose not in the embedded space, I have no idea what the business strategy arguments would be. But as a developer, I know when a client's use of a library's interface is slighty off. Or something like that. Maybe I don't even know that. Anyhoo.",1271106375.0
