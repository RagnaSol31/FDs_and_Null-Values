The resulting closure is ""closed over x"", as well. I guess in this context ""over"" means ""including"". So you've got a bunch of references and a function laying around. You take a ""closure"" like you would a tarp or something, and put it ""over"" all that stuff. Now you've got the function and the references ""closed over"" by the ""closure"".<p>Personally, I think this terminology is a little weird and immediately intuitive to someone without a math background [1].

Whoever produces or purchases that commodity has an effect on the money supply.""<p>But in that sense, nothing has changed for fiat currency. Fiat currencies are still produced and purchased just like commodities, with the exception that governments can produce all they want to get a leg up on that game. That's what they use monetary inflation for, to cheat at currency trading and bonds games.<p>My point is that nobody should be ""in charge"" of a currency. Currencies came about through consensus in the market, not through government mandate. Nobody has the right to be the final arbiter of all ""dollars"" any more than anyone has the right to be the final arbiter of ""time"" (the only truly important resource) or ""air and water"" (the first truly vital resources). Monopolies are not good, especially monopolies that come about through force, which is as governments are. In a society that is claims to be free and equitable, having a super-citizen government is not equitable.<p>A single, mandated currency is a borderline oppressive idea. There are laws against ""undermining the ubiquity and stability of the dollar"". They're used against people who want to mint their own coins of their own design and use them in transactions with people willing to accept them. If people want to use something other than dollars for transactions, then more power to them. Hell, publicly traded corporations already do it, often using their own stock holdings as a medium of trade for merger deals and such. When you look at the plethora of trading (I mean this in the generic sense, not the Wall Street sense) options available to anyone with enough wealth, I think it starts to become clear that financial and monetary laws and regulations are really only meant for the working classes.",1257543140.0

58,926978,comment,926648.0,926931.0,0,0,teilo,,,"The alternative to government supplied corporations is not much better: partnerships and conglomorates, whereby natural persons accumulate vast sums of wealth, individually or collectively. The government cannot forbid corporations from forming. It does not, however, have to recognize them. Individuals can enter freely into contracts which create partnerships and conglomorates. However, this ends up at the same place. Instead of individuals hiding behind a government-created fiction, they hide behind contract law, which cannot be abrogated without undermining the nature of law itself.<p>Corporations, by their very nature, are a legal fiction designed to circumvent that aspect of of the free market that punishes unconstructive behavior. Such an entity should never be created in the first place, if the leaders of a government had the intrinsic integrity to hold individuals accountable, rather than legal fictions. But the same legal fictions that protect the citizens behind corporations can also protect those who create the laws in the first place. Thus, corporations are the invention of lawmakers who themselves use said legal protections.<p>But this gets back to what TA rightly points out: Rand's assumption that the leaders of a capitalist system have integrity is false. But this is not necessarily a bad thing in itself. It becomes bad when that lack of integrity is joined to ideology, for the two are not mutually exclusive, or when it circumvents the very laws that establish said capitalist economy. If the problem were merely lack of integrity, then pure economics would take over - the government would succeed when the economy itself succeeded, and integrity would be irrelevant. That is the essential nature of capitalism: It assumes that because greed can never be eliminated, it is best to use greed to the benefit of everyone overall.<p>Ideology short-circuits this process. If, for example, taxation were driven entirely by greed, said greed would act as a sort of feedback mechanism. Taxes would automatically be set at the level that the market can best bear without being impeded by the taxes themselves, and thus driving down revenues.

And I think it will be popular on both the server-side and client-side.<p>But, making bets about technology 20 years out is a risky game.  20 years ago, there was no Java (and now it has come and gone as The Next Big Thing), JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, or Python.  Perl was just getting started and Haskell was mostly just a gleam in some academic's eye.  All of those techs are still on upward trajectories to varying degrees, and some rose faster than others, and some (Haskell, for example) have only recently started to see a burst of activity and interest.<p>In other words, I don't actually have any idea what's going to happen in languages, but I suspect that in 20 years, it probably won't be recognizable as anything we're using today.  Because the languages most used today for new projects did not exist 20 years ago.

68,926967,comment,926077.0,926722.0,0,0,andreyf,,,"Great question! Every time you call <i>foo</i>, a new scope containing <i>x</i> is created. That scope ""travels"" with <i>bar</i>, and is evaluated (dereferenced might be a better word) just as any other variable inside <i>bar</i> would be - during the execution of <i>bar</i>. A global variable is just a variable in the topmost (""global"") scope.<p>But my example doesn't make the distinction to clarify that at all. Here's a better one:<p><pre><code>    function colors() {\n        var cs = ['red', 'green', 'blue'],\n            i = 0;\n\n        function nextcolor() {\n            i = (i+1) % cs.length;\n            return cs[i];\n        }\n\n        return nextcolor;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nEvery time you call <i>colors</i>, a new local scope is created. Easiest way to think of scopes is as maps from strings to values. In this case, a new scope <i>{ cs: ['red', 'green', 'blue'], i: 0 }</i> is created every time you calls <i>colors</i>. If the language didn't support closures, that scope would be destroyed when <i>colors</i> finishes execution, but in JS, that scope is bound to <i>nextcolor</i> and returned along with <i>nextcolor</i> in a closure. Now, every time you call a particular <i>nextcolor</i> returned by a call to <i>colors</i>, the <i>cs</i> and <i>i</i> variables will reference those same values. Example using firebug:<p><pre><code>    >>> A = colors()\n    >>> B = colors()\n    >>> A() => ""green""\n    >>> A() => ""blue""\n    >>> B() => ""green""\n    >>> B() => ""blue""\n    >>> A() => ""red""\n    >>> A() => ""green""\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nKeep asking if anything is unclear.

Perl ended up on top in both cases.  Admittedly, we have a historic codebase of several hundred thousand lines of Perl, but we've both worked in Python at least as much as Perl in the past several years and there is a version of our API in Python that we could have started from.  We weren't forced to choose Perl for legacy reasons, but we chose it, anyway.<p>We're pretty much agnostic about languages; we prefer dynamic languages, but not much beyond that.  Our website is running on Drupal and several custom modules in PHP.  We'll be adding those afore-mentioned web services via frontend PHP code, but the backend will be Perl.  Haskell might make an appearance at some point in the future for concurrency work where performance matters, but for now, Perl is plenty fast and has reasonable concurrency mechanisms for our needs.<p>So, we're still cranking out tens of thousands of lines of Perl every year, and will be launching a couple of new products in the next six months also written in Perl.<p>But, I will mention that our products directly and easily support PHP, Ruby on Rails and Django deployments, but not Catalyst.  And it's because we're simply not hearing requests for Catalyst from paying customers.  Maybe the Catalyst developers are more old-school and don't trust a control panel (even one written in Perl), or maybe there's a helluva a lot more PHP and a handful more Ruby on Rails and Django developers out there (note that PHP developers using our software outnumber RoR and Django developers to a degree that makes the latter two practically noise in the signal).
