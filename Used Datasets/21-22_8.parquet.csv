I didn't see anything in the article to suggest that HMC itself was dangerously leveraged, though.  Considering the long-term outlook and vast wealth of Harvard, one wouldn't expect it to gamble anywhere near as much as a hot-shot hedge fund, or even as much as a pension fund with an implicit government guarantee.

11,409155,comment,408060.0,408530.0,0,0,shimon,,,"Good points.  The decline we should be worried about is not in the currency, but in the competitive advantage of the US relative to other countries.  If it gets more affordable to do business elsewhere, you'll find fewer and fewer good companies on US financial markets.  (Many claim SarbOx has already done significant damage here.)  If emerging economies can continue to reduce costs -- by tackling security problems, corruption, red tape, improving education and infrastructure, etc. -- faster than we can, US equities may lose their world-leading position.  That's not to say it's a zero-sum game; it's quite possible that all the world's equities markets could do well, and the US could lead without being dominant.  But equity investments are more strongly tied to their country of origin than globally traded ""real"" commodities like timber or oil, so if you think the US might lose some competitive advantage -- like if it got significantly less appealing for valuable workers to immigrate here -- you might want to skip the stock certificates and instead buy the paper they're printed on.",1230155160

If Bill Gates had never been born, Moore's law would still have been in effect and computers would still have got ever cheaper. The Apple Mac would still have been built; the IBM PC would still have been built -- but probably running CP/M-86, DR-DOS and (later) GEM. The Atari ST and Commodore Amiga would still have happened. Unix and C would still have been invented, and their intrinsic wourth would have let to them becoming popular. HTML and http (or something very like them) would still have been invented.<p>The only difference is that their would have been no baleful, anti-competitive Microsoft watching over all and limiting progress. (How many startups weren't started in the 1990s because their putative founders thought Microsoft would strangle them if they showed signs of success?). So, minus Gates, if anything today's technology would have arrived quicker.",1230154530

Friedman and a lot of his neighbors in his generation were early in urging their fellow Americans to have environmental concern and to be aware that America is just part of the world. I have good evidence for this, because my fifth-grade class made a time capsule in 1969 to be opened in the year 2001, with predictions of that year.<p>Perhaps Friedman's elementary classmates and my elementary classmates were part of a minority in America, but maybe people who share those concerns are still part of a minority in America. Anyway, these days it's easier for more Americans to see what is going on in the rest of the world, and there is plenty to learn from.<p>P.S.

It's odd that you mention Newton -- the idea that some combination of regulations/deregulations will engineer a better economy is why our tax code is currently incomprehensible. Perhaps it might work if we try it again for the 50 thousandth time?<p>It might be better to look at the economy like a chaotic system, with billions of independent agents all working randomly yet somehow creating a greater whole. The trick is a minimalist yet-changing set of constraints to allow the chaos to continue and be productive. Once you start trying to put it in a box, or choose special parameters, or try to understand or constrain the entire thing in some fashion that you <i>can</i> understand, you're kidding yourself.<p>My opinion only. I can tell you that history is littered with really smart people, governments, and political parties who thought they could understand/control economics. Sometimes people mistake what I'm saying for laissez-faire or free-market philosophies. It's not. It's simply acknowledging that the over-engineering of things we don't understand usually ends up in stagnation and corruption, not growth and opportunity.<p>We're in quite a mess now in the U.S. because politicians get elected promising more things than they can deliver. If you ask me, we started heading down this track once the federal government usurped the states back in the 1860s. There's no more sharing of power -- people slowly are figuring out that they can directly vote themselves whatever the government can borrow. No kind of market or tax policy is going to be able to get us out of this larger problem. That's the meta-issue.",1230152638
