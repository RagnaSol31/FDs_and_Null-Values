The problem is that the conversion to PDF is not tied to revenue for the project.

INTRODUCTION \nMost forms of life on Earth are adapted to growth within the temperature range, 10-45C. Microorganisms, known as thermophiles, however, grow optimally between 45C and 70C. Recently novel microbes, growing at temperatures above 80C have ben reported, and the upper temperature limit for growth has been extended to 113C and 121C by the discovery of  Pyrolobus fumarii  and “strain 121”, both having been isolated from hydrothermal vents (Kashefi and Lovley, 2003). Stetter  (1992) termed these newly discovered microorganisms “hyperthermophiles”. There also exist in the literature disputed claims that bacteria, isolated from black smokers can grow at 250C (Baross and Deming, 1983).  Louis and Kumar (2003) also reported that red cells which fell in so-called “Red Rain” over at Kerala in India (and which are studied here) could replicate at 300 C (Louis and Kumar, 2003, 2006), a claim that needs to be verified independently if it is to gain acceptance.</i><p>Wickramasingh and Wainwright were publicly critical of the earlier claims made by Louis and Kumar in 2003. This paper investigates one aspect of those claims by testing whether any growth of these cells take place, and if so whether it can occur at high temperatures. The answer to both those questions is 'yes'. It's reasonable to begin by investigating whether the phenomenon occurs at the known upper temperature bound mentioned in the first citation, and to solicit confirmation of that result, before investigating other conditions for growth whose very possibility is speculative at present.<p>I don't know why you're ragging on this paper so much. The news report is trash but the paper is cautious (indeed the Louis papers are a good deal more cautious than their linkbaity titles might suggest). Even if further study determines that that the cells are definitely terrestrial, the fact that such 'extremophiles' are not confined to extreme environments like the walls of volcanoes or undersea is itself news.",1283550173.0

""Lawyers can exploit it more easily"" doesn't work as a rational argument for me. It seems like almost all privacy violations out there happen well within the constraints of privacy policies, or by accident. There's rarely ambiguity in a policy which gets exploited to enable something unexpected. It seems like a really low-concern area that doesn't deserve the kind of FUD I'm seeing in this thread.

Sometimes natural selection actually increases variability by favoring outliers (specialists) over the average (generalists).<p>Consider a population with two food sources that require slightly different characteristics to access, for example, food sources at different water depths.  They'll be most easily accessed by creatures whose neutral buoyancy puts them at that depth of water.  Natural selection may favor individuals who are most able to generalize (that is, those who float right in between) or those who are most specialized (those who float right at the level of one food source or the other), depending on various details of the system.<p>If you have the relevant mathematical background, you may want to look up some of the recent models of ""adaptive speciation"" (Ulf Dieckmann and Michael Doebeli have done some great work in this area; their book [0] has some great examples.)<p>[0] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=Z-gCf7TD9-MC&lpg=PP1&ots=6XAgn7RZPJ&dq=adaptive%20speciation&pg=PP1",

Perfect for milking the cash cow.<p>-Windows 95? Come on, your memory fails. It was utterly usable and crashed hard everyday. Any other OS of the time was better. It was so basic... paint? notepad? a big pile of shit. And they have been budling the same crap more than 10 years until Windows 7.<p>-IE6 was good at the time. It's sad it was so many time without new versions.<p>-The first usable SQLS was the 2000, and sincerely, until 2003 oracle ran circles around it.<p>-.NET and C",
