For example, if you have on-disk state, unless the threads are able to share memory (either by running within the same process or using UNIX shm) you're risking a situation where\nthreads are competing for resources like OS page cache (provided you're not doing your own in-process caching and direct I/O, but even in this case, you've now lost the ability share a resource between any two connections without copying).<p>Some e.g., Asana have added fibers to Javascript (in their case V8): <a href=""http://asana.com/blog/?p=49"" rel=""nofollow"">http://asana.com/blog/?p=49</a><p>The previous post from RethinkDB is quite interesting in terms of motivation for coroutines: to me, this superficially seems like SEDA. Here, instead of stages in the pipeline (thread pool per stage, first stage being processing events from epoll/kqueue, thread per core in each pool, each thread holding state machines, communication between threads via a queue) you are using coroutines for clearer code.",1293141594.0

First-class coroutines are very similar to first-class continuations, and many of the same fundamental issues manifest.<p>Lua has one of the best coroutine implementations I've seen. Scheme has continuations which are convertible to coroutines, while Lua has coroutines which are convertible to (one-shot) continuations, with community insight on their use.",1293138844.0

I spent 2 straight years of high school working part-time and full-time summers at trading firms and realized this is exactly what I want to do.<p>What we need is shut down this ""prestige whoredom"" prevalent across all elite colleges in America and have graduates try different careers to figure out what in the world they want to do with their lives.

The position (or dimension if you will) of a keyword in the data-vector is all important. So equal vectors in terms of the symbolic presence of a number of keywords will generate great cosine distances the moment the keywords are not in equal position.,1293138713.0

This could happen in any case where types are converted: calling functions, assigning variables...whether or not any printing or typedefs or chars are involved.  You could see surprising behavior anywhere, and arguably in places where it is a lot harder to debug.<p>The ""explicit"" keyword for constructors addresses part of the problem, but not all of it.  The real issue is one of programming style.  Personally, I feel this is a case where C++ programmers should think more like C programmers, and not be offended by having to give functions different names, or otherwise making things more distinct when <i>the behavior is totally different anyway</i>.<p>If I have to call handleChar() and handleInt() with an ""if"" statement, instead of relying on one of the 12 overloads of handleAnything() to perform magic, I think that is <i>fine</i> because it will one day save me hours of debugging.  Notice that printf(""%c"", c) has pretty damned clear behavior, and it requires someone to say the equally-clear printf(""%d"", (int)c) to get a number when they want a number; this might not be C++-like, but it's the right way to think about the problem.",1293138229.0
