And I'd be willing to wager that she's already leveraging that knowledge when it suits her.<p>If you try to prepare her for it, all you're really doing is letting her know how important <i>you</i> think it is.

Let's face it, unless she is unlucky enough to be ""ugly"" in a way that removes her from the accepted norm, there is a high probability that somebody somewhere will date her and love her when she is older.<p>Not to discount the effect that our culture places on girls and physical attractiveness, but girls learn much from their parents, especially there fathers. If she can see that what she looks like doesn't matter to you one iota, odds are she will not see any real value in any guy that mentions how pretty she is. You can't be swept off your feet by somebody calling you pretty when being pretty isn't how you define your worth.<p>In other words, by worrying about her getting the pretty comment from you, you're probably working against your intended objective.",1256248404.0

To try to put into words what I think is going on in my head: I link based on something in the piece that I think folks here will find interesting. But I don't assume that the title will be sufficient. Only that it will be a primer for following the link.<p>In this case, the given title wasn't good. So I tried to pick out the primer that led to my saying: ""That's interesting"". But admittedly I won't spend more than a few seconds thinking about the title. I'm just not too worried about accuracy so long as it's in the general semantic ballpark. I'd say if it leads to an incomplete impression which the article resolves then I'm okay with it. That's why I added the ellipse.<p>Sorry, I'll try to do better but I'll probably fail. The bookmarklet makes it easy to just throw up interesting stuff. The title for me is simply a shorthand for saying: This was interesting to me. I similarly interpret upvotes - this was interesting to the community. Comments start to get at accuracy - kind of.<p>To be honest though, even as Gladwell says that second part, it seems to me he wants real world experience informing journalism. I think that's the most interesting bit. Grad school, it seems to me, is itself sheltered from ""real"" stories. That's my current bias, I guess.",1256248368.0

My physical desk can hold absolutely anything no matter shape or size and I can stack things and put them in piles and clear them off with one swoop of my hand. Also, my computer desktop has nothing on it, which is quite different from my physical desk.<p>The fact that ""windows"" can ""stack... like paper"" shows that the real world isn't being modeled. Last time I checked, windows could not be stacked like paper and windows on my computer have very little resemblance to paper in any other way. I'm quite certain paper wasn't the inspiration for stacking windows.<p>I think WYSIWYG editors <i>are</i> a bad idea, precisely because they try to model the real world too closely.<p>Object oriented programming is about much more than modeling real-world objects in code. Sometimes (often in fact) that is exactly the wrong way to create objects.<p>Trying to model software off real-world objects is how you get stupid things like clicking and dragging to flip pages on a document you're reading, all while animating the turning of the pages.<p>The examples you give (where they are accurate at all) are about using physical objects to provide a metaphor for understanding software. The perfect example is the trash / recycle bin. It provides a metaphor that makes it easier for people to learn what it does, but it isn't modeled after a real trash can or recycling bin. You don't have to empty it. You can, but it's not required. You don't have to change bags. It isn't picked up twice a week. It doesn't start to smell after a while. It's of essentially unlimited size. If it was modeled after a real trash can, some of these things would have been implemented in some way.",1256248245.0

The most convincing argument that I see for this is traditional RDBMSs are all row-oriented and organized via relational theory, and that a lot of data is better stored and/or manipulated via column-oriented, or graph theory, or object oriented systems.",1256245412.0

For instance now that I'm used to Redis lists and sets I feel strange when I'm using an SQL DB and I've a problem when to just pushing or popping stuff is the trivial thing to do.<p>Of course SQL databases are very useful and a great tool for many domains. It is also not a balanced view to think that SQL databases are to trow away. Sometimes the table-based data model, with the querying power of SQL, is just the way to go for many kind of problems, or in addition to a different kind of DB.",1256245224.0
