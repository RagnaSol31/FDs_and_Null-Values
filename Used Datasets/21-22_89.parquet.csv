21,2800430,comment,2800084.0,2800084.0,14,0,Mz,,,"<i>The risk-taking, novelty-seeking and obsessive personality traits often found in addicts can be harnessed to make them very effective in the workplace. For many leaders, its not the case that they succeed in spite of their addiction; rather, the same brain wiring and chemistry that make them addicts also confer on them behavioral traits that serve them well.</i><p>This is ridiculous in some ways. Yes, certain personality traits predispose you to certain things.  But environment also plays a role.  I imagine most leaders suffer from something I would call ""bored gifted kid syndrome"".  And if they find a means to be adequately engaged, it goes away and stops being a ""personality problem"".<p>In fact, framing it as ""addictive personality"" helps create problems by vilifying them in a way that seems inescapable -- like ""you were born defective"".  My oldest son is profoundly gifted and was prone to ""addictive"" behaviors (not drugs or alcohol, but video games and such) and when we figured out how to meet his needs for mental stimulation adequately, he went from behaving like your typical grumpy, socially defective addict to being one of the calmest people I know.  I never told him he was ""defective"".  I didn't frame it that way.  And it helped him find his way out of what often ends up being a psychological trap.<p>Edit:  There is a book that addresses the social aspect of creating addicts by imposing expectations that it is out of their hands  -- for example, cultures that blame alcoholism on the alcohol have higher rates of it than cultures that hold the individual responsible.  Title:  ""The Truth About Addiction and Recovery"".  One wife of an alcoholic who tried to hand me my head for recommending this book then went on to talk about ""dry drunks"" (people who remain ""addicted"" to alcohol while not drinking for years at a time) and that the real problem with alcoholism was all the ""isms"" (by that I think she meant beliefs?) not the alcohol per se.  She was on such a tear, I didn't bother to point out that her remarks supported mine rather than refuting them.<p>EDIT:  Since comment scores are not visible, I will note that this is being upvoted, downvoted, upvoted, downvoted.  I would be curious as to what is so seemingly controversial.  Any thoughts?",1311543995

If you <i>really</i> wanted to ban some kind of behavior, the ideal outcome would be that everyone who does it is arrested, and nobody who doesn't. But from law-enforcement's perspective what they often want are ""options"" for prosecution--- so that when they find someone who they're pretty sure deserves to be arrested, they can dig up a statute that justifies the arrest. In <i>that</i> setting you actually want them as broad as possible, so you always have something in your back pocket to get someone with. Of course you don't prosecute <i>everyone</i> who uses a web browser... but if you find someone doing something ""bad"" but in a way that isn't specifically criminalized, it's always nice to have that ""did a bad thing while using a webbrowser"" charging option, eh?<p>I can sort of see the motivation; nobody likes to see someone who you're 95% sure is guilty manage to beat any charges because you technically couldn't get anything solid.

71,2800378,comment,2799645.0,2800219.0,47,0,mkn,,,"I don't find that to be the most plausible mechanism for the proliferation of laws at all. More likely, it's an emergent property of the legal system in a democratic context that can probably be explained in terms of game theory. At any legislative junction, there's a cost or benefit associated with enacting or not enacting a law. Take the arrowhead removal example from the article. You're a lawmaker and you're faced with the problem of people pilfering Native American artifacts, and this law is presented to you. Which side are you going to be on? The side of desecration? Or the side of preservation? Boom. Another law. At each juncture, there's a good reason to pass another law.<p>What emerges from this is a jumble of laws. Each local decision is made in response to an immediate concern, and cannot take the jumble-of-laws problem into account. You're only adding one law, after all, and it's benefit is clear.<p>""Well, what about repealing some?,"" you may ask. Well, what's the ""game"" when it comes to repealing them? Even if each law got on the books for--heh--objectively bad reasons, those reasons were still ""good"" in that they contained a political benefit. Often, repealing them would have the unacceptable adverse consequence of giving up that benifit. You wanna be the guy to repeal the broken sex offender registry laws and be perceived as on the side of rapists and pedophiles? How bout the U.S.A P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act and be perceived as being ""on the side of the terrorists""? What now, hotshot?!<p>None of the above requires a conspiracy, as your post intimates. Those effects emerge as unintended consequences from the dynamics of a system. The even more infuriating thing about that quote in this context is that it ignores the corrective power of a democracy in crisis. There eventually does come a point where people wise up and rise up on specific issues. Prohibition, slavery, and civil rights come to mind. Revolutions, as they say, are impossible until they happen, and then they were inevitable.<p>Finally, the mechanism of control in your Rand quote is just ludicrous. How would one ""cash in on guilt"" in a system that is as patently absurd as the one you cite? Nobody would feel guilt about breaking those laws. The arrowhead collectors didn't ""feel guilt."" Quite the opposite, it seems. They paid the bill and openly talk about how absurd it is. The only way one could use a system like the one you outline would be to <i>actually lock everyone up</i>. It's just not practical, and it's not even the kind of control your example seems to advocate. Ostensibly, the controllers in your <i>fictional</i> example want people to behave a certain way out of fear of being locked up, not to actually have to lock them up for misbehaving.<p>Try to critically scratch the surface of word-butchered fanboy fictional allegories that comprise Ayn Rand's work before posting them here verbatim as if they actually have any bearing on the real world. The real issue here, and one from which your post serves as a distraction, is the evisceration of the <i>mens rea</i> requirement for a finding of guilt.",1311542877

However I was hungry and the auditor was cute and I told her I would give her the root password in exchange for a donut. Which she dutifully wrote down on her clipboard. Now the whole company has to go on training. I don't even know the root password!,1311541801

What else could Tomlinson have used from the basic teletype character set?<p>And, as I commented to the author on Twitter, his story of how email came to be glosses over the low-level technical details that would interest at least the HN crowd. (I realize that's not the point of his story. But he touched on it, anyway.)<p>For example, in the pre-TCP era (NCP was the host-to-host protocol), email was delivered by FTP'ing to the given site and appending your message (saved as a file) to the user's publicly-accessible mail box file (which was usually append-only, so you couldn't read it).<p>We were pretty trusting in those days.<p>That meant your email name was your username on the site; for us TOPS-10 users, that means our email address was the usual 18+18 octal project/programmer number. I think mine was 377,6001@harv-10 (no domains in those days). The lucky guys on Tenex systems (the precursor to TOPS-20) and Multics, etc., had real names.<p>I also remember being on the first ARPAnet mailing list (1972?), which was, of course, a discussion group on mail clients' UX and mailing lists, combined. Talk about bike-shedding and flame wars! But of course, none of us had ever experienced anything like a mailing list before, so we had to discover all those issues ab initio.",1311541582

Little chaotic, far too much crap content so far (my G+ is worse than my FB stream and I tried to 'follow' only tech guys that I admire otherwise or find interesting to read about). I don't care about these 'see this graph about the explosive growth of G+' graphics: It's completely useless in my world so far. The UI doesn't scale. The content is miserable. 'Social' features are missing (tell me about events, birthdays).<p>Using it as a _blogging_ software is the most ridiculous thing I've ever read/seen.<p>Now your argument comes along and says 'You know what? This thing you all dislike about this new product here? The product it tries hard to compete with, one way or another, has the very same issue'.<p>Uhm. What? Right.. So - it's the same crap regarding 'real names'. Missed chance. Leads (with other things) to (and it hurts me to write that..) lower scores than FB in my world..",1311541518
