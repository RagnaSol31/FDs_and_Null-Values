You write your program using an event model, where the events are IO related (you select events based upon file descriptors being ready for reading and/or writing) which (in my opinion) make for easy programming of network based daemons ( <a href=""http://boston.conman.org/2007/03/08.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boston.conman.org/2007/03/08.1</a> ).<p>The general method appears to be, write the program using an event model, then create a thread per CPU, which each thread waiting on epoll() (timeouts optional).",1221087219
