You can spend you time being popular NOW, at the expense of studies and other form of self-enrichment. Sports (with their short fitness time-span) are not really an investment, unless you are a really talented athlete.<p>So, by investing your time wisely as a kid you have a good chance of reaping monetary rewards later -- in term of a good job or even your own business.<p>An additional bonus for geeks comes in a form of above average growth rate for knowledge industry. We are living through a kind of 'industrial revolution' that is changing the shape of traditional industries. The rate of return that an internet software business can deliver is unmatched. And it can only be run by a geek, somebody who has spent countless hours bending his mind around recursion rather than flexing his muscles in front of girls.<p>And of course, ""the girls will come chasing"", after you reap economic rent from your investment.",1215384544.0

You always need a good story to tell, and I feel like traditional press/readers need a different story than the web crowd. I guess thats obvious since our target users probably haven't heard of Digg or NetVibes or any of these popular web 2.0 service.",1215384431.0

We're interested in the subset of smart people with a special kind of honesty, the kind great scientists almost always have, and great philosophers often do. The 'smart people' you claim changed their minds because of fashion aren't the ones we're really interested in talking about.<p>Also, I like to distinguish between deliberate atheists (like myself) and people who are atheists by default. Some people are apathetic about philosophical questions and will say they don't believe in God simply because they weren't brought up with any religion.",1215384403.0

However, that said, there are a lot of good strategies to get direct PR from traditional outlets. The bulk of it seems to be creating narratives that people can easily pick up on. I'd check out Full-Frontal PR as a good guidebook.",1215384264.0

However, too often I've found the baggage of words like ""agnostic"" obscures the discussion more than it clarifies it.<p>Literally, ""gnostic"" and ""agnostic"" refer to what you claim, or do not claim, to know. Given the general muddle of terms--""agnostic"", ""agnostic theist"", ""agnostic atheist"", etc--I tend to find it more helpful to separate out the terms into core meanings. I believe doing so more clearly displays the positions, as you can plot the Atheism <-> Theism axis against the Agnostic <-> Gnostic axis. I would argue that this separation of claims-of-knowledge vs claims-of-god(s) is clearer than the simple Atheist <-> Agnostic <-> Theist positioning.",1215384209.0

7,238103,comment,236808.0,237985.0,0,0,robg,,,"Atheism is one version of nihilism unless some attempt is made to redefine the basic concepts. It sounds like you already have and it sounds very similar to what I embrace. I don't know where that leaves us, but it doesn't worry me either. I'm not trying to convert anyone. But I'm also very satisfied by my working model for God. You may choose a less-loaded term to describe where you derive a ""life rich with meaning and spiritual satisfaction"".",1215384054.0

This is your Final Judgment - the probability you assigned to your life.<p>Those who follow Bayesianity strive all their lives to maximize their Final Judgment. This is the sole virtue of Bayesianity. The rest is just math.<p>One who follows Bayesianity will never assign a probability of 1.0 to anything. Assigning a probability of 1.0 to some outcome uses up all your probability mass. If you assign a probability of 1.0 to some outcome, and reality delivers a different answer, you must have assigned the actual outcome a probability of 0. This is Bayesianity's sole mortal sin. Zero times anything is zero. When Laplace multiplies together all the probabilities of your life, the combined probability will be zero. Your Final Judgment will be doodly-squat, zilch, nada, nil.

This black culture looking down on intelligence thing is not new or insightful. I've read about that lots of time on the internet. Black culture does not look down on intelligence. It looks down on nerdiness.<p>Let's imagine there is some really cool black guy - let's say the 50 cent of your high school. He does all the 'in' things and wears the right shoes etc. He also is consistently the best in the class. NOBODY would look down on him, rather, he'd be regarded with extreme awe. He'd be monster cool, and still effortlessly ace all exams.<p>Looking good is an easy way to be popular, but there are lots of terrible looking gangster like figures who are quite popular in high schools.<p>Being popular is about standing out in a manner that makes people want to follow you.
