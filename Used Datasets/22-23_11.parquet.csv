This is represented at it's core by the fact that EVERYTHING is an object - if you say:<p>foo = 5<p>foo is an object of type int. It's still loosely typed, in that you don't have to declare that foo is an int, but the contents being objects gives you a lot of power for dealing with them.<p>There are a lot of great tools for Python as well - Pylons (which Reddit is based upon), Django and TurboGears are pretty well entrenched and established.

What you get is the finished product - colour balanced, retouched, cropped, and probably actually only 5-10% of what was shot. That's what you're paying for, the final images. If you're the bride, then the photographer's business model is to give you a good price on shooting your wedding and make money on reprints. If you're an ad agency, the photographer licenses you the image for this campaign for this much time, because the business model is that that image will end up in a stock portfolio in a few years.<p>If you get the originals, and exclusive rights in perpetuity, then expect to pay a premium for it.
