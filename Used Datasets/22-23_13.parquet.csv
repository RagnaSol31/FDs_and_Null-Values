Rather than listing all of your skills list only the skills that job requires plus a few extra closely related.<p>Listing too many skills can get your resume tossed because the resume reader will see a lot of Adobe products listed and think you're more of a graphic designer than a developer. Concentrate on what the job opening asked for.,1204671517.0

Here is a summary of my opinions (note from a year ago).<p>pylons: didn't really like the lack of decorators, didn't seem to be an ORM of choice, docs looked weak although the wiki was well stocked with recipies<p>django: really well documented. Seemed to be HUGE and I felt intimidated by it. It wasn't clear to me I could strip it down to what I needed. Didn't seem very modular, you can only use the Django ORM and templating engine.<p>web.py: Far to simple for my needs, you need to build nearly everything from scratch, simple to learn because there is nothing there!<p>I chose Turbo Gears because it seemed easier to chose the components you want to use. The idea that the TurboGears community picks best of breed python components and integrated them really appealed to me. This is both good and bad but in general I think it's been good for the project.<p>A year later and I haven't been disappointed.
