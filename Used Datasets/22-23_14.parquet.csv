If I were in your shoes and earning enough off my own business, I wouldn’t think twice about jumping ship. As your company grows, bring on people with diverse skills and learn from them. Even if it worked, I would never trade a few years on the plantation for knowledge to run my own farm.<p>Edit: You have to ask yourself: are you an entrepreneur or not? You might not even know for sure at this point, and it’s okay to change your mind later. However, you have the holy grail of entrepreneurship sitting on your lap right now: a self-made business that pays you enough to live. After you reach that point, your upside is MUCH greater than working for someone else.<p>Read “Founders at Work” and ask yourself if you want your story added to a future version someday.

10,134699,comment,134685.0,134685.0,0,0,iamdave,,,"On the issue of wage vs wage:<p>If you are seeing more benefit from working on your own and producing software you <i>truly</i> believe will succeed use that as motivating platform to become an unsung hero in your niche while at the same time proving to be an asset with the company.  This may result in becoming a full-time employee and later on down the road a promotion and bigger paycheck.<p>On becoming a corporate slave:<p>Try not to look at it like this.  As I mentioned, become an asset early on, but establish a pace in which you can work.  Corporate work is very important to have in your tool belt as it shows you have the capacity to work in a very structured environment, and have the ability to interface with multiple levels of personnel.  Yes it can be demotivating, but see above on being an unsung hero.<p>On being effective:<p>Tell them this.  Show them that you want to take on some challenge and responsibility, but remind them you do know your role in the company as an intern and want to maximize the best of that situation.  I mention this particularly because I was offered an internship with a radio station with the webmaster.  Halfway through the interview it became apparent that the individual was very inexperienced, and only received the job she had because she knew more than the rest of the company about HTML and CSS.  It became even more apparent that she was only looking for an intern to perform grunt work and left absolutely no room for growth (not to mention I knew much more about web development than she did).  I declined the offer, but was also hired by the IT department at the same radio station as an analyst and I don't regret it one bit.<p>On being happy:<p>Do whatever brings about that feeling of joy.  If it means leaving the company and following your own path, but receiving a smaller paycheck, by all means go for it.  If you're happy doing what you do best, and if it works, no one can tell you otherwise.<p>These are lessons that I had to learn the very hard way throughout the past 3 years, but I don't regret enduring it one bit.",1205275195

20,134688,story,,,1,0,iamdave,How do you feel about forward metablogging? (A question of mareketing and usability),,"I'll make the assumption that we know about Metablogging (blogging about blogging).  What about <i>forward</i> metablogging?<p>It's a phrase I've used maybe twice on my own site, but numbers of times have I talked about it, and how it's a destructive practice for the end-user.  Forward Metablogging is a type of blogging or in other instances of user interaction where instead of linking them directly to a website being reviewed or discussed, you forward them to another article on the same site, about the same topic.<p>Example: TechCrunch's article about ClickPass(http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/11/clickpass-could-change-the-way-you-surf-the-web/)   doesn't directly reference ClickPass until the third paragraph, but however has the site logo affixed next to the first.  Software developers should be familiar with what a perceived affordance is.  If a user sees a radio button, they expect it to perform like a radio button and perform the task it says it will do.<p>That said, you click the ClickPass button, and it takes you to another page also operated by the TechCrunch team that holds no value to a user expecting to see this ClickPass site in action.<p>Other sites like Technorati, CNet, even CNN do this type of ""bait and switch"" all the time.  Even links with the title of a web app or website placed directly between <a> and </a> never take you to the site itself, but to more blogs.<p>If software performed like this, the exodus to web applications would be monumental.  All of that said and keeping relevant to YC themes, from a usability front do you think forward metablogging is a good practice for users to experience who plan on running blogs based on their startups and business ideas for fear they may inadvertently do it themselves and ruin the experience of their applications?",1205274521

23,134685,story,,,8,6,dangrover,Ask YC: The value of internships?,,"I'm a sophomore in college who has a small non-startup product business that's started taking off. I develop Mac software. It's been paying off well for the small amount of time I've been able to sink into it, and there's a lot I could do to serve my customers better and attract more business. Kind of exciting.<p>But I'm also interning at a company. I've interned at a few before. Since I've just had the first month where I made more off my own business than wages from the internship, it's made me re-evaluate a lot of things. It feels really weird.<p>While I could quit the internship and lose credit for it, and funnel all my energy (instead of a couple hours a day) into improving my own business...something in that doesn't appeal to me.<p>In a way, I kind of want to be a corporate slave for a few years. I'm learning a little about business and working with other people. I really need to have some daily interaction with other human beings to stay sane. I also recognize a lot of gaps in my non-technical skills that I'm going to need experience to fill.<p>But on the other hand, it's also extremely frustrating and demotivating at times. Everything happens really slowly with a lot of BS in the way. And, even though I've taken some initiative in the company and contributed to a lot of projects...you can't entrust any kind of responsibility to an intern, and you definitely can't promote one. Unlike when I'm working for myself, there's no advantage to figuring out more efficient ways of doing things or pressing myself to work harder.<p>So I find myself being less effective than I would otherwise be just because of the environment. Most of the interesting, technically-challenging work is given to other people, and, if not, attributed to other people upon completion.<p>And, because of my own business competing for my time, often the slightest little indignity will make me think about quitting and be really grumpy for a couple days.<p>So what would you do?

Billing is a nightmare (I wrote my own software so that it integrates into everything else that I bill for), clients can be demanding and not really all that technically-savvy, and you have to be constantly on guard for security problems.
