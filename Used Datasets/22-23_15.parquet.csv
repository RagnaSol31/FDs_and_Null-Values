But I also believe the ultimate authority on how a page looks and prints should be you. What if company policies force designers to include ink-draining advertisements on the printer-friendly version (<i>cough</i> cnn.com <i>cough</i>)? What if you don't like the font a page uses, or only want to print part of the page, or want to merge multiple pages into one print job? A printer-friendly stylesheet won't do that for you, but PrintWhatYouLike will. \nI totally agree that PrintWhatYouLike will mostly be used to get around poorly designed sites, but print stylesheets are only part of the solution.

Folks got loans where they could afford the teaser rate but not the regular rate.  Even if they'd put down 20% and the house didn't go down in value, they couldn't afford what they'd bought.<p>If housing prices had continued to appreciate, they could have done a cash-out refinance and used that money to help them pay for the new loan, but that just delays the inevitable.  ($50k doesn't go very far when a payment that you can't afford goes up by $1k/month.)<p>Or, they could have sold and taken the equity to buy something that they could afford.<p>The only way that they could have kept those houses (without significantly increasing their income) is if they'd been able to do no-cost refis with teaser rates until they were paid off.  Since many/most of those loans were interest-only....<p>Note that most of the teaser-rate loans had prepayment penalties.<p>The amount of equity that one has in a house has very little effect on the interest rate.

Okay.<p>It may be that conceptualists have a very natural peak in their early years because of two factors: a learning peak and a neural peak.  For conceptualists, concepts are grasped, mastered and built on quickly, but are explored in their learning.  Once they absorb a subject, they get tenaciously attached to worthless novelty, they find new things, or they're just not able to think about things in the same creative way.  That's what I mean by a learning peak.<p>Second, to go further out on a limb, could there be a neural peak?  There are many late-blooming artists, but how many late-blooming mathematicians?  Not many.  Since theirs is the epitome of conceptual work, there might be something natural to it.  One suspects that the, let's say, spark of creativity in conceptualists may actually consume neural connections which cannot be regained.<p>It's interesting to think of and compare some notables in these terms.  Edison, Fuller, Kubrick, Lucas, etc.  It would be instructive to see examples of late-blooming non-experimentalists, for example.  I also think that there are many fields where artists are encouraged make the transition from one approach to another, such as the actor that becomes a director.  Perhaps this subject encompasses much of the difficulty of the artist at mid-life, maybe even that of Malcolm Gladwell.",1223936951

In other words, the proposed indirect approach of <i>reduce taxes -> increase hours -> higher income ->increase happiness</i> may be less effective than the proposed <i>raise taxes -> more free time ->increase happiness</i>.
