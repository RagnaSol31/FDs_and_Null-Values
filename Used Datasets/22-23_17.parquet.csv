The only place I hear those kinds of conversations are here, on the web.

But it would be a kind of metadata for these relationships.  I could see if someone who is a friend of mine on here likes them, trusts them, etc.  Though making all of that explicit might be too much.

The radical intuitionist, with whom the author seems to sympathize, did not only reject the axiom of choice, but even things like the law of the excluded middle (i.E. they assumed that ""A or not A"" is not necessarily true).

Now I reload my RSS reader and find this!<p>Life is strange sometimes...<p>What I started wondering about is if there's a chance of achieving better compression results if the compressor and decompressor could communicate about the compression before it happened. For example, (ignoring CPU constraints) what if when I was downloading a large file over the web, the web server and the browser conspired together to achieve a higher rate of compression customized just for me by using some kind of shared knowledge (like a history of what was recently downloaded or whatever) to achieve a transfer of less data? (Like, if I had a bunch of files on my client that the server also has, could it use small chunks of those known files and index their location in the new file to be transfered - thus saving me download time?)<p>Obviously this is not a fully formed thought... but I think it might be worth considering that compression need not always be bound by the type of data, but also by the receiver of that data and the intention and method of that data's transmission.",1234908875.0

This means you can use version control with impunity and not worry about giving bad code to colleagues.  You can commit a broken work-in-progress without harming anything.  You can also create branches with impunity and not have to worry about naming conflicts, polluting the space of branch names, etc.  If something turns out to be a bad idea, you just zap it and nobody ever has to know.<p>When you reach a version that needs to go out to the wider world, you use ""git push"" to send it to a shared server. By default git remembers where you used ""git pull"" to obtain the source from in the first place, and can automatically push back to that server.  (Note that I say shared server, not central server. If you want a single official server, you a free to dictate that for your project.  You can also give each work group their own repository.)",1234908148.0
