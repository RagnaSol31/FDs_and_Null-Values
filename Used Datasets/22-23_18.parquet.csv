It is not unreasonable for the federal government to control materiel moving over the border. There's not even a ""reasonable clause"" notion here, as a complete and thorough search are asssumed at ports of entry -- otherwise the government would be defrauding the social contract by not being concerned enough about what's happening there.<p>How else would you run a border? Hey guys, what do you feel like showing me that you're moving? This laptop smells like it has encrypted money on it?<p>They're not investigating a crime, they're controlling movement. That's their job.<p>There used to be (and still is, I think) a crime of carrying so much undeclared cash across the border -- whether or not its yours or not. One could argue that the IP contained on a laptop easily could be more valuable than the cash limit, but there are no similar regulations on IP movement. With cell phones becoming e-wallets, seems like it would be easy to walk across the border with a couple hundred k loaded on your cell phone.

A lot of people really like hating Perl.<p>I think it goes beyond basic dislike of the language...that would require knowledge of the language, which is pretty clearly lacking in many of the flames.  I suspect it's often human tribal tendencies.  Rubyists and Pythonistas see another tribe competing in the very same environment with very similar capabilities (because, let's face it, mild syntactic differences aside Perl, Python and Ruby are more alike than they are different when compared to almost any other language), and they also see an opportunity to combine to beat up on a currently larger and older tribe.<p>By the time you've spent enough time with a language to get past identifying with just that one tribe, you don't feel as aggressive an urge to pontificate on the suckage of other languages.",1217889019.0
14,266868,comment,266657.0,266657.0,0,0,kennyroo,,,"Newspapers are dying because the half-life for headlines today is much, much shorter today than it was in the past and because other options are faster and free.  Today's printed newspaper is by definition yesterday's news.  Who wants to pay for old news? Imagine  a web site that charged for yesterday's news.  Wouldn't it fail miserably too?<p>The problem is that online news isn't really free -- it requires funding from the dying offline business because online news doesn't have a viable business model. In fact, a lot of people don't start with the news provider's site at all -- we start with news aggregators and then do quick dives into provider sites without leaving a trace of revenue in their pockets.  This simply can't last.  The offline business will go broke before the online business can be made workable at this rate.<p>Successful news providers in the future will need to start with a much cheaper cost structure to match a much lower revenue model.  Current media companies may not be able to make that transition.  None of them are moving fast enough, and most won't even acknowledge the simple reality that there is simply no future for the printed daily newspaper.",1217888863.0

31,266851,comment,266663.0,266727.0,0,0,nostrademons,,,"In my physics courses, they used to call these ""Fermi estimates"" because apparently Enrico Fermi was really, really good at them.<p>The point of them is to show you can creatively use what you know to come up with a very quick ballpark figure.  This sort of estimation comes up surprisingly often in real life:<p>1. In physics labs, it was often useful to do a quick estimate of roughly what the answer <i>should</i> be and the likely direction of the error.  That way, if we got something way off, we could check the equipment immediately and rerun the experiment if necessary, instead of going home, analyzing everything, finding out we were way off, and having to go <i>back</i> to the lab and collect everything again.<p>2. When selecting an algorithm, it's good to be able to estimate roughly what the input size will be, so you know if say an N^4 or N! algorithm will work, or if you really need to get it down to linear or N log N.<p>3. When selecting a startup to work at, it's useful to do a back-of-the-envelope estimate of its market size, to give you an idea of what the startup may sell or IPO for and hence how much you can make off stock options.<p>4. When founding a startup, it's good to do a back-of-the-envelope estimate of your costs and potential revenues, to make sure that you're not totally uneconomical.  (This sort of estimation could probably have prevented debacles like AllAdvantage or Pets.com.)<p>5. When investing in growth stocks, you can get a good sanity check by estimating their potential market size.  For example, in 2002 Akamai was trading at a total market cap of $150M.  I did a quick calculation based on the number of computers on the Internet, and figured that the only way they could conceivably be worth $150M or less was if they went bankrupt.  Then the question becomes the strength of their product offering and their capital structure, and both of these had fairly easy answers.",1217887939.0
