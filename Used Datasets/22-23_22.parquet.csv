That's quite possibly the biggest misconception about the BBB ever. It's a lot simpler to first ask the business, then go to the city/state/federal licensing and consumer affairs departments and directly file a complaint. Maybe the information doesn't become public, but businesses also tend to Start Caring when it's their license(s) or permits at stake, and it's not like the BBB is even close to acceptable in this regard.<p>I seem to be writing a lot about the BBB here (i.e. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=541244"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=541244</a>), but someone has to spread the word.",1240872989.0

So each week, I clocked 28 hours per week. The hours were choked full of coding effort.<p>Mostly, I encountered difficult obstacles that would slow me for a day or two. I couldn't just solve it siting around so I go around to coding different projects.<p>It was actually a little understatement. I did a programming session in the middle of the experiment when I tried to develop a game in 48 hours for a contest. By the time I finish the project, I have a hard time protoyping newer versions of the game so I got something like last place.<p>I did a the same thing for a week back in the beginning of April. I ended up releasing a new version of a game I made but I worked really late. Mostly it is because I procrastinate until the last minutes. So quality of life suffered due to that. So I learn to not only time-box but also schedule my time so I don't end up hacking at strange hours.<p>I got time management down to a few set of tools that allow me to do a lot of solid coding. I can't get much better than that.<p>The actual major hinderance is the fact that I am extremely slow in term of programming speed.

Go Arsenal!)<p>Edit - registered my copy.  Really enjoying it!<p>Edit 2 - The included version 1.0 of Adobe Air raised an alert (""very dangerous"") in Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2009.

For applications that are inherently social or have a strong social component, it's going to be very valuable or necessary to live on the social graph. Until now, those companies have had to try to build their own, which is very difficult or impossible.<p>For now a lot of developers just see Facebook as a way to spread virally, which has led to a lot of annoying spam machines.",1240869887.0
