Lomborg notes that there is just one problem with the Litany: ""It does not seem to be backed up by the available evidence.""<p>Lomborg then proceeds to demolish the Litany. He shows how, time and again, ideological environmentalists misuse, distort, and ignore the vast reams of data that contradict their dour visions. In the course of The Skeptical Environmentalist, Lomborg demonstrates that the environmentalist lobby is just that, a collection of interest groups that must hype doom in order to survive monetarily and politically.<p>Lomborg notes, ""As the industry and farming organizations have an obvious interest in portraying the environment as just-fine and no-need-to-do-anything, the environmental organizations also have a clear interest in telling us that the environment is in a bad state, and that we need to act now. And the worse they can make this state appear, the easier it is for them to convince us we need to spend more money on the environment rather than on hospitals, kindergartens, etc. Of course, if we were equally skeptical of both sorts of organization there would be less of a problem. But since we tend to treat environmental organizations with much less skepticism, this might cause a grave bias in our understanding of the state of the world.""

There is no meaningful argument: the current, epochally high rate of CO2 release is driving current climate change.</i><p>Wow, I'm glad you have all the answers.

I think that immediately accepting that it's all because of us is disingenuous to the scientific method.<p>Whether or not <i>the majority</i> of climate change is due to CO2 released by human activity (which I'm still yet to be convinced of), my question was whether the small-scale changes being championed (CFLs, hybrids on an individual scale, living less comfortably (less A/C, bottled water, etc.), and so on) are really going to make a difference in regards to the climate. That's all I was pondering. See also: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=230272"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=230272</a> .
