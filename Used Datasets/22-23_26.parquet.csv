11,759474,comment,756580.0,758267.0,0,0,Mz,,,"Some of that is humor.  At some point, I imagine the front page will change. As far as I know, that's the only place where I (jokingly) comment in a conspiracy theory style.<p>But the reality is also that most CF patients are prisoners of the mental models used by medicine.  Ex:  Zithromax is very commonly prescribed as a prophylactic antibiotic and to control inflammation.  It also competes with magnesium.  So taking zithromax tends to make one magnesium deficient.  Magnesium is an alkaline mineral.  Thus magnesium deficiency leads to excess acidity, which leads to inflammation, which promotes infection, for which doctors then prescribe drugs like zithromax.  It's a vicious cycle: Once you start taking zithromax, you tend to become dependent upon it because it worsens the underlying issues which cause the thing it is treating for.  Most doctors seem to be completely unaware of stuff like that.  I have never had a doctor tell me what nutritional supplements I needed to take or what foods I needed to eat to combat the side effects the drugs cause.  Getting off the 8 or so prescription drugs I used to take has made me feel strongly that the solutions doctors prescribe -- and which most patients blindly and obediently follow to a T -- are part of the problem.<p>I wish the picture were prettier.  But my CF specialist expressed zero interest in what I was doing to get myself well.  His response to my improvement was to schedule me fewer appointments because other patients needed his help more.  If anyone is going to get well using the information on the site, it will be a grass roots movement.  Doing some kind of research on it when it is already helping people (me, my son, others with CF that contact my via email) looks to me like a huge waste of time -- kind of like a recent article about avoiding spending undue amounts of time writing your business plan.<p>Thanks for the feedback.  I will make a mental note of it for future reference as the site gets improved. :-)",1250117644

70,759408,story,,,2,2,Ardit20,Ask HN: 'Do what you want'... Does it really matter what you want?,,"This is perhaps the most stated advice, the fall back, in many instances, of giving some advice, the first thing that comes in mind when one asks as to what they should do. Do what you want most, what you have a passion for, absent of any consideration that most people, if not all people know not what their passion is.<p>My question is the simplest, and I hope you will engage in debating it. Does it matter at all what you decide to follow in the absence of any clear knowledge of what you want or what your passion is? Is there such a thing as passion and want when deciding how to spend your life and choosing your career, or is instead our path paved by circumstances and events, our passions formed by our experience rather than carved by our own controlled paving of the future?",1250114874
