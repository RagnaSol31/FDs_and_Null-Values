It was explanatory, rather than prescriptive, and gave my analytic brain something to chew on while my non-analytical brain was busy digesting the language.<p>For example, Chinese sentence structure is Topic-Comment rather than Subject-Predicate. This little insight helped make sense of the sometimes odd phrasing that my mind had tried to cast as Subject-Predicate.<p>About the rest, though, I think you are trying to force good data into a broken framework. Krashen seems interested in the teaching of foreign languages. Thus the focus on student relaxation, comfort and interest--how do you ameliorate the school environment?<p>I'm interested in the study of foreign languages, which already assumes an interested student. Sounddust was determined to learn French. Play and safety seem beside the point.<p>This is the process of making a foreign language ""real"". It starts off like a chore and then becomes a meditation. I could have spent 3 hours per session once I got into the groove. I would have to stop myself after 60 minutes, because extra practice w/out sleep would do me no good.<p>I don't know how I would apply these methods to the classroom. I did TA a Chinese class once, and no I didn't try to apply the methods. Clock in, clock out. I would tell students about them, but who knows if anyone listened. It all sounded like black magic, and I sounded like a raving fool.",1245020187.0

Well, we had <i>a</i> version of the source code, but it wouldn't build.  The version running in production?  It was built on the workstation of a since-departed teammate, and apparently never checked into source control.<p>Fortunately, the replacement for this system was already in development.  Unfortunately, we had to patch the system on two occasions before its replacement was ready.  Fortunately we were able to make both fixes by patching the binary - once to change a hard-coded encryption key that was linked in to the executable, and once to change a printf format string that was causing a critical bug in production.<p>The day we finally launched the replacement system and retired the un-buildable codebase was the biggest relief of my career.  (Not least because only the team and our immediate manager were ever told about the problem.)",1245020062.0

The plan involved turning Detroit into a free trade zone, along the lines of Hong Kong.  There would be a low flat tax rate of 15% on company and personal earnings, no import/export duties, no welfare programs or government assistance, including being exempt from all Federal taxes, interventions and benefits.  Basically set up a border around the city and let people do whatever they want.  The idea was that within 10 years, it would again be a growing and dynamic economy as people would be attracted to the region to escape growing Federal intervention.<p>While I don't think the idea would ever fly, and I'm not sure it could work, it's definitely an idea to make you think - perhaps the answer is less intervention, not more.",1245019782.0

I worked on the adapter card drivers writing code in C and assembler.<p>One of our drivers emulated the Novell IPX/SPX API on the PC and it worked great.  Except for one piece of software which would crash (it was a 3270 emulator).  I was task with debugging this problem.<p>It turned out that an optimization in our code meant that if you sent a packet to yourself it would be never actually go into the network.  We'd simply immediately deliver it.  The real NE2000 driver would send the packet on the network and then receive it.<p>This piece of software was using a packet sent to itself as a test of network connectivity and because of the way in which the code was written the packet had to be received with a short delay.  Basically, the software called Send_Packet and when that API returned it would clear a flag and then it would hang around and wait for the flag to change.<p>The flag would be changed inside the ESR (sort of interrupt service routine) registered by the software for receiving packets.<p>Trouble was our optimization meant that the ESR was called while Send_Packet was executing (i.e. before it returned) and hence the flag was always zero and the software died.<p>The solution was... to ship our network driver with special code that I wrote that would examine the code of all programs that registered ESR for packet receipt.  By examining the ESR routine code I would determine whether this particular piece of software was running and patch it to get around this problem.<p>(Yes, you did read that right: we shipped a network driver that would patch host software live.)",1245018368.0

Whenever software is written, fundamental assumptions get made, and even the most forward thinking architects can't predict everything that will become possible or necessary. For a while, it is simply enough to build on top of what you currently have, but eventually the underlying architecture will no longer represent the main goals of the app. At this point, the spaghetti and hacks will far outnumber the well written aspects of an application and you will be spending most of your time trying to navigate the mess.<p>Again, that's not to say all software should be rewritten for every version. Mac OS X has been around for about 10 years and could easily go for another 10 with its current architecture. However, I think we can all agree that sometime between now and 100 years from now, something fundamental will probably have to change.",1245018239.0

That those modules need to be imported might suggest that the current module is attempting to do too many things at once.<p>I only point this out because a former coworker's code I've been dealing with. This was in PHP, but everything had been broken out into classes and the classes were named after the files. So, closer than just including raw PHP code into the same scope, and hopefully close enough that I don't get buried in comments to the contrary. :-)<p>But the coworker had the logical extreme of a module importing module. Arguably, he <i>had</i> the same 120 files coming in over and over. But this created all sorts of problems, the most prevalent being that a typo anywhere in these module files would bring down the <i>entire</i> site, since they have to be syntax checked.<p>So, I overall agree with jerf, with the addendum of be vigilant and be careful. :-)",1245017330.0

I studied 3 years in high school, 2 years in China, 3 years in college and another 2 years in grad school, so what's that 10 years all together.<p>High school was a wash, and living in China helped but I never made real progress till I hit upon this produce and repeat method. College and grad school were mostly classical Chinese and other dialects, so I'm not sure if that counts.<p>Were I to start Russian today, 6-12 months would be enough for a) no discernible accent and b) every day proficiency. But ""pick up"" is the wrong phase here. You aren't going to pick up a foreign language in 6-12 months with the immersion method. Look at what the grand OP did: 6-12 months of produce and repeat, <i>followed by</i> immersion. By the time he immersed himself, he had developed the faculties to process the stream of stimulus. That's a huge difference.",1245017305.0

Well, not in the hands of a beginner.  If you want to just click a few things, Emacs is not for you.  If, on the other hand, you live in your text editor all day long (you are, say, a programmer), what Emacs lacks in usability it makes up for 1000 times over in extensibility, flexibility, and ability to do pretty much anything you could imagine, with a bit of effort.",1245017259.0

67,657611,comment,657401.0,657401.0,0,0,jerf,,,"I think in both cases the best solution is to somehow mandate slack. The temptation is to run both the financial system and the electric grid as hot as possible. In the grid case, this means that the grid is running at 100% and if anything goes wrong, the whole thing just unravels as nobody can pick up any slack. In the financial world, this manifests as leveraging as much as possible to grab as much positive investment as possible, and when the investment ticks even the slightest bit negative you get total, massive bankruptcy and unpayable debt.<p>In both cases, if we didn't leverage so much or run the grid so hot, a failure is much more likely to be contained. The downside is that it is more expensive, you're leaving money on the table or putting up more power capacity than you really ""need""... but it only takes one financial disaster to pay for years of slightly less growth, and only one total power failure for an extended period to suck as much value out of the economy as you would have put into building more capacity. If you don't account for the possibility of disaster it looks like a terrible investment, but factor that in and it looks downright prudent.<p>Look at the stock value graphs of the past 30 years; would you trade a lesser growth rate for not having the past year on your graph? <i>I</i> sure would!<p>The primary problem as I see it is the question of how you mandate financial slack. Mandating excess power capacity would be relatively straightforward (though it blends with ""green energy"" initiatives <i>very</i> poorly as they tend to add virtually no baseline power to the grid), but even <i>defining</i> financial ""slack"" is a challenge, let alone making the system robust. There are just so many games that can be played with paper that it may not be actually possible to prevent huge leverage.",1245016867.0
