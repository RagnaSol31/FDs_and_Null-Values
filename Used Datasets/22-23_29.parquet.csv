5,685336,story,,,2,0,joshuarr,Ask HN: What should I do with UberGoose?,,"{Sorry if you've already seen this, i'm resubmitting for more feedback.}<p>UberGoose is a 'social catalog' that provides a forum for people to rate and discuss things. I think of it as Wikipedia meets Digg with a bit of Facebook and Amazon thrown in. Items can be goosed, which improves their popularity within a category â€“ more popular items get more exposure. Additionally, goosing things adds them to your profile, so other friends and other users can see what you like. The goal is to become the go-to destination for user based ratings, reviews and discussion forums on the internet.<p>The site is currently stuck in private alpha. Really, it's a prototype, as it only hints at the site I imagine. It has several critical flaws due to its incompleteness, but is still kind of fun (but obfuscatory) to play with. The alpha test site was useful as far as putting together a development roadmap, but at this point I've exhausted my development funds. The current site was built in rails.<p>I've taken this about as far as I can for the time being and so I am looking for help moving forward. Ideally I would like a talented rails programmer and/or business guru to partner up with, but I don't know how to go about finding someone who fits the bill who would also be interested in working on the project for equity.<p>Any advice is appreciated, but I'm much more concerned with how to move forward than how to improve the current site.<p>Thanks!<p>http://www.ubergoose.com",1246575061

If one constantly lives in the moment, forsaking entirely the idea of a future and its implications, then the chances of amounting to anything in life are greatly reduced, since the ability to look forward and hope for a better reality are tightly entwined with the concept of planning. How can one develop both personally and professionally without looking ahead? On the other hand, if one concentrates exclusively on the future, neglecting the minutiae of everyday life, one will, invariably, miss life altogether. I think it's just a matter of perspective. <i>Balance is key.</i>",1246574911

It actually does much more too, but lets pretend this is the only operation. The simple way to do this is to step sequentially through the file and load everything into memory in N different structures and then save your files. But the problem is that sometimes you don't have enough memory to do that, so you have to loop through the file N times, loading a type, saving it, clearing memory and repeating. Since that seems very inefficient, so I thought I'd be clever and on the first pass through the file, load one of the flavors and also save file pointers to all the other blocks so that each subsequent pass could be done more quickly by seeking to the exact black that I needed to load.<p>Long story short, on regular hard drives, thanks to optimized sequential reads it can actually be faster to just do the dumb thing and loop through the file N times than seek though it randomly.",1246574490

I'm pretty sure I've seen that somewhere. But the segmentation seems to be the easier way.<p>Going back to the editor example, suppose you have two editors from two different authors; one is cheaper, the other has SFTP feature. The author of the one with the SFTP features put a higher price on the overall development effort than the author of the cheaper one. And he's charging you more than the other author per every copy, even though he coded it only once. Why is this so drastically different from having two editions of the same product from the same author?<p>To take your logic a step further, why is the author charging money for every copy? Once he coded the whole product, it's done and there are no per-unit shipping or manufacturing costs. The alternative would be to somehow get the money, upfront, that would cover the development costs and net him some fixed profit for it. Who knows, maybe if we could switch to that business model piracy would no longer be an issue. But until then, as long as charging per unit of software is accepted practice, I don't see a difference between two editions of the same product and two products with different features.

Other than with a proprietary solution (e.g. Oracle RAC), what options are there to easily add/remove capacity on demand from an RDBMS?<p>Now, you can just add additional ""shards"" of a MySQL database, but that breaks the whole ""R"" of ""RDBMS"" (can't do joins across the shards). In addition, you're limited to a ring-style Master-Master replication scheme vs/ a grid/mesh. There's also MySQL NDB_Cluster engine, but I have <i>never</i> (to date) seen it in production (there are just too many limitations).<p>Proprietary solutions like Oracle RAC <i>may</i> scale on demand, but require a DBA team. The cost overhead offsets any savings gained through on-demand provisioning of resources.<p>Not to mention Oracle RAC (and even MySQL) aren't exactly friendly to commodity hardware (which is what both official cloud computing solutions and de-facto clouds used in high-tech companies' data centers are built on).",1246572430
