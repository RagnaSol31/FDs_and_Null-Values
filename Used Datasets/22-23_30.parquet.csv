The iPhone is the easiest one to deploy to (thanks to the App Store). I don't have any experience with WinMo. So far, Symbian is my favorite.",1234825169
1,483749,comment,186735.0,186735.0,0,0,briansmith,,,"Based on what's happening today, I'd say that (1) Symbian will take control of the phone-first-computer-second market and, (2) Windows Mobile will slowly take over the computer-first-phone-second market, (3) Apple's marketshare will mirror its computer marketshare, (4) Android will get squeezed out of the market unless there is an ad-subsidized phone revolution (unlikely), (5) Either Nokia or Microsoft will buy RIM, and (6) price is going to be a much bigger factor in the long-run at the top of the market, and Nokia, Samsung, and Sony-Ericcson have a big advantage there because of its experience building mass-market feature phones.<p>Look at what is happening today at MWC: Samsung, Sony-Ericcson, and Nokia all announced amazing Symbian-powered devices. HTC and LG both made huge commitments to Windows Mobile, and Windows Mobile got a huge upgrade. Meanwhile, Android was almost absent from the show, and Apple literally didn't even show up.<p>There's only one commercially-available Android phone, being subsidized by only one major operator (AFAICT). I can't find any evidence that it is gaining any momentum; in fact, the evidence seems to show that Symbian has gained a lot of momentum at its expense. Besides that, Symbian just seems technologically superior. Nokia just announced a Symbian-powered phone with a one-MONTH standby time. The G1 cannot even last through a single day. If you've programmed for both, you can see why: everything about Symbian's design revolves around a relentless desire to conserve resources. Android's main contribution might end up being the open-sourcing of Symbian.<p>The iPhone gained a lot of mindshare but soon it will be one out of many similar devices. Feature-for-feature, every single other manufacturer has them beat, hands down. The iPhone's only advantage is in ease-of-use. That's a big advantage now, and the iPhone will continue to thrive as long as its competitors provide sub-par user experiences. But, once the other vendors get their acts together, the iPhone won't have any advantage whatsoever. The same applies to Mac OS X on the desktop as well.<p>Samsung, Nokia, and Sony-Ericsson are close to having application binary compatibility across their smartphones. And, Nokia has started moving Symbian down market into midrange phones. If they can all agree to build compatible phones and if S60 replaces Series 40, Symbian will have an absolutely massive market share.<p>I think Windows Mobile will succeed in the corporate world if they can build enough tools into the platform to make building mobile enterprise applications as easy as they've made enterprise development on the desktop. At some point I think Microsoft's leverage in the corporate IT world will cause a lot of problems for Blackberry.",1234825041

3,483747,comment,483460.0,483572.0,0,0,old-gregg,,,"I believe most of those are patents filed by US graduate/PhD students of foreign origin working for big corporations either via H1b or using their student visas. These are the individuals we want to keep.<p>The ""dark side"" of H1b program is various ethnic sweatshops often filled with mediocre talent unable to find work anywhere else. I have known a person in Boston area who, along with 4 roommates, lived in his ""owners"" (H1b sponsor) basement where they were looking for contracts for themselves, so the sponsor could sell them later for a percentage. This crowd doesn't file patents.<p>Another, less evil ""H1b business"" is what many 3rd grade no-name universities do: they bring people from all over the world using student visas, give them loans, put them through 6-8 month Java crash-course, after which students are supposed to find themselves H1b employment. When they do, they have to pay $10-30K to their ""school"" while completing their ""education"" online (the requirement that lets these institutions maintain their legal university status).<p>I suspect that these shady H1b sponsors take up as much as half of all H1b visas issued to programmers year after year. As I said, big companies rarely bring people from overseas, they like to hire the best foreign graduates from good schools instead, where H1b works as a temporary bridge between a student visa and a green card, and that was the original idea behind it, IIRC.",1234824956

The lifecycle? Access to GPS and the ability to launch apps? Theme-able widget libraries? An MVC development model?<p>Dashboard, Yahoo! Widgets, etc. give you lifecycle functionality. Dashboard, at least, lets you make system-level calls and launch apps. YUI, MooTools and ExtJS all provide theme-able tables, buttons and dodads for your web apps. Sproutcore covers MVC and then some. Despite predictions of some, these technologies have not united to overthrow native desktop applications. What makes you think they'll overthrow native smartphone ones?<p>Palm's clearly making a tradeoff, wooing web developers at the cost of application and toolchain robustness. Personally, I think that's silly (the AppStore and even the Palm Pilot software ecosystem of yore never had trouble finding developers) but maybe I'm wrong? Maybe people don't want more than widgets on their phones and the explosion of web2.0 ""ports"" to the Pre will secure it a place in smartphone history.<p>But to stick one's head in the sand and say ""my webapp can do anything your objc or java app can because it's <i>revolutionary</i>...""

It's two things:<p><pre><code>  1) An MIT-licensed reimplementation of Cocoa (Foundation + AppKit + some CoreFoundation plain-C APIs)\n\n  2) A cross-compiler GCC toolchain that produces native Win32 binaries and installs into Xcode. (There is also some degree of Linux support.)\n</code></pre>\nThe benefit of this combination is that you can basically add a Windows target to an existing Cocoa project in Xcode and have it produce an .exe file... At least if all the methods used by your application happen to be implemented in Cocotron.<p>There's still quite a bit of the Cocoa API missing, but the amount of work already done is impressive -- and one of the really great things about Cocotron is that it feels so easy to contribute to the base frameworks. The Foundation and AppKit projects are clean of cruft, neatly laid out, and they are built as Xcode projects so there's no toolchain learning curve: if your favorite esoteric NSString method is missing, you can simply open Foundation.xcodeproj and implement it.<p>For me, Cocotron is cross-platform Objective-C that ""just works"". YMMV.",1234823751

You are a startup that isn't even started yet.  No matter how many pieces are in place, there are many opportunities for it to go wrong.  Remember this when you expect someone else to invest into your vision.  The risk/reward should be there.<p>2. Consider starting someone out working in a low commitment/low risk way.  i.e. take someone with potential and pay them to do some stuff.  This will make it easier to recruit this someone and give them a chance to find out how they like working with you and if they buy into your vision.<p>The startup I did some consulting for consisted of people I already knew and I felt they had a pretty solid model.  Overall though it hasn't ""started up"" yet because they got in their own way.<p>3. Consider giving away equity for a very well scoped deliverable.  With the startup I worked with, I took a small slice of equity in exchange for working with them to create a product functional specification and to deliver on that spec as-is.  I liked this arrangement because it limited my commitment to them and they liked it because it tied my slice to a deliverable.<p>Overall it comes down to this: let them date you before deciding they want to marry you.  Don't go on a first date expecting it to turn into marriage.<p>P.S. for your job ad, this analogy carries over there as well.  Emphasize what you bring to the relationship and less about the expectations you have from them.<p>Good luck!",1234821704
