It's easy to see if someone can write fizzbuzz, or find the bug, but it's significantly harder to grade a design.<p>Good design operates in the face of real world constraints, unlike typical interview questsions (see the article on Apple design about Real Artists Ship).<p>As an interview question, I used to ask people to design the DB schema for Netflix. Almost everyone could get something that would kind-of sort-of work. Of course there was a gradient of bad to good answers, but a passing or better grade on the question did not help predict whether the candidate would get an offer. Asking FizzBuzz was a better predictor of whether they would pass the interview process.",1247784816.0

I sent him an e-mail regarding his Colbert Report interview earlier.<p>Hey Rushkoff,<p>I saw your appearance on the Colbert Report the other day.  In it, you made reference to how it would be economically beneficial if a great number of people caught cancer.  Are you not familiar with the broken window fallacy?<p>You're following the flow of currency, which is the wrong way to go about it (mercantilism died in the 1700s).  You need to follow the flow of value.  When people contract cancer, they money that they would have spent on gifts for their children, personal luxuries, etc. is lost.  The time that they would have spent working for their employers, etc. is lost.  The money that the HMOs would have spent on whatever-it-is-they-spend-money-on (probably luxuries, but somebody paints the pool) is lost.  And if some of these patients die, then we lose a great deal of economic value--years of working, perhaps.  All of this to redirect some quick money into the hands of cancer doctors or researchers.  This might look good on paper, and it might even artificially inflate the GDP temporarily.  But in the long run, the value that is lost has a sharp negative effect on the economy.  Effectively, we've sold an appreciating asset below its amortized value, which is always a bad idea unless there's some dire emergency.<p>Anyways, this is all Econ 101.  I realize these sorts of appearances are entirely a marketing thing, but I would encourage you to be more thoughtful in your assertions on the future, even on a ""comedy"" show.  I watch Colbert because he is subtly, deceptively deep.",1247783978.0

So I'm not defending them per se.<p>But there is a reality to this situation that at least mitigates things.   In some situations morality only brings a result if everyone in the world acts morally.  Like here, TechCrunch knows someone else will publish these papers if they don't.  Given the hits they'd be worth it's an absolute given.  So in judging the scale of their guilt you have to consider a subset of morality.<p>Because if you're TechCrunch and you are deciding what to do with these documents you have to accept an immoral thing is going to happen.  So the question for them becomes: Is it immoral to cheat your employees out of the revenue this information would generate because you want to stick to a moral code that you know will have no consequence?<p>That doesn't excuse what they did but it's a mitigating factor.  So while I'm not saying they're right in doing what they did I think saying things like ""I have no respect for TechCrunch"" might be a slight over reaction.",1247782352.0
