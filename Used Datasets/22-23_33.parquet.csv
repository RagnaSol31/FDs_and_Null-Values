The mining tax was the last act in a long play of dropping promises, reneging on commitments and policy backflips.<p>The mining tax was a disaster and, in it's original form, was reverse nationalism by stealth.  The government was going to tax profits above 6% with a 40% 'super tax' - terminology straight from a Marxist script.  They were then going to reimburse Miners for losses on projects.  In reality, with the government participating in 40% of the profits and 40% of the losses, it was a part-nationalisation by stealth.<p>The reason the mining tax was so rejected, particularly by the mining states, was that it was to replace state-based mining royalties with a Federal mining tax.  So instead of individual states receiving royalties for mineral wealth - as per the constitution, the tax money would be funnelled to the Federal government, which would then have power over where it was spent.  The mineral states stood to lose power over their own revenues, and the non-mining states stood to gain income from activities that took place entirely outside their borders.<p>The tax was beloved by pro-government tax-raising types and lovers of economic theory and hated by pretty much everyone else.",1283727474.0

It's not too shocking actually .. If you're renting a $99/month server with 512MB of memory and 80gb of disk space, you're losing money on it unless it's an old, already amortized server. That RAM upsell might become all of the profit of that server.. also, limited ram and disk space means you can do less with your server, like use less power or less bandwidth.",1283727457.0

Start playing around with it by setting up toy web sites and web apps.  If you don't have experience setting up a server, then it's important to be experimenting with one for a long time because it takes a while to learn things.  For example, you not only have to install and configure all of the necessary software, you have to think about security and resource utilization (memory, CPU, disk).  You also are going to want to set up some server monitoring software such as serverdensity.com.  And you're going to want to get used to managing web traffic (reading Apache logs, tuning Apache for performance, etc.).  All of this takes time.  But if you do this then if the time comes for you to switch away from Heroku, you will have experience setting up and managing your own web server.",1283727124.0

73,1665293,comment,1664578.0,1664578.0,0,0,akshayubhat,,,"I could not understand several points made in this article:<p>1: He mentions infochimps, but according to my knowledge its more of an ebay for datasets rather than support/provider for Big Data Stack, also is it successful? I am unsure how infochimps is related to the Big Data stack.<p>2: From what I remember reading about 80legs, is that it uses distributed grid computing to run the crawlers (something like SETI @ Home), I doubt Hadoop was ever designed for such applications. So this is surely isn't a Hadoop use case.<p>3: Quoting:<p><pre><code>       While the standard big data stack has made huge strides in making big data more accessible to everyone, it will always fall short against our stack when it comes to the cost of collecting data.  We actually don’t store that much data. Because 80legs users can filter their data on the nodes, they’re able to return the minimum amount of data in their result sets.  The processing (or reduction, pardon the pun) is done on the nodes.  Actual result sets are very small relative to the size of the input set.\n</code></pre>\nAgain I am unsure how it is different from Hadoop? First Hadoop uses same principle ""to move computation closer to data"" hence a crawler implemented using Hadoop (something Hadoop is not intended to do) will also store data locally and not on some other node.<p>Also he mentions """""" We have about 50,000 computers using their excess bandwidth."""""" 50,000?? The biggest Hadoop cluster That I know (Yahoo) has ~10-20k nodes, and Hadoop was never meant to be used at 50K scale for crawling. So they had no option other than building their own system, even if they had to build it today.<p>4: Quoting<p><pre><code>      One advantage is optimization — an “off-the-shelf” system is going to have some generalities built into it that can’t be optimized to fit your needs. The opportunity cost of going “standard” is a slew of competitive advantages.\n</code></pre>\nThe only issue I can think of regarding Hadoop is that its written in JAVA, otherwise its an extremely extensible piece of software. Unless you are designing a real time messaging system or distributed system for High Frequency Trading, Hadoop is good enough for most of the applications. Also what about cost of finding good enough programmers who are capable of building a system? Another advantage of Hadoop is that in case of a low load the remaining nodes can be used to do something else, maybe processing some data, with your own solution it would be harder to do it. Also your IP and your Secret Sauce isn't of much use, if you dont have solid Patents for them, otherwise they would mostly end up becoming a maintenance nightmare, after original engineers cash out. Also what if the the big company already has Hadoop cluster, it would be even difficult for them to integrate with your computing power.<p>While I seem to agree with Authors conclusion that a highly focused startup should make their proprietary solution, I cannot agree with his evidence behind that argument. A grid based crawler with 50K machines isn't something that Hadoop was ever designed to support.",1283724572.0
