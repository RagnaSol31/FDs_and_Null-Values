My luck was to be involved in two companies that simply paid me a wage, they had a reasonably good idea at the time, they were good enough in their execution, one was 10 years ahead of its time (the idea has since been adopted and is now common practice), the other failed because of terrible planning and marketing.<p>My gain was as much or more looking from the position of a salaried employee and to learn as much as if it was my own company that failed.<p>If it hadn't been for those two projects I wouldn't have stood a chance in hell with my own business, even today I benefit from that experience.<p>The most important thing you can do if your project tanks is to really sit down and mine it for what its worth with respect to the lessons that you can learn from it.

Take your first comment:<p>""The fact that women are even capable of conceiving of short-term sexual relationships is a sign that our society is impotent and dying.""<p>See, I'm not sure that's quite right, but I'm always open to being convinced. If you cited, for instance, the fall of Rome when making your point, or GDP per capita growth in traditional/modern societies, or population growth rates, well you might make a point. Instead you're just asserting that you're right.<p>> Everyone knows I'm right.<p>Like that. That doesn't work so well. Data, evidence, argument, counterargument. You've actually got some good arguments on your side - replacement rate in population growth, birthrates of the Islamic world vs. the rest of the world, and so on. I just got a copy of The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, and I think Gibbons points to changes in Roman family life as one of the big causes. So, you could probably make a really interesting and nuanced argument that challenged our beliefs and made us think more.<p>Now, it goes against a lot of people here's base views, so it would likely receive mixed feedback, but it would definitely get some positive points and discussion going. Heck, I'd be up for reading and discussing with you if you made those arguments because I'm not sold either way on what's going to happen to modern society 100 years out - it's a fascinating and interesting topic. I think data, citations, research, books, and a more flushed out argument and you could really make some interesting points and get some good discussion going.",1262471243.0

After a couple of failures you begin to get the hang of how to avoid failure in the ways that you've already seen before, and you find new, interesting ways to fail.<p>But everytime you 'fail', you also simultaneously succeed, you succeed in learning, in educating yourself. Three failed start-ups is probably the equivalent of a badge of merit and positions you very well for a possible success the fourth or the fifth time.

A lot of the things that happened (break-in, heart attack, etc.) were black swans that probably can't be avoided in the future. I did learn some important lessons though.<p>- Make sure your co-founders are as engaged as you are. I would even go as far as to say that if you can't find someone that really believes in the idea and is willing to put some serious work behind it it's better to go it alone.<p>- Make sure expectations are squared off, and you don't oversell the promise of riches. Most startups fail, and your co-founders need to know this. Otherwise you'll end up with broken friendships, which is never a good thing.<p>- Learn to code. When I looked back I saw that if I had been able to code I would have been a much better manager and founder, and would probably have been able to do a lot of the stuff that gave us so much trouble myself. I've since become pretty proficient at PHP, MySql and CSS. And I'm learning python and javascript.<p>The stuff I'm working on now is coded by myself, and I'm doing it alone. Not because I don't want a co-founder, far from it, but I don't want to have a co-founder that drags the whole venture down.",1262470116.0

This is needed for wear-leveling, so you might as well also use it for thin provisioning (aka trim), dedupe, etc. In the worst case, one read command may require reading several pages of metadata from flash to find the data.

It is the best of both worlds. Hopefully by disagreeing we'll explain what we're talking about more.<p>I remember reading Founders At Work. One of the points that one of the founders made was ""don't try to read too many business books"" His point, I think, was that it was really easy to fill your head with lots of great ideas. And executing was more important than all of them.<p>There was a saying I heard once: work on sales and all your other problems will take care of themselves. It doesn't mean that other things aren't important, just that there are some key metrics for any business.<p>I've spent a lot of time reading a lot of books (and HN) about startups. I think finally it's all congealed with me -- I got it. Perhaps I am sadly disillusioned, but I don't scratch my head like I used to any more. When I read an article like the one I read today, I don't think ""What kind of idiots wouldn't invest in such a cool idea?"" Instead I think ""Wonder why the community has failed this person such that he expects something much different than what he got?""<p>I'm done commenting, though.
