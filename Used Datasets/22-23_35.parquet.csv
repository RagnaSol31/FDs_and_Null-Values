The market could be a lot bigger if it were easier to find one's way.<p>Your first sentence deliberately ignores my main point which was of course that Linux by and large doesn't care if you're a little too intimidated by the range of choices to try something new. In fact I would go so far as to say if you're a person who likes to have everything spoon fed to you and is not comfortable and/or does not enjoy doing some research for yourself when you encounter issues, then you actually are better off sticking to Windows or possibly a Mac. Linux helps those who help themselves.<p>> And what about most of us who are not acquainted with anybody that uses Linux on a regular basis?<p>a) Local Linux user groups.\nb) Distro forums.\nc) Mailing lists.\nd) Google.<p>I also mentioned that these days, the choice for a newbie wanting to try Linux in general terms is pretty much made for them. You ignored that bit too.<p>> If their goal is not being popular, then I would say they are succeeding.<p>I never said their goal was not being popular, this is quite obvious to anyone who actually read my previous reply rather than skimming over it and trying to twist it into something that could be used to reinforce their existing beliefs.<p>What I did say was that many distros see popularity as a low or non-existent priority when compared to others, such as quality of implementation.<p>Debian has often gotten flak in the past for its long release cycle. If Debian devs are asked when the next stable Debian release will be ready, the usual answer is ""When it's done."" (though this is changing somewhat now) When the quality is assured, then it's released.<p>It's not released when the marketing department says it should be just because they are trying to hit an artificial deadline imposed by some middle manager who's more interested in his coke and hookers.<p>From the sound of it, I would recommend that you stay as far away from Linux as you can. You do not seem to have the required mind set that would make it an enjoyable experience for you.",1222729069.0

You fail to take into account production levels (which are currently only about 65% of consumption), an increase in uranium demand (based on new and proposed build will double by 2020), increased costs of actual mining and transportation of the resource just to name a few, or the effect of mining and extracting ever bit of uranium from the planet.  There are limits to fuel efficiencies increases and as well to the economic viability of nuclear power.  This is why it's a good idea to invest in new technologies now, such as fusion (the whole reason this discussion began).  Sure we can take every last particle of uranium out of the Earth's crust and ocean's but I think we can spend our time, energy and effort doing something more productive.  Uranium and thorium are finite resources and no amount of water extraction will make them not so.  We once believed oil would last us forever and we have come to realize that this is not so.  Let's not make the same mistake by promoting unsubstantiated and irrational ideas that nuclear (fission) will last us for half a trillion years when very educated and informed people who are actual experts put the number at 1000 years.

It's entitled ""To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide earnings assistance and tax relief to members of the uniformed services, volunteer firefighters, and Peace Corps volunteers, and for other purposes""!  If that kind of doublespeak don't get yer hackles up, I can't imagine what would.<p>Some honest discussion, some real consequences for the people that caused this meltdown (and it <i>was</i> caused, it was not an accident), and some oversight in how a bailout proceeds.  Perhaps we, as the folks footing the bill, would also like to know what the total is actually going to be <i>before</i> agreeing to it.  My understanding of the bill (admittedly weak) is that it is a blank check for Paulson to distribute amongst his friends in the finance industry, with no oversight and no transparency about how it's going to be used.<p>The fact that a bailout is being presented as ""OMG! We have to do this now, imagine the consequences if we don't!"" it has a strikingly similar ring to the ""We have to invade Iraq now!"" pose of a few years ago.  I don't trust salesguys that insist I need to buy now, and I <i>really</i> don't trust politicians when they use the same tactic, especially when they're arguments are based on lies and misdirection.<p>Yes, <i>something</i> must be done.  Accountability would be a great start.  Bringing some trust back into our finance industry would be a good way forward.  A bailout?  I dunno.  Maybe there are other ways forward that directly help the people hurt rather than the millionaires and billionaires that caused it.",1222726493.0

That's just a fact, and I'm not in a mood to give you documenting links.  Outstanding credit continues to grow at only a slightly lower rate than before.  There is not a credit shortage.  There is a shortage of viable uses for credit.  There is huge overcapacity in retail, housing, etc.  People who can't reasonably be expected to pay back loans can't get them right now.  Which is basically a good thing.  Businesses can't get loans to expand because nobody in their right mind thinks many kinds of business SHOULD be expanding.<p>The macro-economic conditions are driving the markets, not the other way around.  The financial firms are suffering because the REAL economy ran out of greater fools and hit its maximum tolerable debt load.  The real economy is not shuddering because the masters in Wall Street can't grease the wheels; it's the other way around.",1222726477.0

I think it shows a striking lack of character to vote for a bad bill because it happens to contain some earmarks or other terms you (and your biggest contributors) happen to like.<p>The older I get, the more I realize that character in politicians is far more important than ideology.  Decent people can disagree on the right way to solve the problems our nation faces, including this (very large) one...but lining the pockets of supporters at the expense of everyone else in the nation, particularly those least able to protect their assets, strikes me as a despicable and crassly self-serving act.  The only way to a solution that most everybody can agree on is to honestly discuss the issues.<p>With a bill named ""To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide earnings assistance and tax relief to members of the uniformed services, volunteer firefighters, and Peace Corps volunteers, and for other purposes"" that hands $700 billion (actually more...) over to a fellow who'll be doling it out to all of his old buddies from the finance industry with no oversight, we've already established that no sane discussion can take place.  It's classic doublespeak on the order of the best the Soviets and Red Chinese ever came up with, and that duplicity in and of itself is enough to disqualify this bill from consideration by honest folks.<p>This is actually a prime example of why I genuinely like Ron Paul.  I disagree with him on some major issues (immigration and abortion being the biggest), but I know where he stands, and I know he believes in what he says and acts accordingly.  I think I'd like to see a lot more of that, from any side of the political spectrum.  But, it seems like crooked Republicans get voted out only to be replaced by crooked Democrats.  I'd be happy with a batch of honest Democrats or a batch of honest Republicans, but it seems the only way to keep them close to honest is to keep churning new people in, keep the parties roughly in balance, and keep them at each others throats so they can do the least amount of damage possible.",1222725947.0

Instead, it diverts resources away from more productive sectors and by fuelling consumer spending it exacerbates America's economic imbalances. Eventually, there will be a price to pay.<p>Also, I'm not sure that predictions of problems equate to knowing what to do to best wind down the current mess.  You're right (elsewhere) that some things need to go under.  However, I think the point of the 'bailout proponents' is that more will go under than otherwise needs be without it.<p>Of course I guess we'll really never know for certain in any case, as it's impossible to know what would have happened otherwise.
