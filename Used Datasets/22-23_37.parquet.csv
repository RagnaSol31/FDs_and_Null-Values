It's not a revolutionary change, sure, but honestly, neither is implementing web standards.  You're still rendering html, applying css, and executing javascript.<p>As for the point about what constitutes a 'standard', you're just saying there's a difference between an official standard and a de facto standard.  I won't dispute that.  I don't think that's the story here, though.  The story is that IE used to be the de facto standard through merit before growing lazy as hell and losing its technical lead, and that people are increasingly willing to think they can move forward without it.  It's been steadily losing market share since 2004, while the web has absolutely exploded in that same time frame.  Are you really saying that its a bad bet at this point to not particularly care about IE's attempts to bully the market by not playing nice with the standards the other browsers are agreeing to support?",1243464972

It's entirely possible that people may look back from a few centuries hence and look at floating national currencies (which are essentially backed only by the backing government's power to tax a particular economy) and think ""what a really terrible idea.""  The very power that a fiat currency gives a government over its money supply might turn out to be more temptation than even the most honest government can withstand in the long run.  We don't know, because there just hasn't been enough time to tell.<p>There's two orders of magnitude difference between the amount of time gold has been in use and the amount of time the current un-pegged dollar has been around.

I don't think we've reached the pinnacle of the form, though -- I'd much rather we could expand the areas where it's the fastest way to get the job done.<p>One weakness with the standard unix cli is in discoverability. The MPW environment for the original Mac had a great system for this -- option-enter on any command would bring up a gui with that allowed you to build up the options and flags. It was the perfect mix of GUI: invisible when you didn't need it, but vastly easier for the first use of an unfamiliar command.<p>That said, I think the people who think like you are in the majority of CLI users, so innovations like these will struggle to get traction.

He never explains how Bespin implements this feature, but I don't see how you can get a significant improvement on the way these shells do it (which he says is probably not the best way) without abandoning the standard toolchain altogether. (zsh uses scripts to do it, which can use --help output if desired. ISTR that they're rather complicated, but then they're also rather powerful. I think they become much simpler in degenerate cases, but I've only ever dabbled and that was over a year ago.)<p>For the pipe inspection, I got the impression he might have been talking about ""look at the data that's being sent"". Which can be done with tee, but both that and pv require that you insert them into the chain beforehand. I think there's room for improvement there.

Very few people going to an ER are paying out of pocket: many don't have insurance[1], and will either not pay for their visit or will negotiate some sort of payment plan at a reduced rate with the hospital. And, of course, those visitors with insurance don't care what the hospital ends up charging their insurance company- that's the whole point of insurance. This is, of course, especially true during emergency or urgent care situations.<p>[1] To the extent that emergency room overcrowding is due to people without other health care options (i.e., the un- and under-insured) using ERs as their primary care facilities, surcharges <i>really</i> won't help: by definition, these are people who can't pay for medical care... so adding additional surcharges probably won't have much effect on their ER utilization.",1243463346

What you want to do is segment the demand curve for ER services and slice out those who are willing to pay more to avoid wasting hours of their time.<p>It seems lowering the price would gut your revenue but you wouldn't increase your userbase enough to make up for it (there would be a big deadweight loss of utility that patients get, but don't have to pay for -- lost revenue for you).<p>Also, ER is an incredibly expensive thing to go through, so mentally your users may be more price-insensitive than usual--they'll bucket all the costs together in a 'big bath', so you can charge more.",1243462633

I don't own an e-book reader and can understand buying hard copies -- at used book stores, in particular -- but if I did own one, I can't think of many reasons why I would prefer this to an e-book.
