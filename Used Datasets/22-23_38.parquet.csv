But if you don't care much about Joel, the atmosphere might not work for you.<p>Looking at the rest of the options, that's what I think at least. If that's not the intent for ""Environment/Atmosphere"", something like that should be added then, because that can play a big role. A spacious office with views and Aeron chairs is always better than a small windowless room sitting on a pizza box, everything else being equal.",1239747211.0
