People vote them up not because they're interesting, but just to support their preferred candidate.<p>Maybe somebody should submit an ""Ask YC: What Presidential candidate do you like?"" That way everybody could get their political opinions off their chest once and for all, and we wouldn't have to suffer through ten months of this kind of stuff.",1201561020

It's hard to comprehend the unconscious and intricate processes of the market.<p>For lighter, more modern fair, I have always enjoyed the works of Steven Landsburg. From the trivial, such as why we walk up stairs but not escalators:<p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2070182"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/id/2070182</a><p>To the profound, such as how to grow cars in Iowa:<p><a href=""http://faculty.tamu-commerce.edu/dfunderburk/428/readings/The%20Iowa%20Car%20Crop.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.tamu-commerce.edu/dfunderburk/428/readings/Th...</a><p>Empirical economics (what perhaps you mean by ""scientific"") is also fun and illuminating. The author of ""Freakonomics"", Steven Levitt, is enduringly popular nowadays. His work tends towards the empirical:<p><a href=""http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/</a><p>I've always been a big fan of Cowen and Tabarok:<p><a href=""http://www.marginalrevolution.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marginalrevolution.com/</a><p>In college I studied the economics of environmentalism, which is essential to understand what approaches to helping the environment are likely to work or not (incentives matter!). I also studied the economics of law. Sorry, no quick fun links!<p>There is so much great economics out there, and so little life. Right now I am studying monetary policy. It's dense and dry, but also very controversial and unsettled, which makes it exciting.",1201560733

But I'll have a go.<p>My first premise is that I think those who achieve success via ""fair"" competition tend to be better qualified than those who achieve it other ways.<p>My second premise is that over time successful founders should expect to find themselves in positions of power and influence beyond the scope of their initial successes.<p>My last premise is that societies avoid the worst types of social injustice when no single culture or way of thinking dominates the others.  While heterogeneous societies may not make as much ""progress"" as homogeneous ones, they also avoid the worst cases.<p>Based on this, I think we'll have a better society if there are more qualified women at the top, but to have that we need more qualified women at all stages of the competition.",1201560655

To save you the trouble of researching everything yourself because someone who you already know tells you what they think.  If you trust the endorser, then they've saved you some time.  Ditto if you distrust them (there are some people that if they endorsed my favorite candidate, I'd probably be so suspicious I'd change my vote).  I know a lot about what the xkcd guy is like than my senator (well, not my senator (Obama) but probably everyone else), so his endorsement is more useful information.<p>It was also a well written explanation of his views, whether you agree with it or not.",1201560243

If you can find any model of keyboard at all that works for you, buy it. Ditto for wrist rests, chairs, monitors, whatever. If it's expensive, make your employer pay for it. No manager worth their salt should look askance at spending $1-2k if it'll keep you in front of the keyboard for even an hour longer per day.<p>If you're working for yourself and therefore self-imposing these ridiculous hours and spending limits, then stop. Seriously, just stop. Think about whether the payoff is going to be big enough to make crippling yourself for life. Hell, if you're really sitting at a computer for 15 hours a day, you're probably at risk of getting blood clots in your legs from lack of motion. No startup is worth dying over, or even seriously degrading your quality of living in the future.",1201559858

But that is not to say, that a rapid prototyping framework couldn't be made, which used solely client side state.<p>Anyway, I am of course putting it a bit on the extreme end here, but in principle I stand by it.

21,105809,comment,105590.0,105590.0,0,0,sanj,,,"I wonder if the throttle move.  In almost all aircraft, excepting the A3[2|3|4|8]0 family, throttles move when in any automatic mode.  If the autoflight system decides to go to full throttle, they'll slide all the way forward.  This was definitely true on the B7[5|6]7 series, but I'm not certain about the B777.<p>There were a rash of concerns (though no incidents that I recall) because pilots often leave a hand on the throttle to have a sense of what the aircraft is doing.  A sudden movement could mean a change in flight mode or a level off, or a stall.<p>By contrast Airbus's non-moving throttles are just shiny switches.  They have detente settings for each mode.  They could just as easily be a set of toggle switches.",1201559098

It affects every American (and some would say the rest of the world as well) and coverage is so pervasive it's hard to avoid, so some of it is going to seep in.<p>For those that wish to post political articles, please consider that a significant portion of the readers of Hacker News greatly dislike the tone that political discussion often takes.  If you decide to post something, please make sure it is 1) fair and even handed, 2) not polarizing, and 3) loosely related to Hacker News in general.<p>A big thank you in advance to everyone who helps keep things civil over the next (oy) 10 months.",1201558985
