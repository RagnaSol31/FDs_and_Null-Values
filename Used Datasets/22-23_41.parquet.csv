So your society, whatever it is, will have an extremely poor and old social class. These are the people who will also have the most problem with health care. When they get sick, the hospitals will not let them die - their medical care will be paid - by the government. Those people will turn to begging, alcohol and create a new class of homeless people.<p>It's nice to want to put responsibility on the individual, but those 20% will make your society an unpleasant place to live in.

15,540995,comment,540005.0,540931.0,0,0,mkn,,,"They use the term 'discover,' I would presume, because it's the most technically accurate term for what they do. As near as I can tell, as a relative layperson, mathematicians look at the existing state of mathematics, embodied in proven theorems, and consider the implications of those theories, looking for unanswered questions or outright contradictions. They then attempt to find the new theory that will provably answer the question or resolve the contradiction.<p>The only 'invention' that goes on seems, to me, to be on the order of brainstorming, i.e., inventing hypotheticals to test their implications or shed new light on an existing conundrum.<p>Fundamentally, I think the use of 'discovery' terminology, rather than 'invention' terminology arises from the nature of the new thing produced. Discoveries, in the scientific or mathematical sense, were 'always there' within the corresponding realm of inquiry (e.g., the set of axioms that comprise mathematics, the physical world for scientific discoveries, & etc.) and represent a mere formulation of an existing but previously hidden truth. Inventions, on the other hand, represent a novel application of existing principles for some external purpose. The implementation cannot be said to have flowed from existing knowledge in any meaningful way. Nor do inventions have any <i>general</i> theoretical utility. (Mousetraps are fun little inventions, but don't contribute to a 'Theory of Pest Control' and we certainly would not refer to the 'discoverer of the mouse trap.')<p>Additionally, other scientists do in fact use the terms 'discover' and 'invent' in precisely the same sense as mathematicians do, and for similar reasons. In fact, these are the commonly accepted notions of the terms even among nonspecialists.<p>Using 'mathematical invention' rather than 'mathematical discovery' erroneously (or maliciously) ascribes arbitrary subjectivity to mathematical thought.",1238539613.0

The management of GM basically just deferred these costs.<p>Things such as pension funds should not be handled by the employee (IMHO). You should get your full salary (with benefits included) and make your own choice what funds you will use for medical aid/retirement.<p>Also - on a side note (of topic), these companies should be allowed to fail. They are easily replaceable and most motor manufacturing already happens in lower cost countries in any way.<p>Aren't there companies that are much more important pillars of the world economy that deserve a bailout more (e.g. AMD).",1238537522.0

Regardless of how the actual quality compares,  people think American cars are lower quality.  It didn't happen over night either.    I can't imagine what went through their minds as they just let it happen;  there was probably a lot of corporate thought control and it was un-PC to actually drive a Japanese car or say anything good about one for decades.    You know you contrast that to like MS and their approach to Linux,  MS is on top because they fear EVERYBODY and give them some respect.  I just can't imagine letting my company develop and image of creating lower quality products than my competitors, for years and years.<p>Now the bigger difference is when you buy an inexpensive, smaller Toyota or Honda,  they are radically different than an inexpensive, smaller Ford or GM car.  The styling choices are different.   For years Americans associated big and heavy with quality,  they always thought the Japanese cars are tinny and flimsy.  It really seems like when you buy an inexpensive American car,  you get a cheap car but when you buy an inexpensive Japanese car you get a cost reduced version of their nicer cars.",1238537334.0

So if GS is not clearly saying that those pages are unofficial, any lack of correspondence will hurt that company.<p>GS was basically hijacking some companies customer service. If I have a problem with a product, and I incorrectly believe that I am being ignored, the company will end up worse off. At the minimum, I will seriously consider not buying from that company again, and I might mention my bad experience to other people I know. And if my problem was severe, I might think of filing a chargeback.<p>I really doubt 37Signals spends a lot of time scouring the internet looking for people infringing on their IP.
