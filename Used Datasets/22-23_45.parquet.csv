1,2926726,comment,2924399.0,2926362.0,1,0,rprospero,,,"I'll completely agree with you that a student who can't multiply three by five doesn't understand mathematics.  However, I'd argue that I'd rather have a student spend ten hours figuring out that 3*5 = 5+5+5 = 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 15 than to have a trained parrot that simply squawks the answer.  The first student was slower, but it's the parrot that's mouthing a series of words without understanding.<p>As for the rest, I disagree that I'm fighting that standard learning pattern.  In nearly every subject, we start with a generality and then move into specifics.  We learn about the Roman Empire before we learn about Cicero.  We learn about teeth before we learn about incisors.  We learn about protons before we learn about quarks.  We learn about function calls before we learn the standard library.  We learn about China before we learn about Beijing.  Almost all learning is performed through iteratively refining a central abstraction with increasing detail.",1314313107

But not using a WAR file it seems.<p><i>For example, JRuby is one of the most frequently-requested languages on Heroku. Matthew Rodley has already put a Rails app onto JRuby on Heroku by adding JRuby to pom.xml. Scala, another common request, could be done the same way. We do look forward to being able to offer the same kind of first-class support for JRuby and Scala that we offer for Clojure; but in the meantime, bootstrapping via Java is a reasonable strategy.</i><p>Now if we could just get some performance comparisons between the Ruby and Java platforms on Heroku... pretty please?",1314313054

Language mismatch is a major cause of slow generated code (see GWT).  In Opa's case, having no arrays (only linked lists) sounds like a disaster for compiling to JS.<p>* I've never seen the model work before where you ""don't even need to think about what's running on the client or server.""  I like features like sharing code (same language) and easy transport (serializable data structures), but frameworks that blur the client/server distinction usually download all of your code, or none of it, or little snippets on demand, or some other strategy that's worse than a manual distinction.<p>* What's development like?  Do you really have to recompile your app after every change?  My favorite frameworks just let you change the code and reload the web page.<p>* I've seen many, and even written one, tutorial that goes:  ""Making a chat room in a web browser is hard.  But here's a demo that does it in 20 lines!""  With all the frameworks and libraries out there these days, it's not that hard.<p>* Tons of dependencies (a personal gripe).  Coming from the Java world, where lots of things like reading images are built-in, it's comical to see that Opa requires Java, AND libjpeg and a dozen other things (it doesn't actually run on the JVM I don't think).",1314311922

Nothing in the world even comes close to /. moderation.<p>Reddit is a prime example of a simple karma system going off the deep end. Instead of reinforcing good behavior, the trend is now that a substantial majority of the community competes for karma score. The noise level has increased sharply over the previous years such that the ""popular reddits"" are now in the same domain as Digg or 4chan. (Thankfully subreddits such as proggit are still an excellent source of information.)<p>I think karma works here at HN because it is a hidden score (to avoid the Reddit scenario) and the community heavily discourages low-quality posts. In a sense it relies directly on the userbase mentality and could easily be negated by a change in demographics. (Hopefully we maintain a high signal:noise ratio...)<p>/. meta moderation rewards users for moderating ""correctly"" and it doesn't consider the sum input of all users. It's not something that every community could or should adopt, but it certainly seems to have prevented a large fluctuation in community quality for well over a decade. It's also really awesome that comments are not just quantitatively scored, but also have qualitative tags.<p>Both you and Rob have effected the evolution of the Web as well as how we consume our news in more ways than we'll ever know.",1314310083
