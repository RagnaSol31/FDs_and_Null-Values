32,636945,comment,635593.0,636300.0,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Actually assuming the climate and weather aren't connected is fundamentally ignorant. The El Nino and La Nina effects are the biggest example of this, in that it can change regional temperatures across the entire globe, it can cause algal blooms, which in turn are a key part of the climate model.<p>A prolonged El Nino is reported to have helped provoke the French Revolution by causing famines all over Europe. Crop failures and record low temperatures/rainfall have profound effects on the environment and the local biospheres climate effects. Death of biological material (crop failures) is usually tied to CO2 and Methane release through the biological processes that result, this is not to mention that prolonged cold periods (El Nino lasted over a decade at the time of the French revolution) result in less plant growth and more CO2 production through fuel burning. Then it would have likely led to a lot more deforestation than it likely would today.<p>My objections to computer modeling is that all they are is a model. If you put the wrong equation into the model, the answer is wrong.<p>The one thing I've never heard factored in is the amount of thermal energy emitted by living organisms and our society. From the estimates I've read, all the biomass on earth produces roughly 3-4 days the amount of solar energy received from the sun. Essentially the Earth is receiving 369 days worth of energy, for only 365 days in a year.<p>It's all a matter of equations, and the computer models have always put out unsatisfactory answers. I remember one being laughed at for predicting ocean rises of 1 cm per year, and I believe we've had approximately 0.01 cm per year.<p>My point is that the climate scientists' jobs depend on the climate being in danger. If there weren't fires we wouldn't have firemen, and if we didn't have crimes we wouldn't have police, so if there isn't a climate crisis we wouldn't have climate scientists and there's no provisions to protect us from rogue scientists but there are provisions to protect us from rogue cops. None of these models are repeated, no one can confirm the results as even being valid, they're just guesses.<p>Perhaps I just have a problem with trusting people in white coats telling me the sky is falling, but it all sounds too much like Chicken Little to me. I need to know the firemen aren't burning buildings down before I'm willing to pay them to put out fires. Equally I need to know Climate Scientists aren't hyping this up just to keep their careers alive.<p>As I've already said, I don't have a problem with the hardcore evidence and I believe global warming is happening. My problem is with the explanations and predictions, because they all seem either too simplistic or just bunk. Perhaps it's just a problem in the translation from the scientific and non-scientific lexicons, just like the major problems with explaining evolution to an American.",1243895804.0

One of the reasons we are so anti-censorship is because there is a strong tradition of anti-censorship in the US.  As much as we like to think we are inherently moral, the truth is that a lot of it does stem from culture.  This isn't to say that anti censorship isn't objectively good.  Just that we don't necessarily support it merely because it is objectively good.<p>So you may get weird responses when you transplant such a value to a culture that has thousands of years of history where the issue of censorship was never really important.  When you say censorship is bad to another westerner you are signaling a value and you expect a certain response.  Your communication is predicated on a shared set of connotations.
