As long as you have privacy you will have this kind of thing. If somebody starts a popular service with (close to) 100% anonymity and 100% data privacy (e.g. server provider doesn't hold encryption keys), they are virtually guaranteed that it will be used for this kind of content. In other words, any truly private service is almost certainly an unwilling accessory to this kind of abuse. Further, users of such services are going to be stigmatized for sharing a service with kiddie porn consumers/producers. That is very unfortunate.<p>Also, since apparently this kind of content is easily available, we are all one click away from becoming criminals. Imagine somebody posted a link to some kiddie porn on news.yc with a title like ""Apple Announces iPhone 4G"" on some non-alarming domain. Anybody that clicks the link to get their daily Apple rumor will instantly become a criminal.<p>Eventually, nearly all of us will probably have some kind of incident like this. And, as companies and governments start recording and analyzing everything we do online, this means that we will all eventually get caught. At any time, any of us could be instantly arrested and (nearly) instantly convicted. This is just like how cops claim that if they follow somebody long enough, eventually they will break a traffic law because it is nearly impossible to follow the laws.<p>Somebody that can solve these problems would be doing society a lot of good.

Your goal should be to finish a couple of proof-heavy undergraduate theory courses, such as 400-level analysis and algebra.<p>Along the way you will learn lots of useful math, but that isn't the point -- other than the math you encounter in your CS classes, there is no specific mathematical knowledge required for programming.  However, you <i>need</i> to do a lot of proofs and understand the power of mathematics, and you need to have the mathematical background to tackle whatever your specific interests turn out to be.  (For instance, if you become interested in data mining, you will need to have enough mathematical maturity to study statistics by yourself, starting with any requisite calculus and linear algebra you happen to lack.)<p>Some people will correctly point out that you don't have to know jack about mathematics to be a good programmer.  While this is true of many programmers, you sound like an especially smart kid, and <i>you</i> will not reach your potential without studying high-level math.",1237328151

Do some (quick) research about some languages you're interested in.<p>2.  Decide on the language that is most intriguing to you and that you think you'd stick with.<p>3.  Find an idea for an app that will be useful to you.  Be sure to set the goal of your first app properly-don't try to take on too much (mathetica clone) or too little (Hello World) with it.<p>4.

For example, I'm not comfortable with an 18 year-old being viewed as a predator for having consensual sex with a 17 year-old.<p>But other than the fringe cases, I really don't see how it ever can be healthy for a child to be involved with an adult, or even be in a situation where they can give consent.<p>There is too great a power difference. Somebody mentioned earlier that some parents were basically forced to get their kids involved with porn so they could eat. What is the child going to do in that situation, say no? Basically, in that situation, if the child has a choice it's between eating and doing porn.<p>Also, minors today are taught that it is the acceptable thing to defer to adults. So children already have a lot of pressure to defer to adults instead of enforcing their personal boundaries.<p>And I can't imagine a child being seriously attracted to an adult. They are both in different stages in life. After I started college, I really viewed high school students  differently. They are just in a different place in life. I have different goals, responsibilities, and plans then I did in high school. I really doubt I would have enough in common to be attracted to a high school student, let alone be able to make a healthy relationship work.",1237327760
