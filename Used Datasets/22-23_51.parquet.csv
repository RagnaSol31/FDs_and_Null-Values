The example is fully functional, though, and once you've wrapped your head around it, it all makes sense and does indeed work (I've used it in production).<p>Sorry, but ""seeing what patterns are most widely used"" is a lame excuse. You could just look at what real world sites do today (and did 4 years ago) - or simply jump right to implementing the only anonymous sharding model that can possibly work (see how mongodb does it).<p>I'm not meaning to bash django as a whole here, but I had a true WTF-moment looking at that page. It seems the home-grown ORM is becoming a ball on a chain if something like that takes <i>this</i> long...<p>Anyways, at least it's progress in the right direction, looking forward to real partitioning support, hopefully in earlier than another 4 years.",1261522774

Writing a whole bunch of getters and setters in a freshly minted Java class certainly feels like work.  However, I think he gets it wrong when he puts OCaml on the extreme ""for you to model everything"" end of the spectrum:<p><i>And Haskell, OCaml and their ilk are part of a 45-year-old static-typing movement within academia to try to force people to model everything. Programmers hate that. These languages will never, ever enjoy any substantial commercial success</i><p>Hold on a minute...last time I checked OCaml was a dialect of ML.  ML does not ask you to ""statically"" type everything, in fact it does the opposite.  It infers all the types.  Sure, it allows you to hint types to the compiler, but this is not necessary.  You get all the benefits of ""static"" type checking through ML's concept of type inference.  It's designed specifically to make it less work for the programmer to enjoy the benefits of a sound, correct type system.<p>If you want to learn more about type inference in ML, check out this short introduction: <a href=""http://bit.ly/8WEhD8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/8WEhD8</a>",1261521795

None of the classes I tested out of counted towards my GPA. I passed 4 AP tests, but my GPA was 2.4. If principal hadn't kept me there I would of been in and out in 2 years. I suspect he didn't let me leave because the high school gets funding from the state per student enrolled.<p>I did four years of Japanese classes in one and got a five on the calculus test, but my GPA was below the cutoff for engineering, so I had to get a professor there to write a special recommendation to let me in. Somebody with a high GPA who passed no AP tests has preference in admissions over me.<p>I've got nothing against using test scores for admissions, but grades are incredibly subjective. 99% of the time they're not a measure of ability, they're a measure of obedience, and your ability to persuade teachers.

I worked with many pieces of code written by one particular coworker of mine who was way too smart for his own good.  His code was littered with little formulae like that, repeated again and again throughout a file, and to him it was obvious at a glance what they meant.  It was also easy for him to scan through his code and find errors in these expressions, as easy as it is for you or me to see that ""(matthes-js2-line-ending ..."" contains a typo.  I have no idea how he coped with finding and changing every instance of a formula that needed to be changed.  For me it was a slog every time I had to read, change, or debug his code.<p>P.S.  The most frequent and flagrant was calculating array indices into multi-dimensional arrays in C++.  It's so easy to write a simple class that lets you do this:<p><pre><code>  arr(n1 + i, n2 + j, n3 + k) = calc_foo(i, j, k);\n</code></pre>\ninstead of this:<p><pre><code>  arr[n3 + k + (n2 + j) * (nz + (n1 + i) * ny)] = calc_foo(i, j, k);</code></pre>",1261519599
