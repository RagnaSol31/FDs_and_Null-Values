So I set some rules for myself based on the meeting type.<p>Brainstorming meetings/topical discussions: 30 minutes, max.  Never recurring.  I start the meeting on time with a simple statement: ""I value the time you've given me here, so I want to get this going.  If we tear apart <topic> we can probably be done in twenty.""  I get consistent, on-time attendance (from people who do <i>not</i> report to me) and consistent participation (on conference calls people are taking from in front of an internet connected PC).<p>Status Meetings: I rarely schedule these, but when I have to, they're set to 15 minutes and very structured.  My daily status meeting lasts between five and seven minutes.<p>I have a totally unscientific theory as to why I insist on shorter meetings work (based solely on how I behave):<p>1) I don't have an hour to kill in a conference call being hosted by someone other than my boss or in my reporting chain.  So I work during those meetings.  I do have twenty minutes assuming that the problem attempting to be solved hasn't already been solved by the organizer and my attendance is simply ceremonial.<p>2) Half hour meetings may mean having to have two instead of one, but that may also be a benefit in that it gives people time to think more deeply about the problem at hand and be prepared for the next meeting.<p>3) Status meetings suck, especially if they are simply a formality or legal requirement.  I see them for what they are (a necessary evil) and try not to waste anyone's valuable time.  When I host them, they have a strict agenda and are very short.<p>When I participate in ""manager status meetings"" (sometimes called ""What did you work on this week?""), I come prepared with a list and put it through a filter: ""Is this item something that anyone on this call will find useful or care about"".  My responses are short and to the point.  I regularly receive follow-up questions targeted at a specific bullet point.  Maybe that's bad, but I'd rather provide a little less than is necessary and have someone ask me for specific information that's important to <i>them</i>, than provide so much information that everyone's eyes glaze over and they stop paying attention.",1241820823.0
