In the case Tinker vs. Des Moines, the court ruled that the students who were wearing arm-bands as a protest against the Vietnam War enjoyed first-amendment protection and discipline from the school was illegal. The court has been much more lenient on searches -- see New Jersey v T. L. O. However, you still need at least some reasonable ground for a search to be legal.<p>As for interrogations, the supreme court has yet to rule on it.

The fact that it's written in such a fashion as to be assumed that students have Fifth Amendment rights and the court cases are arguing over a technicality of pre-trial processing would seem to imply that students don't shed that right, either. Specifically: ""A juvenile court judge determined that Paul did not understand that he had a right to remain silent and a right to have a lawyer and his parents present for the entire interrogation.

Too often, children defer to authority -- as they've been taught by ...uh... the authorities -- and when the principal says ""Write out what happened and sign it,"" that resulting confession is often given to the police. Cops certainly can't demand that a suspect write a confession without first advising the suspect of their rights (""You have the right to remain silent...""), but school officials -- typically government agents in their own right -- don't seem to have a problem obtaining confessions for use against their own students, even without bringing in their parents first (let alone a lawyer).

Conversely, many Mandarin terms for which characters do exist are foreign to non-Mandarin speakers. The fact that nonstandard speakers can read a text in the standard language simply means that these speakers are bilingual. They have learned written Mandarin as a second language. They know enough vocabulary and grammar to make sense of Mandarin texts, much as I know enough French words and grammar to read that language (without being able to pronounce it convincingly, much less to speak it fluently). If Chinese characters have unified the Chinese languages, then the alphabet has unified French and English.<p>""The characters do allow nonstandard speakers to use their own pronunciations to read Mandarin texts. So instead of acclimating to the national standard, nonstandard speakers reinforce their own speech habits and add to the vitality of their ""dialect"" by introducing new vocabulary from Mandarin, which they pronounce their own way by analogy. Whether alphabetic scripts should be used to provide China's non-Mandarin speakers with the means to become literate in their own language is a political question outside the scope of the present inquiry. But one thing is certain: since non-Mandarin speakers are forced anyway to learn a second language, it would make more sense from the viewpoint of those promoting unity if this bilingualism were achieved through Mandarin written in the pinyin alphabet.8 The incentive to learn the national standard, including its pronunciation, would be higher than it is today if one's ability to read depended on it. As it is now, nonstandard speakers work their way through standard texts using whatever pronunciation comes naturally, not fully learning Mandarin and not reading their own languages either.""",1274566444.0

But if you have some customers and some revenue you're not doing badly and your competitors aren't really an issue. A year is not much time to build a presence on the Internet. It takes time to get organic traffic and word-of-mouth growth.<p>If you think the market is there keep at it. If you've learned the market isn't really there, sit down with your cofounders and hash this out with them. They will see through any attempt to keep them enthusiastic if you aren't enthusiastic. I think this is a key example of how PG is wrong on the cofounder issue (at least for bootstrapped startups). It's a lot easier to grow a small business to the point where it supports the expectations of one person than to the point where it supports the expectations of several.<p>If you want to sell, try making a phone call to the other CEO and arrange lunch if you can get it.
