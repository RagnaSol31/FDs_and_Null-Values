Probably the most extreme re-organization was the urllib/urllib2 merger, which was at its core just removing old stuff. Because Python is dynamically typed, the ""protocol"" of a library is extremely important, and the semantics of existing functions/classes are almost never changed.<p>Of Zed's complaints, I feel that two are misguided (time handling seems quite reasonable to me, and I've never seen an easier documentation system than Sphinx).<p>I think applying the ""del"" keyword to objects in a container is a mistake in the language, but that's how it was designed, so it probably wouldn't have been changed in the 2 -> 3 transition. It certainly won't be changed now -- the best that can be hoped for is for its use to be discouraged in the documentation.<p>Install/Uninstall of modules is fairly easy, but requires all concerned parties to work together.

They have been the furthest thing from innovative since circa-2003 — their hardware has always been second rate at best and it doesn’t seem to be changing now. Couple that with the nation’s underdog carrier at a $299 price-point (before rebate), and we’re not sure how many people are going to be lined up overnight, yet we’re pretty confident once people are able to play a real unit themselves, there will be more than a lot of happy Palm Pre customers.</i><p>That's kinda the feeling I'm getting too.  As a Sprint customer who is eligible to upgrade, I'm really excited - finally a WebKit based browser in a Sprint phone!  However, I wish Palm could have been more competitive - on price, on applications, and on hardware.  Not that it's terrible or anything on any of those fronts.  It's just that it would be nicer if it were a tad more competitive when compared with the iPhone.  Would a glass screen have killed them?  Maybe a preliminary SDK for games?

We're talking microseconds.<p>I take it a step further than OP.  Every data base record has 2 IDs, an internal sequential one and an external one.

56,632952,comment,632335.0,632806.0,0,0,mdasen,,,"This is part of what I'm wondering: how much do you have to give?  Simply providing for basic needs is clearly unacceptable (in my opinion).  Heck, try suggesting that someone go without cable TV to balance their budget and you'll get a bad reaction.  Anyway, I think it would be undesirable to have a society in which there were two clear castes of haves and havenots even if the havenots did have all of their needs (medical, shelter, food. . .).<p>And then the problem becomes: as we move into this new economy, how do we parcel out this socialism?  Majority rule would simply be tyranny and we can't have a functional society where there are two groups and one is 100x more wealthy than the other in a caste-like fashion.  Still, those who produce need some reward and incentive.  So, how would we do it?<p>The only thing that I can think of is land: land is the one thing that we can't actually produce with labor (despite Boston's Back Bay real estate).  If the cost to produce a television is essentially nothing, there's no sense in restricting who gets one even if the design has to be done by an ""upper-caste"" person.  However, land - and land in ""cool"" areas like Seattle or San Francisco - is in limited supply.  Only certain people can live there.  So, even if all goods and services can be provided for near $0, land can't.<p>To be honest, I think that this future will be kinda cool.  I mean, if most/all of our material wants and needs are taken care of, we could hack away at projects we thought were interesting/fun.  Our jobs could be what we find joy in - whether that be local theater or web apps.  And I think that we would create value that way.  Potentially not in the focused, reward-driven way that we do today, but lots of people come together around no money to do things even today.  I'm not saying that we can replace our current economy like that, but at the point that we have wants and needs met for essentially $0, it seems like it would be fun.  Frankly, in that kind of future, there doesn't seem to be a need to force people into things they might not like.<p>Maybe that's too hippy.",1243636141

I think a programmer would be much worse off facing his first real-world programming problem armed only with an instruction set and a hex editor than if he had a C compiler and knowledge of C.  Just knowing how structs and functions work gives you some mental tools for solving the problem.  ""Any Real Programmer will tell you that all the _____ in the world won't help you solve a problem like that"" just doesn't make sense if read literally -- is he claiming that no set of ideas for structuring programs actually enhances your abilities at all?  ""It takes actual talent"" is just an empty truism (like ""______ is never a silver bullet."")  So the statement falls apart when taken seriously, which calls the attitude it expresses into doubt.<p>And that's the dual thrust of the article.  It doesn't just make fun of Quiche-Eaters.  It also makes fun of Real Programmers.  The humor is based on the difficulty of drawing a line between progressivism and trendiness.  Or, to turn it around, the difficulty of drawing a line between pragmatism and fatalism.  The article is written from the point of view of someone who errs on the side of fatalism (believing that no new ideas will ever prove useful) and who makes fun of people who err on the side of trendy prissiness (turning up their noses at anything mature enough to actually work.)  The Real Programmer speaking in the article manages, quite ironically, to make just much fun of Real Programmers as Quiche-Eaters.  Consider the paragraph you quoted.  Of <i>course</i> the most appropriate ideas for finding your way around a legacy system are the ideas that were used to <i>create</i> that system!  That illustrates how the (caricature) Real Programmer's perception of technical superiority is skewed by a lack of historical perspective (quite funny given his relish for history.)  Quiche-eating, effete values of _____ have a way of turning into Real Programmer stuff when they became widespread and uncool.  That means a lot of today's Real Programmer stuff consists of yesterday's quiche.  Structured programming?  That's <i>C</i>!  The present-day Real Programmer sees himself as the inheritor of the guy who scorned present-day tools as effete, not as the inheritor of the Quiche-Eaters who pushed the development of present-day tools.  (Likewise, one might parody Quiche-Eaters as not <i>wanting</i> their ideas to suffer the indignity of becoming mature and practical.)",1243635988

78,632930,comment,632487.0,632848.0,0,0,russell,,,"> Unlike tobacco, which was traditionally defended by a coalition of libertarians and politicians from conservative tobacco-growing Southern states, pornography’s most prominent defenders in the public sphere — including its industry spokesmen —  associate themselves with the progressive wing of Democratic Party politics. It is hard to imagine Henry Waxman, for example — one of the most voracious elected officials in pursuit of the tobacco companies — adopting any similar animus toward Big Pornography. It is equally hard to imagine the Obama administration taking much of an interest in prosecuting obscenity — if indeed its members even believe that obscenity as such can exist. The recent ascension to the No. 2 slot in the Justice Department of a lawyer who in private practice had numerous times defended Playboy, Penthouse, the largest distributor of pornographic videos, and other pornographers just emphasizes the point.<p>is the paragraph that I based my innuendo comment on.  Fundamentally, most porn is protected as artistic expression, child porn excepted.  It's a fools errand to spend resources on prosecution that's going to be overturned.  That's probably the position of Waxman and Obama.<p>I admit that I read the article quickly, but more than skimming.  I thought the analogy was stretched, even she seemed to think so at times.  But at the end linking liberals, Democrats, feminists, and porn political contributors was just a bit silly.

This is an aggregated number. For Sweden's most prestigeous med school (Karolinska Institutet) the number is 3,6%, so it does vary a lot depending on the education.<p>There are very few programmes that don't have any requirements. However, if one doesn't have any good high school grade, the ""university entrance""-exam is a way in, or else professional experience. Hence, there are (again, depending on the education) a wider range of ages represented. However, 28% of all applicants are 19 years old. No one in my class is older than 25.<p>About universal and free, I'd say the system here is close to very good.
