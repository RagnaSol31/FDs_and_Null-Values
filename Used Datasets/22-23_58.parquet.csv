It was originally fairly simple and used the <i>Upgrade</i> header that was specified for exactly this sort of thing. Unfortunately, since nobody really used it before, broken implementations in proxies are widespread making it impossible to use without opening up security vulnerabilities.<p>Sure, <i>http-equiv</i> could be parsed out by the webserver or a proxy and transformed into real headers, but since none of them bothered to do that, the browsers parse them. The end result to the user is largely the same (just that you're unlikely to successfully get a 304). Expecting proxies to do anything intelligent is what's ""fundamentally incompatible"", not <i>http-equiv</i>.",1304549868.0

6,2515590,story,,,16,7,evanowens,My humble thoughts on the 10 minute YC interview process,,"i'd like to start out by saying that i have nothing but the utmost respect for y combinator and the people involved in it.  i wish like hell we would have been accepted into the summer 2011 program.<p>after 2 days of reflection i have a few humble thoughts, and i'm sure these were manifested because we were rejected:<p>1. the 10 minute interview process works for yc and they have their reasons for keeping it brief (probably because they had to do 170 of them this time and because 10 minutes is all they need to make their decision).  that being said, it seems to me that such a monumental decision (at least for the teams applying) would warrant a bit longer discussion.  there is a wide range of industries and business models that are represented, and i guess the question is: is it worth extending the interview 10 more minutes so that teams may expound on their ideas?  to me, the interview felt like chaos and before i knew it jessica was snapping our photo and we were whisked out of the room.<p>2. i know everyone tells you not to have a pitch ready and to listen to the questions and respond thoughtfully and this you should absolutely do.  however, i think that you should also have a list of 5-10 points that you simply have to get across and you find time to squeeze them into the interview, regardless if it's a total non sequitur.  i understand pg and co. are intellectual giants, but i find it hard to believe that they know the nuances of the very industry/business you've been deep into for months or years and there could potentially be a crucial piece of the puzzle they're missing that you need to convey.<p>3. mike tyson says everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.  well, we were punched in the face.  all you can do is internalize your yc experience and learn everything you can from it.  then you got to get up and keep on charging.  my grandpa always tells me that a) it's gunna be uphill all the way and b) you're gunna be just fine.<p>4. finally, i think there are only so many defining moments in our lives and it's up to us to capitalize.  that 10 minutes in the interview room is probably one of them, and maybe there's a damn good reason 10 minutes is all you get.  i wish you all the best of luck.",1304549832.0

I attended the 10th anniversary party, which I believe was in 2010.<p>- Microsoft didn't need to launch a Microsoft-branded 411 to collect utterances, for they had acquired Tellme and had many utterances coming in under their umbrella of services<p>- Tellme's bread and butter was speech recognition on the telephone and they are still in that space today, so Bing411, 1-800-555-TELL are still relevant for them.<p>I can also say that a lot of the speculation in the article about Microsoft's ""reaction"" is just wrong.

The revenues are going to be tied in with the amount of people looking for designers. As long as the stream of good customers does not dry out, the site will continue to do very well. At this point, how many customers are being brought in because of 37s? I don't know, but that would be something I'd have to get a better idea of before considering a purchase. I think SF has already gotten all the value from the 37s name that it can, or at least is close to that point. Early on, being a 37s product had tremendous SEO, linking, social news, etc. value. That stuff is already built into the product, so the 37s value is mostly limited to drawing in new customers.
