The developers are not that bright, the growing code base is not that awesome, and this is our worst enemy.",1228517984

3,387631,comment,387623.0,387623.0,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Just a suggestion: Consider instead framing it as giving a  <i>discount</i> to people who use a newer web browser, since ""they didn't require the extra work supporting older, buggy web browsers does"" (or similar phrasing). It makes the same point, but <i>may</i> be less likely to make potential customers resentful.<p>Either way, you'll probably want to run this by a bunch of actual customers. People with the sort of personality quirks that draw them to (and make them good at) programming might respond to this very differently than customers/clients at large. Also, note that some people will not be allowed to change web browsers, e.g. for administrative reasons. (Whether or not they're good reasons is beyond your control.)<p>I don't know if it's a good idea <i>from a business standpoint</i>, but I like it.",1228517502

How in the world did you get 57%?!<p>The real probability based on the article (according to my calculations) is 34.4%, which is actually much better than I would have guessed.<p>Here is how I came up with that.<p>The article states a first time entrepreneur succeeds at an 18% rate.  And someone succeeds at a 20% rate given they failed the first time.<p>P(First Time Success) = .18<p>P(First Time Failure) = .82<p>P(Success | First Time Failure) = .20<p>P(Second Time Success) = P(Success | First Time Failure) x P(First Time Failure) + P(First Time Success)<p>0.344 = .18 + (.82 * .20)<p>In words:  18 percent of entrepreneurs will succeed on their first try.  82 percent will fail.  Of that 82 percent that failed, if they try again, they will succeed 20 percent of the time.  To get a number from the original population of first time attempts you have to multiply the 82 percent who failed by the 20 percent who succeeded on the second try which results in 16.4%.  That 16.4% is the percentage of the original population who tried on the first try but did not succeed until the second try.  The end result being 34.4% of the original population will be successful on their first <i>or</i> second try.<p>Hopefully that makes sense.<p>* edit to format the formulas a little better",1228517422

For our pay web services, we're debating including an IE6 surcharge.<p>While we'd love to drop IE6 completely, it feels crazy to do so while it's still 20% of visits. But there is definitely a lot of extra development time needed to keep things working for older browsers.<p>In both cases, we'd make it 100% clear why they saw more ads and paid more, with instructions on how to upgrade.<p>If everyone did such a thing, maybe we'd see the financial/annoyance incentive lead them in the right direction to browsers that don't cost as much to support.<p>It's been a long week, so this may be a bit crazy, but I thought I'd get some discussion going as Friday comes to a close.",1228517108

Seeing class hierarchy trees with one click, jumping to view the source of a method I'm using, remote debugging totally integrated with my source code, etc... is all really valuable.<p>Sure, drag-and-dropping everything in some IDEs means you're missing a lot of the core stuff in programming, but at least for me, I am more productive using Eclipse than I was using Emacs and the shell.",1228516294

Yes, if you are talking about kids straight out of college living in a dorm. What about slightly less desirable older people, like say 30-year old (now, that's old :-). So a startup with 3 founders would need closer to $15,000/month of revenue.
