(1) It doesn't take into account financial aid (e.g., the average actual price paid by students), and merely reflects the sticker price. This likely means that the top schools, which are quite generous with their financial aid, are being undervalued... BUT (2) On the other hand, it has no ability to disentangle correlation from causation. Viz, perhaps those who got into those colleges would have done quite well even had they decided not to apply there. This ""study"" has no ability to answer that question, and therefore has no real ability to evaluate ROI - the main thing they claim to have evaluated.<p>Don't get me wrong, these numbers are fascinating, but the claims made in the article about what these numbers demonstrate are completely fallacious.",1277938755.0

YC sets up C corps so they can easily issue shares to VC. They would probably retain the cash as a part of the agreements with the VC to spend on growing the business. If that's not your plan, then alternative organization might make sense and will eliminate some of your tax fears. Also, if you have more of a lifestyle type business, then distributions would make sense. Do you start to see how the intent and details change the advice? Talking to someone when you are setting something new up or having a major change makes sense. That said, don't worry too much about the taxes. If you are so worried about not giving the government a cut that you don't make money, then you lost the point. What is it specifically that you want to know here?

Even if the product itself was doomed to be a failure the timing is really suspicious. Why not just ignore the Kin for the next few months and quietly kill it only when WM7 is on the market?

You can fool yourself into thinking getting that 1% will be easy.  Depending on the product, the sales channel is different.  Focus on how many customers you can get to the top of your sales funnel. You loose a certain % of customers along the funnel and you end up with a certain number of paying customers.  Even if the market is 5 million people, if you only get 100 in your sales funnel, then that is an issue.<p>If you are going with Adwords, there are pretty standard conversion rates you can follow to figure out how many customers you need to look at your product in order to earn X dollars a month.<p>If you have expensive product that requires a salesperson, then find out how many deals can get done in a day/month/year.

Or, it's an interesting concept poorly thought out and implemented.<p>You get ""a point"" for having a significant other or a serious relationship?

Maybe make 30 the baseline there, but really that whole calculation is just off.  When I'm hiring someone at a startup I tend to cringe at the 25-and-under crowd with startup stars in their eyes and no experience.  THEY are drag on the organization because the majority of them don't know how to work independently and don't know what the company is supposed to look like in 5 years, so they lack a lot of vision and understanding (sorry if this offends anyone reading this, but I've always advocated that people get some real-company experience BEFORE joining a startup).<p>I can see how the kids thing might cramp things a bit (in theory I guess, I don't have any kids, so no real experience there).<p>I also wouldn't recommend that someone rush into their next venture after something else winds down or blows up (as the author of this article did).

Here in Dallas, Texas, not many people want to jump into startups straight away. \nIn my case, the problem was also not so well defined, and there's not too many people working on this.

Gives me some level of confidence that it's not too late.\nAlso, hearing all these stats about younger guys doing it and succeeding, Zuck and the likes, doesn't boost confidence  either.

As far as actually quantifying it though, there's several methods.<p>I personally think the easiest traditional way of doing it is called the break down method. This involves taking a total population, and then applying various percentages to whittle that number down until you got your target market. To illustrate, lets say you're selling an iPod hookup for cars. You're targeting US only so you have the total population <i>n</i>. You also know that x% of people drive cars and that y% of people own an iPod. To get your market size you multiply <i>n</i> by x and y--voila.<p>A less traditional way of doing all of this involves a little facebook hack I've been tinkering with. If you go through the process of creating an ad on their network, it will give you the number of users for the various filters you place on it (you can specify your demographic by location, age, sex, keywords, education etc etc). In certain areas of the world the % of people on Facebook is so high that you can basically use this figure as a solid estimation.
