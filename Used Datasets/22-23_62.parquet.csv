Do you think that is likely?<p>Perhaps somebody could list out all of the YC philosophies of acceptance, and every type of generic e-mail that wouldn't make sense to send; then we could use deduction to solve this mystery of no stratified rejection e-mails.<p>All I set out to do was test the hypothesis:  <i>Were there different rejection letters sent</i>, because it seems pretty reasonable that there would be.  Maybe some letters would contain feedback, albeit generic?  After all, they need to make a conscientious decision to accept/deny, why not have a few reasons for denying?  I even proposed a method to test out this hypothesis.<p>Thank you to everyone who did the MD5 to verify that there was only 1 type of e-mail sent.  That's what I was looking for.<p>But when I get in return, and not just on this thread, are people talking about the YC acceptance process as if they are part of YC, or (in this case) paraphrasing the fucking rejection letter or YC application notes, I find that to be really annoying.

This figure, which was based on actual bids for new reactors in the United States, caused considerable sticker shock.<p>Current prices for nuclear reactors shot up extremely over the past 5 years.

At my day job, I do one off scripts, plus the occasional prototype. I do however work on a number of side projects, mostly in Ruby, where I try out the latest practices: TDD, BDD, etc.<p>I base my statement on my own perception of my abilities, and I certainly don't attribute it fully to my not using a debugger anymore. I've learned a lot, and gained experience. That experience enables me to solve problems more quickly, as it's much more likely that I've seen an error (or something like it) before. I've had more exposure to good code, both internally as well as many of the open source projects that I've looked at. Seeing how other people solve problems also makes you a better programmer. I've also seen a lot more bad code, and thus know which things to avoid.<p>My opinion on debuggers is also subjective. I just know that when I used one in the past, it tended to cause problems (though I didn't realize it at the time). You set a breakpoint, step through some things, find a problem and fix it. But this doesn't generally lead to an understanding of what caused the problem (simple logic errors aside), and in fact can insulate you from larger design issues that need to be addressed. You fix a bug here, modify a line of code there, without taking a step back and looking at what the code is doing, and whether or not it needs to be refactored.<p>This isn't to say that you can't do those things with a debugger. My point is that debuggers seem to enable certain bad habits, while skipping the debugger and relying on analysis, unit tests, and debug statements seems to encourage some good practices.<p>All I can say is give it a try - next time you want to reach for the debugger, write a unit test to recreate your problem, and use some debug statements to try and solve it. If it works for you, great. If not, go back to the debugger. YMMV.",1239141611.0

Avoiding credit wasn't something my parents did, though they never abused it or amassed huge amounts of debt, and could always pay everything off (I didn't know or care about this at the time).<p>The thing my parents gave me was a longing for independence, success, and the knowledge that if there is ever something I need to learn, nothing stops me from learning it.<p>Sometimes, no matter which route a person chooses, they will succeed just because of their willpower, hardwork, sacrifice and perseverance.<p>Consequently I think money is wasted on studies like this, each individual finds their own path to success, even if similar.",1239141606.0
