3,1199892,comment,1199808.0,1199808.0,0,0,lmkg,,,"There are a couple of subtle pieces lurking just under the surface of this post, but diving into them requires a lot of time and words, so I don't mind them not being included. For example, proofs by contradiction require the Law of the Excluded Middle[1], which some reject. You could go into this for pages and pages, and it's very interesting, but it's also a complete tangent.<p>However, there's one important part that I think deserves some more depth. One of the main points driving the logic on display here is that the mathematical concept of ""implies"" is different than the normal one, because in logic ""A -> B"" does not suggest any sort of relationship between A and B. The sentence ""My name is Fred, and that implies water is wet"" is a true statement in logic, but most non-logicians would consider the statement false because there's no causative relationship. A logic definition of implication is more like ""there is no possible universe in which A is true and B is false,"" which can be satisfied by A being false (or B being true) in all universes, regardless of what B (or A) happens to be and what A and B have to do with each other.<p>It's possible to see this as the crux of most arithmetic paradoxes. If you can slip in a false hypotheses, you can imply any conclusion, no matter how false it may be. All that's required is some sleight-of-hand so that you don't notice when the false axiom is being invoked. A common trick is dividing by an expression that evaluates to zero, without evaluating the expression.<p>For related shenanigans, check out the Principle of Explosion: a single logical inconsistency suffices to prove all statements, including their negations.<p>On an unrelated note, talking about the logical implication operator is difficult because you have to be careful not to use the word ""implies."" Good fun!<p>[1] ""A or ~A"", or equivalently, ""~~A -> A"" for all logical propositions A.",1268866715.0

6,1199889,comment,1199472.0,1199472.0,0,0,anonjon,,,"I don't know why the study paints this as being a strange outcome. This outcome makes sense to me intuitively. Perhaps because we confuse momentary happiness (having fun!) with prolonged mental wellbeing. They are somewhat related to each other, but are not a causal or necessarily even a correlative relationship.<p>I've never really understood the point of smalltalk (beyond social things where you don't really know anyone). If I'm going to be having a conversation, I like it to be about something. I think having a meaningful conversation signifies that you are actually interested in the other person and interested in knowing what they think. If you think about it from that perspective, that you are actually making deep interpersonal relationships with the people around you, of course you will be happier. The person making smalltalk with a hundred people is someone who is still lonely in some aspect of the term.<p>It also makes sense in that discussing and thinking about 'deep' issues, you are becoming more knowledgeable about yourself. People who know more about themselves are going to be better able to please themselves (fill their lives with things that make them happy), because they actually know what they like (and what they are like).<p>Substantive conversations make for a substantive lives. And substantive lives are more enjoyable than empty ones.<p>This study is sort of just be rediscovering the Platonic theory of pleasure. (Sensual, Esthetic, and Ideal pleasures).<p>Moral of the story, read Plato (talk about it), be happy.",1268866643.0

The 1930s witnessed a return to Victorian conservatism.<p>Examples:<p>Women's suffrage movement continues to make gains as women obtain full voting rights in the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1906, New Zealand in 1909, Denmark in 1915, in the United States in 1920, and in the United Kingdom in 1918 (women over 30) and in 1928 (full enfranchisement); and women begin to enter the workplace in larger numbers.

That's why antibiotics work, because while different, all bacterial cells are alike. And antibiotics only attack bacterias, not normal cells.<p>With viruses it's different ... you can't attack viruses with a generic mechanism.<p>The only hope you have to treat a virus / stop it's reproduction is to identify a signature in its proteins, and target that. Vaccines are the most efficient because they give your immune system a heads-up, but once you caught it the only hope you have is for your immune system to fight back.<p>Computer viruses are pretty much alike ... you can't have a generic method for fighting back. You can only develop a specific treatment for a specific virus, otherwise you'll be in the same league as cancer treatment ... targeting cancerous cells efficiently, but doing enough of a damage in normal cells that your internal organs start failing (with a direct analogy being the loss of data).<p>Personally I never install anti-viruses.

Sure - sometimes it works and you can do a lot of crazy stuff with a software PBX; in reality you want it to be up 24/7 and ensuring the quality of pstn termination, local network and configuration of such setup is at least one additional full-time job for the first couple of months. In reality if you have a problem with some ""prepared"" solution like freepbx / trixbox / whatever and have no support contract, you're left on your own with a system you don't understand and with no telephony - not a good option. Unless you need some very special functionality, just pay for the service. Do not be fooled by ""simplicity"" of solutions like trixbox - if something doesn't work, you still have to learn the whole stack to know how to fix it.<p>Solutions like grasshopper are cool and that's the kind of service I'd recommend. What you should look for is: how do they handle faxes (only T.38 is reliable), can you setup a divert number (like a mobile) for situations when your network is down, how much will it cost to get additional internal and external numbers. Bonus point - do they support wideband codecs? It might seem stupid, but the quality difference is amazing (only for internal calls).<p>If you're an MS-based shop, you might want to look at hosted OCS offers. Phones supporting it are a bit more expensive, but the ability to integrate with your emails, calendar, voicemail, etc. over the phone is really cool if you travel a lot. If you have a high volume of calls, you might also look for solutions that provide reception with a virtual switchboard apps - they're a bit more comfortable for a lot of call transfers than looking up numbers.",1268863988.0

I think each business needs to evaluate what's right for them.<p>For example, in the setup I described in my other comment, the business wanted to move away from a Lucent/Avaya Partner system they had been using for over a decade. They had 3 lines and about 15 extensions and were somewhat happy with it. The system for many years had, as you say, the ""maintenance overhead of a desk lamp"" but it was starting to drop voicemails randomly, the phones sucked, adding more lines meant buying one of those extension modules, etc. Plus the building was being renovated and running just CAT6 everywhere instead of separate ethernet and phone lines was very appealing.<p>Buying an inexpensive Dell rack server, Polycom phones, and a couple Linksys analog gateways was much cheaper than the initial investment they spent a decade ago. Since they kept the analog lines, which are useful for fax machines and security systems, there was no need to really worry about QoS initially since internal network bandwidth was plentiful. This alone fixed the problems of the aging system and they got voicemails and faxes delivered via email, shared directories browsable directly from phones, proper call parking, and a ton of other small features.<p>The cost benefit came when we added an external VOIP provider later. Now they could have unlimited simultaneous inbound and outbound calls for a single DID/caller ID and just pay a flat-rate per minute. At their usage, this came out much cheaper (4x) than the deals negotiated with Verizon locally. And the concept of individual lines that could be busy just melted away. The system is still configured to fallback on the couple analog lines if the internet goes out, but the rate plans have been reduced to the bare minimum so that incoming calls stay free.<p>EDIT: Almost forgot, another key benefit of a software switch is the easy integration it allows with your backend apps. For our internal rails-based order processing app, I implemented dial-on-click (ala Google Voice) and call history logs for all our vendors and customers (see librevox and mod_xml_cdr for FreeSwitch if you want to do something similar) in a day.<p>But viraptor is right, ensuring all the fallbacks work correctly and are tested takes time, and it might not be the wisest way to spend time if you don't understand what you're getting into.",1268863818.0

Heck, on Wall Street the 1920s was a decade of greed and moral decrepitude (if you get into that sort of name calling) that is possibly only rivalled by the 1980s. Go back 30 years, and you are squarely in the 'Gilded Age', where the Senate was completely controlled by large companies (to the point where the companies simply picked candidates and ushered them through state legislatures, because Senators weren't popularly elected yet). After that came the Progressive years, where we learned that our meat was lethal and other things, and women finally got treated like human beings. How could any of those decades be considered better than the current one? Sure, women's suffrage was a great accomplishment, but only because the reality to that point was so bad.<p>My brother has a saying... ""progress, not perfection"". American history has been exactly that. Sure, there are temporary setbacks (no one can argue the 1930s were better than the 1920s really), and there are local setbacks (1980s Detroit?) but the overall story is progress. Thankfully the small victories accumulate faster than the setbacks, leaving us with a better society all the time.<p>I guess if we need the jeremiad to motivate us to make progress, then that is fine. I was simply commenting that it's disingenuous to pretend that it's somehow different this time. If it really were different, you wouldn't be sitting around musing about it, you'd be dealing with a collapsing society.<p>But I guess if you realize that, the jeremiad loses it's power, so maybe it's better we keep pretending that things are going to hell.",1268863218.0
