It is about the same as the new ""unsubsidized"" price for phone+data.  If I buy this phone, I will pay about $20 more per month for service and will be locked into paying it for two years.  This is still less than the price of the unsubsidized phone, of course, but I am still kinda annoyed that phone service keeps getting more expensive and only gradually getting faster and more widespread, despite all other kinds of tech getting cheaper and faster.",1262732338.0

Thus, prices won't trend towards the marginal cost.  They'll stay high.<p>That's a long winded way of saying: if carriers (and handset makers) didn't have a massive chubby for long term contracts, prices on handsets would be much, much lower.

As a shareholder in AMZN, you don't even get dividends.
