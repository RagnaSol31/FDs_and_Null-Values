When I was trying to build up a habit of going to the gym every day after work, there would often be a part of my mind saying things like <i>I'm too tired</i>, <i>I won't be able to get a machine</i>, or <i>I have more important ways to spend the next hour</i>.<p>When this happens, I've started to develop a habit where another part of my brain keeps ""yelling"" <i>just get off your ass and go</i>, and listen to that one.

And the more you use it, the better you are at it.<p>So, in the case of trying to commit yourself to new goals, first decide on a goal. Then decide when you want to apply time to the goal. And then, most importantly, when you're not working on your goal, use mind control to not negatively think about the goal and the efforts involved to accomplish that goal.<p>Here's a dumb example, but it can be applied to many cases. Unloading the dishwasher. If, ahead of time, you think about the steps that you're going to have to take to unload the dishwasher, you won't do it. But if you use mind control, and don't think about the steps it's going to take to unload the dishwasher, but just think about the fact you need to unload the dishwasher, you will do it.<p>In other words, procrastinators over think things, to the point they overwhelm themselves. But you have to constantly use mind control, and understand that the more you use it, the easier it is to use.<p>I used to be a huge procrastinator, but using mind control, I've literally transformed myself into a person that can't stop working.

36,702653,comment,702613.0,702613.0,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Joseph Needham did gather a lot of interesting source material from ancient Chinese literature on developments in science and technology in China. I studied Chinese and sinology as his lengthy book series was published, and have read many hundreds of pages of his books. The general view of the historians of China whom I know best is that Needham did a fair amount of axe-grinding with his primary sources to prove ideological points and bolster his theory of history that other historical sources would not support. The primary historical literature in Chinese (literary Chinese) is VAST--the usual statement is that ancient Chinese literature outnumbers all other ancient literature from all other world cultures combined in word count by a considerable margin.<p>What I find most disappointing in Needham's work is his too Marxist explanation for what historians of technology think is what is most remarkable about the historical comparison between China and the West. Until the late Western middle ages, China was plainly ahead of the West in technology, and arguably very much ahead in science. Historians of technology refer to the West in those days as having ""precocious technology"" that couldn't be explained at all by Western science of that day. But as the Western middle ages gave way to the Renaissance, there was an explosive growth of science in the West, and ever since the West has been ahead of China in both science and technology, for reasons that I don't think Needham explains adequately. And of course the development of political freedom in the West in the same period has very much been world-leading all that while.",1247524693.0

If you can plausibly link to several different libraries, not all of which are GPL, you don't.  So when readline was alone in the world, everything that used it had to be GPL.  The BSD folks wrote editline specifically to avoid this--initially, editline was extremely lame compared to readline and I think might still be, but because the API was equivalent they could say ""We're BSD licensed through and through; use our code for anything you want"" and still have a non-horrible CLI and yet at link time decide to use the good library.<p>I think the reason this works legally, although I'm not a lawyer, is because yes, when you link your program with readline that executable cannot be distributed except under the terms of the GPL.  Because you have multiple potential targets for this sort of thing, nobody can argue that you are trying to technically evade the requirements.<p>But apparently this is still contentious.",1247523082.0
