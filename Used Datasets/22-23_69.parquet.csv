They probably know there's no future in stripping in Moscow, but I would guess they think everybody in New York shops on Fifth Avenue, and if sex gets them that, what's the harm?<p>I think you're sadly underestimating how shocked Eastern Europeans can be when confronted with the reality of America.  <i>Especially</i> 18-year-olds.  And even if they ""knew what they were getting into"" in terms of there being sex, that <i>still</i> doesn't touch what human trafficking is about, which is a slow and steady process of degradation.  They'd give up their passports, they'd never see actual money, and the first hit of crack or heroin is always free at some rich guy's party - but pretty soon, it's not free, they're increasingly in debt, they feel trapped (and <i>are</i> trapped) and they think there's nobody in hell who will help an ugly, crack-addicted, no-longer-so-pretty woman.<p>So either you think Russians, or non-Americans, or whoever, ""know what they're getting into"" in that situation, and it's just fine, or you haven't thought it through.  I'm banking on the latter.<p>This is not a question of human intelligence.  We've all gotten into situations where a flashy fast talker got us into something that trapped us - ever had a cubicle job with a software consulting shop?  Our monkey brains <i>always</i> fall for that crap, which is why this particular story was so heartening - somebody actually stopped it before it started, and that's fantastic.<p>As I said earlier, Bingo's attitude was half humorous, half assholery - I wish he'd stopped at just the humorous half.  Sure, maybe this particular nightclub with sex ads where a mysterious guy wanted two 18-year-olds without much English to meet him at midnight for an interview after another job ""fell through"" and they were in another city <i>wasn't</i> a human trafficking situation.  Given the preponderance of flashing red flags, though, I'm damn happy we didn't give this benefactor the benefit of the doubt, even if the club itself had lots of prosperous young people attending.",1275086967.0

Here's how it would work:<p>1) Visit Diaspora.com<p>2) Install dropbox-style client.<p>3) ""Connect"" with your friends by facebook, twitter, google, oauth, email, etc.<p>4) Diaspora.com then shows all your friends files. Click ""Download"" to sync any file you want into your Diaspora folder. Any files you put in the ""Diaspora"" folder are shared with your friends.<p>5) Growl notification when a transfer completes-- open it from your Diaspora folder or play the media in-browser with the embedded VLC browser plugin.<p><i>Key Issues</i><p>* The UI would be stupidly simple-- everything happens in the browser<p>* No central index. All indexes are transparently synced P2P when both users are online.<p>* It's viral - any files you download into Diaspora folder are automatically shared with others by default.<p>* Privacy options let you limit bandwidth, restrict your friend list, etc.<p>* Embedded Web Server -- Diaspora.com would still be available offline.<p>* Embedded VLC Player -- Click ""Play"" to play media in-browser.<p>There are lots of legitimate purposes for the software. It's a like a free dropbox-- but with no central index it seems impossible to stop. The most exciting thing is that lots of normal people are now running the auto-updating ""Diaspora Personal Server"" and they don't even know it-- because it just works.",1275085413.0
