Anyone who's depressed really needs to try this out, with or without the aid of anti-depressants.<p>The thesis is that you, at least in part, make yourself depressed by telling yourself depressing things that are largely false, about yourself, about what others are saying and doing to/about to you, etc.; in general, incorrect filtering of what you perceive.<p>So you identify those things and do you best to correct your mis-perceptions.

If you know enough people in your selected field, it is usually not that bad. However, if you want to change careers, move to a new area, or are generally not interested in networking for networking's sake, finding a job is a soul-sucking misadventure.<p>Monster/CareerBuilder sites are absolute crap, especially for IT-related jobs. Indeed, Dice, and Jobing aren't that great either. The Web 2.0 job-hunt startups are just mashups of existing job sites so while the interface is cool, the content is no better. Most of the jobs have no mention of salary, benefits, or the social/managerial environment. Recruiters / headhunters are only interested in you if you are a potential fit for a specific job. The moment that job gets filled, you're back to square one.<p>I've actually been more on the other side of the job hunt i.e. finding people to hire. The problem there is that the good/quality coders are just impossible to find. Most of the resumes I come across are people who taught themselves Active Directory and are applying for ERP-coding jobs. I've looked at ""superstar"" job hunt sites like jobs.joel and jobs.37signals but there's barely any traction in my area (Tampa, Florida).<p>Surprisingly, Craigslist has been the best choice for me as a former applicant and as someone looking to hire. Craigslist is very blunt, direct, and accessible. The last part is the key here. You don't have to sign up for 10 services to place a job ad on Craigslist. As a result, I've found many more job offers on Craigslist that end up in an interview than other sites. I know with near certainty that someone is actually reading my email when I reply to a Craigslist post. I feel my email ends up in a large junk folder when I apply on other sites. Similarly, whenever I've posted an ad on Craigslist for a job, I've received direct emails from candidates and some of them have been pretty good.<p>I don't know how this system could be fixed.

Most of these postings feel like black holes.  You submit something and (typically) never hear back.<p>Maybe an improvement to your idea is some carrot/stick mechanism, that at the very least, incentives both parties to stick to good behavior (timely submissions of RELEVANT resume / cover letters and timely responses from the companies that listed the original posting).

Well, thats because someone already took it.""<p>The point was a generalization of the fact that in a free market, arb opportunities don't exist because market inefficiencies are corrected in real-time.<p>Thats not always true, but the general point is.<p>The problem with finding good jobs on Monster, CL, etc. is that, more or less, there aren't any.  Good jobs fill fast, most often through backdoor channels - networking, campus recruiting, etc.<p>The jobs that flow down to sites like Monster and CL are those that smart, skillfull people don't want.<p>Think about it from your own perspective.  If you wanted to hire someone for a job, chances are you would turn to your circle of friends and trusted advisors and ask them if they knew anyone.  You branch out from there like a ripple, with each ring being less focused and more general, until you hit mass market sites likes Monster.<p>I think this is why the majority of jobs on these sites are usually low-paying admin type work or one-off small business contractual work.<p>LinkedIn attempts to solve for this, but they I don't think they have a direct enough of a mechanism for doing so.<p>Other sites fail too because most operate under the assumption that they can do better by improving usability and don't really address the underlying problems, so they suffer from the same issues (namely no good work).<p>The sites that I think do a better job are those that are niche industry focused.  Niche sites help job seekers find relevant (to them) jobs and job posters find relevant hires to fill those positions.  This helps both parties filter down, which I think is their value-add.<p>Ultimately whatever improvement that hopes to be successful needs to focus on ways to either change or divert the current way most employers find employees - word of mouth and personal networks.<p>Perhaps better mining tools for LinkedIN would solve.  I think some functionality that lists job seekers by skill (profile, resume) weighted by in-network relationships may help.<p>Another idea is scaling the head-hunter model for public consumption.  Something where as a job poster, I could send a request out to my network on linkedin, and there would be some sort of incentive (money or otherwise) for those in my network to recommend people the know.  There is already natural incentive to do so... having a solid network is a good skill to have by itself; knowing good people says good things about the type of person you are.<p>Just some thoughts.

Linux can't even play full screen HD Hulu on an ATI 4850 video card without stuttering. While we're on the subject, audio is in just as sad a state. I've been trying to use Linux for prosumer level audio recording for a dozen years, about once a year, and every single time I've gone wimpering back to Windows for audio work. So, yeah, the state of multimedia on Linux, while dramatically better than its ever been, is still embarrassingly bad.<p>So, yeah, I probably wouldn't want to be the developer tasked with making Unity work on Linux (even a very limited subset, like ""just nVidia and ATI provided drivers""), as it would probably suck. The guys at id software managed to do high end 3D gaming on Linux in the past, but they also complained loudly and frequently about the state of things.<p>I wasn't suggesting I blame the Unity folks for not supporting Linux. Just saying that developers like Linux. Unity likes developers. Maybe they could hookup sometime. But, it might be more trouble than it's worth for them, and I'd understand that, too (it's why we don't have an installer for Mac OS X for Virtualmin, despite the fact that more than a handful of our users like having a development environment on their Mac at home that is similar to their Linux server).
