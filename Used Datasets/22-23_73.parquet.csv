29,2550975,story,,,29,36,uneasyearlyhire,Ask HN: At what point does being a loyal early hire become a poor choice?,,"I need advice weighing the benefits of being loyal through the struggles of an early-stage startup vs the importance of looking out for my career.  In other words, at what point does loyalty become stupid?<p>I am the first official (non-contract, non-founder) employee of an early-stage startup.  I was originally hired as a contractor to do some small jobs for the company, when one of the two technical co-founders left, I was bumped up to programmer lead, at which point, was offered a full-time position as an employee.  At this point I floated my resume to a few big name silicon valley companies to see what my prospects were in the hiring world.  I got a few interviews that didn't go anywhere so I accepted the job.  The job has been a huge opportunity for professional growth as I have had to become an expert on our full stack technologies from deployment and databases to client-side web technologies and my original plan was to stick with this company for a few years to build up my skills and experience.<p>However, there have been a number of warning signs which make me somewhat worried about staying here long term:<p>- As I've talked to other developers outside the company, I think I was taken advantage of in my compensation package (significantly lower salary than median entry level for most tech companies, no equity, and no benefits, though these have been promised to me 'as soon as we are profitable').<p>- Despite my position as lead programmer, I feel quite cut-off from the business side of the company and this divide between the business and technical sides of the company seems to go all the way up to the technical CTO and CEO.  I have no idea who our clients are, what our funding is like, what our income is like or what our business goals are (aside from vague descriptions).  Basically I get feature request and bug reports and commit them.<p>- This is partly because we are distributed across North America and do all our work remotely.  This wasn't an issue when I was contracting but has increasingly become an issue.  Furthermore, I am finding working alone to be extremely stifling.  It's lonely and I have no mentors to go to when I run into issues and I repeatedly find myself re-discovering best practices the hard way (doing it wrong before discovering the right way).<p>- Also, our development roadmap continues to be pushed back.  We were originally supposed to be live this time last year and a year later we are just barely beginning to meet those development goals.  This makes me wonder if we'll ever reach that magical 'profitable' status that will get me finally able to have some benefits.<p>I realize that working for a startup is a wild roller coaster and that success means sticking it through.  However, I also do not want to find myself loyally sticking with a sinking ship, to the detriment of my career and bank account.<p>(Edit: formatting)",1305499404.0

Try to be a little more empathetic to good businesses by honest, hardworking people whose sustainability depends on search discovery. Notice that I didn't say <i>google</i> search discovery. It just happens that google is the monopoly search engine, but if they weren't there, people would search with other engines.<p>Almost all companies are not open about the things they consider their competitive advantage. Google likes to promote themselves as an ""open"" company, but notice that their openness is almost always to support strategic decisions that commoditize their complements. Their business, the way they make money, is advertising from web search. And they are just as fanatically restrictive about anything they fear jeopardizes that segment's profitability as, say, Apple is restrictive about curating the app store.<p>I personally know a couple who had a thriving business for several years, then lost their home one season when their google rankings went south. Nothing they could do, they were doing the same things as in the past, but that was it.<p>What really chaps my hide in particular is that Google doesn't allow folks to track their rankings in anywhere near the accuracy or detail that they need to effectively manage their business. Its rationalizations for doing so are incredibly silly and deceptive: Just build a good website with plenty of content and we'll take care of the rest. What patriarchal and self-serving nonsense. Is there some reason to believe that google is infallible? Or even very close to infallible? Sites continue to successfully use paid links, sites continue to steal content and outrank the sources, and etc. Knowing your site's ranking data is obviously just as important a metric as any other a business might need to help them make decisions. No one says, ""Well, just create a good business with great products. You don't need to keep financial books and really watch your cash flow too carefully, it'll just take care of itself."" What tosh.<p>The hell of it is that google is well known for its fanatical approach to decision making through data, even to the point of dumb extremes. Yet, hypocritically, they don't allow business who depend on its monopoly of web search to obtain the data they need.<p>The concessions they do make, like webmaster tools, are poor and ineffective and feel like they were designed more to serve google's interests than webmasters. Their web search api turns out to be incredibly restrictive. If you talk to them directly to try to arrange something, there are even more unpublished (I believe, at least I couldn't find them anywhere) and incredible restrictions making it inviable for almost anyone. Remands me of that asmartbear.com article the other day where he recommended that, if you really don't want to do something, still offer it, but at such fantastic terms for yourself that you would be glad to do it. Google offers a search api only to say they do.<p>A hard-hearted response would be, ""well, you shouldn't build a business on such an ephemeral platform as search discovery."" Really? How about we have a world where there's a little more competition so we don't have to rely on the vagaries of one company? Wouldn't it be a better world if we could rely on the stability of our search platform if we continued to use the same strategies and put in the same effort we had before?",1305498452.0

Checks and balances are not essential democratic features following your definition  they are more in the rule of law camp  but it strikes me as wrong to claim that they contradict democratic principles. You point about wolves concerns protection of minorities and checks and balances certainly dont do that.
