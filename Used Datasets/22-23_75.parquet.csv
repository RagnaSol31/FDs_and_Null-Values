Obviously if the bank abandons the home, the homeowner can legitimately live there.<p>As for fixing the roof simply because it makes the home uninhabitable, I don't buy it.

Or instead of moving out, you could just put a bucket under the leak and move your bed, on the theory that you'll probably be kicked out before the leak gets that much worse.<p>Regarding mark to market accounting, my understanding is that a mortgage is treated as a ""held to maturity"" asset, while a defaulted home is treated as an ""available for sale"" asset and must be marked to the market. Thus, the bank must mark the loss only when the home is foreclosed on (not sure when in the process this rule kicks in).<p>And yes, it benefits banks at the expense of investors.

One of the nation's top patent lawyers (a ""top earner"" at Kirkland & Ellis - one of the nation's most prestigious firms - who served for the past 6 years on its management committee) walks away from his position in order to capitalize on buying a patent portfolio from Micron, setting up a holding company for those patents, and positioning himself in his own boutique firm to use that portfolio (we assume) either to file a multitude of infringement actions or to exact royalties on threat of legal action - vividly underscoring what is wrong with a patent system that hugely rewards ""non-practicing entities"" that specialize in litigation far more than in any form of true inventing.<p>2. A patent system that so skews money incentives that the best and the brightest (and, yes, by all accounts, Mr. Desmarais is a highly likable and much admired and talented fellow) would be drawn to the seamy side of this business in this way.<p>3. What this illustrates about how a patent nightmare scenario can so easily arise from the fall or decline of a traditional tech company. Here, it was Micron. What happens, then, when Novell auctions its IP assets to private equity firms who in turn parcel them out to firms such as this? Developments such as this can raise significant threats for Linux and the open source community, among others (see the write-up here on this issue: <a href=""http://url4.eu/3p37m"" rel=""nofollow"">http://url4.eu/3p37m</a> - ""Novell auction could be patent troll bonanza"").<p>4. How easy it would be for Congress to make simple modifications to the patent laws so as to preclude this type of trolling, as for example by imposing a simple test that an invention be truly ""useful"" (and not merely theoretically so) before qualifying for patentability (see a recent proposal to this effect here: <a href=""http://ip.jotwell.com/patent-utility-reduxit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ip.jotwell.com/patent-utility-reduxit/</a>).<p>5. How patent drafting in large corporations can become as much a function of the legal department as of legitimate engineers who are actually inventing things.<p>6. How this sort of activity does not promote inventions or the useful arts in the slightest and yet characterizes so much of the day-to-day activity in the patent world.<p>Patents generally have had a useful role in our society, whatever their limitations, but this side of the business basically makes one want to scream.",1275431667

Draw Luck and Iterate?<p>Here are the actual keys to Twitter's success:<p>1. Simplicity - get updates from your people you are interested, and maybe let everyone else know what you are doing too. Lots of successful companies start with simple descriptions like this. Google was just about SEARCH, Facebook was just a digital contact book, etc. Twitter is surprising in that they have kept it so simple for so long and still seen growth.<p>2. Asymmetric Relationships - you can follow me, but I don't have to follow you. Made the service great for celebrities, which in turn brought more people onto the service. This is a big difference between it and Facebook, who had to invent ""pages"" and ""fans"" to be able to support the same thing.<p>3. The API - twitter.com is all fine and good, but the open API meant anyone can make great 3rd party apps. That twitter was so open with their data was rather novel.

It's been my experience that even miniDV cameras and digital audio recorders can have significant variations in their recording speed over time, which would have to be detected and corrected in order for this technique to work.  I once tried to use a laptop with a USB audio interface to record audio and a DV camera for video, but could never sync up the audio and video because the video rate was fluctuating up and down.  If I synced up the beginning and end of a clip, the middle would be off by up to half a second.<p>Though there are techniques to detect and compensate for these variations (some of which were used to restore the wire recordings of Woody Guthrie released as The Live Wire), I'm not convinced the minute variations in the mains supply would survive.<p>Possible countermeasure: narrow notch filters on every harmonic of the mains frequency plus a high-pass filter, or adaptive noise filtering (such as used by noise reduction audio plugins).  Get those hums down into the single-bit levels and you'd need a huge sample size to extract any useful signal.<p>Any statisticians want to comment on how much data would be required to conclusively identify time, place, and edits?<p>Edit: another question: could it be possible to detect sample rate jitter caused by periodic variations in the voltage supplied to the sample rate clock generator, even after the noise is filtered out?  Could it be counteracted by randomly resampling sections of the audio up or down by a few Hz?",1275429839
