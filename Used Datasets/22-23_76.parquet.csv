Have you asked all of your friends wether or not they might find your family photos interesting or not? Do you think there is no value in being exposed to things that is beyond your comfort zone? I might be a 25 year old party animal that doesn't care shit about family life. But seeing the odd family photo or two in my feed now and then might perhaps be good for me? And I might even enjoy it, even if I don't want to readily admit it to my self. There is also the dimension of making the social realm more ""democratic"". In the sense that it is a good thing if people are not intentionally excluded from social contexts. It helps create a more tolerant society and more robust and flexible social networks if the interaction in the networks are less clustered (something a hacker, with knowledge about how the internet works should be able to appreciate).<p>The somewhat technical explanation is that what Google is doing is implementing something very similar to ""Social role theory"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_Theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_Theory</a>), which emphasizes social roles as the defining characteristic used to understand social interaction.

Bilingualism, and an eventual transition to study in Suomi (or Swedish -- which seems to be a level alternative officially) are encouraged, of course, but the object of the game seems to be to get the young minds working as well as possible as early as possible, even if that means teaching reading and math skills in Somali, Vietnamese or Arabic in the interim.

If 39 pick A and 40 pick B then you'd need a larger sample size to overcome the margin of error. Of course at a 95% confidence interval any result even in excess of the MOE is pure chance 1 of out 20 times.<p>What I'd do is split your customer base into 3 groups of 50% 25% and 25%, test each 25% and then apply the winner to the 50%.",1314137015.0
