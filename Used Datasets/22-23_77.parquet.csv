To hit what seem to me to be the key points:<p>(1) Markets do not just affect the long term structure of production relations (though they certainly do that). Prices of many goods and services fluctuate on a daily or even hourly basis. That is markets operating in close to &quot;real time&quot; to restructure economic activity in response to all kinds of changes in conditions.<p>(2) Markets do not just change when new entrants appear. There are other actions that market participants can take on shorter timescales to respond to changes in supply or demand. One key one is finding substitutes for goods or services that have become scarce due to some change in conditions.<p>(3) It&,
