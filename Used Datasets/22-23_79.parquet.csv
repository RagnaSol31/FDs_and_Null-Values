Usually new businesses create most of the new jobs. let's say i start a new business. i need an employee. In the past i needed to pick an american worker. Today i can chose between a machine, non-american worker and an american one , and outsourcing the job to some company that does it more efficiently(local or global) - and b2b outsourcing has really improved is the u.s. in the last decade.<p>So with so many options, it makes sense that new businesses would hire less American workers and would reduce pay. And according to a Kaufman institute study(which i can't seem to find), that what happens: new businesses hire less American workers per company(while the number of companies stays relatively constant).",1319410529.0

70,3147476,comment,3146365.0,3146365.0,3,0,RobertHubert,,,"Here is my take for what its worth - Great products require great understanding: The designer needs to understand what can be engineered, now, what needs to be invented, and what can only exist in the future, and an engineer needs to understand what the designer wants. And both teams or individuals are responsible for the process and outcome. If you have a flimsy designer that makes everything look pretty on paper but fails to communicate the entire picture, the engineers will inevitably produce sub par work, not because they're bad at their job, but because you did not give them enough to work with, unless you have visionary engineers with a foot in the design department as well. Then again if the engineers only think code code code they will fail to meet the designer where it counts and again the product is sub par. They are 2 parts of the same creative entity, one that lives and relies on communication and understanding. This is unlike the ""well oiled machine"" where each person or team resembles a mindless cog in some contraption... These are companies that do not understand the ultimate relationship between designer and engineer. It takes a designer with a stubborn focus on the big picture and a razor focus on the tiniest details along with an engineer of godlike skill to not just solve the puzzles set before them, but solve them intelligently (there is a huge difference), while keeping an eye on the final product. The two parts should always demand validation in their understanding of what the other has communicated.<p>Build a team that does not simply 'do', but a team that thinks, communicates, and understands; and create an environment that fosters this relationship.",1319408801.0

But I have too much respect for ZeroGravitas to think that he was saying something that was not historically accurate.<p>Wikipedia says that the iTunes store was introduced April 29, 2003, and that the 3rd-generation iPods (the first with USB) were first available on April 28, 2003. Furthermore, iTunes for Windows was announced on October 16, 2003.<p>So when, in this timeline, do you think labels would have signed contracts allowing Apple to distribute their music?   It would be incredible to think that they put pen to paper after the store was introduced, wouldn't it?",1319407298.0

I think you need to have some entrepreneurial experience to get much out of it though.  Until you've run into some of the problems that the lean startup proposes to solve, you'll probably find the concepts too abstract.<p>If you're looking for a book to take you from step 1 to the end of building a successful, profitable business, you'll be looking for the rest of your life.  There are far too many variables to create a completely replicable business.  Instead, it's better to know what things to look for going in, and have a framework in place that makes it easy for you to see if you're on the right track.  I think Eric's book does a great job of showing that side of things.<p>If you're looking for additional reading on the topic, you might find '4 Step to the Epiphany' worth reading. 'Business Model Generation' also gives some additional tools.  You won't find anything (worth reading) that gives you step-by-step instructions, but there's enough literature out there on the Lean Startup methodologies that you should have enough to get started.",1319407275.0
