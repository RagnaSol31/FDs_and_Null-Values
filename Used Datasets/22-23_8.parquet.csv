If China did not buy US debt or other debt then there currency would inflate which would harm their economy in the short term.<p>Just remember China is not stupid and they feel their long term goals are tied with holding a lot of US debt.<p>PS: Another advantage is they can avoid military and diplomatic confrontations with the US and the rest of the world without a strong military.  Compare the US military budget with the trade imbalance and it's not a bad deal.,1234651834

17,481492,comment,478887.0,479335.0,0,0,twopoint718,,,"Disagreement isn't being a dick. And I agree more with you that Doctorow, I have cases and cases of books (my back remembers this every time I have to move). But I, and I may have misread Doctorow's article, take it that his point wasn't that ""the screen"" (phones, e-readers, laptops, etc.) is a <i>good</i> device to read things from but that it is <i>good enough</i>.<p>I think of this as similar to the comparison between a live concert, a CD and an MP3. The concert is the one that really moves me, that's the one that makes me want to get up and dance or at least tap my feet. A good band vibrates my guts just as well as I hear them.<p>A CD is <i>nothing</i> like that experience, it's flat by comparison, the tones aren't as low or as high and I can't feel the music thump in my stomach like I can at a concert. But at the end of a great show, I'll plunk down $10 so that I can hear a really great band again.<p>Now an MP3 is even more flattened, I don't know what the science is but I think that on a lot of rips I <i>can</i> hear some sort of difference from the CD. There are parts that don't feel as crisp, etc. But MP3s, (and by this I mean ""compressed digital music files"") are doing really well out there. Apple sells a lot of them. In other words they seem ""good enough"". Or it may just be that when people evaluate different formats, concert, CD or MP3 they choose the most portable one and don't care as much about the quality.<p>That's what I was trying to cite, without judgment, that it seems people will sacrifice a lot of quality for a gain in some other area. I don't see why it would be different with books.<p>I remember reading a book (""Scrolling Forward"" by David M. Levy, Arcade Pub., New York, 1st ed.) the author was an alum of Xerox PARC; he had written his thesis on one of the first WYSIWYG word processor typing systems, an early machine with a mouse. After this experience he went off to learn the very analog art of calligraphy. He felt that he had lost his connection with the feel of the page and the art of writing, he also wrote this whole book about what ""document"" means in the digital age. I mean to say that there may also be a more expanded notion of what <i>reading</i> and <i>novel</i> mean in the future. Or maybe not.",1234650939

The vast majority of github repos is ruby and javascript of which the majority is most likely rails related. Lots of people also use it to host their private scripts and little tools, you don't have that on sourceforge where most of the big opensource apps are hosted. Maybe Rubyforge will suffer. Anyway, I like github a lot and appreciate the upgrade, but I don't think it will overshadow sourceforge anytime soon.",1234650118

28,481479,comment,478869.0,480658.0,0,0,weaksauce,,,"They must have added it after you left. They must have hired on some usability gurus to make the site very user friendly(in my eyes, but I am not a typical user).<p>For Example, they added a javascript hover over a movie title in the list and they ""pop-in"" an info box of the movie that you are interested in while your mouse is hovered over the title. This does not prevent you from clicking through but it is an easy way to decide if the link is actually worth clicking on.<p>Another example of the UI adding instead of detracting from the overall experience is when you actually add a movie to your queue. Another pop-in happens that gives you more recommendations based on the movie that you picked. The key thing that makes it usable is that when you are done looking at the recommendations you can close the pop-in and you are back at the original list of titles without any jarring transitions. There is another subtle way in which they make the pop-in more usable by making the original page visible behind the pop-in at all times. This keeps your sense of where you are in the netflix site.<p>I am definitely not saying that they have a great UI. Just that they have a UI that works well for most use cases.",1234649732

The phrase ""at least in theory"" was meant to communicate my skepticism of the surrounding claim; sorry if that didn't come across.  I mean that most members of society believe they are acting in children's best interest by requiring them to attend school, while the primary motivation for keeping prisoners in prison is to protect the safety of others.

Its been inflating ever since.<p>Also, bonds are just a proxy for cash. There is effectively no difference except the bonds get interest. Banks are not an option because any cash over $250,000 will have little guarantee. If China ever wanted to purchase US companies, the US govt. securities market would be more than happy to exchange the bonds for hard cash. Also, why would the chinese avoid buying US companies once their economy stabilizes and goes down from the double digit growth? They will buy whatever is most efficient and with their abundance of capital, that may be mean greater investment in American and European stock-markets.<p>Also, being able to print more money does not make an investment safe. It makes it crap. Read the last sentence you wrote. The key phrase is ""devalue the dollar."" What exactly is a devalued dollar worth? you tell me but it's not much and it's certainly low enough to wipe out the investment. US bonds are a safe place keep capital because the US government has a reputation of maintaining currency values and honoring debt. A reputation that is more and more divorced from reality as time goes on. Remember something: money != wealth. Also the Chinese <i>government</i> has a few 100 billion (which by the way is <i>not</i> an insignificant amount, have you ever had even a billion to spend? I wish I did.). The Chinese public also has a lot of capital floating around and when considering the country, that capital must be counted.",1234649306
