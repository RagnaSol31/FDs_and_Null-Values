If you are from the older countries in European Union/EFTA then, once you get a job, your permit is not tied to your job and you have enough time to look for another job if you want to switch. You can even get unemployment benefits after completing 1 year (but I would advise not to if you want a C permit). Things are much harder if you come from a non european country. Then I think for the first couple of years your residence permit is tied to your employer. Once you are past the first years though, the conditions improve a lot but you are still in disadvantage compared to Europeans.<p>If you want more information, I would suggest to look up the conditions for L, B, and C permits depending on your country of origin.<p>Once you have a C permit, you are pretty much settled in and almost like a Swiss person (apart from voting). On B permit, you have less freedom, but I have not faced any practical issues so far (but I am young, without family, and European).",1451256413.0

Surat, a city in Gujarat of 4.5m people, is a flourishing trading hub that not long ago was a wretched dump like Gorakhpur. In 1994, after a reported (but never confirmed) outbreak of pneumonic plague, it became famous for squalor, gridlock, slums and rotten management. Since then it has been transformed. Effective managers cleaned up. Rubbish was collected and transport improved, streets were swept and public services delivered. Miraculously, the improvements were sustained. Some 96% of residents pay their municipal taxes on time. Manoj Kumar Das, who now runs the city, says that over the past decade the growth in Surat’s population averaged 5% a year, among the fastest of any city in the world. According to his planners, by 2031 it could have 9.3m people, overtaking London.<p>You complain about &quot;positive generalizations&quot; and yet you resort to generalizations yourself without checking facts ?<p>As for Palanpur - I don&",
