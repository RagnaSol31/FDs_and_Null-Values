This might be inflammatory, but I venture that the bulk of Canada's A-talent is already in the USA. Given the ease of the TN visa, I think it's not a stretch to say that if you're offering $70K for software engineers in Toronto, you are <i>not</i> hiring any of Canada's top talent, because they're all in the US making $150K+.<p>In my experience the few talented people who remain do so out of philosophical or family-related reasons, and that's a tiny, tiny slice of the overall pie.<p>> <i>""I think that movement is changing..""</i><p>As a Canadian expat in the US I disagree. In fact, if anything, in recent years the brain drain of software talent from Canada to the US has <i>increased</i> as the software industry heats up down south.

Actual, recurring negative irrational thoughts in certain situations. We all agree those would be bad, right? Then, you counter the negative irrational one by formulating a positive and reasonable affirmation to counter that negative one. And nothing more and nothing less. The goal should be to get rid of the irrational negative recurring thought, not to start believing something unrealistically fantastical about yourself. Although it <i>can</i> help the process to exaggerate the positive one a little bit, but maybe not for everyone, and it's just supposed to expedite the replacing process.<p>Though actually, the people referring to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy are probably most right on the mark.

It is based on anything that is published before the relevant date. Thus, examiners should and sometimes do use all kinds of different publications to determine obviousness. But the problem is that the patent office is accustomed to do prior art searches based on existing patents. Thus, internally the PTO is set up to favor prior art searches based on patents rather than other publications. This generally makes sense for other slower moving fields of technology (e.g. mechanical devices, farming equipment, etc.) or for fields where everything gets immediately patented (biotech) but it makes no sense in software.<p>Another problem is that software was considered generally unpatentable until a landmark supreme court case in 1995. At that time people started filing for software patents and the patent office was generally set up to mostly use patents as prior art searches. Well, there were no software patents then, because software was not patentable until then. The unsurprising result was that a lot of very obvious software patents got through.<p>Thus, my pet theory on software patents is that there is nothing inherently wrong with them, they were just not correctly administered by the PTO. If the USPTO hires proper competent computer scientists as examiners and encourages the searching of all available prior art, then we would get much fewer and much higher quality software patents.<p>And I do agree with your idea of opening the review process. The pto is trying to make tepid steps in that direction but they are obviously scared of a flood of comments that may happen if they open up the gates and them having to pay examiners to evaluate every single comment from every crazy person on the net.",1342909429.0
