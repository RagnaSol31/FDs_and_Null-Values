While there's a lot of pseudo-science in pop business nonfiction, there's very little rigor - see a summary of this critique here: <a href=""http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/04/12/luck_inc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/04/12/...</a><p>In particular, ""In a paper currently under review, the three argue that not only are business gurus bad at identifying the causes of success, they have no way of telling true greatness from mere luck - if enough people are flipping coins, someone is likely to string together an impressive run of heads. According to their analysis of 13 of the most influential business success books, three quarters of the purportedly great companies had track records that could just as easily have been explained by the vicissitudes of random chance - performances that looked impressive on first glance were simply akin to being the lucky person in a stadium full of coin-flippers.""<p>Maybe HBR is more rigorous than the pop business press as a whole, but this article doesn't seem to be.",1262901780.0

Of course this doesn't work. We take away guns and bombs, so the terrorists use box cutters. We take away box cutters and corkscrews, and the terrorists hide explosives in their shoes. We screen shoes, they use liquids. We limit liquids, they sew PETN into their underwear. We implement full-body scanners, and they're going to do something else. This is a stupid game; we should stop playing it.""</i><p>And do away with the restrictions? As much as I dislike dealing with the TSA, some of these rules have made it far more difficult for terrorists to bring down or hijack an airplane. I'm sure I am not the only one who remembers the bad old days when criminals, mentally ill people, non-suicidal terrorists, and political extremists would regularly hijack flights here and abroad. I can't remember the last time it's happened, because now it's nearly impossible for anyone to bring on weapons or get into the cockpit.<p>I also disagree with his conclusion that people reacted with ""fear"" to the Christmas day attempt.
