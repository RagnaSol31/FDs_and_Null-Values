The tiny speed hit that checking memory bounds before accessing arrays required turned out to not be a big deal, and the improved programmer productivity more than made up for the need for slightly-more-expensive hardware.  And, of course, the number of lives saved was more valuable than a few extra microseconds of execution time and the larger EEPROM needed to store the smarter runtime.<p>Oh sorry, that was me daydreaming.  Of course nothing has changed, people just ""try to be more careful"".  Since people never make mistakes, even when pressed with tight deadlines, this has worked out fine.

What I AM suggesting is that by storing and making it simple to send and receive public keys, Gmail could very easily and transparently facilitate the growth of such webs of trust. Simple example (what TFA seemed to be):<p>1) Alice, a crypto-savvy non-gmail user, sends Bob, a non-crypto-savvy gmail user, her public key. (Or, better, Alice gives Bob a thumbdrive with her public key on it for upload to Gmail.)\n2) Gmail stores it.\n3) Alice later sends signed mail to Bob.\n4) Gmail verifies it, and prominently notifies Bob whether it is a valid or invalid signature. Perhaps it even presents a link for Bob to learn more about how it knows this, and how his mail from Alice is different from un-signed mail.<p>So with extremely little forced interaction on Bob's part (nothing to install, nothing much to learn, no key generation), there is now some added security between the two of them, even if it is unidirectional. From this point, Bob could then quickly learn enough to be able to encrypt the email that he sends to Alice from within Gmail, and Alice, using PGP in her mail client, would be able to decrypt it.<p>It certainly doesn't cover every angle, but it would improve relative security and it would allow those who ARE familiar and experienced with public-key cryptography to bring up basic concepts with their friends/family/coworkers (among the ~150 million monthly Gmail users, anyway).<p>Edit: wonky formatting",1266876442.0

But it was running on the G1 within weeks of release (as was most of debian, FWIW) and there are certainly no barriers to using it.<p>But the supported API is Java-based, and that legitimately annoys some people even if it pleases others.  Google isn't banning python, certainly, but neither are they pushing it.  No different than any other phone, I guess.",1266876284.0

The next stage would depend on the position you're applying for, and whether it's algorithms, web, systems, maintenance, whatever.  There are now several questions I could pursue, but that's enough to get you through the door, offered a beverage of your choice, and effectively courted.<p>By the way, not knowing what the modulus operator is no bar - all you have to do is write:<p><pre><code>    if is_divisible_by(n,d) ...\n</code></pre>\nor something similar, and then say - ""I'd need to look up the idiomatic way to do that in your language of choice.""<p>But you are already way ahead of the game.  FWIW, when we have been hiring (which we aren't now, by the way) the person who wrote something like that got the job.  And yes, out of several tens of applications, only one could do it.",1266876207.0

But even if you ignore that, there's rarely any harm to leaving an app ""running"" with no windows open--such an app isn't doing anything anyway, so it doesn't consume CPU, and it's faster to reopen again. And for some applications--instant messengers, for instance--Windows works the same way. Even if you quit all your Pidgin windows on a Windows box, Pidgin keeps running in the taskbar. Mac OS X's global menu bar and application concept at the very least provide consistent behavior.<p>""on the iphone, doing that (which would require going to the home screen between each jump) would restart each app every time, losing your context.""<p>iPhone apps save state upon exit and reload state upon start. Considering that a background app that you're ignoring is probably going to swap to ""disk"" anyway, that's not much different from what you'd see in a multitasking environment.",1266876192.0

Almost as bad, both countries have the ability to unilaterally bankrupt the other--China through fire-selling their stash of US dollars and the US through cutting off imports from China. The problem is that either step on its own would be mutually disastrous. If China floods the market with cheap US dollars, the RMB (which is pegged to the USD) crashes too. If the US cuts off Chinese imports, our cost of living soars even before taking into account the hyperinflation China could cause for us.<p>Taiwan and China will reunify, but they will reunify peaceably.
