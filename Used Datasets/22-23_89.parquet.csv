The data you checksum is probably already in L1/L2 cache (write to RAID) or going to be used by userland, and us reading the data will just mean userland process gets its data from cache instead (read from RAID). You can get maybe 2-6 GB/s to GPU. Add the latency (sync, etc.) and GPU time to calculate the hash, you've probably radically slowed down the process. Additionally, assuming DMA transfer, your memory subsystem is more stressed due to both CPU and GPU reading same data.<p>Oh, and simple xor? Well, assuming data is in L2 already, Intel i7 can xor 10+ GB/s using just single core, between 3 buffers, aka minimum RAID 5. Fastest RAID adapters can achieve only a fraction of that speed.",1304722778.0

The likelihood that it would drive startups out of San Francisco proper is very high.

Another big issue is that the city of San Francisco will lose out on significant tax revenue from companies based here, since they will be forced to leave.",1304722702.0

This is totally backwards and leads to standards that are too complicated, unrealistic, and in many cases not needed at all.</i><p>The general view of the W3C as a <i>standards</i> body is broken.<p>The W3C gets companies and individuals together to hash out ideas for the Web.  After some time and trial and error they assemble a <i>recommendation</i>.   Hopefully people (i.e. the members of the W3C) put this into practice to see how well it flies in real-life.  At some point, if the recommendation proves its worth, a standards body such as ISO or ANSI may want to formalize it.  Or so it was.<p>Once upon a time yo could find on the W3C site a statement to the effect that they were <i>not</i> a standards body.  However, some people who wanted to see the ideas from the W3C gain more traction (i.e. XHTML) started referring to W3C docs  as standards, and the W3C as a standards body.  Jeffrey Zeldman, in <i>Designing with Web Standards</i> [sic], says the use of the word ""standards"" when referring to these specs was, in fact, ""a guerilla marketing maneuver.""<p>This is not mere semantics.  There is great value in making a distinction between well-considered ideas that still need to be battle-proven, and  proper formal specs that have been sufficiently vetted.<p>Eventually the W3C began to believe the hype and now presents itself as a standards body, to the detriment of the greater Web community because, as you point out, they are ""standardizing"" things that people aren't actually doing.",1304720931.0

Not all of these work for everyone, but many will work for most. Let's take your site CompVersions.com (which looks very nice, BTW) for example:<p>Controversy - Okay, tough one there. Get back to me on that.<p>Viral tricks - Allow new users to extend their free trials by another 14 days if they send an email about the service to 5 people. Or, give new paying users some amount of credit for doing something similar. Give away a free {thing designers want} - To enter the contest you must tweet about the service. Tons of options here.<p>Affiliate Program - People pay for the service, so this is doable. The affiliates you want are people/companies who operate popular design sites/blogs/forums/newsletters/services. If they have ads then they could be an affiliate (actually, even if they don't). Cut special deals for really good partners. Consider offering small payouts for trial sign ups and bigger payouts for paid customers.<p>SEO - Goes without saying. You need to be thinking about this.<p>Press - You probably aren't going for CNN here, but there are lots of design oriented publications both online and off. Think of some story ideas and start pitching. Are more people going freelance because of the economy? You could play off that angle. Clients who can't make up their minds about anything is a classic designer story. If you can put together a success story of someone who used your product to get an indecisive client to make a choice- that's a story people want to hear.<p>Celebrity Endorsement - Offer your product to a highly visible designer for free. If they like it, ask for an endorsement. Maybe a tweet or two? Maybe a mention on their blog?<p>Biz Dev - There are lots of design agencies out there. Maybe this is something that some of them would be interested in using. Maybe you could do a co-branded promotion with a company that offers another kind of design tool, like wire framing or something. Perhaps you could work with Appsumo to put together a ""Designers"" package, of which CompVersions would be a part.<p>Offline Events - Probably not super useful for this. But live design demos in front of an audience could be fun.<p>So yeah, I think there's some good material to go on here.",1304719625.0
136,2522651,comment,2521820.0,2522599.0,5,0,tkahn6,,,"CUDA has a much simpler API (and your entire program can be written in CUDA C) because it makes assumptions about the hardware you're using. OpenCL is for 'computing on heterogeneous platforms' meaning that if you do it right, your code can run on multithreaded CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, ATI GPUs, or any device that conforms to the OpenCL standard. The tradeoff is that you have to write a lot of accessory code to make sure you're computing on the right device and conforming to the capabilities of that device... and these decisions have to be made at runtime unless you specifically know the platform and devices attached to the host but then your code isn't very portable.<p>So for a proof of concept it makes sense to go with CUDA so you can play with the algorithms and not worry about all the other stuff.",1304719612.0

Completely by accident, my payload executed in my colleagues skype client.""<p>If I had to guess, they were probably pasting back and forth JavaScript ""payloads"" for an XSS and broke the parser that Skype is using for formatting chat messages. Not that interesting.<p>Chat messages on Skype aren't exactly the most effective propogation mechanism either. Don't you have to be approved as someone's friend before they can send you a message? This probably won't be used in any massive attacks any time soon. Until then, continue to annoy your girlfriends as the author apparently did.",1304719498.0
