Just not so keen on all the upheaval and territory fighting that might happen along the way. But I guess in that sense it kind of selfish to worry about global warming. Maybe the poor people in Greenland deserve some warmer years, and I should gladly chill for their benefit (chill because I think it would be getting colder where I live, if the gulf stream became diverted).",1240700394.0

Those sound like wildly different roles. He could have just been totally over his head.<p>The first startup I worked at hired a bunch of corporate IT execs and former management consultants to be executives. Their old jobs seemed more related to their new ones than the guy in the article, yet they were still totally out of their element. They always tried to spend their way out of a hole, which always put us further in financial jeopardy.

However, these are the exact same ways you can rewrite history in Git.<p>Second, the 'receive' setting is not for normal users - it is not run client side.  It is an option for the people running the Git server and is not normally needed.  If you trust your fellow developers enough not to commit something idiotic, then you can trust them to manage the head references properly.  However, if your company has some super paranoid and poorly considered policy, then it is an option.<p>We do not enforce this at GitHub and not only has it never been a problem, but it has helped us help people solve issues that they do have - accidentally committing files you really don't want in there, or code with a license you actually cannot use or something.  With Git it's relatively easy to fix the repository and force push the update and let your collaborators know this needs to be done.  With Mercurial... I honestly don't know how you can deal with that.<p>Furthermore, it doesn't actually lose the changes, it just removes the pointer to them, you can push the old pointer back very easily.
