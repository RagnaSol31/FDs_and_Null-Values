In fact, most computers have been designed to cater to that 1% of coders and creative professionals.  Very few computers have been explicitly designed and made for the other 99%.  The iPad seems to me to be targeting that 90% that want to be an audience/consumer of content, but are not creators.  It's a computing device/appliance finally made specifically with them in mind, rather than with hackers/creators/coders/geeks in mind as the target market.<p>So, it makes sense that Macs will remain the only way to develop for iPhone OS.  Making iPhone OS capable of becoming a development platform would be counter to the entire idea/market of iPhone OS.<p>Macs may dwindle to 1% of Apple's sales some day, but they'll still sit at the top, trickling down all the content to the rest of the ecosystem.",1272495188.0

The question isn't only about reserves, but about how expensive those reserves are to access (and what kinds of environmental damage access will cause).<p>And oil prices have, in real terms, gone steadily upwards through a boom and bust cycle: prices rise stratospherically, then crash, then find a new trading point higher than the previous trading point. For more on that, see Christopher Steiner's <i>$20 Per Gallon: How the Inevitable Rise in the Price of Gasoline will Change Our Lives for the Better</i>:  <a href=""http://jseliger.com/2009/08/21/20-per-gallon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com/2009/08/21/20-per-gallon</a> . Note that I don't believe the provocative claim in the title, but he provides a lot of useful historical data.<p>And this argument mostly ignores the environmental cost of oil, both in terms of extraction and in terms of consumption. And in terms of the massive wealthy transfers from the West to charming places like Saudi Arabia that do a great job of churning out people who become terrorists and ideologies that are repressive. If the price of oil goes up—and it almost certainly will—the latter dynamic will only get stronger.<p>People who cite peak oil aren't doing it because they have ""a visceral hated of petroleum,"" especially if visceral refers to inward feelings rather than the intellect: they have rational concerns about the world in which we live.

Yes, more developers might port their existing iApp to Android, etc, but if its viable for them, then its also viable for people who creating new apps who might have bet it all on Android if they didn't have an easy way to hedge with the iPhone too.<p>If this idea were real, and it caught on, the bigger issue for Apple is that developers might be slower to adopt new features of the platform.  Right now, if Apple releases a new OS feature, they can put it on new devices and move the installed base to it pretty quickly, which means developers have incentive to take advantage of the new functionality.  If those developers depend on a translation layer to reach a significant portion of their audience, then they have less incentive to move quickly, because the translation layer needs to be updated, and that could take a while if the underlying platform doesn't provide the required functionality yet.<p>Not that I think it would ever get that far.  It's a lot of work already, and its going to be magnified by the fact that both iPhoneOS and Android are evolving quickly.  Even if this hypothetical were real, its going to be lagging the capabilities of both platforms which means that its only really attractive for apps that don't get much benefit from the new capabilities.<p>Look at WINE.  It's been under development for over a decade.  I think its impressive that it is as useful as it is, but when it comes down to it, its still pretty niche.",1272493608.0

85,1302943,comment,1302561.0,1302561.0,0,0,grellas,,,"My thoughts based on years of representing such companies:<p>1. Non-funded startups typically don't have employees or, if they do, they are employee-founders. If the cash isn't there to support salaries, you won't have payroll. People can and do get misled in non-funded companies, though it is the rare exception and by no means the rule, since most of those involved understand they are taking a flyer and that nothing may come of their efforts unless and until the startup gains sufficient traction at least to get funding.<p>2. Most of the abuse involving outright misrepresentations concerns <i>funded</i> companies that hit hard times and then tell their employees that they must stick with a failing situation, and endure the accompanying hardships (missed paychecks, etc.), in the name of deferring their reward until the company can rebound. In such cases, employees are in effect being asked to take the risks of founders and yet are often given nothing more than their deferred pay in case the company does bounce back - that is, having taken on an indispensable role to enable the company to save itself, they get no additional equity or other reward for the hardships they undertook.<p>3. Funded companies also are more prone to mislead employees with tall talk about what the company will supposedly do and why the options held by employees will be worth so much. Yet, in doing so, they don't tell their employees anything about the capitalization of the company itself, thus leaving the employees with a sense their 50,000 options or whatever will make them rich while in reality they may represent only a miniscule percent of the company and have only a small upside even in a success case. At the same time, no one is ever told about VC liquidation preferences, which can easily be used in many cases to wipe out the interests of the employee-shareholders in an instant as soon as anything goes wobbly with the company.<p>4. Opportunities come and go rather quickly in the startup world and it may just be a simple fact of life that employee tenures will tend to be shorter in such an environment for reasons having nothing to do either with flakiness or opportunism on the part of employees or with deception or abuse on the part of employers. I think it is a mistake to overstate this in either direction in seeking to ascribe generalized motives to one side or the other.",1272493273.0

The upcoming part is the ability to create event-driven javascript services of your own.  At the moment, you're limited to the ones that Palm provides.<p>They've also got a lot of other really net web tech in the pipeline, including things like a pluggable data service on the device that automagically syncs to CouchDB servers in the cloud.<p>Also check out their Ares web-based development environment, which reached 1.0 recently.  Very, very cool.",1272492196.0

Even Sony understands that.",1272492166.0

I can see how it makes sense for Apple to drop 'computers' and focus on 'devices,' but they are currently restricting their development platform to Macs. Do you feel that they will be able to create a competent development platform for Windows or Linux? Or do you think that we will all be coding on iPhones/iPads in 10 years?",1272492101.0

Are you really saying that Steve Jobs, with all his secret meetings with Samsung and random manufacturers, isn't aware that it will be available soon?<p>To put it another way, if the hardware is hard, wouldn't it have taken Apple quite some time to build the stuff?  Wouldn't they be working on the iPad, say, two years out, when Jobs was making those statements about $500 tablets?<p>But I think even <i>that argument</i> in a sense is a red herring.  The real issue is ""can Jobs change his mind?""  Of course he can.  But he's notoriously cryptic about what Apple's working on.  It's not like he's out talking to industry analysts and is making off-the-cuff comments about Apple's strategy.  His statements are calculated and controlled.  In fact, I would argue that he is more often ""wrong"" or ""misleading"" about new products than he is ""accurate"", because lots (by percentage) of his forward-looking statements turn out to be inaccurate, at least according to the plain meaning of them.  To say that he is changing his mind is to imply that he's really inept his job: figuring out what to build.<p>But I think even <i>that's</i> not the central issue.  Let's say Jobs is just a really whimsical guy, who doesn't know he's working on an iPad until it slaps him in the face on launch day.  So all of the quoted statements are just him running his mouth and he really has no product vision years out.<p>Wouldn't that imply, then, that today Jobs has no idea whether he'll be making a Mac app store or not?  So his statement has no real information content?<p>tl;dr It doesn't matter whether the hardware is hard or what his intent is--to mislead or if he simply doesn't know he's going to make a product.  His track record shows that claiming he's not going to do something is a good indicator that he'll do it a few years later.",1272492067.0
