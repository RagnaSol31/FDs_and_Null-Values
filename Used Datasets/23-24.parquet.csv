Now, a message shows my key is no longer genuine.  The individual key on the bottom of the laptop didn't work any better than the Dell OEM key it came with.  After trying System Restore from the Repair prompt during reboot (via a Dell Tech's prompt), I'm told I can't restore because a file already exists.  My system diagnostics and hard drive are 100%.  It seems the Windows Genuine Activation saga continues--it says the status of my operating system is unknown.  It suggests I... revisit the same page again and find out the same thing.",1191369468

2,62348,story,,,8,27,cirroc,Ask news.yc: Raising money using bank loans?,,"I'm interested in hearing any thoughts that some of the other Hacker News readers on starting a company using loans, and who might be the best places to approach? <p>We're a small team, about 70% of the way through a fairly hefty project. We've done most of the back-end code, but we need to contract some artwork, and want to move one of our co-founders to working FT on the project, in order to speed up development.<p>SBC style loans are offered by Citizen's bank and others- \nThese loans, as I understand, typically require that you invest 30% of the loan amount into the company at the time of the loan.\n While we've invested quite a sum over the last few months as we've been building (legal fees, etc), I don't have a huge amount of up-front capital.<p>There's private sources of capital such as America One (amone.com), but they seem very shady, and want a high percentage as a finder's fee.<p>I know we could end up going to Angel Investors asking for a loan, but we don't know any personally, and building lengthy presentations for investor meetings takes time away from actually building things, as well as dilluting capital. <p>We're very dedicated to the idea, and the company, and I'd appreciate any advice, thoughts, or experience as other people have gone through this part of the process.\n",1191369417

Seems too easy...until you start getting into some meatier applications and use cases.  Take a look at some of the tutorials over at peepcode.com.

In fact, we can take this idea further by asking the user to decide whether the ad he/she is looking at should be linked with his submitted ad (to provide a ""related"" ads feature).",1191368420

If that's the case, sounds like an interesting idea.<p>If I play the devil's advocate as advertiser a bit more though, I'm still not understanding why I would value this service. My time is a lot more precious than the pay-per-click rates I would spend on google. I'm not really that interested in looking at ads all day.",1191368082

I would then go public and see what sort of growth rate I had. Maybe you can attract more bloggers to write about you.<p>Then, go looking around for angels who have experience selling a product like yours. Use them to fund your marketing. I imagine most of that money would go to a PR firm. <p> ",1191368002

14,62336,comment,62122.0,62122.0,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"If you let it coast, it will never go anywhere great.  Only you can determine if it is a big enough opportunity to be worth pursuing (I draw the line, and VC level investors tend to draw the line, at $100m/year potential...your line may be much lower or higher).  I suspect time management can be a pretty big business--particularly if you take your strength in that one niche and then mix it up with related products six months or a year from now (what those related products are is up to you to determine...email-related time management products seems a good place to start groping around, since there is a large and growing population that uses email as their todo list, among other things).<p>If money will enable you to compete more effectively, then you should raise money.  If you're this uncertain about the market size, and how big you think you can be in it, start with a small investment.  $50k, $100k, along those lines can be raised pretty painlessly with a good demo and presentation.  Your site looks awesome, so if enough of it works to pull together a great demo, then you can raise money.  But, if development is what you want, you might want to bring in a co-founder...a great coder costs more than a small investment will buy, but equity in a great idea can buy great developers.  You seem quite capable of holding up your end of the bargain, so you should have hackers knocking on your door...just pick the smartest of them, and run this idea up the flagpole.  (You might still want to raise money, but not so much for development.)",1191366989
