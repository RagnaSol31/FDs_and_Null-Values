One is that there is a real risk of split pots, where multiple winners drive the ex post probabilistic payoffs negative.<p>The larger issue is operational hurdles: it is tough to buy a million tickets, even if one has the coin. The retailers simply aren't setup to handle that sort of flow, and the state lottery officials have setup measures to prevent this sort of things (mostly as a result of being picked off in the past). To them, it is a business, they expect to make money, and they just change the rules relating to ticket sale mechanics to limit/punish outlets that collaborate with the syndicates.",1243209440.0

(if you are 25 and under, you are basically a walking hormone).<p>Added the fact that in most tech companies guys outnumber girls 2 to 1 or worse (i am including marketing, sales, hr also),  if you are a single and decent looking girl you will probably be hit on a lot.<p>Not sure if there is a solution to this.<p>As a counterpoint, i worked in a company of about 80 people, where 60 were female, and i got hit on a lot.  I actually enjoyed it when girls were flirting with me.  But that's the main difference i guess,  women are more likeley to be more annoyed from non-wanted advanced than men are, call it evolution or social, i don't care.<p>The fact is that being the one differnt from your collegues, might make you feel a little bit like a fish out of water.\nAnd in this case is being female, where you are probably outnumbered 4 to 1 or worse.",1243209429.0

So Argentina is only has about 1/3rd the land mass that the US does.<p>However, the extent of the U.S. land mass is bounded in the west by the Rockies and the deserts of the Great Basin, so in reality, the amount of arable land that both countries started out with is comparable.  The arable Argentinian Pampas is closer to the coast than are the plains of the U.S.  Just as importantly, the rivers in Argentina flow East-West, whereas the U.S. have the Appalachians between the East coast starting point and the breadbasket.  This gives Argentina a STRONG head start in terms of being able to easily populate and exploit the arable interior.<p>In this light, Argentina should have had a higher initial population than the U.S. did.  Argentinian farmers didn't have to clear fields for rocks as did the farmers of New England.  They didn't have to cross the Cumberland gap or clear trees for farms in NY.",1243209113.0

When George W. Bush would get on TV and read a speech about evildoers, he would make the hearts of the faithful flutter with devout feeling.

In principle, I don't see a problem with granting someone a temporary monopoly for monetizing discoveries that came about as the result of long and difficult work. Society is almost certainly better off if the patent system causes discoveries to be made sooner than when the patent was granted plus the length of the patent term. I'm torn on the gene patent though.One the one hand, a gene is a non-obvious mathematical formalism that offers an explanatory account of heredity. So we don't really have genes in our bodies and any arguments relying on such a claim are dubious. Furthermore, patents do have research exemptions. Now, my intuitions tell me such a patent is wrong but I'd really like to see a solid supportive argument.",1243208011.0

Failed intellectuals will enjoy the immediate fun of solving a complex problem or satisfying their innate curiosity yet rapidly changing priorities as soon they get bored. At what price?<p>I personally enjoy the carpe-diemishly failed intellectual's path; I don't deem myself smart but I do enjoy hacking C++, Ruby and LISP out of pure fun and my college GPA is around 2.4 with several failed classes. I never finished high school due to bureaucratic crap I haven't liked to deal with. I've done drugs too, just out of curiosity. I probably look like a typical failed teenager but I can't look at myself with a pair of eyes other than mine.<p>My friend is a totally different story. Before his freshman year of high school he set a goal -- get a 4.0 GPA and get into a totally awesome university.<p>I watched him -- it was easy since we shared schools -- months and months, digging into assignments, spending nights at the library, working a part-time job and paying an SAT tutor. He was like a bulldog; he grasped the system by the very throat (yet he seemed like a prisoner of his own mind). He got 3.99 GPA and 2200 SAT (up from 1680). He kept focus for four years. I consider myself lucky if I keep focused on something for more than two months. He went to Berkeley.<p>Me? I consistently skipped school, learned stuff on my own, been the typical slacker, failed classes, and somehow picked up programming contracts while in high school.<p>Now he's finishing Berkeley and I'm taking classes in community college, just for intellectual stimulation, working part-time as a C++ programmer and towards my goal: frugal passive income from web-startup that would give me freedom to explore and learn, not being stuck in office (like he might).<p>My friend has prestige, respect and he is very succesful but I wouldn't live his life even for a second.
