When new entrepreneurs, or old alike, reach out for help, your first instinct is to help them because you know how hard it is to be an entrepreneur.  This is despite being super busy and drained yourself.  So, when you make time for someone, even though you may not have much time to give, it's quite a waste when they take it for granted.

73,2839118,comment,2837905.0,2837905.0,3,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"I don't 'get it'.  Sounds like an easy question and not ""The Mother of All Interview Questions"".<p>But, for me, part of the answer is that the ""process"" has involved solving practical problems only in part with software, and some of the ""invention"" has been not really in the software.<p>Do the following examples count?<p>(1) A prof wrote a package for statistics for students and in the testing found that one of the operations was too slow and another one gave numerically poor results.<p>For the slow operation, looking, there were two loops, each that ran in time proportional to n^2. Using the existing storage in a tricky way, I converted the loops to (n)ln(n) which was then plenty fast.<p>For the bad numerical result, I used some orthogonal polynomials instead of statistics normal equations, and that solved the numerical accuracy problem.<p>(2) At a growing company, the Board wanted some revenue projections.  There wasn't much for ideas, so I got involved.  We knew the current revenue.  We knew the maximum long term revenue because of the capacity we had in mind.  Revenue growth was to be 'viral'. So, let t denote time in days with t = 0 the current time.  Let the revenue at time t be y(t). So, y(0) is the current revenue.  Let b be the maximum revenue.<p>From virality, the growth rate in revenue should be proportional to (i) the revenue from current customers y(t) and (ii) the revenue from the customers not yet served (b - y(t)).<p>The growth rate in revenue is dy(t)/dt = y'(t), that is, the calculus first derivative of y(t).  So for some constant k,<p><pre><code>     y'(t) = k y(t) (b - y(t))\n</code></pre>\nSolve for y(t) in closed form, select a reasonable k, and done.<p>(3) A company had a cute marketing opportunity and wanted to allocate marketing resources the best way.  They formulated the problem as a 0-1 integer linear program (ILP) maximization problem with, for a first test case, 40,000 constraints and 600,000 variables.  Seeing that no ILP package would take that problem as it was, they tried a genetic heuristic, ran for days, and quit.<p>I looked at the problem, saw an approach via non-linear duality theory and Lagrange multipliers.  So, the dual problem was to minimize a convex function approximated by some hyperplanes.<p>I wrote the software, and after 500 hyperplanes had a good approximation to the dual and a feasible solution to the original problem within 0.025% of the optimal answer.<p>(4) Another company had another cute marketing problem and wanted to allocate resources to maximize results.  The problem was integer linear programming again, but I saw that it was also a problem in least cost network flows on a network with integers for arc capacities.  So, use the network simplex algorithm and get an optimal answer quickly with the integer constraints honored for free.<p>(5) A software project was to analyze some data collected at sea.  I looked at the specification for estimating the power spectra and saw some problems:  For the low frequency resolution they wanted, they needed too much data.  To illustrate, I wrote some software to generate a sample path of a second order stochastic process with a known power spectrum, accumulate the sample power spectrum, and showed how slowly the sample power spectrum converged to the spectrum of the process.  This work surprised and pleased the customer, and we got the competitive software contract.<p>(6) In a project, needed to look at a few million numbers and end up with the, say, 100 largest.  So, go to classic heap sort, and start with an ascending heap of 100 locations that has the 100 largest so far and with the smallest at the root of the implicit tree of the heap.  So, given the next one of the 100 million numbers, one comparison with that root value says if that next number is among the 100 largest so far; if so, then replace the root value with the next value and 'sift' to rebuild the heap.<p>The worst case would be given the 100 million numbers in ascending order in which case the computational time complexity should be proportional to (n)ln(n) for n = 100 million.  Otherwise for large n the execution time should be only slightly slower than proportional to n (exercise:  for n independent, identically distributed numbers with a distribution absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure so that the probability of ties is zero, find the actual expected running time up to a constant of proportionality).<p>(7) A server reports numerical data on each of 10 variables at 20 a second.  You have data from three months when, from that data and more evidence, the server seemed to be 'healthy'.<p>Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to implement real time monitoring for this server that uses the data from the three months and also real time data.  Your solution will be a statistical hypothesis test with known, adjustable Type I error (false alarm rate).  Your work will necessarily be the world's first class of statistical hypothesis tests that are both multi-variate and distribution-free.  You need to show that your test is not 'trivial', and for that consider the classic S. Ulam result on 'tightness'.  You should also show that in a powerful sense, asymptotically the test is best possible in a sense similar to the classic Neyman-Pearson result.<p>Also, design and implement a fast algorithm for the computations.<p>Do such examples count?",1312327560.0

I think, as you said, there is a lot more to this than just bandwidth measurements.  For example, last November a bunch of DNS servers went down in Comcast's networks that essentially meant no Internet for the majority of people that don't know how to configure public DNS.<p>We're working to eventually get a much finer grain survey of performance (e.g. a neighborhood), by piggy backing on network-intensive applications (currently BitTorrent).  In addition to throughput, we're looking at things such as packet loss, latency (the last-mile in particular), time-of-day effects, as well as using traceroutes for underlying forward-path analysis.<p>My point is, if anyone has any ideas for other applications (something like Netflix would be great) to leverage, metrics to include, or advice, I'd be happy to hear them. :)",1312327187.0

I am willing to take risks.<p>This idea was just planted in my head about 6 months ago and I have been studying how to start and systemize the whole concept and if it's even worth putting my time & effort into it. I understand that I lack the knowledge of coding but I believe so much in the idea and its success that I cant not act upon it! I will do what it takes to get my partner/resources in helping me achieve my vision.<p>I have not raised any money yet but I do know of many funding companies to submit my proposal to. As soon as I find my tech co-founder then he could help me hash out the idea some more, create my promo video & beta site and start attracting attention!<p>Yes, I know I have what it takes to manage this company, finding funding sources, keeping the vision, and strategically set goals!<p>So if anyone is down to get more details and help me perfect this concept, please contact me! I will be waiting patiently by.<p>& Thank you so much for your very informative & honest response! I really appreciate it.",1312326279.0

130,2839060,comment,2836585.0,2837636.0,1,0,draftkraft,,,"Probably the major difference is that Aloha Editor supports direct inline editing. You can edit dom elements directly without wraping the content in an iframe which leads to a different rendering (inline tags, css, etc). Further we did implement the HTML5 spec and a utility API (<a href=""https://github.com/alohaeditor/Aloha-Editor/blob/dev/src/lib/util/dom.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/alohaeditor/Aloha-Editor/blob/dev/src/lib...</a>) the helps implementers of plugins to write plugins that modify the dom in a HTML5 complaint way. There are some other new concepts available like ""scopes"" or ""blocks"". The floating for instance menu reacts on scopes like continoustext, link, image, table, tablerow, etc. You only the the interaction items that are availabe for that scope. That reduces the number of interaction item that are exposed to the user and still provide a huge amount of interaction items, where only the relevant ones are available at the right time. Block are non editable areas in editables which is a very common usecase for CMS systems. Blocks can be copy pasted, serialized and rendered async by AJAX calls from a backend.",1312326178.0
