20,1670526,comment,1665043.0,1666680.0,0,0,brc,,,"It was called the MSPT or Mining Super Profits Tax.<p>Super Profits is a Marxist term (don't know if Marx coined it, or it just became part of the canon) to reflect anything above a 'reasonable' rate of return.  In this case it was set at the government bond rate.  Which makes you question why any rational investor would invest money into a highly risky mining venture when they coudl get the same returns from government bonds.  I suspect they thought they could kick off a nasty class war - which people seem to have forgotten now that Swan was muzzled by Gillard and Rudd deposed.  But at the time Swan and Rudd were talking about 'evil foreign rich miners'.  But it backfired with some good PR from the mining companies, and a higher level of awareness among the Australian people when someone is being deliberately obtuse.<p>It was sleight of hand to link super profits tax with superannuation.  In reality the two have nothing to do with each other because employers pay for employee superannuation out of their bottom line.  The only superannuation the government pays is for public service employees.  The reason they did a poor job in selling it was because if you actually looked at the details, the tax and the superannuation actually had nothing to do with each other.  Lindsay Tanner actually quoted as much before changing his tune to the party line.<p>>slow the party down.<p>Imagine how much you would be upset if they decided to start taxing you extra because they thought you were doing too well.  It's the ultimate definition of unfair.  The miners struggled for decades - have a period of prosperity and are whacked with extra taxes.  That is not only unfair, it raises sovereign risk and ultimately reduces foreign investment.  You don't improve the economy by knobbling your best performer.",1283903628.0

See below.<p>""Sebum Secretion and Sebaceous Lipids"", Stewart et al, Dermatologic Clinics -- Vol. 1, No. 3, July 1983.<p>Sebum is an oily substance that is secreted onto the skin surface from glands located in the dermis. Although a number of useful functions have been proposed for sebum, proof that sebum performs any of them is lacking. In furred mammals an essential function of sebum is to supply 7-dehydrocholesterol, which is converted to vitamin D by the action of sunlight and then ingested by the animal as it grooms itself. In man, however, the location of 7-dehydrocholesterol has been shown to be the epidermis rather than sebum. Sebum may act as a waterproofing agent for fur, but humans obviously have little need for this function. Kligman has specifically disproved the notions that sebum improves the barrier function of skin, that sebum helps to regulate the water content of the horny layer by forming emulsions with sweat, or that sebum on the skin surface is fungistatic or antibacterial.(21) Kligman regards the human sebaceous glands as 'living fossils' that lost their usefulness to our species as we lost our fur.(21)<p>(21) Kligman, A. M.: The uses of sebum? In Montagna, W., Ellis, R. A., and Silver, A. F. (eds.): Advances in the Biology of Skin. Volume 4. Oxford, Pergamon Press, 1963.",1283902606.0

I can more accurately bill clients and easily keep track of the projects I'm working on because they tend to have things like built-in time trackers and integration with popular apps that perform other functions (e.g. project management) that excel doesn't. There is no way that I can do this without a lot more effort with a simple office suite. Alternatively, if I did use something like excel to keep track of these things for a month or two, I've now got to slowly migrate to some other alternative or find a way to input that kind of data into my new choice of app, and that's time wasted that didn't need to be. If you know you're going to do this, you may as well start with what you're going to use. I've switched apps mid-project before, and it was a huge pain to the point that the next time I switched to another app, I was stuck using both the old and the new until projects were finished, just because of the migration hassle. (For the record, the first one was a billing/invoicing one, second was my business to-do.)<p>On the flip side, I know people that keep track of these things in spreadsheets, they've done this for years, and that's their choice because they like it that way.
