Lets assume that we figure out how to maintain control over them so that they never revolt a la Terminator or Battle Star Galactica (re-imagined).<p>For one thing our purchasing power will go up. Or rather things will become so cheap to produce that we will probably  lose our drive to hoard material possessions. There will probably be no excuse for poverty.<p>What new things will we fight about? Certainly not wealth anymore. Probably religion: one group trying to tell the other group what to believe in or how to live their lives. The future will probably be stranger than fiction. Hope I can live long enough to see it.,1315612709.0

They also end up with two nice cars instead of one average one and probably eat out more than they could afford on one income.

If the list has size 1, the problem is trivially solved. Otherwise suppose we have a list (x:xs) and we recursively solve the problem for xs. If all the recursion returns is the random sample from xs, we clearly have insufficient information to take a random sample from (x:xs), so we need to strengthen the induction hypothesis by having the recursion also return the length of xs. Let (r', n') be the random sample and length for xs. Then the result for (x:xs) is (r, n) where n = n' + 1 and r = x with probability 1/n or else r'.<p>Another way to derive this algorithm is to notice that any solution must implicitly or explicitly compute the length of the list as a byproduct. If you start by writing down the recursive function for computing the length of a list, composed with the straightforward recursive function for taking a random sample from a list of known length, you can apply a standard fusion and deforesting transformation to combine them into a single pass, and you end up with the same algorithm as above.<p>Here's a fun problem to ponder.

64,2980216,comment,2979405.0,2979405.0,6,0,akeefer,,,"There's one question, regardless of if you believe this is ""fair"" or not, around whether structural inequality at this level is harmful to society regardless of fairness.  I tend to believe it is, based on historical precedent of what happens in highly unequal societies (it tends to not be good), but that's a separate question from the one about fairness.<p>To analyze whether this is ""fair"" or not, I think the best perspective there is Rawls's framework, which is the maxi-min idea.  To summarize, the idea is that inequality is okay to the extent that it improves the minimum position.  For example, if you start out with some totalitarian society where everyone makes $25k, it's okay for someone to start making $200k so long as it doesn't mean that someone else now makes less than $25k.  Economically, that comes out as something like:  it's okay for the top end of the wage spectrum to increase because they're producing more value and capturing that value for themselves.  It's not okay for them to increase because they're capturing value that other people are creating instead.  If someone making $500k starts making $1MM because they're producing $500k more in value, that's acceptable.  If they do that and they're only producing $300k more in value, and the other $200k increase is coming from other people's productivity increases, then that's not ""fair"" and shouldn't be acceptable.<p>So, which one is it?  Does anyone have a compelling argument?  In the financial sector, for example, I think it's pretty easy to argue that it's the latter:  people who privatize gains and socialize losses are enriching themselves far out of proportion to the value they create.  When it comes to startups and new businesses, it often works the other way, in that the person starting the business, even if they become hugely wealthy, does so by creating even more value than they capture.  I'm not sure it's obvious if what's been going on for the last 40 years is one way or another.",1315610401.0

Just because that's where the most income growth has been doesn't mean that that is where the growth has been produced, its just where it has been captured.<p>I think you are right in questioning what drives the inequality.  I do believe that some people are more productive and thus deserve additional income and wealth.  But i am not so sure that the amount of additional income that the very wealthy earn is actually proportional to their intrinsic productivity.  The issue is that capital tends to create more capital because you can 'put it to work' so the wealthy tend to become wealthier.  So the rich will naturally become richer because they have access to greater growth opportunities (though investing for instance they can capture growth produced by other companies).<p>Capitalism fundamentally favors people with excess capital.  This is what makes it very effective and efficient because it encourages risk and investment.  however it doesn't necessarily produce a fair system because the owners of capital have many means to capture and retain the returns of investment.<p>For example if in the proverbial pin factory innovations were made that allowed workers to be more efficient (say by specializing different aspects of the production of the pins) then all of a sudden the factory is more productive relative to the labor invested.  Now the question is who should capture the gains of that productivity.  Should it be the factory owner because he/she put up the initial investment, the factory workers because they are now more productive, the person who came up with the innovation?  It's not really clear but i think most people would agree that they all deserve some share of the additional profits.  The shift over the last 40 years has been that mostly its going to the owner (the capital investor) and the innovator and not the worker.  It's tough to determine exactly how the profits should be divided fairly, because fairness is so complicated in this instance.  This is one of the major benefits of labor unions because they provide a way for the workers to share in the additional wealth that they are helping to create.  Now obviously not all occupations should have unions and not all unions are effective, but this is the problem to which they are the solution, but you have to admit that its a problem first.",1315609307.0

As a larger amount of income goes to those who have more than enough money than enough already, the average savings ratio increases. This is a drag on aggregate demand that hurts the economy.<p>Supply side economists will tell you that savings are not a problem because investment will go up. But then why would somebody invest when the people who would be interested in your product don't have the money to buy it because they're poor? This is pretty much the situation we're in right now, where there is no shortage of capital, but rather a shortage of possibilities for profitable investments because consumers have become more careful with their spending.<p>(I realize that it may look different from where you are standing - I am not an insider in the tech startup scene - but that is the picture in the larger economy.)<p>Another question that I am less certain about is how inequality affects economies of scale. Basically, as society becomes more equal, the larger size of the potential customer base makes investments in efficient production techniques more viable. Of course, there is the other side of the coin, which is that rich people finance advanced technology out of boredom, e.g. space travel.",1315609244.0
