I've lived in Massachusetts (and New Jersey, California, and a bunch of other places that like to call themselves the ""worst drivers""), but everywhere I go, it seems apparent to me that road conditions and layout account for the huge majority of deviations from place to place.<p>For example, in New Jersey there are a ton of highways that don't have onramps (or about 15 feet of it). Because of this, there are a lot more (I mean a LOT more) collisions on the ""onramp"" and people generally are used to swerving in front of 65-mph traffic from a complete stop.<p>In California you have just as many people (or maybe more) who swerve in and out of lanes at unreasonable speeds, but since there are so many lanes and since they're all so fantastically wide, that sort of behavior doesn't get punished as it might, say, on the Mass Pike or the Garden State Parkway. At the same time, city roads in California (at least in OC) tend to have much higher speed limits.

This can be goodsomething new inevitably gets discovered over timebut it also has a fundamental weakness, in that most scientists toil in obscurity with the public never understanding the relevance of their work, and thus never applying it outside their original domain.<p>I'm not sure the output of scientific positivism <i>can</i> be well-indexed, to the point where anyone can find all the relevant pre-existing work they could build upon in their own: as there is no one big point where something new is discovered, but rather a lot of little facts and confirmed/refuted hypotheses that snowball until a meta-analysis of several studies can actually say something for certain, there's no one thing for a scientific expert system/communications tool to return to you. I expect, to have such a thing at scale, we'd need an actual human-level AI that ""read"" and understood the significance of every study in every field, and could see all the cross-correlations.<p>Before the advent of scientific positivism, though, we had a sort of ritualized science, where we would get large groups of people all studying one thing or another, out looking for proof or disproof of whatever particular thing they currently believed, leaping around wildly in hypothesis-space rather than just edging forward and taking whatever facts came along. There would be scientific belief ""movements,"" in the same way that there are artistic ""movements."" Because it was ritualized, science was able to be made an entertaining talk of at the time, similar to celebrity gossipeveryone would have their own opinion on whether the currently-researched belief held true or not, and would debate it constantly, increasing public awareness of the subject; a ""named hero"" scientist would later come with a sweeping experiment and prove one or the other group right, and would be heralded by that group and have some unit of measure, chemical element, or heavenly body named after them.<p>Ritualized science didn't necessarily advance human knowledge ""as a whole"" very quicklythe iterative assembly-line process we have now seems to work quite well for thatbut it did seem to get each new scientific fact thoroughly embedded in the public consciousness, because of what is basically good <i>social game design</i>. Perhaps we need some more of that, some hybrid model where scientists <i>can</i> still be ""heroes"" with ""rivals"" in the public eye, entertaining and informing in conjunction and raised up with social status, rather than simply workers for government grants raised up only with citations in journals?<p>As a screwy tangent: perhaps this could even be a facade on top of current science, a sort of staggered release of scientific knowledge in high-assurance bursts, with the rest of the ""development"" going on in some scientific ""closed alpha"" where the public wouldn't be constantly bombarded with overzealous summations every time the ratchet was turned (basically a justification for Yudkowsky's ""Bayesian Conspiracy."") When a scientific hypothesis was made theory, it would be handed off on stone tablets to a researcher well-trained in rhetoric with a nice-sounding last name, and they would become, to the public, ""the one who discovered the theory of X."" Only the conspiracy would know that it was the work of thousands.",1312240835.0

The examiners are incentivized to close cases, not to make the right decisions.  So if you badger an examiner enough you can get them to sign off on just about anything, e.g. U.S. patents 6368227 and 7126691.",1312240061.0
