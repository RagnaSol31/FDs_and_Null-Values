4,10029011,comment,10027867.0,10028581.0,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,">I defend that using the word &quot;proof&quot; in the context of scientific theories is misleading. It invites people to suspend doubt, which is precisely the opposite of the scientific stance. Religions deal in absolute truth. Science is something much better than that, precisely because it is rationally humble.<p>Science is fundamentally subject to abductive, statistical reasoning.  As such, the whole &quot;doubt&quot; and &quot;humility&quot; shtick wears out once you get to well-tested ideas.<p>We do not have &quot;some evidence&quot; that &quot;supports&quot;, for instance, our conclusion that the Earth orbits the sun.  We can simply say that <i>all available</i> evidence supports such a statement.  We can imagine some chance, some probability, that the statement is wrong, but that probability involves revoking so very much of our established corpus of scientific observations that it makes no odds.  In well-established matters like these, underconfidence in colloquial speech is every bit as misleading as overconfidence in bleeding-edge research.",1439078375.0

Eventually they <i>will</i> get saturated. In large scheme of things, cities are artifact of ancient times when transportation was hard and natural landscape for habitat was scarce.
