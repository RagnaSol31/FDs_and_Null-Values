Most sites will see a huge performance improvement by just concatenating (bundling) their JavaScript and CSS. Tools like; YUICompressor and www.rockstarapps.com Eclipse tools simplify the process.<p>One issue I have found is that developers always leave performance tuning of all projects to the end.",1245801560.0

4,671359,comment,670836.0,670836.0,0,0,skmurphy,,,"This is an outstanding idea and distinct from current GoogleDocs or other wiki implementations precisely because it's asymmetric (one owner, many commenter/editors). I think you could enable a business model based on remote copy editing by 3rd party labor where the owner has the ability to accept or reject the changes. I can definitely see this as being offered as an alternative to the basic browser WYSIWYG editor for blog and wiki systems where the user ask for help with final edits or copy editing. I see a lot of potential for this. We did some research a while back for a wiki startup and this supports a mode that some prospects were asking for which wikis today do not support: an individual owns the page and can accept or reject additions/edits. This is different from the wiki model but appropriate for many projects (or as a finishing step where a lot of peer review/development has already taken place in the wiki).",1245801426.0

22,671340,comment,668381.0,669441.0,0,0,jcl,,,"Yes, ALGOL-derived languages contain English words, and chunks of code can be read as English if you imagine the right words being inserted, but the same is true of Scheme code, and to about the same extent.  In fact, it's true of most programming languages.  The languages that it is most true of -- languages like Ada, Cobol, Inform, etc. -- are not notable as good beginners' languages.<p>Here, for example, is typical C code, right out of K&R:<p><pre><code>  for (count = 0; count < MAX; count++)\n    printf(""\narr[%d] = %d."", count, arr[count]);\n</code></pre>\nTo read this in English, you need to fabricate a lot of words, like this: <i>""Repeat</i> for <i>several times, first initializing</i> count <i>to</i> zero, <i>as long as</i> count <i>is less than</i> MAX <i>and, after each step, taking</i> count <i>and adding one to it: call the</i> printf <i>function with the arguments...""</i>.  How is that exercise any worse for the equivalent PLT Scheme code?<p><pre><code>  (for ([count (in-range 0 MAX)])\n    (display (format ""\narr[~a] = ~a."" count (vector-ref arr count))))\n</code></pre>\nAn English translation of C's ""while"" statement is easier; the ""switch"" statement is harder; a C function declaration is nearly impossible without sounding awkward.  Yes, <i>actual</i> ALGOL would be easier translate to English than C, but there are even less people starting with ALGOL than with your hypothetical assembler -- which suggests that the real reason people start with the languages they do is primarily because the languages are popular, not because of the degree of similarity to English.",1245800287.0
