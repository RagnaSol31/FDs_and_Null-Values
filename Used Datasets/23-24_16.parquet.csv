The point is that you should have a product people want AND be sales oriented.<p>Are there times when it's rational to start a business that's not sales oriented? Absolutely. But you better have a damn good reason.<p>For example, let's say your product is a search engine that returns results structured in the way people learn. And what's more, it's so obvious that your search engine is better that a huge percentage of people who use it instantly switch their default homepage. Now this is a good example of when you might want to start a business without a sales plan. But starting a business like this is like planning a breech birth, so you better have a good reason.",1258501680

They may very well invest a huge amount of capital into infrastructure upgrades but how much of that actually translates to real world improvements is unknown. I'm not sure Verizon is all that much better off in this respect but they happened to deploy a more scalable technology better suited for data long before the demand was a reality.
