6,851593,comment,851315.0,851315.0,0,0,collint,,,">Look at the evidence. Look at MIT or Stanford’s online admissions guidelines for homeschoolers. They don’t want high school diplomas. They don’t want some perfect equivalent of 4 years of high school classes. They want teens who have taken personal initiative and designed meaningful, independence-building activities for themselves. They want teens who have boldly explored the realms of business, international travel, and college-level research prior to convincing themselves that they actually need college. Traditional high school is very often a handicap in pursuing these character traits. And while not every college has explicit homeschool admissions policies like MIT and Stanford, the logic remains the same: colleges want dynamic, innovative teens who leave the cookie-cutter approach behind for greener pastures.<p>As an ""unschooler"" I received similar advice from advisors and admissions.<p>In the end I didn't go to college, I found it wasn't for me.   I couldn't stand the thought of another four years of before cutting my teeth in the ""real world."" I just couldn't take anybody's word that they were going to give me the best preparation for what was to come next.<p>I just had to dive in.<p>It's not for everybody, but we can do more to help students whose time is wasted in school.<p>If one is better suited to jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire these are 4-6 years of experience s/he will never get back.",1254268470
