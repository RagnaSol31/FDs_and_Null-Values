It also gives credible explanations of most of the equity-related issues at that stage.<p>In my experience, very few employees who get option grants will ask the right questions to understand what their equity piece really means. That is, they won't even ask about something as basic as how many shares a company has outstanding (much less about size of equity pool, liquidation preference held by the preferred classes, etc.). When they fail to get this information, they really are going into the employment with poor knowledge about what likely will wind up being the most piece of their overall compensation.<p>Why don't they ask? Sometimes they just don't know how it all works and proceed out of ignorance. More often, however, I think they feel intimidated about pushing a company to disclose what they think is company confidential information, especially when the company is a big-name company that is already VC-funded and the offer otherwise seems tempting.<p>Because of this, startups will sometimes play games in this area, arbitrarily inflating the size of the company's capitalization structure (e.g., splitting a 10M capitalization structure 3 or 4 for 1 to turn it into a 30M or 40M-share structure). This splitting lets the company make a 100K share offer to a key employee sound like a 200K share offer and hence make it appear better than competing offers from companies working from smaller capitalization structures.<p>It amazes me how many times employees will simply accept such offers thinking they got better deals than they would have from other companies, when in fact they may have passed up equal or better alternative offers. This is truly a case of flying blind but it happens a lot.",1263771171.0

I'm sure it's been a real learning experience for everyone who participated, especially those who have been watching closely. I wonder if I should write up a ""lessons learned"" blog post.<p>If you step back you'll see that it's amazing how the HN community got together to collaborate and provide feedback, and now people attempting to improve on the initial idea of all the co-founder data in a flat table on Google Docs spreadsheet.<p>Ultimately we'll see if the market decides if they want something other than a flat tabular data or not.<p>That's why we're all here, right? We want to ""make something people want"".<p>p.s. shoutout to Paul from UCSD who's graduating and is helping out 280 North (I met him for coffee after we found each other, thanks to the Google Docs).",1263769498.0

That too is a better outcome than having someone blunder on a site not meant to have serious information when performing a search that might be expected to turn up reliable information.",1263769440.0

It's vastly better at some things than the iPhone but doesn't have the App Store :(.  You can still find most applications that you need but games are not as good.",1263769347.0
