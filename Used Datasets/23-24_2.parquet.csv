I just wasn't a very good programmer any more. Lisp's power\nhad made me complacent, and the world had passed me by. Looking back, I\nactually don't think I was ever a very good programmer. I just happened\nto have the good fortune to recognize a good thing when I saw it, and\nused the resulting leverage to build a successful career. But I credit\nmuch of my success to the people who designed Common Lisp.""<p>Yeah. I can attest to that. Many non-lisper friends have learned to do very difficult things while <i>I</i> personally remained ignorant of them because I never needed them. This is analogous to how being a fortune 100 CEO is bad for your health compared to being a day laborer; you no longer sweat and work your muscles, you no longer get the necessary daily vitamin D from sun rays, your hands are not as manly and rugged, etc.<p>Yeah, but then you can afford a chartered JetStream to fly you to the Bahamas for 2 hours of Jungle Gym and back.<p>Ron Garret just wishes 37Signals to fork SBCL and get us Lispers some hype :-P McCLIM windows with rounded corners FTW!",1238803197

This, in turn, will hopefully lead to hub-bridging between cities, which basically will transform the internet from being the scale-free network it currently is into the scalable network it should be. At that point, current ISPs will be forced to dramatically alter their business plan, because it is impossible for them to keep their current business plan with a non scale-free network.",1238801829

Magical thinking won't stop you from being a good business person with good instincts for opportunities who understands the bottom line, or from being a great sales guy who can close faster than a bank at 4.<p>The subset of hackers who can learn ""business"" is greater than the subset of business people who can be hackers because the particular style of thinking needed to succeed as a hacker has a unique rigor and need for persistence, and is comparatively rare.<p>This is true for comparing any less common skill to a more common one.
