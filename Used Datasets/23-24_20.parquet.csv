Find X, A, and B, where 2(X-A*E16+A+BE16-B)=X<p>That way, you can at least get each digit on one side, which might make it a more tractable problem. This is very frustrating! It's easy to narrow it down a  whole lot, but it's still going to be intractable.",1238022497

Despite the title, that's an interesting observation. I for one didn't think live video would be as big.<p><i>So most of its audience and growth is global, with particular strength in Spain, Brazil, Germany, and the UK.</i><p>I'm pleasantly surprised Brazil has that much broadband penetration.",1238022305

And 20/19 = 1 + 1/19, which means that 2/19 is a single rotation away.<p>If you've ever noticed that 142857 * [1..6] produces different rotations of the same number and wondered why, you might have thought about this.  Dyson had probably already done all the hard work on the problem and knew immediately that the answers were rotations of some repeating fraction, and one where multiplying by 2 gives rotations by 1 digit.",1238022276

Some amateurs might have read more about the issue than the self-proclaimed experts.<p>And if non-experts are not qualified to speak, how do you justify letting them vote?
