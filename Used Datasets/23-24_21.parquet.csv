They buy wine they've never had before for $5 or $10.  They order food for $5 or $10 or $50 from restaurants they've never been to before.  People will even spend $50 or $60 on a game they may or may not like, as long as it's for their computer or their console and not their iPhone.  Life is full of uncertainty like that, and most of it costs way, way more than any iPhone applications do.<p>My point is that people who wouldn't balk at spending that kind of money on something else that they may or may not like/use will freak out about an iPhone app that costs that much, and I really don't think there's any rational reason for it:  it has nothing to do with uncertainty or expected value, but rather people have just been conditioned to expect that apps are free or $0.99 because the app store is flooded with those apps (just like people expect web-apps to be free just because lots of other web-apps are free), and that's a shame since it makes it that much harder for all the developers that are working on making great applications.",1237334013.0

The thing is that these benefits are diffuse enough (though they are measurable) that no single commercial entity can afford the risk that they might not be able to capture those benefits.<p>The blinkered view that all public spending is automatically evil prevents clear discussion of the possible alternatives. Not all public spending is equal, some projects deliver more overall benefit than others.<p>I guess my take is that those who are strident in their distaste for any public spending are patsies in the hands of the special interests who are trying to capture as much of the benefits of public spending as possible.",1237333506.0

It was not a startup, so the cash flow from existing business easily supported the one-year timeframe.  (We did the design in our 'spare time' when we weren't busy with day-to-day work.)<p>No industrial design (very utilitarian product, simple molds), and we had someone with a bit of molding experience.  Had to go outside for mold design and construction, of course.  We went with hard steel, single cavity, half a dozen molds all in, but I'd certainly go with aluminum (for the initial production) if I were to do it over again.  I'm thinking we spent just over $100k on mold stuff before we had our first test shots.  Talk about an exciting UPS package!  ;-)<p>Our product didn't require much certification, so we saved there as well.<p>Not only are the first 100 electronic widgets much more expensive, it (was?) hard to get them made because our usual suppliers weren't set up for a low-volume job, and we didn't have existing relationships with the more proto-oriented CM.  I did a lot of soldering that year.<p>It would be much easier today, especially with so many cheap dev/eval/reference kits on the electronics side and the rise of quick turn mold shops such as Quick Parts and Protomold.<p>Hardware is a real blast.  Nothing quite like seeing those molded parts once they start coming in in pallet quantities!",1237332934.0

35,520812,comment,519619.0,519619.0,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"The big overlap between mathematics and programming is proof\nby mathematical induction. The standard example in\nmathematics is proving that<p>1+2+...+n = n(n+1)/2<p>The proof has two parts, first is it true for small values\nof n, and second does truth for a large value follow from\ntruth for all small values.<p>Well, 1+2+3 = 6 and 3x(3+1)/2 = 6, so small n is looking good.<p>What about general n? Can we get the formula for n from the\nformula for earlier n, perhaps n-1?<p>Suppose we already knew 1+2+...+(n-1) = (n-1)((n-1)+1)/2 = n(n-1)/2.<p>Adding n to n(n-1)/2 does indeed produce n(n+1)/2 so gives\nus the second part and completes the proof.<p>The standard example in programming is writing a fast\nsorting routine.  Given data x1,x2,...,xn pick one item,\nperhaps x1, as the pivot and work through the data\naccumulating two lists, big and little, of data larger than\nand smaller than the pivot. Join the sorted versions of\nbig and little with the pivot in between.<p>The algorithm works because it works for small n as special\ncases and works for larger n by breaking the big case into\nsmaller subcases.<p>A list with only one item is inherently sorted and a list\nwith exactly two items is easily sorted by swapping them if\nneeded.<p>A list with n items gets broken into a pivot and two lists\nbig and little.  Both lists are less than n long. Even in\nthe lopsided case that one is empty the other is only n-1\nlong because we have taken out the pivot. So the sorting\nroutine is going to work because it works for smaller cases,\nby just the same logic that underlies mathematical\ninduction.<p>School mathematics has a misleading focus on\ncomputation. University mathematics is focused on proof.<p>In programming we tend to keep the proofs in our heads and\nnot write them down. The reason for this is that computers\nneed a great deal of handholding and babysitting. A computer\nprogram is mostly made of details that spell things out for\nthe computer in detail. These details are typically\nmathematically shallow. Provided we have not made any small\nslips with the details the program will work and obviously\nso.<p>On the other hand, interesting programs have tricky bits\nthat are not mathematically shallow. How do you write those?\nYou need to think like a mathematician writing a proof. You\nneed to find bases cases and inductive steps.<p>Mathematics and programming are different but mutually\nilluminating. There is a very close connection between a\nmathematic proof and the explanation of why a tricky\ncomputer program works. Learning how to create mathematical\nproofs will help you with writing tricky programs and\nvice-versa.<p>The most important example is calculus. Many mathematics\nstudents struggle with calculus. It is a useful exercise\n(perhaps for 16 to 18 year olds) to write your own computer\nprograms for numerical differentiation and for symbolic\ndifferentiation and to get the two to agree as closely as\nrounding error permits. Much that is obscure about calculus\nthen becomes clear.<p>The overlap of mathematics and programming is very clear in\nformalisms such as ACL2\n<a href=""http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/</a> which use a\ncomputer programming language as a logic in which\nmathematical theorems are stated and proven.
