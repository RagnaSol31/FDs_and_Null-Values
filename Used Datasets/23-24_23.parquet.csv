The meaning, I think, is that in the end the church* will be judged by its works: the disciples who fed the poor and did nice things to the least of society were promoted, while the ""goat"" disciples who refused to be kind to others, were sent away.<p>Most people don't really care whether Obama believes in Zombie Jesus, but they care about whether his interpretation of believing in Jesus leads to actions which they deem unacceptable or unkind to themselves or others. Obama, McCain and Palin are all judged by their actions, not their faith.<p>[PS: Jesus never said anything anyone who wasn't already ""part of his flock"" to begin with. He judges his own Church the harshest out of anybody. Don't let anyone tell you the fire and brimstone is meant for the unbelievers -- it's always been meant for the flock]",1222732691.0

Just a thought.<p>Second, Palin's beliefs are far outside of the mainstream. Mainstream Christians don't reject the most basic findings of science; plenty of mainstream Christians believe in evolution, the big bang, and quantum mechanics.

Banks don't lend more than they have in their vaults, they just have less in their vaults than the sum of their depositors' accounts.<p>That's tangential to your main point, which seems to be an objection to a perpetually increasing amount of money that only exists as numbers in a computer backed by nothing. That only becomes a problem in a severe recession, where the rate of wealth creation slows so much that loans can't be paid back. The system breaks, and governments have to intervene to fix it. This isn't done by just giving banks money, as you suggest. The government typically takes over the banks. The proposed bailout involves buying assets, but it's still not giving banks money.<p>That is only a problem if you think we'd be better off with the slower economic growth that would result from banning fractional reserve banking. We're not. A system that breaks on a regular basis sounds like a bad idea, but you still have to compare it with the alternative before you condemn it.",1222731432.0

It may in fact be that many of them are destined to fail, and that many of them shouldn't have been in business in the first place, but the people that allowed them to get in over their heads - that would be the collective American republic - have a duty to make sure they fall as gently as possible. By temporarily putting trust back into the credit markets, this bill would have bought the time to explore the options.<p>To simply pull the rug out from under the little guy is a violation of the contract that the government has with its people.",1222729474.0

Over time, faiths like the Church of England (and on another level the Catholic Church) became dull bureaucratic institutions which nobody really took seriously, whereas in America there arose a tradition that if you don't quite take your own church's beliefs seriously you can start up a new, slightly different, church down the road.<p>Supporting this idea is the fact that while Catholics in the US make up a fairly large portion of the population, the vast majority of the real religious craziness comes from the many varieties of protestantism.",1222729449.0

Total money in the world increases, the economy grows, but it's a con, a mirage, a convenient consensual fiction. A system based on eternal growth, which relies on pushing around ever increasing debt for its very existence, where repaying the total debt would require giving the banks back all the money they ever loaned plus all the stuff in the world to the value of the conjured extra.
