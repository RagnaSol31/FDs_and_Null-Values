By the end of 1959 IBM had delivered the 1401 and the 7090 both transistorized.  The 1401 was the mainstay of the business world until the advent of the 360 in 1965.  The 1401 and 7090 were q dynamite combination where the 1401 served as an offline peripheral controller for the 7090.  The 7094 was my first computer. Baseball was my first computer game, played on the console switches and displayed on the accumulator and index register displays. (My first video game was Space Wars on a PDP 1.)",1235948564.0

There's lots of touch-screen-y stuff and shared screens.<p>But given that tablet technology has not proved its usefulness where it is available, I'm not sure if making more common would make it more useful.<p>Sure, it's nice to see a video of programs responding to a gesture according to what the person apparently wants. No one has yet created an environment where that happens (the iPhone GUI is a perhaps closest).",1235948501.0
