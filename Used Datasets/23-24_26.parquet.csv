There aren't many non-apple users (classifying them as people who already own an Apple system, but want the improved portability the netbook formfactor affords) who are interesting in taking the time or energy to hackintosh their netbook. These people are saying, as loud as they can ""Apple! We love your platform, make some hardware like a netbook and we will buy it! For goodness sakes, look at all the trouble we're going through to simulate it!""<p>Apple doesn't even have to R&D the netbook formfactor. They don't have to work with chip vendors to come up with lowpower chips and chipsets, or downgraded low power GPUs. They literally have to do nothing except get Jonny Ive to cook up a unibody case and put OSX on them. Charge $400 instead of $350 and they have and Apple netbook.<p>But Apple can't find the margins in the product line and the equation means that they have no offering for this huge hole in their lineup.",1257203185.0

I like the idea and I think its more intuitive than some of the comments would suggest.<p>This reminds me of these interactive CD-ROM books that my little sister used growing up (shes 18 now).  One thing that I liked at the time was how interactive the books were.  Users could click on background imagery to engage little animations, etc.<p>Do you have any plans to make the site more interactive?  Something very simple like highlighting the word as its being read (think of Karaoke) would add a lot of educational value and help, at least marginally with reading.<p>I see this service as not only replacing the parent when they're away, but also as a standalone educational platform for kids.  You can even incorporate ages to scale the complexity of the interaction.  So for younger kids, clicking a carton bunny may just show a bubble with the word ""rabbit"" while older kids get something more advanced.<p>Are armed services the target group?  Have you seen interest from users who aren't away on such extended leaves?<p>I wonder how useful this service is for parents who only make 1-3 day business trips.",1257203153.0
