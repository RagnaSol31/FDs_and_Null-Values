Sure, we can have a long debate about whether the Pirate Bay is legal or not under different interpretations of the law, but I think it's reasonable to say that such a site is of questionable legality if for no other reason than it being a somewhat new phenomenon that, until the recent case, really hadn't seen a lot of law spelling out exactly what was and wasn't ok.<p>NFS hasn't been at the center of any big controversy and they're more motivated by ideals than by profits.

When people err, in my experience, they seem to err in the direction of overestimating. They don't even bother to consider opportunities unless there is a connection involved, and they ignore red-flags they discover along the recruitment path simply because they have a connection there who downplays them. Often as not, they end up unhappy, but suffer through it because their only out is through more connections they don't yet have.<p>Sometimes, you have to look beyond the people you know.",1244589172.0

Competence never entered the picture; even when I would ask about it, I was always told ""it's not what you know, it's who you know,"" as if to reassure themselves as much as to admonish me. In some cases, the recommendations are truly noble-minded, but never underestimate the social pressure people have to practice nepotism.<p>I will caveat this by saying I've been hired in one or two places where the recruitment tango started through a recommendation. One of those places, it stopped mattering as soon as the phone screen began. The other, well, the person who recommended me was the hiring manager, so I'm not sure that counts. :-)",1244588557.0
