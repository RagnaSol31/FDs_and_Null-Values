How do I automate a functional test? I talk to the people who run the test manually. How do I learn how to do this and that with a given box? I talk to the engineers who designed it.<p>""I'd google it"" is the wrong, right answer. It's the right answer because you should have some ability to research things you don't know. It's wrong because there's no way Google will teach you what you need to know.

People at singles bars don't act remotely ""themselves.""  The guys are puffy and douchey.  The girls are silly and giddy (or drunk and slutty.)  There's no point in picking someone up in a singles bar unless you don't give a crap what they're really like, because they're acting completely differently than they would in any other context.  Basically, singles bars only work for the people who are in heat, hook up, and have sex.  If you don't get laid, then all you get out of it is the name and phone number of someone who is essentially a total stranger whom you know nothing about.<p>That's why people give up on singles bars, except for guys who are hot or slick enough to get laid and the girls who are actually looking for sex and not a boyfriend (or who think that having one-night stands is a good way of looking for a boyfriend.)  Most guys are disillusioned when they figure out they're not getting sex, just phone numbers from girls who look a lot less interesting in sunlight and sobriety.  Most girls are disillusioned when they figure out that the only way to get any attention is to act like they're in the mood to put out if they meet the right guy.  Both sexes are disillusioned when they realize they want their sexuality to be an integral part of who they are, not an entirely separate aspect of their personality, an inner douchebag/hoebag that comes out at night and does embarrassing, tasteless things.",1244676554.0

You match people using collaborative filtering techniques based on your social network profile (bayesian filtering, for example. . .). Then you via gps on your cell phone. IE, if two likely matches happen to be geographically close to each other, the cell phone tells both of you ""hey, you guys would be a good match . . . would you like to hook up at a nearby coffee place?"". If both say yes, the cell phone will allow you to meet at a local coffee place (or whatever).<p>The point is is to have a weird excuse to interact briefly. Just by a brief encounter one can know if that person is his/her type.",1244675445.0

I wanted to be there.<p>But as I've learned more about the limitations of our understanding, our biology, and computers I've realized that this isn't something that will be happening any time soon without some amazing breakthroughs.  I don't expect the Singularity to happen my lifetime, and I'm still in my 20s.<p>We really understand very little about the brain.  We don't know exactly how neurons work and the most information we can get from the brain is on the order of 1-7 BITS per second when sampling from implanted electrodes.  It's also not a lack of data.  We don't even know how to fully decode the data we already have.<p>Our understanding of AI really is pretty poor.  Knowledge representation and machine learning has become a hard enough task that many researchers are back to developing algorithms for specific tasks, which embeds the knowledge of the researcher in the algorithm, precluding the system from learning anything truly novel.<p>They say we can't see past the Singularity because things will change too much and too fast.  Right now we can't even see the Singularity because too many things would have to change too much and quite fast.",1244675399.0
