On the order of the category headers, I'll implement that today.<p>On the ""how to hire"" me comment, I've struggled with whether to put more info out there as the original point of the site was so that I could understand what blogging was about (and providing a public service by demystifying things for entrepreneurs).  While I have been cold-contacted by a couple of entrepreneurs who have gone on to raise venture financing, I also end up getting contacted by a lot of people who will likely not be successful.  I've generally taken the attitude that you have to kiss a lot of frogs in order to find a prince, but some people who have cold-contacted might know that I constantly joke about having to weed out potential axe-murderers.  I'll probably add an FAQ in the near future to address how to engage attorneys and how much things cost.",1228521278.0

It is based on the Drudge Report which I discovered recently--except that our site's content will pertain to environmental issues and hopefully appeal to the large and environmentally conscious populace. Drudge Report rakes in 3,000,000 unique visitors a month, using a very simplistic design. I figure there's potentially similar audiences to be tapped in other areas. I've assessed that Drudge's audience may not be the most tech savvy (or at least less savvy as people here. Or they'd be here, right?) but I could be wrongâ€”Drudge readers please chime in!\nSo now that the fruits of our labors have materialized we're a slightly at a loss from where to go from here, since we're lacking in marketing experience.<p>In what ways can we reach and retain the largest environmentally conscious audience possible with the goal of making gaiareport.com(a plug, I know) a reliable and appealing environmental news source?<p>Please share thoughts!
