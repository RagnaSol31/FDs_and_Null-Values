I do promise though to donate the next spare one I get.<p>2. It's a laptop, so turning it into an aquarium is not going to work. Poor fish.<p>3. The reaon that it's spare and not donatable is that the screen connection is very very loose and so the Force of Duct Tape is what's keeping it alive.<p>What I've decided to do based on the replies:<p>1. Install Linux (of course) and set up a central backup server, attach the house's printer to it, and attach the current external backup drive.<p>2. Turn it into a media server. I'll be trying both MythTV and XBMC and will report later.<p>3. I will donate the spare CPU cycles to Folding@Home, at least initially. BOINC and other distributed computing projects will get time. Maybe I'll cycle once a month.<p>Thank you again :)",1231804284.0

She asked him what he'd do on terrorism and illegal immigrants, he went to answer and then she starts arguing in the middle of his reply.<p>How political debates are handled in the UK where I grew up and found my interest in politics are: you stand up, ask the question you've got, they reply and, I've seen this numerous times, the questioner will stand back up and say ""that's not what I asked..."" I remember it with Tony Blair, he did it 3 times in a row to the <i>same</i> guy and it was like WTF you're showing everyone on national TV that you fully ignore people when they ask a question you don't like. I believe the question was on why we entered the Iraq war after it had come out that there weren't WMD's and that (IIRC) MI5 had declared they highly doubted the existence of any WMD's in Iraq months before the war. Tony Blair basically kept saying they did it because Saddam Hussein had WMD's.<p>Obama in that video was asked a question, but the woman tried to stop him from answering, obviously she'd already made up her mind that <i>whatever</i> he said wasn't the answer she wanted because she never even listened.",1231801667.0
