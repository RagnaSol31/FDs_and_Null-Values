As I understand it (I tested for standing, so I can't claim first-hand knowledge), 2110 does a very good job of combining the relevant parts of ECE2030 and the C bits of CS2130. That, to me, makes it a solid replacement for those concepts.<p>The first time 3240 was taught, Olin was the professor teaching it. It covered a fair chunk of the material you'd expect to see in CS4510 that semester while also being an excellent class on lexers, parsers, and interpreters (not so much on compilers, but of course it's not a compilers course). I can comfortably say that it was by far the most interesting and educational course I took during my undergrad career. Since Olin's unfortunate departure, 3240 has apparently turned into just another lexer and parser course.<p>On the whole I'd say the changes they made w.r.t. CS2130 were good. However...<p>Threads has made it so that you can get a CS degree without taking an algorithms or data structures course above the 1000 level, which I find wholly disappointing.

I wouldn't want to run a database off of it, but for a bunch of text files it's perfectly adequate. A lot of people are fans of truecrypt and if you are seriously concerned about devoted efforts to get at high-value data you probably want to just encrypt the disk partition you are using.<p>This post <a href=""http://www.debianadmin.com/filesystem-encryption-tools-for-linux.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.debianadmin.com/filesystem-encryption-tools-for-l...</a> has a fairly good introduction to the most popular flavours.

Some of the more useful additions include:<p><pre><code>  * Git hooks for ""official"" commits\n  * Hooks for when automated tests break after a commit\n  * /ping and ""pong!"" client response to see who's at their desk (I don't work in\n  an open concept office)\n  * Times during the day (typing break, lunch, etc)\n  * Notifications from members that need someones specific attention using notify-\n  osd and (optionally) a system beep.\n</code></pre>\nI also built this system because external chats are blocked, but internal multicast cannot be blocked, and doesn't go against IT guidelines :)",1250291334

(i.e. functional languages, procedural languages, etc) Teaching <i>only</i> C and C-like languages is encouraging a monoculture. It doesn't matter whether or not they will <i>use</i> Lisp or SmallTalk in the real world. The idea is for them to come away with ideas and concepts they would not have been exposed to otherwise. I mean this <i>is</i> a university and not a vocational school. I would expect university students to be exposed to more ideas (even if they are ideas that never get commonly applied in the real world) than someone coming out of a vocational school. {/edit}",1250290803
