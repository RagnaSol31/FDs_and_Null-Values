So that if you add or remove an index, you don't need to adjust all the queries on the table, for example. Obviously the query planner is imperfect, but planner hints are fairly common in practice.

Isn't GROUP BY very similar to reduce? SELECT UPPER(firstname) is map? With the ability to define custom functions in different languages that's a fairly powerful tool. Also, comparisons between MapReduce and SQL are misguided, because MapReduce does not operate on tabular data.<p>Finally, your solution is based entirely on the idea that people will prefer Lisp to SQL.<p>SQL is not perfect for everything, but if you want to suggest a better alternative, start with a solid argument.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix",
