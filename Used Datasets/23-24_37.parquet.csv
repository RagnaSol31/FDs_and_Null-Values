11,1544642,comment,1544338.0,1544338.0,0,0,dieterrams,,,"Coding speed depends heavily on how familiar you are with the problem domain, language, libraries, and code base, and the quality of documentation for things you are not familiar with. It depends on the complexity of the task, and whether you have a sufficiently high-level roadmap that separates your task into meaningful, independent chunks. (The appropriate level can be something as high as MVC, or as low as various parts within a function.) Creating a roadmap of chunks is extremely helpful for any relatively complex task, because when you start working on one, you know exactly what you need to focus on and what not to. The alternative is fumbling your way through vaguely defined requirements, your brain lost in a haze of concerns that may not be relevant, with the likely result being poorly written and organized code.<p>Then there's your brain's state, dependent on all sorts of things like your health, wakefulness, nearness of deadlines, etc. Some of this can be easily manipulated, e.g. by listening to good coding music, meditating, drinking coffee, etc. Pair programming can also speed up coding considerably (though at the expense of having two programmers focused on the same thing instead of working simultaneously on different things). Part of this is because when a peer is looking over your shoulder, you approach coding as more of a performance, and thus don't lapse into idleness or reading Hacker News. Another part is that when you run into roadblocks, and need to, say, look up documentation, the two of you can cover more ground faster. There are a lot of other benefits that have been covered well by others, so I won't go into them.<p>I also find that when I start something new, whether a new project or a new part within a project, I'm usually very, very slow to get into it. I've discovered that this can usually be circumvented by focusing on some minimal first step, which gives you enough of a toehold with which to immerse yourself in the project/problem. Once you've reached that point, the hard part is stopping.",1280015364.0

For one simple reason: the source code is (hopefully) the only thing pretty much guaranteed to survive.<p>I have seen countless shops where valuable history was lost because it was stored on someone's c: drive, a network drive, or some repository that failed to survive some kind of migration.  And even if these other files (digital or paper) did survive, chances are that the programmer that needed to see them never did anyway.<p>Good shops practice keeping audit trails <i>in the source code</i>.  This means good commenting.  Which means good code review and quality control.<p>I recently came across a single piece of code that had been changed back and forth 6 times in the previous 2 years.  The comments looked something like:<p><pre><code>  * jeo 02/11/09 Use Ship Date, not Book Date per Sarah in Sales\n  * jrm 04/15/09 Use Book Date to make military contracts balance\n  * msl 08/24/09 Use Ship Date per Joe in Ops (military no longer active)\n  * jrm 12/13/09 Use Book Date per Rick Smith to prepare for new contracts\n  * jrm 02/14/10 Use Ship Date per Rick Smith after Ops meeting\n  * jrm 05/25/10 Use Book Date per Rick Smith until Q3 migration\n</code></pre>\nI know that this is an extreme example, but this stuff happens all the time in commercial environments.  How easy do you think it would be for the programmer/analyst to provide background if these comments were not in the source code, but somewhere else?<p>Sure it's a pain it the ass to maintain this, but it immediately provides the needed background to the person who needs it, when he needs, where he's already working.

He also has a simple definition for talent in writing: ""If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented.""

Whoever you bring on board as a marketing expert will ask you these questions (if he doesn't, you don't hire them.)<p>If you're just starting, you need to ask ""who did we develop this for""? Then go where your supposed clients are. The simplest thing you can do is use Adword's Keyword Tool to see how sought after your keywords are. Google your product description and look at the top 20 competition websites. Analyze the sites and see what language they're using, collect synonyms, different phrasings and popular descriptions (all done with firfox plugins, btw.) Then search those keywords in the Keyword Tool.<p>This will give you a bird's eye view of how your competition is spending its Google advertising money (you will see them in the ads on the right after you search.)<p>You now have enough data to form a rudimentary strategy.<p>The fact that you like this skill in-house is not very reassuring.

There is a huge difference between a business development specialist and an online marketer.  Generally a business development specialist is focused on distribution, partnerships, sales, and potentially affiliate programs if you are lucky.  A traditional internet marketer will be focused on SEO, content development, user experience, email etc.<p>My advice is that if you can make the time you should start looking now, even if you are not ready to hire.  It is going to take some time to find the right person to mesh with your personalities and if you do find a great person they need to be as excited about your product as you are.",1280012728.0

On Mondays and Wednesdays, only 50% of the seats in the dining room were taken for dinner.

We did all the reading, planning, and reviewing other people's results <i>before</i> we entered the lab.  We even wrote our reports in advance, filling in the results as we went.
