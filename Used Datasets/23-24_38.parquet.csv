There's definitely a belief among successful Africans that Africa could be the next step for outsourcing.<p>However, they all knew that it wasn't something that could work because of the perception of doing business in Nigeria.

My biggest concern was typing, so I also opted for the keyboard dock instead of a bluetooth keyboard or a case.<p>So far, she really likes it. The first thing she figured out was that the dock plugs into the computer and the iPad plugs into the dock, so she didn't even know about the onscreen keyboard until I told her to unplug it (about 30 minutes after she got it).<p>Unfortunately, I haven't been able to really observe how she uses it, as she lives a few thousand miles away, but she seems to really enjoy it, compared to her slow, heavy, unreliable, and virus-laden Windows laptop.",1293319175.0

This isn't intended to be confrontational but is just motivated by curiosity on my part.<p>Perhaps if you were willing to talk about your beliefs I might go on to other questions such as ""Do you believe that it is possible for us to determine if a God exists?"" or ""Do you think it is possible to find evidence that God exists?"" and ""Would you be willing to listen to some reasons why I feel that there is a God?""<p>If so we could discuss each individual reason.

I wonder what rock they have been hiding under.  How could any true language enthusiast not have an understanding of their language's history?<p>====<p>Java has very few original features.  However, it did serve as a sort of 'feature aggregator', where it pulled in a very large pile of features from other languages and housed them all under one roof.<p>What I (vaguely) remember about Java from the early days as being it's (other) main advantages were:<p>(1) incredibly easy networking (compare sockets with C for example)<p>(2) applets (yes they suck(ed), but no other language had that browser adoption)<p>(3) it wasn't Microsoft (not such a big deal now, but back in the day Microsoft were a lot more aggressive)<p>(4) it was open(ish) (you could look at the library code to figure out how it was doing stuff) (compare with Visual Basic where everything either magically works or magically doesn't)<p>(5) Threads (compare again to semaphores)<p>(6) Free (as in beer)<p>In some cases, such as early Java, I think a feature most people don't really take into account is not what was put <i>into</i> the language, but what was left out.  By hiding pointers behind the curtain, it made the language a lot easier.  Easier to write, and easier to read.  Even then it had its wrinkles, the people I know who were uber-productive in Java tended to use a small subset of the languages features.<p>Over the years of course feature creep has slipped in, so it now has bits of perl (regex) and bits of C++ (templates/generics).  A lot more of the base code is a lot uglier than it used to be....<p>====<p>As for Lisp, I don't really buy the argument that lack of a good IDE held it back.  I think the following reasons are more to the point:<p>A) butt ugly syntax (I'm talking about the random lengths of indents, not the ()s - to understand why this is bad, go learn you some usability)<p>B)  greedy corporate interests (if the developer kit for Java had cost $10,000 no one would ever use it either) (early on)<p>C) language fracturing and speciation (there are too many 'little lisps' for any one of them to gain momentum) (later on)<p>D) lack of well written textbooks (compare to the veritable explosion of books for Java in its early days.  Back when I was actually interested in Lisp I used to pick up books on it, and they'd invariably spend the first 2 pages showing some vague equivalency to lambda calculus and then it seemed as though they felt their teaching duty was done)<p>speaking of the lambdas...<p>E) programmers got better at naming variables and functions  (having anonymous functions may be a neat party trick, but nowdays when we put on our big boy pants we like to name stuff)<p>F) missed the OO boat because they were too caught up in their own cleverness (early OO implementations in Lisp were butt ugly and broken (didn't do encapsulation and/or inheritance well)).<p>You may argue (as the author of the original article does) that currently Lisp does wonderful OO, but you have the same problem as say Java does, overcoming the slowness myth(s).<p>I wonder if it is possible to predict the critical junctures where the myths about a language solidify.  In any case, it doesn't help to make a new lisp with more/better/faster features (in an attempt to create new myths), because that just feeds the confusion (see point C above)<p>edit for irony: missed a )",1293318149.0
