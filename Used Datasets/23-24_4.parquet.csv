Glad to see that the highlighting idea is spreading: I've seen similar ideas used elsewhere before.<p>The modification that our system uses rather than this one is that it creates the comment box on the left-hand side, rather than scrolling all the way down. The idea is that you then make multiple posts as you read down, rather than one single one that disrupts the reading process, and that they all bundle together again at the end. (Of course, blog commenting is a little different than content critiquing, so perhaps merely quoting once is sufficient here.)",1231286274.0
