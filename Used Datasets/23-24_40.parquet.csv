Some softwares can decipher a password based on the information of “most common keys pressed”.\n--><p>This one is just so wrong as to make it hard to understand what they are saying.  Ironically, _fewer_ keys, make it easier to guess based on the ""common keys pressed (4 character passwords on Intercoms are easily guess based on ""Wear"")<p><--\nTherefore, lesser keys punched in a given frame of time lessen the possibility of the password being cracked.\n--><p>Still making no sense.<p><--\nMoreover, American Express is committed to protecting the privacy and security of all of our Cardmembers, both on-line and off-line.

There's absolutely nothing new about this either, rich attractive young males have been running their way through women since the dawn of time. How about putting aside all of these stupid gender roles and focusing our time on arranging a sane, happy and sustainable life? There's plenty of women and men that do this and don't obsess about knotches on a bedpost.

Overall, we should recommend the best tools for the job.<p>It's just that Web Applications, once built, are so easy to deploy across the enterprise.  It really is hard to build a decent application that can be (A) Rapidly Deployed to everyone, (B) Be maintained with patches on everyone's system, and (C) Be useful on Windows, OS X, and Linux, _unless_ you deploy it as a WebApp.  For some reason, Java Apps never really took off (I'm not sure if you consider Java Apps to be Web or Thick Client - I think they are in the middle.)<p>And, I agree with you in terms of where I get Value - at the end of the day, when I _really_ need to get some serious content creation or analysis done - It's Excel, Visio, and, interesting enough - my local shell.  I'm astonished how, 15 years into technology management, I use awk on 10 Gigabyte files to do critical work.   Definitely not a webapp.<p>So, I guess after reading your analysis, I probably agree with you more than I disagree.  In particular, ""html as a more advanced 3270 terminal"" brings it home for me.  The reality is, when I need more than just a terminal onto a back end application, I _do_ use a local thick client, and, I'm guessing that if most of the HN audience reviewed their work habits, they do as well.",1265584827.0
