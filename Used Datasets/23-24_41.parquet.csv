Seth is a brilliant guy, and for such a young guy he was quite impressive. It's a shame to hear that things arent looking great for the company at present. I havent been following the storyline of SCVNGR religiously, but this does sound a bit like the company got pushed into trying to be a home-run when it was a sure thing as a single or double. Unfortunately, when funding is in the mix the incentives point in the direction of trying to become gigantic at all costs. To be honest, I feel this is the same thing that did in the first startup I was a member of - we knew we could be a successful business but the pressure to become the next LinkedIn for fundraising reasons caused us to pivot and crush ourselves as we got over-extended and ran out of runway.

From an ML perspective, as you add dimensions to a dataset, the amount of data you'd need to accurately model the data without overfitting (i.e. without memorizing specific details of the sample rather than underlying trends) grows <i>very</i> fast, because due to the combinatorics you end up with extremely sparse coverage of the overall possibility space even with huge data sets.<p>The reverse of that phenomenon is that, given a data set in a high-dimensional space (even 3 dimensions, if each dimension has more than a few bits of entropy), it will cover the dimensions very sparsely (even if it's large!), and therefore it's relatively easy to recover specific details of the sample from the aggregate statistics.<p>edit: Well, I was hoping this might be a new insight, but in fact there's a good 2005 paper exploring that connection in much more detail: <a href=""http://www.vldb2005.org/program/paper/fri/p901-aggarwal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vldb2005.org/program/paper/fri/p901-aggarwal.pdf</a>",1314747069.0

The reason for that is that a lot of the capital flowing into Google is being spent on speculative ventures, from self driving cars to alternative ways of converting solar energy into power. So billions come in, and they get spent on things which have a zero ROI, on the off chance that one of them will have a huge ROI. Sort of a VC firm wrapped inside of a search company.<p>Using the eponymous self driving car as a reasonable example, seriously, if you have the technology to build self driving cars at a modest premium over manually driven cars you can build a business around that. Automated taxi fleets for example would be a trivial way to disrupt an entrenched market, put a lot of people out of business, and get all that money. Calculating the ROI on that, you go from zero to a lot (I can't find a solid number for cab revenue in the major metro areas sadly, I'm sure the Uber guys know it though).<p>Wall street hates Google for pretty simple reasons, they don't tell them enough to evaluate their business, they have 'golden' (aka Class-A) shares that allow Larry, Sergey, and Eric to out vote all the other shares combined (so there is no share holder leverage) and they don't show any respect to wall street bankers. So far its working in Google's favor, but it is an open question as to whether or not they can keep it up.",1314746525.0

Every single thing you've just said is wrong. Every single thing.<p>First -- ""the chances of that happening is very low.""  Let this be an education; there are automated toolsets that seek out and exploit known vulnerabilities in software across the entire Internet. If you have a public-facing website, you will get attacked. Period. The chances aren't ""very low"", they are a certainty. There are also toolsets that are used to do much more low-level scans for things like XSS, SQL injection, etc. These are commonly used by security auditors, but are also used by 13 year old kids who want to compromise your site. Again-- the chances aren't ""very low"", they are a certainty.<p>Next -- ""...but the priority in any business to make profit first."" State attorneys general are very quickly drafting personal privacy laws. I believe Massachusetts and Nevada are leading the way here, whereby any personally-identifiable information is _required_ _by_ _law_ to be held to the same rigorous data protection standards as PCI. If your site is breached, you will get sued, and you will lose.<p>Following OWASP takes maybe an extra day's worth of time out of a developer-- saying that you're just going to ignore it because hey, what's the worst that could happen -- again, I would ask you to list what you're building, so I can avoid it forever.",1314745571.0
