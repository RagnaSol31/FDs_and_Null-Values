The hardware is built to a uniform worldwide standard (established and enforced, during its crucial early years, by a single company: Microsoft) and is developed with money that is recouped by selling millions of units to Windows users.<p>In the phone market, such a large, self-perpetuating commodity hardware platform has yet to evolve. The market is heavily balkanized. It's under the control of multiple carriers whose rules determine exactly what will be sold and where. It's a rather different universe from that in which Linux evolved.",1248998208

With books, it is not only the content but the medium that is part of the experience.<p>A paperback is lightweight, cheap, durable and independent of other resources. Most importantly, a book as an experience is a long, drawn out affair. Books take hours to enjoy, so it's of little importance how many I can carry at a time.<p>Music/movies have the opposite effect ~ they are shorter durations of entertainment, so the more I can carry, the more I can enjoy the experience. The major advantage of digital music is that I can carry my whole library with me in my pocket. Even if I could do this with my bookcase, there is little reason for me to do so. This defeats one of the major advantages of kindle.<p>I don't disagree with anything you say, but I don't think the death of the book will happen any time in our lifetime, or our children's lifetime to be honest.",1248998176

13,733380,comment,733113.0,733265.0,0,0,onedognight,,,Sussman's critique of mathematical notation is hollow.  The point of good notation is to hide the details while conveying the high level compactly and succinctly.<p>Lagrange's equations written the way he derides are a perfect example.  His need to think about what spaces the symbols live in based on their context in the expression is typical when translating math to code.  He should be talking about about what kind of type inference engine one needs to allow the original notation and end up with his positional notation internally.,1248997877

These people don't trust you and/or your boss(es) any further than they can throw you. I don't blame them frankly. There have been far too many examples of why they are correct not to.<p>So these other people figure that the best way to safeguard their money is to make sure that you and your co-workers are legit. The only way they can do that though is by hiring yet more people to ensure that you actually tell them the truth about what is happening to their money. It's these third parties, the ""auditors"", that run most large companies.<p>Auditors have found that there is a certain set way of running companies that tends to result in the least amount of risk to the money that funds the operation. The money that belongs to someone else. Auditors ensure that the company is run according to these principles.<p>Ergo: the fact that some rimjob 3 states over once used iTunes to and IM to run a kiddie porn distribution ring or whatever and caused heartache for the money suppliers of that company means that the Auditors concluded that IM and itunes pose a risk to the other people that supply the money for your company: hence, you aren't allowed to use itunes as a matter of policy.<p>It gets even better when the government gets their hands sticky as well. Because then you get crap like Sarbanes/Oxley that basically makes being a criminal more difficult by making everything more difficult.<p>Public companies are not about the product/customer relationship. They are about the investment/investor relationship. You are the investment.

I decided to post a rate of 50 bucks an hour, and they were often happy to pay this with a tip.<p>I've thought of many ways I can make money, generally looking into starting some kind of online business, however whenever I start a new venture I become too busy and simply don't have the time to give it the kind of attention it needs.<p>So I was thinking I'd take PC repair/advice on more seriously. Put up a simple website, print some business cards with my name and number, contact my neighbours and inform them, and if they'd suggest me to their friends. Maybe even do a door-drop one afternoon in the streets around where I live, post it on facebook. It seems like a great idea because it's largely flexible, I'm my own boss, and if demand exceeds my fairly limited time I can always increase the rates - though I'm not sure how realistic, or harmful this would be.<p>Have any of you guys been here?

Then your program could be pretty sure that 44-32 is a delimiter, and that 65 and 90 are the ranges of characters used in keywords. (The above examples are ASCII).<p>However, that does nothing to eliminate words like 'in' and 'of' in a query, which you may want to do.
