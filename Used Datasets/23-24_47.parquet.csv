If you don't have someone to teach you, figuring out the ideal way to learn something can be tricky.<p>For example, the Rubiks Cube.  I'm sure there are great ways to learn to solve this puzzle, but I learned using a very time consuming technique with a lot of failure.  While I have a really good schema for book learning, I have a relatively poor schema for learning the optimal way to manipulate items in 3space, despite the fact that I live that space.",1283644736

That way they don't have to deal with the fact that you're not a US Citizen for payroll purposes, as they just pay you like any other vendor.<p>You can work remotely / travel to the US for periods of a few weeks at a time, working out of their offices - sublet apartments from craigslist for a month or two at a time, then return back to Canada. I believe there is a US visa you need to get to do this, under the guise you are working for a foreign business conducting biz in the US.<p>If the startup takes off, you will be integral enough to the process that they will (hopefully) hire an immigration lawyer to figure out how to get you into the country for longer periods of time and pay you directly. If it doesn't take off, probably best that they didn't issue your VISA after all...<p>I know of a few people who got in from eastern europe to the US that way... again, I am not a lawyer though, and therefore don't know if what these guys did was legal or not, just repeating what I heard...",1283644339

(I might be atypical in that regard?)<p>Furthermore, I think there <i>is</i> such a thing as wearing down your audience. It’s like you’re lowering your own value. Sure, you might still produce really good piece on a weekly basis, but they live in the same house as all your other, potentially mediocre posts.<p>That said, I strongly agree that we should all try to write every day. I started blogging earlier this year, and only at that point did I realize how difficult it is. So, taking my first point into account – my suggestion is that you <i>do</i> write every day, but not necessarily share everything you write. A journal is good for this, or even write it on your computer without publishing it. Whatever works. By doing so, I think you still develop your voice and style, without obligating yourself to add to your blog every day. This approach has helped me avoid burnout.

And the default state of that checkbox would be ""yes.""<p>Then CL could just offer a bare-bones, REST, read-only firehose API to access those posts. Just like how Twitter does it.

Hell, knowing how software shops work, they probably already have 3 private internal versions of it that were shelved by the ignorant, risk-averse management who only fear change and don't know how to tread water in the meandering river of technology and Internet society.<p>Wild idea for the Techcrunch rumor mill in 2011: it's too bad Twitter doesn't buy or merge with CL, and in absorbing CL, make them be more open and community-centric.<p>Perhaps CL will see the light and open up an API, as the newspapers get more desperate and turn up the dial on the hate.

CL has said nothing in response to critics who have pointed out that independent research groups have been able to place ads that contradict CL's stated policies, or that relevant authorities have said they've received few to no reports of suspicious activity from CL.  Refusing to acknowledge these problems, and instead focusing on the misdeeds or weakest arguments of their most sensational critics, undermines CL's credibility quite a bit.<p>And if you are going to shut the section down on your own, just do it.

It seemed to be accusing Thiel of not considering the big picture, when in fact Thiel is considering something much, much larger.  You're asking about differential pricing of prescription drugs, while he's wondering about the impact of a spot market on human organs.  What did you think of that part?<p>Thiel isn't arguing that globalization is a done deal.  If anything, he agrees that what we have is astonishingly incomplete: ""we stand at a level of globalization that compares with the previous peak year of 1913"".  Rather, he's asking whether the economic world as we know it could withstand true globalization.<p>But to answer your question:  yes, I think it's only to be expected that corporations will seek to maximize their profits through price discrimination.  And also to be expected that true globalization will make this more difficult to do.    But while it's clear that those paying the higher price would benefit in the short-term from paying a lower price, it's not clear to me who would benefit in the long-term from forcing companies to choose a single set price somewhere in the middle.  It probably depends on how this would be enforced.",1283642037
