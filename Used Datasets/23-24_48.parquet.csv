The only thing Ping publishes automatically (which is creepy enough if you buy a lot of music) is what you bought in the iTunes Store and who you followed.<p>This button is just a little shortcut for functionality that already existed but was ridiculously inaccessible before.,1285459120.0

After all, the problem with the specification metaphor is figuring out what the specification actually _is_. To me, the best route to get there is experimentation.<p>Make programming more about experimentation and I think we'll get somewhere.<p>(I'm still going to read more about Omega.

We didn't do much implementation, but assuming enough people used IE9 we'd probably make that set of meta tags page dependent.

19,1728152,comment,1727286.0,1727732.0,0,0,allengoodman,,,"Exactly. Most of the top ranked liberal arts college have gender parity. For example, my school, Amherst College, has a 50% male to female ratio. Likewise, Williams is 48% to 50%, Swarthmore is 47% to 53%, and Pomona is equal. This is also true for Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Since each school is competing for the same 10% of high school students and has an acceptance rate of 10% it’s probable that males have an advantage. However, affirmative action contributes a fair amount to the overall success of these schools and their graduates. I suspect, and I hope, applicants agree.<p>It’s also worth mentioning that this has become more of a problem because of the Seven Sisters. Harvard’s acquiring of Radcliffe and Vassar becoming coeducational placed greater pressure on similarly ranked schools. Moreover, Amherst and Williams’ becoming coeducational might’ve contributed to this imbalance.",1285458489.0

Reagan, bush, Clinton and bush all grew their deficits by trillions, and now Obama is adding a trillion a year.<p>Meanwhile, taxes have not grown like that, nor has the economy,  so how is it financed? Via inflation.  Via the \nTinting press, via federal reserve auctions of treasuries.<p>All of which are the same thing, and all of which are the drug Alan greenspan spent years pushing in our economy.  Note also that the ability to finance this way is dependent on there being enough people to buy the debt. Lately, the fed has been printing money to buy it under the table to keep the treasury auctions going, not that they will admit it.  This means that the ability to find financiers for the debt is decreasing, and without them, crash.<p>If we raised taxes to produce a balanced budget, it would be a death spiral, because e deficit is astronomical.  If we cut taxes we at least stimulate economic growth.  It won't be enough to cover the deficit, though.<p>So the real question is, how much of the country needs to be destroyed before the government will get spending under control?",1285458433.0

You might find that you won't be profitable if your cost to support the free user base is more than the paying users can cover at prices they're willing to pay. You can't just make the price arbitrarily high, sometimes freemium really doesn't work for a business.<p>W3Counter barely gets by as a freemium service. The paying users cover the servers it takes to run the site, but not enough more to pay even a single person's salary. I'm always waiting until service degrades to the point someone starts complaining before I add more hardware, otherwise enough new users wouldn't have started subscriptions to pay for the expansion.<p>The next service I built, W3ROI, does not offer a free plan.

Otherwise, there would be an orgy every weekend, right?""<p>If you replace ""people"" with ""men,"" the answer is probably yes. Men on average tend to seek out far more sexual partners than women do; I remember one study that had attractive, opposite-sex college students approach other students and offer to sleep with them. 75% of males approached said yes; 0 females did. I think the study is discussed in Dan Ariely's _Predictably Irrational_. As Roy Baumeister points out in his book _What Are Men Good For_, famous men often sleep with many, many random young women, and appreciate it when young women offer them sex; famous women seldom do the same.<p>As for women, they are the sex that has to invest more in offspring; in virtually every species studied, the choosier sex is the one that has to invest more; see, for example, Robert Trivers' famous work, or Geoffrey Miller in _The Mating Mind_:<p><i>""As David Buss has emphasized, human sex differences are most apparent in short-term mating. Men are motivated to have short-term sexual flings with multiple partners than women are. Women are much choosier than men in the short term. Short-term mating is exciting and sexy, but it is not necessarily where sexual selection has the greatest effect"" (95).<p>""Human males are generally not as choosy about short-term affairs as females. There is very little opportunity cost to short-term mating for men. It does not exclude other sexual options. But men get much choosier about medium- and long-term relationships, because their opportunity costs increase dramatically. If they are in a sexual relationship with one woman, it is very difficult to sustain a sexual relationship with another woman. They cannot give both their full attention. They must make choices—sexual choices"" (95). </i><p>Note: this doesn't mean women aren't very sexual. They are. See, for example, Randy Thornhill's _The Evolution of Human Female Sexuality_. But they don't tend to seek out as many random encounters or as many concurrent, unknown partners as men do. Most sexually mature women <i>are</i> ""seriously looking to have sex"" because they like it as much or more as men do. But they aren't, on average, looking to have it as indiscriminately as men do.<p>The equilibrium isn't for ""an orgy every weekend."" There isn't a stable equilibrium if the number of males and females and fluctuating; for more on this and how small numbers of people influence mating/dating markets, see Tim Harford's _The Logic of Life_.<p>Note too that variations among individuals are greater than variations between groups, so those of you who are about to tell stories about your guy friend who is asexual and your female friend who hooks up with a new guy every weekend are not being inconsistent with the above, which has been established empirically through a variety of means discussed in the books referenced.",1285456711.0

And the reason they don't have any other guidance is that people running technology companies didn't have <i>any</i> kind of design phase other than sending salesmen out to get pointless checklists of features.<p>If anything, the book is a criticism of the way tech companies are (or at least used to be) run rather than a criticism of diligent programmers doing their best with incomplete information.
