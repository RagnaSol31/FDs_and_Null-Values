Highly entrepreneurial society/culture.<p>3. Strong presence of many US Firms, VC and technological (intel, google etc..).

Lots of highly skilled engineers and somewhat lower costs (by US standards).<p>5. A city that never sleeps and has wifi everywhere.<p>I mean this quite literally.

I honestly don't know if 90% is a problem, but the natural knee-jerk ""fair"" outcome of 50% would actually mean that half the time, a prosecutor is bringing a case that they shouldn't have. That sounds like an awfully high rate of false charges to me.<p>90% doesn't sound so wrong to me, and I don't think that's where the problem lies. The problem is the breadth and variety of ways in which the prosecutor can bring a successful case against you.<p>(This is important because if we're going to push for reform, we want to push for the right things, not just kneejerk that everything is wrong every time we see a statistic.)",1280704891.0
