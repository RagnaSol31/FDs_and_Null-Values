First, forcing people to spend seems immoral, second his ""negative interest"" is called inflation, and it already exists in ordinary currency.<p>Presumably stores will be able to redeem the scrip for regular money right? So I can just imagine a store allowing currency exchanges, pay a small fee (less than the monthly fee) and get real money.<p>The whole thing doesn't seem right to me. And I think the examples don't prove anything - I bet those recoveries would have worked if they used regular money, and on top of that cities can issue IOU's right now, which effectively do the same thing.<p>And finally the economic problems are global, not local, fixing things locally might not do enough.",1232495995.0

11,442473,comment,442003.0,442003.0,0,0,dejb,,,It wasn't all that long ago that many Palm branded phones being sold were actually running Windows Mobile. I suspect that commentators are way too quick to write off the Windows Mobile platform most cause they don't really know much about it. Sure the UI is a little clumsy compared to the iphone but I don't see what will make it so difficult to incorporate most of the techniques in to the OS. There are actually a huge number of apps developed for the platform and still it has a large user base around the world. I suspect the much of the reason for the platform being written of is their lack of a mobile carrier 'deal' in the US.,1232495563.0

I disagree with the implication, though. There are two possibilities that come to mind when people encounter contradictions and exceptions in a system:<p>1. There is no unifying model. The exceptions are truly exceptional, and have to be dealt with as their own case apart from the main logic and rules of the system.<p>2. The existence of a unifying model is unknown, because no one has thought to look for it yet. Additional cases that need to be resolved are assumed to be exceptions unless it is blatantly obvious they are not, and are immediately developed as such.<p>Experiences I and others have had suggest that the latter case is <i>far</i> more likely. So I agree that the nature of business as practices is full of exceptions and contradictions, but I disagree that being so is inevitable.",1232495338.0
