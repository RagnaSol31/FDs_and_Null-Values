I enjoyed Zack and Wiki on the Wii, and some of the adventure game titles on the DS like Phoenix Wright, Professor Layton, and I've referenced some of those in my other writings about adventure games. My main reason for focusing on PC games and older titles was that that seemed to be where the majority of interface evolution and changes took place. Zack and Wiki is an entertaining concept, but the interface is primarily point and click with some supplementary controls using the motion sensing of the controller and all the buttons the wiimote allows for... similarly with the DS adventure titles, it treats the touch screen as a point and tap world.<p>As for portal, drawing the lines between adventure games and other genres can be fuzzy. Bringing games into real-time 3D is a much more significant shift than bringing a game from a text adventure to a graphic adventure. While there are definitely many types of games which involve puzzles, I prefer to define Adventure Games as being based around solving abstract puzzles that aren't dependent upon a real-time engine.",1236035204.0

66,500753,story,,,7,15,devin,Netbooks -- Who buys them?,,"I got into a discussion with a coworker last night about netbooks.  He made a few assertions that I had a tough time disagreeing with.  First, he asked coworkers (4 or 5 of them) if they knew anyone with a netbook.  Most people didn't even know what a netbook was, and offered up a friend or relative who owned a Kindle instead (This may well warrant a separate discussion of its own).  Of the rest of us, we came up with two netbook owners.  Two.  Of the people surveyed, there was very little to desire to own a netbook.  I would rate these coworkers as fairly tech-savvy.  I don't mean to pass this off as any sort of factual representation of the market, but I think it begs the question:<p>Who are the big buyers for netbooks in your opinion?<p>Do you think the current economic client plays to the advantage of the netbook market, or is there a significant disadvantage insofar as netbooks are perceived as luxury items-- a little brother to your existing laptop?<p>Do you own one?  Do you want one?  Why or why not?",1236034882.0
