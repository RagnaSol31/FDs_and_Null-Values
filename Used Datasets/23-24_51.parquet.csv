The government loans you the money; interest is charged at CPI (so usually half that of commercial rates; my debt actually decreased at one point when Australia measured negative CPI growth!). To ensure their debt, it is compulsarily repaid as a percentage of taxable income - the higher your income, the higher the percentage goes (and yes, this does create situations where a payrise leads to a negative cash-in-hand outcome).<p>My debt topped out just over $20K. I graudated at the end of 2002, started paying it off in 2003 (ie, my first salary was high enough for the threshold) and it was paid off in mid-2009. I could have paid it off sooner, but the system means there are usually better uses for my disposable cash (mortgage, even cash deposit!). Still, it's good that it's gone.

The problem with looking at such a huge data set (this goes back to the late 19th century, is that the companies, industries and the world that we live in shifts significantly over time.  So the 'real' numbers are extremely important, but I'd have to do some more research to find out how his CPI calculations change from one era to another.  This is important because (to the best of my knowledge) there is nothing that says that the P/E ratio of a major industrial company in the 30s (thinking like Rockefeller, etc.) is equivalent to that of a big tech company now.  So as industries change, investment attitudes, etc. change, which will affect the overall P/E.<p>And as far as the market being expensive in relation to historics, again you have to compare apples with apples.
