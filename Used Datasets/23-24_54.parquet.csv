So, the question is, does cost matter?<p>For us, a single engineer's salary costs more than our entire yearly EC2 bill. And, we're not even using cost saving measures like elasticity and reserved instances.<p>And, EC2 actually drives costs down in ways hosting does not. First, as you mentioned, it dramatically reduces the need for IT staff. (Though it doesn't eliminate it, of course.)<p>Second, and IMHO, more importantly, the constraints EC2 imposes on you forces you to build fault tolerant, shared-nothing systems. I'm sure many folks here have worked at companies with hosted servers to find machines that are chock full of random cron jobs, services, and so on. The instant provisioning capability of EC2 combined with the constraints makes it very hard for you to have these one off ""god boxes"" your system is hinging on. Beyond that, as things get too messy, you have the freedom to automate and shut-down and bring up fresh nodes instantly with no increase in cost. It's hard to me to estimate the amount of man-hours we've saved and disasters we've avoided due to this capability. It's allowed us to cleanly ""refactor"" our entire cluster over time since we can reprovision nodes on demand as we improve the services or architecture on those nodes.",1260316027.0

Glass Steagall was repealed in 1999, mortgage backed securities were issued and sold long before then. Many commercial banks traded MBS under Glass-Steagall as a way of reducing their risk; in fact regulatory bodies encouraged them to do this.""<p>We are really getting into details here. This was technically partially true, because Glass Steagall was being progressively watered down long before it was actually repealed. So commercial banks were allowed to underwrite some securities but again there were limits as to how much they could do. I think the limit started at 5% of revenue and then progressively expanded to 25% as GS was being further watered down. But I doubt banks would have been allowed to create the huge amounts of mortgage backed securities they did after the repeal, even in the most watered down version of GS. Also, when the original article argued for the reinstation of Glass Steagall they probably argued for it in its original non-watered down version.<p>As to your second statement, you said ""Instead of speculating in ""finance"", lending went to speculate in ""productive assets"" like equities and bonds.""

You're in for a breakdown unless you can undo this thinking.<p>Success at your startup won't give you friends or a social life. It won't help you escape from the stress. It'll do the opposite, unfortunately. Success puts even more pressure on you. If you land that $1M customer, you'll have to deliver $2M of value back to them.<p>What you get out of success is more opportunity, more resources, more freedom. All of these you can use to enrich and expand your own life. If you don't have your own life going though, you'll have no outlet to enjoy your success. Then the stress will turn into a death spiral.<p>Add yourself to your plans. Make a plan to enjoy your success. Do something to enrich your life like joining a club or taking lessons. If you land the big customer, reward yourself (not with <i>things</i>, with an improvement in your life).<p>Advanced tip: If you don't land the customer, do something for yourself anyway. The company may fold, but you're still stuck with you for a while yet, so you might as well get along with yourself. :)",1260313696.0
