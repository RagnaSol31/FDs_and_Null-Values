9,932054,comment,931554.0,931554.0,0,0,anatoly,,,"""These days mathematicians are divided into little cliques of perhaps a dozen people who work on the same stuff. All of the papers you write get peer reviewed by your clique. You then make a point of reading what your clique produces and writing papers that cite theirs. Nobody outside the clique is likely to pay much attention to, or be able to easily understand, work done within the clique. Over time people do move between cliques, but this social structure is ubiquitous. Anyone who can't accept it doesn't remain in mathematics.""<p>I think this is an exaggeration. Sure, much of mathematics and maybe most of mathematics today works like this, but it's the exceptions, in accordance with Sturgeon's Law, that are most interesting. The really good specialists tend to transcend little cliques, and sometimes entire fields. There are plenty of people who are respected outside the circle of their immediate coauthors, everybody (for some definition of ""everybody"" that is anyhow wider than a little clique) wants to read their papers, etc.<p>You could say that these are rare exceptions and >90% of working mathematicians are producing highly specialized papers that are interesting to maybe a dozen other people, that don't know much outside their narrow focus and don't really care, and so on. And you'd be right. But in programming, isn't it the case that >90% of programmers are chugging along in their Java or C",

Beyond school, his time is spent getting muddy on a soccer field, swimming, building dens, and generally racketing around with friends.<p>However, along with every other 7 year old, he want to know how things work. I am finding that many of my explanations get from A to B via ""and at this point there is a computer that does ..."". - Things: Microwave, car, alarm clock, phone, camera etc.  and broader systems: exams, shops, banks etc.<p>I could explain things in terms of the model that is embodied in the computer, but that seems wrong - at least as the only explanation. If you pull it apart, you don't find the coresponding physical embodiment.<p>If he does want to dig further into this and explore how to make computers do things, I want to have a good set of resources to draw on - My current short list w/ comments:<p>- Lego Mindstorms NXT<p>Start with the provided graphical environment, move on to one of the several text based development environments, eg: NQC, leJOS. He loves Lego, and I have already set up a mindstorms controller+psx joystick to give him a drive+steering component he can use in his own constructions. I find the graphical a bit cumbersome.<p>- Nodebox (<a href=""http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Home</a>)<p>I think it is great - python & easy graphics. I have already been showing off some simple drawing animations and fielding requests to: ""Make it go the other way, go red, faster, jump etc."" - Cool, but I am well aware the he'll get frustrated with syntax errors.<p>- Processing (<a href=""http://processing.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://processing.org/</a>)<p>Also, cool - not used it so much myself, and I am not sure I want to start explaing curly parens & semis, but it does lead into Wiring and Arduino. One thing I would really love for him to experience is making things w/ embedded cpus - even if it just simple things to spin motors and flash leds.<p>- Scratch (<a href=""http://scratch.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a>)<p>Only recently found this. For me, the visual programming was way easier than Lego NXT. Going to have more of a play.<p>- Nintendo DS homebrew<p>- C64 - in the form of a C64DTV (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C64_Direct-to-TV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C64_Direct-to-TV</a>)<p>- Usebox (<a href=""http://belogic.com/uzebox/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://belogic.com/uzebox/</a>)<p>When I was mucking around w/ NDS homebrew I had him draw some characters, then we scanned them and displayed them as sprites bouncing around (one was under joypad control - no collisions or gameplay, maybe 20 lines of code)<p>My own experience was that making games was a very powerful motivation - and all these 3 provide a way into that - C64 & Uzebox would provide a similar experence to mine (well, I was a BBC fanboy, but anyway). Nintendo DS would be a bit more up to date, and would have some currency with his mates. Some way of targetting NDS from processing would be a cool halfway house.<p>Assuming he is at all interested, it will be interesting to see if any of this is appropriate. If not, well, there is another son - and maybe I'll just get stuck in myself.",1257809044.0
