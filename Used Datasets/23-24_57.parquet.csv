In my opinion plain text transmission of data is essential for the web, which would allow things like Google to keep working regardless of the ""language"" being used, whether it be HTML or Markdown, etc.<p>Having thought about it more, I think the real issue here is standards. All these other problems are a function of that in my opinion. The problem with standard stagnation and lack of competitiveness, whether it be missing features or hardware access, is not a coincidence in my opinion. This isn't some rut we are currently in that if we work hard enough we'll get out of. Instead, I think that the structurally process itself is predisposed to it. 5 years from now, the web will just have a new set of technologies that its behind native on. In other words, the way things are headed, the web can never be cutting edge. And sure, there will always be things that work well on the web, but I would personally like a cutting edge web.<p>Additionally, I'd like to add that as I stated in the article, I have discussed these thoughts with Joe on more than one occasion, and even had him look this over beforehand to make sure I wasn't putting words in his mouth.
