16,1466539,story,,,13,10,arthurdent,Tell HN: Stocks are not a zero sum game and high frequency trading is great,,"Stocks represent distributed company ownership. Entrepreneurship (creating companies) has historically been positive value in aggregate.<p>The stock market is the aggregate of all publicly traded entrepreneurship.  Trading would be zero sum if and only if the value of that ownership is constant.  It is not.<p>A reasonable argument is that nobody knows what the growth rate of the market is and over short timescales it is kind of sort of constant, so you might as well think of it as so.  That response is really a knock against high frequency trading and not generally against dabbling in stocks.<p>[Most] High frequency trading and ""investing"" are basically the same thing on different timescales.<p>Value investing might be characterized as finding undervalued companies, purchasing them, then, as Ben Graham might put it, waiting for Mr. Market to correctly value the company.<p>There are flavors of HFT that aren't easily defensible, but much high frequency trading is basically the same as value investing, using a different definition of ""undervalued"", which happens to be measured in much smaller time intervals.",1277682539.0

Instead of our work being our wealth, trading securities somehow became an end unto itself. What's worse is that there really are two markets today: one for the individual retail investor and a second for institutional investors.<p>Retail investors are taught to 'invest for the long-term', and 'not try to time the market' meanwhile hedge-funds and high-frequency traders play a different game with different rules.

19,1466536,comment,1466108.0,1466108.0,0,0,jufemaiz,,,"A fundamental problem that I see is twofold:<p>First, we have a more educated populace globally (not just in the US) - this leads to more confidence in our own opinions, and when combined with ""the university of Google"" and trusting everything one reads on the internet you'll get echo-chambers of likemindedness repeatedly referring to each other. We tend to believe things that we hear over and over. Add in the lack of accountability within the media to appropriately question all claims from all sides in a scientific manner and you can easily become highly insular in your views and opinions.<p>Secondly - science has moved on in ways unfathomable a century ago - a time where the wealthy could afford an education and those without could not (and hence trusted those with an education more, although you can also claim that corporations have also lessened the trust in anyone too). The sciences today are so incredibly complex that the scientific community has the option to either:\na) dumb it down; or\nb) dumb it down.\nThe problem there is that when you simplify science, you lose some of the details and open yourself up for cherry-picking critique. Add in the issue that most science is now not black-or-white (something that the conservative in everyone prefers) but rather is based on probability (yes, I know all about the black swan events that through out prior observations, however scientific method requires repeatability) - irrespective of whether or not the lifestyle that they currently live is based on such approaches. Add in the proud to be innumerate and scientifically illiterate and you've got some major problems. Mix in that science now looks like religion to the lay person, due to the complexity and lack of comprehension, and you're going to have big problems.<p>What is the scientific community to do? I'm not sure. We need to change the perception of science in the community. We need to educate people on the scientific method (even though there are many in the hardcore religious groups who oppose it). Then we need to build a better grounding in science for the next generation and make it valued in the same way that the financial and legal sectors are. After all - they're all dependent on the discoveries for their own operations.",1277682500.0

Plus currently I have a cool internship at a billion $ market-cap Company, where I get to work on Hadoop and stuff.<p>Now here is my problem:\nI love solving problems, unlike people who got interested in programming by making websites, I got amazed by its ability to solve problems by computation. Hence I dont want a job which involves significant amount of (for lack of appropriate term) enterprise fizz-buzz programming.\nI would love to become an Analyst in company like McKinsey or Bains or BCG etc. Though such jobs are extremely hard to get\nMy beloved other option is to join any of Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Microsoft. These again hard if not harder than above ones.<p>This leaves me with three fail-safe options:\n1: Join a startup (I dont mind low salary, since my major objective is to pay back my loan + I am low maintainance person), however startup rarely take student on F1 [yet I can work in US for 29 moth post graduation without H1B]<p>2: Join a PhD Course after a year of job or right after the degree.<p>3: Work on Application development job for three years and then try applying for an MBA.<p>My Final Aim is to get an MBA from a really good university.\nThis is in turn because over course of a year I have realized that except for the top 10 tech companies it is very hard to grow as an engineer/developer.

Because this fight started with religious zealots trying to prosecute teachers for going against scripture, and it's hard to have any doubt that the clowns pushing Intelligent Design would do something similar if people stopped smacking them down.  It might not matter to you whether evolution is right or not, but that's not what the fight is about - the fight is about whether or not scientists should have to poll the idiocracy and make sure they won't offend them before reporting their findings.<p>And yes, I'm arguing slippery slope, maybe - but the argument in favor of worry is a lot more compelling when we've just finished clawing our way up from the bottom.<p><i>It seems like the more we know the more we lose sight of what we still don't know and don't proceed with much humility.</i><p>Absolutely.  And with climate science, I'd tend to agree with you, we don't know all that much and might want to be careful about how much we trust the preliminary findings - the data appears to be messy, incomplete, and difficult to work with, and the field started out so highly politicized that it's hard to know who to trust.<p>Evolution, on the other hand, is not even in the same ballpark - evidence is plentiful, it all agrees with the theory, and consensus is overwhelming (and one big difference between bio and climate science is that biologists don't tend to go into biology because of political leanings, so there's far less selection bias amongst researchers).",1277681719.0

As someone in the comments on the blog noted, if someone's goal with Clojure is to crank out a web app in 24 hours, they've come to the wrong place. Emacs enriches the experience, and I truly don't think it is as daunting as it is often made out to be. Gaining basic productivity in Emacs, even if not excellent productivity, takes little time, and the benefits of using Emacs seem large to me.<p>Regardless, the sentiment expressed here is important to consider. There should be a sanctioned IDE for Clojure, and it shouldn't just be Emacs and clojure-mode.el + Lein, at least not to start. Along with clojure.jar, I'd like to see Leibke's clj script packaged and promoted. That way, like with python, irb and newlisp, you can download and immediately get started with a functional REPL to see if you like the language before investing the time in setting up the ultimate IDE.<p>And yes, documentation. Please, documentation. It's in the style of LISP to have little to none documentation in code, as the code should explain itself. And it certainly should, but a little exlanation here and there can only help to enlighten those not as familiar with the language and save the time of those in a hurry.<p>But now is an exciting tine for getting into Clojure.

Copy and pasting code and running it directly works, and once you figure out how to 'source' in a file, you can start building something modularized and significant.<p>I wrote about a 5000 line Clojure program, fairly early on, and ran development cross platform with just an SVN server at home on my mac, svn clients on mac and Windows, and notepad for Windows development, and TextMate on the mac.
