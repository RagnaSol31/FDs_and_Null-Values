It's actually a pretty acceptable game as far as diplomacy goes. The worst problem with the game is that it very quickly devolves into a situation where two players have a decent chance to win, everyone else is royally screwed, and the game still has about an hour to go. Also, it's terribly reliant on luck: while it is possible to actually be good at Monopoly(i.e. there are strategies and skills that will seriously increase your chances of winning), a few bad rolls and/or a player adamant about not selling X property or trading Y player (this happens a lot IME) can leave you completely out of the game.",1302998235.0

I certainly don't mean to say that determinism implies predictability in the first sense you define above. In the second, more general sense ""knowing a future event before it takes place"" predictability really could depend on the concept of emergence (or solipsists notion of macro-levels). Here's a thought experiment: It's conceivable that you could perfectly simulate a higher level of organization in a system (which would require less information). It's also conceivable that objects on that level (emergent properties of the lower levels) operate according to their own rules distinct from (but derived from) the lower levels. Here's the kicker: given that the higher level is an emergent property of the behavior of the lower level, when we look at it in isolation, it contains much less information than the lower level. In fact several state iterations of the lower level could pass before a state change percolates to the higer level. Thus, in such a thought experiment by having a perfect model of the higher level, you could outpace the lower level and know a future even before it takes place.",1302997808.0

This is not a serious problem but it looks like one on the face of it. If a massive amount of computation suddenly went into computing bitcoins there are two issues you could be worried about.<p>The first is that it isn't very fair. The reply to this is that the current balance of money isn't fair either, we just didn't get to watch it happen. And as people have said elsewhere, it's not reasonable to expect a currency to solve social inequality.<p>The second is that, if the cost of mining a bitcoin goes through the roof but there is not enough economy to make money on transaction fees, then people will drop out of mining. However: difficulty is not automatically increasing, it's proportionally increased or decreased relative to the difficulty of the past two weeks. If it becomes prohibitively expensive for Amazon to mine for bitcoins and they drop out, the threshold will fall again. Either way there's always an incentive to keep it running, until the system is out of coins.<p>(edit for clarity)",1302997665.0

Admittedly that's not JavaScript-specific, but one can easily specialise this general criterion by reference to specific language attributes and types of tasks which the language is commonly employed to solve (DOM scripting etc.).<p>That's all a bit hand-wavy, so here are some more concrete suggestions. Even in these days of Node.js et al, JS is mainly used for developing web frontends, so this will be heavily slanted towards those sorts of issues. An advanced JavaScript programmer should be able to:<p>* Develop her own DOM library along the lines of the functionality provided by jQuery or YUI: a CSS selector engine, DOM traversal, element manipulation, all wrapped in a clean and well thought-out API.<p>* Build an extensible UI toolkit suitable for writing the frontend of a CMS, capable of handling numerous different object types, and communicating with the backend via a specified serialisation protocol.<p>* Write a testing framework with an equal level of features and stability as common current ones, such as QUnit.<p>* Create a form validation DSL capable of handling not just simple binary cases and regex-based validation of input fields, but the specification of more complex dependency relationships and requirements. For bonus points, tie it into the backend so the same code generates the frontend DSL code and the backend validation rules, ensuring that they always harmonise.<p>* Develop complex (as in, complex to implement using the DOM) interface elements such as sliders, drag-and-drop controls etc.<p>Again, I'm not saying our hypothetical advanced JS hacker should have <i>done</i> all thisâjust that she should be able to.

Remember, a TrueCrypt volume contains an entire file system inside. File systems seriously don't like it when you modify bits and pieces of it from under their feet. You can't use any file in the volume until you've finished using the volume in the other computer.<p>EncFS is somewhat better in terms of sync, because it encrypts each file separately.<p>Here's a nice tutorial:\n<a href=""http://pragmattica.wordpress.com/2009/05/10/encrypting-your-dropbox-seamlessly-and-automatically/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragmattica.wordpress.com/2009/05/10/encrypting-your-...</a><p>I have ~2.5GB of encrypted files in my Dropbox, and as long as I don't try to edit the same file in two places at the same time, it works like a charm. (Conflicts can be nasty, as another comment says. But it's not as bad as TrueCrypt, because EncFS works per-file.) Editing different files at the same time, on the other hand, is kosher.<p>There are, however, a few other problems with EncFS.<p>First of all, you can't mount an EncFS directory tree from Windows. There's an actively developed Windows port of EncFS out there (which uses Dokan), but I've never been able to get it to work properly.<p>Also, Windows has a maximum path length limit of 260 chars. Since EncFS pads file names with unique IVs and base64 encodes them after encrypting them, you can reach this limit after only 3-4 levels of subdirectories. Paths which are too long for Windows will simply be omitted from the Windows copy of your Dropbox folder. So if you ever treat the Windows copy as an authoritative backup, you're in for a nasty surprise. Linux is OK up to 4096 chars. I'm not sure how OSX does it.<p>Lastly, Dropbox in Linux tends to choke when you add a large number of files with encrypted filenames. It's not uncommon for Dropbox to declare a ""case conflict"" in that situation when there actually isn't any case conflict. This can seriously damage your EncFS directory tree, because Dropbox adds the phrase ""(Case Conflict 1)"" to random files and folders. An easily solution is to stop Dropbox, add the files, and restart Dropbox again. But this can get annoying after a while.",1302996426.0
