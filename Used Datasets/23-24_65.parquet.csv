Google wanted a free and open web, where they could develop awesome server-based applications.  Apple simply wanted to replace Windows computers with Apple computers.  Those two goals are increasingly incompatible.<p>Now that they've managed to make Microsoft widely irrelevant, these vicious fights look inevitable.  I think it's healthy, actually.

Here are some thoughts on a few of those missing things...<p>In real terms, the investments quoted actually had a <i>negative return</i> during 2009 (nominal interest rates mean little outside of an apples-to-apples comparison). With the unadjusted CPI rising 2.7%, those dollars can now buy less than they could one year ago.<p>The negative return actually suggests a lot about the economy (see Japan's lost decade -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decade_%28Japan%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decade_%28Japan%29</a>). Here are a few of the conclusions one might draw:<p>- There is considerable fear remaining among investors.<p>- The government is encouraging risk taking and investment, while discouraging savings.<p>- US treasuries represent the risk-free rate in many traditional financial models; the traditional models are either changing <i>OR</i> returns that seem sub-optimal when compared with yields from 3 years ago actually have significant amounts of risk embedded in them.<p>- Banks & local governments can borrow at very low rates, thereby strengthening their balance sheets, making for a potentially attractive investment opportunity (this is, of course, dependent on how wisely you expect them to allocate the capital they borrow).<p>- The implications are far reaching. This is only the tip of the iceberg.<p>Take away: Look for inefficiencies and exploit them.",1268524566.0

Then, as time passed, I gradually shifted into my old habits.<p>I used to blame my weak willpower for a while for that - but now I think the problem could be with the book itself. I feel the problem is that this book focuses too much on the 'outside', the presentation layer, instead of the 'inside'. It's how to <i>act</i> like you're a successful, popular person with lots of friends, even if you're far from it on the inside.<p>Of course, many have noted that acting ""as if"" will eventually turn you into that person, I think that's true only if you actively focus on that goal. The book does not. It only occasionally pays lip service to ""inner character"" (ten pages about smiling a lot... and in the end ""oh by the way, you actually have to be nice for this to work"").<p>Having said that, I still think it's a very good book for many geeks who have no idea about social norms at all, to provide as sort of tutorial on this topic.",1268524259.0

(Can you imagine what a company that controlled a similar share of TV or print advertising would be worth?)

That's not relatively high, that's simply overpriced.<p><i>and</i> a recurring ???<p>I would not pre-order that until the price came down to what consumer electronics with this much functionality should cost, probably around the $40 mark or so. And that recurring billing bit for a feature that you could easily throw in for free is simply grafted on to make a spreadsheet look good somewhere.<p>Why on earth did you decide to complicate matters so much ? Your average consumer is not going to order these in quantities large enough to make it happen. A scaled down version that would cost $40 to $50 and that would simply monitor your electricity usage and report to a website (for free) so you can do your sampling using the simplest of pic chips would do wonders for energy savings and would be earned back in a foreseeable time.<p>Rule 1: keep it simple.<p>Don't break rule one.<p>Multiple hundreds of dollars are a completely different decision point than < 50, and as your volume goes up your costs go down further so your profits will rise. People visiting the site to see their stats and to compare their stats with other people in their neighbourhood (who gets to have the lowest electricity bill) would be a great way to create a community of energy conscious people.<p>There must be a better way to monetize that than to charge them for the privilege of supplying you with valuable data...<p>So, not 'more features' to sway people, <i>less features</i> at a much better price and a smarter plan to monetize your users in the longer term.",1268524147.0

If you contemplate the implications of that statement for the briefest of moments you will be staggered by how wrong you are.<p>Exploration leads to discovery. Medical discoveries of the effects of radiation and low gravity on the crew, previously unobserved properties of things great and small, things that men may notice that instruments are not designed to notice, and unknown unknowns that we can't yet imagine.<p>Necessity is the mother of invention. Men in space necessitate certain things: filtration systems, radiation protection, extracting water from Mars and the Moon economically, advanced materials, robotics. Terraforming Mars is one of the end-goals of human space exploration. Humans in space are an incentive to do so. Earth has finite resources, and an expanding population. This is science that we ought to contribute to.<p>Manned space exploration also causes people to be interested in space, to pursue degrees in science, and to contribute to research here on Earth.<p>That being said, you must surely admit that contributions to science can be indirect as well as direct, and that manned exploration of space provides both.<p>I am not in any way an expert on space exploration, but there are a great number of highly knowledgeable people who would love to elucidate the situation for you.

People tend to live approximately at what they can afford, perhaps borrow or save a bit. Most people will spend 30-50% on housing and 10-30% on food, just because they will adjust their tastes to their means.<p>What you can afford with the X% however differs greatly between countries.<p>In most of Eastern Europe, spending 30% of your income on housing will get you a 30-year loan for a 600 sq. foot apartment in a ""soviet projects"" style high-rise apartment block. Only middle class can afford a car, and only the upper middle class or wealthy have more than one car per family and a house in the suburbia.

Therefore, the exploration of near planets without a solid technological base (and we don't have one, do the research: I mean the correlation between developed and required technology) has merely a sign value, and remains close to none practical use for scientists.\n3. Spaceflight and exploration might be a great inspiration for the whole planet of aspiring space engineers, but even I, a space-geek, agree with your administration on this matter. This is not a time to inspire, this is a time to pull up some strings in the economy. And in the meanwhile a competitively set industry private or not might push the technology forward to earn the financing they long took for granted.<p>Many people fail to separate two things: a) the process of evolving technology and exploring space; b) the process of putting people to orbit. Why do you think the space station will be trashed so soon? It has little to none value, but sucks the resources FROM the technology.<p>So if we want to 'harvest' H_3 from the Moon surface, why do we need people up there? The fact is that we actually don't. Even modern robotics as simple as it is, may do most of the resource gathering job cheaply. While human presence and life-support will increase the cost and move this perspective even further into the future.<p>All eyes are turned where there is a prospect of financial gain. Right now, the gain is negative because of the lacking technology that needs investment. That is exactly why we have 3-5 people in space and not a large colony of workers. We use more money on supporting those three, than on making ground for some larger operations.<p>Where am I wrong?",1268522416.0

He obviously has an issue when he feels that his innovation has been ripped off.  What we may be seeing here is a replay of the 'look and feel' type dispute between Jobs and Gates.  Jobs felt that his innovation was simply ripped off by a cheaper, tasteless knockoff (and in a sense he was right).  In the end, there was nothing Jobs could do about it.  Now he feels like the same thing happened.  Just as Jobs had shown Gates his ideas in confidence and was then ripped off, Jobs likely feels the same way about Schmidt--he took Schmidt into his confidence, allowed him to be privy to Jobs's vision, and now Google is producing graceless copies of what he's worked so hard on.<p>Obviously Google's side of the story may be true—they bought Android and developed it for a long time, well before the iPhone was revealed.  Apple doesn't necessarily have a right to prevent other companies from copying touch interfaces and other aspects of the iPhone that were unique when it was first introduced.
