His analogy for the tech-telecom bust was with the post-bubble doldrums in Japan - and it was no time to be risking a slide back by rising rates.<p>In the event, directly as a result of that easy credit policy, we got the mother of all bubbles in housing, which has almost taken the entire financial system down with it. Krugman did not anticipate the bigger bubble that was brewing even as he was advocating continuing 1% interest rates (well below the rate of inflation even then!).<p>Economists like Nouriel Roubini, Steven Roach (then Chief Economist at Morgan Stanley), eminent people like Paul Volcker (Fed Chairman between 79-87), investors like Warren Buffet & Marc Faber all  warned about the 2004-7 bubble in housing several times, for many years. Krugman had a very public voice during that entire time, but saw no problems with the Greenspan/Bernanke Fed.<p>It is worth remembering this real world record, as the world fetes his Nobel prize.",1224028555.0

General Dynamics (like nostrademons said), HRL, Boeing, etc. etc. You can get a job with them, and if the environment doesn't feel soul-crushing to you, you are golden.<p>2) A lot of CS research at Universities is funded by DARPA. If you are still in school, or if you are out but still have close relationships with your professors, you can always find out what kind of projects they have. DARPA projects are especially nice because they are large in scope and there's always a need for extra people. Don't expect to be paid much though.<p>I chose route 2 - after my startup failed I wanted to do something that paid, was not as intense, and had nothing to do with Web 2.0 and Social Networking and all that, so I just e-mailed a professor.",1224027956.0

We estimated with devices with good airflow you could stay within the operating temperature range of most computer components with the outdoor air temperature in North Dakota (at least on the high side... you'd have to close the vent window in the winter).

I wonder how this kind of service could be fooled or played or worse misattributed?<p><i>""... Spokeo fits in nicely I think, to answer the so what and offer a more rounded view on prospective candidates. ... It reduces asymetry (sic) of information and reduces the risk of adverse selection by employers ...""</i><p>It would do nothing to reduce risk. In fact I'd go further to say that organisations that hire on unverified information are open to risk of future legal action. This is information gathering at its worst. How does more information of dubious quality on a candidate rule them out distinguishing themselves at a given task? I would propose a counter application to the likes of Spokeo - a registry of potential employers. Free along the line of Craigslist. Someone looking for a job can view lists of companies by sectors and geography, rated by what matters to employees and updated.<p>This is an example of asymmetry.<p>Companies may have more money but there are more employees than companies. More data thrown at the employee allows greater scrutiny than what I guess most companies would like. A comprehensive list of companies worldwide ranking them by employee friendliness. More information in choice of companies you work for might make you think twice before you apply. The cream of companies rising to the top? For example imagine if you could view a company that you thought might be a good place to work only to find company information:<p>- In the press: current directors are constantly in the news for poor financial results, mismanagement or outright law breaking.<p>- Ethical status: encourage low wages and outsource, made no efforts to improve greenhouse gas emissions<p>- Enhancement: no effort to supply extra training<p>- Finances: public finance information reported against the rest of the market. For startups it might also have the VC's or publicly declared finance as this has implications on how a company behaves.<p>- Blunders: What was the last publicly acknowledged blunder? How was it handled.<p>- Relations: do they have induction? how do they handle various HR issues?<p>As you imagine if you start to put the spotlight back on companies that employ people a lot of PR companies will be getting anxious calls.<p>Maybe it might force change?<p><i>""...  I don't think there's any substitute for a good face-to-face interpersonal interaction to determine a person's character or suitability for a role. ...""</i><p>This is one point I agree on. The problem, the best shady characters can fool all but the most thorough of vetting. I'm not sure that software can play a meaningful part in this process?",1224026909.0

A reasonably powerful dedicated server can handle serving an incredible number of requests for static content. Any good host (like ServerBeach) is going to have far more bandwidth to spare than what you're running to your own rack. They can also give you additional servers in an hour or two in an emergency. Far more quickly than you can buy and install your own.<p>Using dedicated servers these days is not like it was in the past. Servers are far more powerful and bandwidth is far cheaper. One beefy server can do what a dozen older generation machines could do. That 40 server rack in 2001 is  a couple dedicated servers in 2008. For me, at least.",1224026139.0

The logic being that most of their troops are getting deployed to inhospitable environments (Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.) and if they can monitor environmental conditions for things like excessive heat, sandstorms, laser sniper sights, explosive residues, they can save lots of soldiers' lives.
