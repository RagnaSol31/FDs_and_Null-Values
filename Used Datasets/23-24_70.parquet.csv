Pulling individual frames out of a video is simple, so you just pull a few frames out of the video and run your regular image CAPTCHA breaking algorithm on them. Since you've got multiple frames, your software has multiple attempts to compare which makes it even more robust.<p>Meanwhile it doesn't solve any of the actual problems with CAPTCHAs that others mentioned.",1281311949.0

However, as you can see above, only about 1 in 4 of those women is actually into both guys and girls at the same time. I know this will come as a big letdown to the straight male browsing population: three-fourths of your fantasies are, in fact, fantasies of a fantasy.

36,1586501,comment,1585646.0,1585646.0,0,0,dprice1,,,"Many of the sentences in this paragraph suffer from one of the following defects: poor grammar, redundancy, excessive jargon, excessive use of metaphor (""as a toy ... dodo's game ... chips on the table"", ""gearing up to bet big""), and spelling mistakes.  This greatly reduces the credibility of the author.  The use of comma to connect sentence fragments improperly is really painful: ""Web developers are happy, but all the other platform hackers are sad, flash, silverlight, ..."".  The literal meaning of this sentence is that ""other platform hackers"" are, among other things, ""flash"".<p>The paragraph's construction makes it hard for the reader to know what the main point is.  At the beginning of the paragraph, I was lead to believe that the topic of the paragraph was the lineage and evolution of HTML5 and its emergence from a previous failure.  Halfway through, the topic shifts (""Implicitly,"") to discuss the implications of the technology.  In the third half, it seeks to get to a ""bottom line,"" which seems to be ""you should care about HTML5.""<p>The lack of hyperlinks and references has several knock-on effects.  The first is that claims made (""Some dismiss"") smell like straw man arguments or like hyperbolic statements (""there will be no more versions of html"").  Another effect is that the reader is left with no way to learn more, making this a pretty shocking example of the failure to use hypertext (ironically, to discuss hypertext markup technology).<p>Some recommendations: (1) Print out the paragraph, take a pen, and start crossing things out.  Seek to reduce the number of words.  (2) Read your work out loud, as you would read a book to a child.  Not as you would talk to a buddy over a beer.  (3) Review some books on clear writing.",1281310818.0

Cohesive in this context refers to the user land and kernel software ecosystem of the project. GNU/Linux is called ""GNU""/""Linux"" because it is the user land software of the GNU project bundled with the kernel of the Linux project. The development of base user land utilities and software is done in completely separate fashion from that of the kernel - they are then mixed and matched into ""distributions"".<p>That model has a key advantage, namely, organic growth through asynchronous development - innovation in the kernel has it's own programmer resources and isn't limited by the development path of the user land; the same can be said of user land. Now, it's also a disadvantage in that, you have gazillions of distributions that are now mixing and matching user land software with completely different methods of managing that software (yum, apt, rpm, etc..).<p>FreeBSD, however, develops the kernel <i>and</i> its base user land all in unison. There are no distributions, there is just ""FreeBSD"" and as a result, there is just one method for managing user land software (ports). The key advantage here is uniformity and tight integration with the components of the kernel and the base user land system.<p>BSD vs. GNU <i>ls</i> or <i>grep</i> or <i>awk</i> is moot - they are practically the same tools. The difference is that they are developed and refined with the base system (which means Clang/LLVM will now be compiling those tools).<p>I liken the difference of FreeBSD vs. GNU/Linux to the days when vendor hardware was cohesively developed and the modern days where all of your components come from separate vendors. There are pros and cons to both. My preference is the *BSD way :)",1281309337.0

All of the advice in people's comments so far is spot on.<p>I ended up in the southern tip of the mission where Mission, Noe Valley and Bernal meet and love it.  $800 a month in a nice 4 bed 2 bath, w/d in unit, new everything.<p>I had been watching the rentals/roommates space on Craigslist for 5-6 months while saving up to move.  Unfortunately for both of us, we missed the bottom of the rental price market.  They have definitely been trending up over the past few months as the tech scene is starting to get frothy again.  So watch dates if you are reading articles on people moving here.<p>I stayed with 3 different hosts off of Airbnb.com for a little over 2 weeks while finding a place. I would book for 4-5 days.  I lost two places to live at the last minute, and both hosts had other people booked so I had to find new Airbnb hosts last minute.  BUT, it was super easy, Airbnb has a short notice/standby feature where they literally tell all of the hosts who want those alerts that someone needs a place fast.  I had 6-7 host offer within an hour both times.<p>One interesting note on cost of rent that I just noticed...You very rarely have to turn the heat on and most places don't have AC.  As opposed to the Midwest (I'm from Nebraska) where either one is cranked year round. This time of year in NE our electric bill would easily be $150+ a month (in a small two bedroom), and I've seen insane bills for heating with gas in the winter.  So for me there is really $100-$200 a month that moved from HVAC costs to rent.<p>I cut my possessions in half before moving back home, and then again before moving out here.  I boxed up all my stuff really good and left it at home.  Flew out here with suitcases full of clothes, then had my 4-5 boxes shipped UPS once I found a place.<p>I sold my car.  I've been extremely car dependent since I was 16.  Adjusting to this change in transportation has been the hardest thing to adapt...but honestly it has been easier than I thought and not having a car is awesome.  You said you come from the Midwest too, so I imagine you are car dependent has well so here are my quick tips to ditching it in SF.<p><pre><code>   -  Sign up for the ZipCar program.  $50 a year, $8-$12 per hour (gas and insurance included) cars on demand.  I have never been more than 4 blocks from a ZipCar when I needed it for getting furniture off craigslist, big store run, etc.  Good phone apps\n\n   - Get a Clipper Card (previously TransLink) and either load cash or passes.  I signed up to Autoload a Fast-Pass every month.  $60 for unlimited MUNI and BART every month, a little more than one tank of gas.  And they work smooth.\n\n   - I use the built in Google maps on my iphone to plot a route and see what line I need.  I then pop over to an app called Routesy that is better for getting a complete picture of the stops and ETAs for any MUNI or BART Line.\n\n   - Get a bike, I snagged an insanely awesome bike that was barely used and 3 months old with receipts off Craigslist for well under half price. Pro Tip:  Google maps for bikes will plot you around the hills as much as possible.\n</code></pre>\nAs for food costs, SF expands the high end options but still has plenty that is affordable.  There will be tons of places you can eat for $20, $30, $40+ a meal if you want, but at the same time you can find plenty of places to grab a bite for under $10.  And the $10 meals here are a lot higher quality than in the midwest.<p>Feel free to drop me a line if you want to chat more or grab a coffee/drink when you get here. schaecher.michael gmail",1281308411.0
