None of them.</i><p>Do you have data that indicates that contributes to RSI?  My personal experience is that trying to ""sit up straight"" and maintain ""good"" posture is the fastest, most direct route to wrist pain.  Like, less than a half hour.  By contrast, if I slouch my body, my wrists can maintain a graceful positive curve (not straight or bent back) and I can comfortably code or game for hours (though I try not to sit in one place that long, in general).  As a side benefit, this also puts my eyes at a better angle when I'm using the laptop screen.",1313538747.0

However, it was not until last year that I eliminated the pain completely.<p>The solution was simple strength training. Not weight lifting (I think that was a major contributor early on.) Within a few weeks of starting the beginner program in the book ""You Are Your Own Gym"" the pain was gone. I fully expected to have severe wrist pain and nerve damage for the rest of my life.<p>I hope this helps someone.

People only whined about the ""evercookie"" method of tracking because of the potential for abuse (across multiple Web properties). Why on Earth would you care if someblog.com knows for sure that you've been to their site five times? I don't think the problem here is that you can be tracked using multiple methods that were not originally intended for use in tracking. I think the problem is that people always had a false sense of privacy (i.e., there was ignorance about what can and cannot be used to track your client).<p>You're accessing a remote server. There will always be a way for sites to track your visits. <i>There is a necessity for those sites to track your visits.</i> Don't care about their necessity to track you?

I was quite disappointed later to find that, while all the sewage here goes through treatment, it does not get directly pumped back into the water pipes, but instead gets pumped back into the rivers.
