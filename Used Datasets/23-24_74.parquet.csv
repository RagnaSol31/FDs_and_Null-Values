When seeing arguments on why 16-bit/44.1kHz is insufficient, I more often see faualty reasoning and a lack of evidence to support the arguments being made.<p>You are correct in that human hearing is highly sensitive in the 300-3kHz band, and that sensitivities to minute timing and phase differences between the ears helps us accurately localize sound with only two ears. But I fail to see how that is relevant to whether or not 16-bit/44.kHz digital audio being enough to reproduce sound without audible distortion.<p>Are you aware of some evidence that shows how 16-bit/44.1Khz is insufficent?
