I switch between Windows(work) and Mac (personal) all the time and i have never seen anything Flash playing ""slower"" on mac.</i><p>I think you'll find that, with regards to computer software ""slower"" and ""uses more resources"" are generally interchangable; it's a trade-off. And ""slower"" can be quite obviously observed when a ""uses more resources"" app hits a resource limit. For instance, there are flash games (not videos -- _games_) which are so choppy as to be unplayable on my  dual core 2.5GHz MBP -- because it uses too much of ""more resources,"" and runs out of cpu cycles.",1266710186.0

And the opposite is true too; an embedded video is more visually interesting (think of the still frame) than a generic link, making it more likely that you'll bother to actually watch the video.<p>There's also a cost to the embedding site -- embedded videos keep the viewer's attention local, whereas linked videos send them offsite, possibly never to return.

Rather, there are more fundamental problems with formal representations of semantics.<p>Once you start to sit down and try and encode all knowledge in a formal manner, one begins running into Godelian imcompleteness. Tugging on the string and trying to resolve inconsistencies leads to more special cases and more descriptions, which in turn lead to more special cases and more descriptions, and so on.\nIn ""Ambient Findability"", a book on the future of information finding, author Peter Morville calls Knowledge Representation the <i>""quagmire""</i> of good old-fashioned AI.<p>There is a certain benefit to the formal representations used by the semantic web. Namely, that communication between different systems is enabled by communicating using discrete tokens. The discreteness of these tokens make the choice of token unambiguous, but does not mean that it is a perfect map of meaning. This is similar to language, which is an incomplete and imperfect representation of what is nebuluous and informal in the brain. For example, if I use the word ""healthy"", you can be pretty confident that I used this particular word (assuming you heard me okay), but you are not necessarily confident that you know precisely what that actually means. We communicate with distinct tokens as our language not because it is a perfect map of meaning, but because its better than using continuous linguistic representations. Imagine if you weren't even sure what word I used at any given point in time, because words are fluidly flowed into each other. So even though knowledge is better modeled probabilistically and continuously, it might be difficult to communicate with a language whose representations was explicitly probabilistic and continuous.<p>The semantic web shouldn't be viewed as a be-all end-all perfect encoding of knowledge. Rather, it should be viewed as a language for machines to communicate, in an imperfect way, but better than having no language at all.",1266708831.0

I now have, and have had for months, a daily real-time paper dashboard of how all my habit-generating projects are proceeding.<p>The key is to focus on generating habits rather than accomplishing goals. To understand why, consider the phenomenon of passive income. Passive income is money which comes from projects that make you money. A person who works at a job trades time for money. A person who builds passive income projects decouples time from money, and puts their time into building something which will, once built, generate money for them autonomously.<p>Every programmer should know that tight coupling leads to bad OO design. It also leads to bad business structure. Passive income wins over working for a living because you get a much more enjoyable lifestyle. Instead of working to make money, you create things, and those things make money for you.<p>In the same way that passive income gets you money on autopilot, when you focus on habits instead of goals, you accomplish your goals on autopilot. You decouple time from money with passive income; when you generate the right habits, you decouple effort from results. You put a little time in to create a passive income project, and thereafter it generates money for you; you put a little effort in to create habits, and thereafter your habit gets results for you.<p>When I got in the habit of creating mp3s every day and marking each daily mp3 on a calendar, I didn't just establish the habit of making music every day. I also established the habit of completing a tiny project every day. This is the part that changed my life. Over the past year, I have morphed from a completely disorganized person into an unusually organized one. I used to never even make a to-do list; now I have an original planning and organizing system with three separate layers. All this happened because I started by establishing the habit of completing projects.<p>When the mp3 thing started working well and I started tracking many other desired daily habits, I created a pattern of working to complete small tasks every day. The brain is a fantastic pattern-matching machine, and if you focus on creating habits, your brain will generalize out to broader things. Since I was in the habit of tracking my music and my workouts, I soon fell into the habit of tracking how often I ate the way I wanted to eat and even how often I put gas in my car. Once I had established these habits, of tracking nearly everything on paper, it became absolutely trivial to make and complete to-do lists every day, and to track my finances, my weight, and my sleep schedule on a daily basis.<p>Remember, this took me a year. But all you have to do to get started is pick one thing you really care about, more than anything else, and make a deal with yourself that you will do at least one tiny bit of work on that one thing every single day. Put that on your calendar, mark an X on the day every time, and don't break the chain. That's the Seinfeld method (google ""Seinfeld Lifehacker""). If you want to expand that method to something more sophisticated like me, it will be easy to do, AFTER you have taken the time to establish this habit of completing one tiny project every single day.<p>If you do what I just told you, your problem will be solved for the rest of your life.",1266708083.0

The level of warming is not precendented in recent (geological) history\n- the rate of warming from 1979-2005 matches other rates of warming in the instrumental record, so the rate of warming is not unprecedented.\n-there has been no statistically significant warming since 1995\n-the production of co2 and associated increase in the atmosphere has followed previous trends and predictions\n- sea ice loss and glacier loss may or may not be related to the warming temperature, in many cases it is not clearly known (ie Himalayas) and requires more study.  In other cases it may be microclimate changes causing snow loss (Kiliminjaro, deforestation)\n- there is no statistically significant increase in extreme weather events measured over the 20th century.  While there was an increase in insurance losses, this is due to more people and property living in high risk areas.\n- the early IPCC and other predictions made in the late '80s and early '90s have failed to predict the global average temperature\n- the underpinning of the AGW theory is that the earth has warmed since the mid 20th century, and scientists haven't been able to find any other reason, so the assumption is that it is greenhouse gases causing this, given they have gone from ~ 0.000035% to .000038% of the atmosphere<p>Don't believe me though : these are the facts as I have read and understand them, everyone reads and believes different things.

The symptoms of caffeine intoxication are not unlike overdoses of other stimulants. It may include restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, irregular or rapid heart beat, and psychomotor agitation.[89] In cases of much larger overdoses, mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, and psychosis may occur, and rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked.\nIn cases of extreme overdose, death can result. The median lethal dose (LD50) given orally, is 192 milligrams per kilogram in rats.[2] The LD50 of caffeine in humans is dependent on weight and individual sensitivity and estimated to be about 150 to 200 milligrams per kilogram of body mass, roughly 80 to 100 cups of coffee for an average adult taken within a limited time frame that is dependent on half-life. Though achieving lethal dose with caffeine would be exceptionally difficult with regular coffee, there have been reported deaths from overdosing on caffeine pills, with serious symptoms of overdose requiring hospitalization occurring from as little as 2 grams of caffeine. Death typically occurs due to ventricular fibrillation brought about by effects of caffeine on the cardiovascular system.\nTreatment of severe caffeine intoxication is generally supportive, providing treatment of the immediate symptoms, but if the patient has very high serum levels of caffeine then peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or hemofiltration may be required.<p>It is insane to write and publish articles like that, without warning people about the risks of caffeine general high usage, and overdose.",1266707522.0
