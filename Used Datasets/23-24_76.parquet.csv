I don't really care too much about polish, since, I mean, it does what <i>I</i> want, I have the excuse of working around other peoples' software, and at worst someone finds out that I did something wrong, and we all benefit. Plus, having it on github makes it really easy to work on it from different locations, and version control helps me document just where all my friggin' time went.<p>The biggest concerns I've heard from other researchers (ie, professors) has to do with being beaten at a publish.

You'll find it easily on Weezic with all the ressources you need to enjoy playing it: Scores, Customizable accompaniment files in high mp3 quality and other musicians to share it with"".<p>I hope this answers your questions about the offer.<p>Regarding the business model, people will have to pay to access our content (scores + accompaniments, etc.) but the user-generated part will be free of course.<p>If you're interested in the project you can contact me at: nicolas@weezic.com\nIf you're in Paris, why not have a beer and discuss it in more details.  Thanks again for your feedback!<p>ps: \nI hope my reply is in line with this forum's rules as I am new to this forum and new to the web dev community.\nPlease also forgive any mistake in my english as I am French.",1287012606.0
