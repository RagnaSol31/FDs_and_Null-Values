It would require a developer to specifically disregard the overall philosophy of a web based apps and a Cloud OS.  Don't get me wrong.  In my perfect world Google would force developers not to do this but as it is I don't think it's something you're likely to see much of (my understanding is that Google is focusing on SD usage for media just to prevent this)<p>On users value of functionality - Again the question comes back to one of ""what functionality will they really be losing"".  Particularly with WebGL and Flash both available to developers I really don't see a functionality gap.<p>Forcing Android to the Cloud - If you just desperately want to save Android you could absolutely do this but what's the point.  If you're going to force everyone to the cloud and you can build your development environment around web based tools than why wouldn't you?  More to the point why would Google spend a bunch of time and money turning Android into a Cloud based OS when they already have a Cloud based OS",1292716532.0

36,2020606,comment,2020495.0,2020579.0,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,I think the answer to both your questions is that the only way Google will succeed with ChromeOS is if they consider it a long-term play.  The goal should be to have the most refined cloud based system 5-10 years from now.   When looking at your questions from that perspective I’d give you two answers…<p>On Peripherals – Google is already addressing that problem with Cloud Print right now.  The same concepts could easily be translated to other peripherals.  Anyone whose tried to use it will tell you the concept is very rough right now but it has promise and several companies have agreed (in theory) to support it in their hardware with future versions.<p>On Large Files – I don’t know of anyone who doesn’t think our current bandwidth is just a fraction of what will be available to us 10 years from now.  For video editors who need to use raw files I don’t think Chrome is appropriate but Google’s said as much by targeting the OS at the netbook/low-end notebook market to start.  Again the point is to refine the OS through iteration (as Google does with all their products) so when editing video in the cloud is a possibility they'll already have the most refined OS for it.,1292715355.0

The ""everything is in the cloud"" goes both ways. Prevent me from accessing it and your OS is actually less ""cloud-capable"". Like ChromeOS is.<p>Edit:\nTo come off a little bit less rantish, what I think is the key point here is that the proponents of ChromeOS, who wants it to succeed, has their vision somewhat clouded (pun intended).<p>I don't think anyone here questions the potential of the web as a platform. For certain kinds of applications. We have all seen the amazing stuff happening on the web, while the desktop has been at a relative standstill. We know what this technology can do, and it is finally getting some momentum. Change is happening at a fantastic pace and we're moving forward towards a new web with even more capabilities.<p>But in all this excitement it's easy to forget that just because a platform <i>can</i> do something doesn't mean it's the best fit for the task. Certain things just works better as local applications. Remember the catch-phrase ""use the right tool for the job""?<p>Why do you want to shoehorn everything into the web, even where it doesn't provide you any benefits? Why should we scrap all out working applications, just because someone out there has written the same application, somewhat limited, in HTML and JS? And why are you so eager about losing control of your data?<p>Lots of common computer use-cases depends on reasonable IO-capabilities. Until everyone has at least a 100mbps synchronous internet-connection and the internet as a whole has a backbone to support this, these kinds of applications will be severely impaired.<p>The web is nice.

Printers, scanners, video cameras, etc. These devices are used by a wide range of users, from someone who emails pictures to their family, to an amateur who wants to shoot their next film project.<p>Right now, these devices are not very cloud friendly. In general you plug your printer, scanner, etc. into a USB or Firewire port. From there the operating system needs to work with the printer through some kind of driver. With the sandboxing that I've seen with Chrome OS, it appears to be a  rather daunting task to support a wide array of such devices.<p>Another issue is the bandwidth cost. Let's say I somehow make a video camera ""web enabled"". Instead of interfacing with the PC through USB, it connects through wifi or wired ethernet. From there you could upload your video to a cloud app that does video editing, or upload it straight to youtube. However, what happens though when it's an hour long video of a family wedding? Depending on the camera's storage format, this could turn out to be a giant gigabyte file, and will take a ridiculously long time to upload given standard broadband connections.<p>Until this issue has a good solution, I see it extremely difficult to achieve this ""live in the cloud"" philosophy. This is not to say it's impossible, just that it needs to be well thought out.",1292714571.0

ChromeOS, believe it or not, employs the Apple method of success.  Apple imposes all kinds of restrictions on its developers but the end result is applications that are remarkably uniform.  By making ChromeOS web only Google is imposing “use the cloud” on its developers and in doing so creating an environment that fulfills the promise of portability (Android and iOS come close but aren’t anywhere near seamless)<p>As for the two points that will lead to Chrome’s demise…<p>ChromeOS will lose because it will lack native apps – That seems short sighted to me.  If Android is brought to the point where it supports web apps built for ChromeOS there will be very little reason to develop native Android apps.  Assuming ChromeOS is not dead on arrival it makes all the sense in the world to target 2 platforms instead of one (especially when the development tools are the same ones everyone uses on the web).
