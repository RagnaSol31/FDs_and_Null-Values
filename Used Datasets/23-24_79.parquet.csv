Let me give you an example, using one of my current projects.  I met two friends (about a month ago) for a brewski.  Turns out they are golfers.  We went to Harding driving range and Lincoln golf course.  When we were on the 2nd hole at Lincoln it occurred to me that there are people who would probably like a photo survey of the local golf courses.  We have roughly 15,000,000 visitors a year here.  So now I'm building an iPhone app that will help tourists plan their golfing forays.<p>I see opportunities everywhere I look.  And so far, I have not had a failure.  Not all ideas are reachable, but there are always many that require no investment other than my time and energy.  (and always remember:  Time is non-renewable.  Budget your time very carefully so it is profitable)<p>I think the most valuable lesson I've learned is that being successful in business is not based on how much money you have.  It is much more based on how you allocate your resources.  Time is the most important one, because it is non-renewable.<p>I wish you great success in the future!",1275090987.0

Almost three years ago to the day I wrote an article outlining what Digg should do in light of the launch of the Facebook Platform:<p>1. Digg should become the default way people like and share things on the web and, in particular, Facebook.<p>2. Digg should reflect shared content through the social graph, vs. showing me an aggregate view of all activity in the world.  The former is social, the latter is not.<p>3. Digg should have a concerted Facebook strategy to accelerate their growth, focusing particularly on the Facebook feed (which was less than a year old at the time).<p>Three years later Digg is just getting around to this, but Facebook has already gotten to (1) and (2) with their ""like"" button and their new connect implementation.<p>Ho hum.  To little too late?  Sites like <a href=""http://likebutton.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://likebutton.me/</a> are in many ways more compelling than digg, which is still dominated by stories that appeal to a very narrow demographic.<p><a href=""http://20bits.com/articles/5-ways-to-improve-the-digg-app/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://20bits.com/articles/5-ways-to-improve-the-digg-app/</a><p>Also, FWIW, Eli White from Digg responded to my article noting the technical difficulty in implementing some of my suggestions -- difficulties which were shortly eliminated by changes to the Facebook platform.

Please tell me when you find out.  :(<p>UX as a discipline is still pretty unrefined: people are only just now realizing that you need actual (traditional) design (art, usability, ergonomics, cognitive science, psychology) skills to really do your job well.<p>A lot of people who call themselves web designers, user experience designers, user interface designers, information architects, interaction designers, etc., today, even (especially?) senior- or architect-level ones, are there because they were mucking about with HTML very early on, but they are often stuck in their current company because they don't have the modern skills we expect.  They didn't keep up.  They're grandfathered in.<p>Example: I interviewed people for a ""web artist"" position recently.  I'd expect someone in that position to have good traditional layout, composition, sketching, drawing, coloring (whether painting or markers or Photoshop) skills, understanding of and practice using grids, typography, font selection, be able to describe their design process, how to run a critique, how to take a critique, <i>plus</i> a basic understanding of not just HTML, but CSS, <i>and</i> that they keep up on things like CSS animations and such.  That's all on top of other things like demonstrated ability to work as part of a large team (jacks of all trades are immediately suspect) and being able to sit for long periods.<p>One person we interviewed stopped learning about the web when tables were okay to use for layout.  One person couldn't articulate their design process.  One person couldn't explain the difference between serif and sans-serif.<p>At my last employer, we talked about this huge list of knowledge domains that a UX person should know, how you need some theoretical or practical experience in all of them, plus depth in at least N of them.  This came up a few years ago with the ""levels of knowledge"" lists:<p><a href=""http://friendlybit.com/css/levels-of-css-knowledge/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://friendlybit.com/css/levels-of-css-knowledge/</a><p><a href=""http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200605/levels_of_html_knowledge/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200605/levels_of_html_...</a><p>There isn't anything really like that for UX, although I've been sketching out ideas for one, coming out of the workshops I run.<p>The professional organizations are similarly disparate: IXDA is voluntary and (because of that?) I don't feel like it has a lot of ability to provide social pressure towards particular skill sets.  Other organizations have narrower specialties: AIGA is for artists, UPA is for usability engineers, ASIS&T is for the information sciences, HFES is for ergonomics engineers, SND is for newspaper designers, SPD is for magazine designers...  all of these organizations <i>say</i> they're branching out but I don't get the impression that any of them have any traction.  That said, I also feel like I should be an active member of all of them.<p>In the short term, you might have the best luck networking within the media programs at art and design schools.  I'd bet you were in the minority in your CS program, hacking on open source in your spare time.  There will be a similar minority in the art departments, people applying their skills to web or games or some such.<p>Good luck!",1275088597.0

It simply is recognizing user demand seen across the web for social features and adding that into its product.<p>2. You say you get enough sharing on Facebook, etc. but what's funny is every time a new sharing/social site launches, over time, we've all grown to begin using it anyway. First we had Delicious (2003), then we added Facebook (2004), then we added Twitter (2006), then we added Google Buzz (2010). Clearly folks ARENT getting enough of it on any one of those sites, since each site has been able to build sufficient user bases. The Internet's a huge world, and different products will appeal to different groups; many can survive. Besides, if we only had one platform, all the privacy folks would be up in arms (as they get from time to time about Google or more recently Facebook) that X company controls too much of our information. Ultimately, competition/multiple platforms is a good thing. Digg entering this space only adds to that.<p>3. You can still type in Digg.com and see what the ""world"" finds interesting, however now you'll get to see what your friends/followers/""tastemakers"" find interesting too. Think of it as a USA Today adding a ""local"" section.<p>4. At first, I agreed with your point that v4 does not appear to show a solution to Digg's lowest common denominator problem. However, upon further thought, it does. Digg has given the power to the user. During the ""onboarding process"" you select who you follow, friend, etc. and decide what your stream of ""My News"" will look like. Follow all brilliant people and you'll get interesting, valuable content. Follow idiots and you'll get great funny pictures of cats. Follow a mix and you'll get both.<p>5. Ultimately I can see myself using the new Digg, but it will take time to see how it fits into my arsenal of social websites. If it doesn't do enough to differentiate itself, it'll go by the wayside.
