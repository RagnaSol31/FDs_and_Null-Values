There were even two major Hollywood movies built around the idea. And predictably, justin.tv in its original form did fail, but in the process opened up a new opportunity based more on a 'long tail' strategy.<p>This is a great example of how funding and connections are more important than a good idea. It gives you the luxury of changing direction if something doesn't work. And ultimately, the proximate cause of every business failure is running out of money. The lesson here is to gain the trust of wealthy patrons who are willing to give you a $50K check just to see how you fail.",1297555066.0

Maybe it's not general intelligence, but there is something.<p>Suppose you threw a different set of things into the bag: phase of the moon at birth, whether you were bitten by a wolf, and how good you are with computers. These things almost certainly will not be correlated, because there is indeed no relationship between them. The only reason the author discovered a large principal component in all his models is because he explicitly built one in!<p>Now, my analogy with physics is not to the physics of today. Rather, it's to physics pre-Boltzman. Before that, we didn't really know how the atomic theory of physics was related to thermodynamics. All we really had were correlations - boiling is correlated with burning, with faster chemical reactions, expansion of solids, with the human perception of warmth, etc. We observed they all occurred together, and postulated an underlying variable T which correlated well with all of them.  We then exploited the correlation between this hidden variable T and thermal expansion to design a specific test to measure it (thermometers).<p>Pre-Boltzman, all we had were correlations between fundamentally different physical phenomena. We had various incorrect theories about why some of them occurred together, but that's about it.<p>Now suppose Boltzman comes along. He says ""what you call a single variable T, I can explain with the sum of many variables."" Does that mean it's reasonable to conclude T is a ""statistical myth""?",1297554849.0

These assumptions are not universally correct, and I suspect that their degree of correctness is rather strongly overestimated.<p><i>Founder groups would have the same problem in pre-formation situations. Say, four founders build something that they have worked on for a full year and are prepared to launch. One of them defects and says to the group, ""I am going to take everything that we have worked on and take it for myself."" Of course, that is outrageous. Buy why? Because laws exist that declare it illegal for someone to misappropriate what the founders have been working on. Those are IP laws. They protect the interests in intangible property. Without them, every founder would be vulnerable to such defections, without any form of legal recourse.</i><p>That doesn't sound like any of the standard copyright/patent/trademark/trade-secret categories, it sounds like it has something to do with (probably implied) contracts.<p><i>Open source is no exception. It relies heavily on rules of copyright law and on licensing to make its system work. If everything were freely shareable without any form of restriction, one does not have open source - one has freeware.</i><p>So then Postgres, SQLite, the BSDs, clang, etc are freeware instead of open source?<p><i>Startups depend heavily on IP laws.

I can understand why - you don't know what the opportunity cost is. None of us do. But that doesn't make your defence valid.<p>If the government gave people privilege for howling at the moon, there would be a startup scene around it.

Even if it were true, there are mechanisms that predate conceptions of IP that can be used to defend trade secrets, particularly contract.<p><pre><code>    Startups depend heavily on IP laws. \n</code></pre>\nOnly some do.
