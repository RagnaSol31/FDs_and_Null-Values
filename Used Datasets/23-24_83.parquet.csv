13,2574590,comment,2573708.0,2574494.0,3,0,teyc,,,"As a library developer, you can explicitly declare all your methods as overridable. The key point is that in large scale software development, in Java, you can have the following undesirable situation:<p>Version 1, you import a third party library:<p><pre><code>    public class ThirdParty\n    {\n        public void calculateAndPrintResult()\n        {\n            System.out.println(""1"");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class Mine extends ThirdParty\n    {\n        public void calculateAndPrintResult()\n        {\n            super.calculateAndPrintResult();\n            this.printResult();\n        }\n\n        protected void printResult()\n        {\n            System.out.println(""2"");\n        }\n\n        public static void main(String[] arguments)\n        {\n            Mine mine = new Mine();\n            mine.calculateAndPrintResult();\n            // Prints 1, 2\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nVersion 2, third party has refactored and introduced printResult. You swap in the new third party library and suddenly the behavior has changed:<p><pre><code>    public class ThirdParty\n    {\n        public void calculateAndPrintResult()\n        {\n            this.printResult();\n        }\n\n        protected void printResult()\n        {\n            System.out.println(""1"");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class Mine extends ThirdParty\n    {\n        public void calculateAndPrintResult()\n        {\n            super.calculateAndPrintResult();\n            this.printResult();\n        }\n\n        protected void printResult()\n        {\n            System.out.println(""2"");\n        }\n\n        public static void main(String[] arguments)\n        {\n            Mine mine = new Mine();\n            mine.calculateAndPrintResult();\n            // Prints 2 ! (wrong)\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhile this example is trivial, bear in mind, when you have programming in the large, i.e. large codebases with a lot of third party libraries and many teams of developers, you would rather not have surprises like this pulled on you, or you pulling surprises like this on other people.<p>It can take a lot of work tracking down this kind of bug.<p>When you finally realize this type of issue arises despite everyone following ""best practice"" OOP, then the reason is because ""best practice"" OOP is not actually best practice.",1306108335.0

Whether my files are stored on disk or in a database makes no difference to me so long as I can still interact with my files.  The actual persistence mechanism for ""file"" is an implementation detail.<p>The key thing I get from ""the end of files"" discussions is how a user interacts with data.  From a file point of view you select a file pick an app to pass it to (though usually opting for a default). With an app POV you have to first pick an app and then  have it open (or not) some file.<p>Most of the time, in practice, it amounts to the same thing.  E.g. rarely does one navigate to a .doc file then ponder what app to pass it to.    But in some cases, such as with audio or graphics files, you <i>do</i> want to consider what app to use with a file, and it may be easier to first find the file and then pass it off to an app based on what you want to do with it.<p>The other day I noticed something interesting on my Mac Mini.  I wanted to manipulate an image file, and the default app association (Preview, I think) was not what I wanted.  So I right-clicked to get a choice of apps.  Windows and Ubuntu are pretty good about showing a subset of all possible apps for assorted file types, offering likely candidates (e.g. gimp, Paint.net, Photoshop) as top options.<p>But with OSX I was just given the full list of every app I have installed.  I'm not a frequent Mac user (don't care for the UI choices) but I got the feeling that I was doing something completely out of bounds, that OSX was not meant to help guide me from file to app, that I really should be picking the app first.<p>It left me feeling that this sort of casual exploration and discovery was frowned on, but that might be my OSX-aversion acting up.  Still, I can see the same thing with Google; there's not need for users to think about trying different apps with their data because that's already been decided.-",1306106786.0

58,2574543,comment,2571490.0,2573082.0,1,0,magicalist,,,">The rounded corners issue I talked about wasn't a mark-up issue, it was a basic rendering bug. It took several attempts to fix, over a period of months.<p>You're going to have to point to a bug report, because I don't know what you're referring to. Webkit had poor rendering of border-radius with a varying radius (the edge would be discontinuous), it had an issue where box-shadow would break with rounded corners, and it had an issue where the element background color would show show up slightly outside of any border color. All were bugs, but none were regressions, as far as I know.<p>> Moreover, as long as Google and Mozilla keep releasing ""experimental"" CSS features with syntax and capabilities that aren't yet standardised, they are on a path where the only options are supporting alternative, non-standard functionality indefinitely or breaking existing web sites that were written using the experimental features at some unspecified point in the future. That's starting to sound like IE vs. Netscape all over again.<p>That's just the reality of web development. We should have had a stable foundation for content, styling, and scripting for a decade now, but the standards are now finally being advanced at a decent rate. In order to do this, we need both experimental and working implementations. You'll note that Opera has -o- prefixed css properties and Microsoft has -ms- prefixed properties. That's how it works...implementations are built while specs are being written, but nothing is standardized until interoperable implementations exist. For more: <a href=""http://www.alistapart.com/articles/prefix-or-posthack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/prefix-or-posthack/</a><p>> Google dropped support for H.264 in the Chrome development builds some time ago, and the change is scheduled to be pushed to users of the official release imminently.<p>You're making me second guess myself, but AFAIK, they didn't and it isn't. The announcement was that they will sometime soon, but that was to give people time to switch. I was just able to play h264 videos in dev and canary builds on my windows and mac machines.<p>> If you've got a full ad-blocker for Chrome, I'd love a link. I've never found one anything close to as capable as things like Ad Block Pro in Firefox.<p>There's ""AdBlock"" and ""AdBlock Plus."" I think the second is made by the same guy that makes AdBlock Pro, but I don't really keep up with it. I have click to play enabled for plugins and that'sufficient blocking of annoying things for me.<p>No idea what's up with applets, but the irony of bringing up the font rendering change in Firefox 4 is that Firefox 4 <i>was</i> a long in development, monolithic release. Whether the style of font rendering is a regression or not is up for debate (there were also tradeoffs that had to be made working with GDI and directx), but really it's just a change people don't like, which has nothing to do with changes in release rates. UI and UX regressions happen all the time; that's why it's great to have a choices.<p>Finally, there are two points here:\n1) Only use experimental features if you're willing to be a participant in the process, even if that just means keeping up with implementation changes\n2) Point (1) would only prevent quick release cycles from advancing the state of the web if implementations didn't converge and specs weren't finalized at a rate faster that e.g. IE's release rate. They do, and since HTML5 and CSS3 have moved to a more modular spec format (rather than the decade long process for CSS 2.1), we are going to see the effect of a lagging IE10 over the next two years.<p>All that said, legacy browsers will have a worse effect, so it's really not that bad. I'm not saying that Microsoft is bad (although required browser updates after, say, 3 years with only an opt-out option would make me a happier camper), I just think that the faster release cycles are better for the web (for developers, users, and advancing web standards), and that the growing pains we've experienced have actually been quite minor.",1306106598.0

Except that the whole point of the syncookies is not to keep the state on the server side, i.e. there is nothing that can at all retransmit the SYNACK.<p>The HTTP, being by nature ""client talks first"" protocol, hides this problem (the ACK for the SYNACK will be effectively retransmitted because it will be part of the data segment), but I thought it might be useful to remind that turning syncookies on by default is not the standard modus operandi.",1306106032.0

Could I be the devils advocate for a second.<p>1) Most of the retail chains (I mean the Big/Medium one which are primary target for this kind of system), already has a price check system installed in their store. This can be issues in following way\n	- Why should the store waste some space for new harware\n	- What is stopping these price checking sytem vendors to simply upgrade their system with this feature as addional one. They already have a installed base and customer confiedence, they can kill the market if they see any traction.<p>So ideally you may want to create a single system which will replace this price checking system with addional features. or the reverse.<p>2) Most of the Small shop owners any way wont have space for a price checker/scanner. So this market is pretty limited.<p>3) There are few key advantages for online profile like amazon does.\n	- people can browse at their liesure and no effort/little effort is required from their side to do passive browsing. while nobody will visit a shop juzz to do passive shopping of grocessories/pharmacy. \n	- Passive browsing helps to build one part of the user profile. This is not possible in case of physical profiling. Also there is some effort required from user to scan any item.\n	- For online browsing, you can use IP address/user login details to track a user and hence his profile which can help u display related products. But when u do this physical, unless there is some way user enter his details (either scanning his member card or entering some number), u cannot use his history during shopping time. This will limit ur data to current shopping iteration only.<p>4) Already most of the groceorry shops provides coupons/deal details currently during your billing time based on the items u have purchased. So this is not new.<p>5) Now if these business are ready to share the details (which i dont think they will do)and u are keeping the profile of each consumer/customer in a centralized form, u will have more details during the checkout time. (due to same reason that u wont know the user untill he provides his member card). And that can be more usefull to provide more deals based on\n	- other shopping he has done recently. e,g he bought a tv from best buy and he is in sears, offer him deals on tv stand.\n	- See if u can utilize some social cues. either use facebook or have ur own social features. so that u can tap his friends profile to suggest something.<p>I am not saying these are big issues, but something u need to think before u pursue these idea",1306105929.0
