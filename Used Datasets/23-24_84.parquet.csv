They are supposed to ask technical questions and evaluate how a candidate answers those questions.  That is it...  No analysis of their open source code, no mentions of an insightful blog post they had written, just the information gleaned in the 45 minute interview (at least in 2009, I don't know if this has changed since then).  Engineers actually took great pride in providing a good and welcoming interview with thoughtful questions.  There was even an internal forum where people would discuss the merits of certain interview questions and ban bad questions.<p>Recruiters however have a completely different job.  They go around the internet looking for candidates who look like they are pretty smart (insightful blog posts, open source contributions, etc), however they don't always have the deep technical ability to differentiate people who would and would not be a good fit for Google.  That is why you get into situations where a recruiter excitedly encourages people to apply for a job, and then the interview is upsetting for the candidate because it isn't what they were expecting.<p>When interviewing people for my current job, I do a lot more of looking at a persons blog or open source contributions if they have them when doing diligence about potential hires, but I also expect them to perform, write code and solve technical problems during the interview.  I feel it does give me a better overall sense of the candidate and allows me to make better hiring decisions.  However, at Google scale this just doesn't make sense, as when you have tens of thousands of ultra-qualified candidates beating down the door to work at your company, missing some people would have been good employees just isn't that big a deal if that means your engineers can save a lot of time in the hiring process.",1311551088.0

I came across that idea a couple years ago.<p>I have always written a lot, but I never did it as religiously as morning pages.  I wrote a wiki in 2004 where I keep all my thoughts/notes -- it's about 1000 wiki pages now (probably 2000 without deletions).  Before that I kept a diary but it wasn't really for ""ideas"", more ""complaints"" :)<p>Right now I feel like I have enough ideas and it's about execution... but I do think there is something valid to the approach.<p>It's also similar to what happens when you write down your dreams first thing in the morning (or even during the night if you wake up after them).  I tried this when I was 15.  My mind was blown.<p>I started remembering 7 or 8 dreams a night.  I would go to sleep for 50 minutes and it would feel like I experienced 8 hours of time in my dream.  It was really disorienting (and interesting).  I don't remember but I think it took about 2 weeks of writing before that happened.<p>So this is another example of writing changing your brain.  Your brain wants an audience (or more accurately, your subconscious does, and the subconscious is where ideas are generated).  If you write down your dreams, you'll start having/remembering more of them.  If you write down more ideas, your brain will generate more of them and follow more associations.",1311549832.0

Everything gets taken as for the sake of something else (e.g. as a resource to achieve some ends extrinsic to it), but there is no final ""something else"" to make it all meaningful. The reason he calls this ""cybernetic"" is because it deals with unending loops instead of the sort of hierarchical organization we might have seen in pre-modern times (e.g. with God at the top of the tree of meaning).<p>Philosophy often attempts to dip below accepted meanings and systems of thought. This may make it seem like philosophers ""have no understanding of the technology they're trying to discuss"", but in fact they aren't necessarily discussing technology in the sense which one might assume.
