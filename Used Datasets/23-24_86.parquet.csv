I continue to wrestle with how to simply and accurately convey what I've accomplished (in terms of getting myself well when doctors claim it can't be done), why I believe it generalizes and is replicable, and why I think an improved information delivery system is The Answer rather than some ""charity"".  I think at some point charity to help pay for costs involved in getting well will have it's place but first some serious in-roads need to be made into ""mind share"" -- into convincing people that a completely different way of viewing the problem is essential, more essential than money, drugs, etc.<p>I've spent several years talking to people on online forums and working on getting my head wrapped around the issue.

34,2401286,comment,2399830.0,2401036.0,1,0,A1kmm,,,"IANAL, but from what I've read, the original legislative intent, in most jurisdictions, is that the process by which an artefact is created (including a stream of bits sent over a network or data sent on a block device) rather than the data itself which makes something a protected work - and it is the process of copying that is restricted.<p>If you invent the exact same sequence completely independently, you own it. However, the problem of looking at data and saying that copying happened is one of inference; if I posted exactly the same comment you just wrote, I could have independently come up with your copyrighted comment, and hence own the copyright, but the much more likely explanation is that I copied your comment, and so judges and juries infer copying from similarity that they believe is statistically unlikely.<p>So if person A generates a random string from the uniform distribution, and communicates it securely to a trusted person, B, who XORs the string with your comment, and A shares the random string with the public, while B shares the XORed string, technically only B commits direct copyright infringement, because B created a derivative work by XORing, and broadcast that work (copying). If done properly, no one could prove which person was A and which was B however. In practice, however, it is likely that if both people acted with intent to distribute the work, they would both be at least secondarily liable.",1301787634.0

I'm dubious.<p>* First, there's not much evidence that the person we're talking about really owes a dime to Delaware. He set up a C-Corp (!), which apparently owes some corporate tax, but that doesn't make him personally liable. So, despite choosing the most complicated conceivable way to incorporate in the US, he can probably still just walk away.<p>* Second, does the UK have an LLC or S-Corporation equivalent? That is to say: is there a structure you can use to get pass-through taxation (business proceeds taxed once, as income) instead of corporate taxation, <i>and</i> have a shareholder structure that allows you to grant equity to employees? Because that is exactly the structure most pre-VC and bootstrapped startups want.<p>* Third, the US doesn't have the UK's system of rules requiring qualified directors; for instance, a bankruptcy in the US can't prevent you from being a principal in a company.<p>* Fourth, isn't it more expensive to incorporate in the UK than it is in the US? It costs under $100 to get a liability shield to do business under in the US. What's the equivalent UK cost?<p>* Fifth, and finally, aren't the laws in the US simply more business-friendly than in the UK? UK employees need to be given reasonable notice or compensation prior to termination; the UK is also not an ""at-will"" employment regime, making it harder to fire and thus harder to hire employees.<p>The UK is, from what I've read, the best of the business regulatory regimes in Europe, and the rules don't look <i>onerous</i>; they only look marginally more annoying than those of Delaware. However, I think that by looking at the weird choice made by one blogger (a full-on C-Corp), you might have gotten a distorted idea of what the regs in the US actually are.",1301787052.0

So claiming foul on someone who is notoriously pro fast powerful cars, who inherently isn't going to like commuter based cars, really nails that emotion. 2 Taking it to the media, to hit a full scale marketing campaign about it, years after it happened, to help fuel that emotion and go after the media justice that seems to easy to do, like O.J. we all ""know"" he did it, but was proven innocent pretty much. Enough press coverage to one side, and we all start forming our own judgments. I think these are dirty tricks, that only add fuel to the opposition's fire.
