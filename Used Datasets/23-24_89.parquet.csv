The fact that Javascript is the only language you can realistically use to script the browser is a terrible limitation and legacy of bad technical decisions at Netscape more than a decade ago. I'm always surprised at the lack of concern about this.<p>While I do actually like Javascript a lot, I think we need to have more choices.

3,2982827,comment,2982474.0,2982778.0,7,0,tsm,,,"I'm a vim user who started to really get into Lisp (and now ML for school). Emacs (especially with SLIME) is really the Right Thing for Lisp, so I started using it. I've definitely gotten to the point where `C-a C-k` is as well burned into my fingers as `dd` is...it's just that<p>a) `dd` seems like a more natural keybinding--both because I'd rather double-tap a home row button than involve three fingers and two hands, and because, if you do stop to think about it, `dd` makes sense--`d` means delete, and a double-tap usually makes something apply to a whole line. (Of course, `dd` / `C-a C-k` is just an example--this applies in general.)<p>b) There's more of a zen to vim. It's been discussed before, but it's worth repeating--vim commands form a language with nouns and verbs. `w` means word and `(` means sentence. Now you know two commands. `d` means delete, `y` means yank, and `c` means change. Now you know <i>8</i> commands--`w`, `dw`, `yw`, `cw`, `(`, `d(`, etc. And adding a few more ""nouns"" brings you up to several dozen with minimal effort. Emacs has no direct equivalent * .<p>So I like emacs for the ecosystem, I like it for the freakish integration it can achieve between a REPL and a source file...as they say, it's a great operating system--it just needs a good editor.<p>* - This is not quite true--emacs does try to do sane things with the use of `C` and `M`. `C-f` means ""forward one character"", and `M-f` means ""forward one word""--a ""bigger"" form of the same thing. In the same way, `C-d` deletes a character and `M-d` deletes a word. But now you want to delete a line? Time to learn something completely new.<p><i>Edited to make a lame effort to fix my formatting problems...thus the asterisks surrounded by a sea of whitespace.</i>",1315698961.0

5,2982825,comment,2982185.0,2982762.0,4,0,zohebv,,,"> I mean this inclination doesn't imply anything about what economic policy should be<p>Isn't it disingenuous to infer that this inclination should not imply anything about economic policy? I would arrive at the opposite conclusion. Economics are sentiment driven by a huge factor. Robert Shiller's work in behavioral economics and his book Irrational exuberance has established and popularized this idea. Krugman's discussion of the unsuitability of BitCoin as a currency rests largely on the peculiar nature of human sentiment and behavior. Large income gaps are perceived by most people as unfair irrespective of the contributions by the wealthy. No one thinks that Bill Gates/ Edison made a greater contribution to social progress than Einstein/Gandhi. I don't think the association of the net worth of an individual to the contribution that they have made to society is very strong. Economies rewards people largely on the basis of demand/supply with I believe is a weak proxy for social contributions.<p>Perhaps you want to draw an analogy to say gay marriage where the popular vote might end up denying gay rights, but I don't think a similar argument holds in the case of wealth distribution.",1315698830.0

It's perfectly possible to have a negative net worth, a negative cash flow, a negative effect on the wealth and well-being of the society in which you live, etc.<p>What technology does ""the top end"" have access to that others don't today? Cell phones? Web servers? Technology has always been influential in proportion to its cheapness.

The period of flattening coincides with the heyday of the large corporation.</i><p>Large corporations are still around and arguably more powerful than ever. Yet the difference in pay between the top executives and average workers in those corporations is one way the growing gap between the rich and the not-rich is illustrated and measured.<p><i>I remember the transition quite clearly. When I was a little kid, in the early 70s, the most impressive thing you could do was to work for a large corporation. It was the era of conglomerates in shiny office towers.

I will miss being on that flip side. Yes of course, you can browse more ""efficiently"" online, but I don't go to a bookstore for efficiency, I go for the experience and the serendipity. Most of the time I don't know what book I'll come out of the store with; that almost never happens to me online.<p>I've tried browsing on Amazon, but I always seem to wake up after being put to sleep. There is no serendipity in online book browsing, there is only tracking down and killing something you already know you want. There is certainly no pleasure in it, whether you're browsing or buying.<p>There is a similar loss of serendipity while thumbing through an ebook, or I suppose you'd (ironically) call it paging through an ebook.

On the other hand I have physical books sitting all around me, and I read them all, the ones not on the shelf (but some of them too), some of them more frequently than others, but they all get a chance to remind me that I have something to read.
