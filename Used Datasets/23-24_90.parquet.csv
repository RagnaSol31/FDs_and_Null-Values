But I think your explanation is a great example of what such basic tests are really trying to get at: people's usage habits reflect their level of knowledge.  I agree that the reasons you bring up are valid, and to use the search bar for those reasons shows your grasp of the technology.  There are pleny of people who use the search bar instead of the address bar because they just plain don't understand the address bar.  Their reasons are the complete polar opposite of yours, but the end result is the same or very similar usage pattern.  Unfortunately, like so much in life, it takes a lot more than a simple test to accurately determine the ""why"" behind an action instead of just measuring the ""what.""",1269471812
