America's current economic troubles highlight the importance of looking out for yourself while not making pawns of others.  I don't know of anyone who hasn't felt the stresses of this recession, but I think that those who were most effected by it were those who made a living by exploiting others, and I'd go so far as to say that the millionaires who lost small percentages of their fortunes lost because the greed came full circle.",1255391796.0

11,877925,comment,877466.0,877466.0,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> The only two responses I've gotten to this question when I ask people this is either a.) you're always going to have to do work you don't want to do, or b.) you have to do it because you need to get good grades / graduate high-school / etc.<p>High school:<p>1. Some learning.<p>2. A credential.<p>3. Some socializing and extracurricular.<p>4. A ""rite of passage"" in Western society.<p>That's why people do high school. They don't normally phrase it like that, they say, ""Well, everyone's doing it, it's normal, and it sucks, but you have to do it"" - but the reason why is for some mix of learning, credentialing, ""other benefits"" (normal socializing, team sports, student council, whatever), and finally, the ""rite of passage"" aspect.<p>So this isn't exactly what you asked, but there are options besides high school which will be more motivating, interesting, and beneficial in the long term - if you're talented and disciplined enough to get by without the structure. If you do so, the first goal you ought to consider setting for yourself will be replacing the learning, credentialing, and socializing/other benefits (more on the rite of passage in a moment).<p>Learning - there's some skills in high school that you probably wouldn't be bothered to teach yourself outside of it. Look up your curriculum, and make sure you get decent enough at math, get introduced to the branches of science, read a little history, and make sure you have decent reading/writing skills. It's not hard to learn at a much faster rate than you do in high school. That's easy to replace.<p>Next is the credentialing aspect. You can forgo high school entirely if you're doing very interesting things with your time - no one will care if you've built a company, or organized charity events, or published articles in the newspaper, or anything really interesting. You can say, ""Yes, I was working on [journalism/coding/sales/whatever] and thought that was more important than high school"", and that'll work if you're outside the traditional track. But if you want to go to college and be salaried later, not having a H.S. degree could be a problem.<p>But it's a fixable problem - go to an adult learning center or alternative high school. Tell them you're emancipated from your parents, independent, working for yourself, and don't have time for normal high school. Ask how they can help. Doing it this way, you can get a real, genuine high school degree (sometimes with a very high GPA actually). After that, it's all on your standardized testing and other requirements to get into university. Maybe the highest level unis look into which HS you went to, but most state schools just plug your GPA into their formula and off you go.<p>Finally, the socializing/extracurricular aspect. This is also easy to replace. Take up some extracurriculars. A martial arts, some kind of science society, some kind of nature-based organization, a hiking group, a cycling group, maybe a couple of them. It's important you're in face to fact contact with people and developing your interests, so don't neglect that part if you move on.<p>Finally - the rite of passage. My advice here might be a touch controversial - forgot bowing, kneeling, scraping, and ""paying your dues"" via rites of passage. Seriously. If the benefits from an activity outside of the fact that ""that's just how it's done"" doesn't appeal to you, then try to find a way to get what you want without going through the wasted motions. Everyone successful throughout history had to depart from convention. But you <i>will</i> get hostility, and expect that. I found this quote by Bertrand Russel recently, and it was quite insightful to me:<p>""Conventional people are roused to fury by departures from convention, largely because they regard such departures as a criticism of themselves.""<p>So how do I know all this stuff? I dropped out of a private high school to self teach myself business and computers, and went and ""scummed"" around the local university just absorbing it. Later I re-enrolled in HS, this time in a gifted and talented program. Also very boring, also dropped out, got an adult high school degree (an actual degree, not just a GED), and with decent standardized testing scores, got a full ride scholarship to a decent college. Dropped out after 3 semesters there to start a company, which was successful, and I've since traveled all over the world doing all sorts of interesting things. I don't regret my decisions for a minute - high school? Hah, seriously, what a waste of time. I'm expecting my first child soon, and going to give him or her options to start doing interesting things outside of the mainstream starting around age 12, with just enough tutoring/parent teaching to get overviews of the important knowledge and enrollment in extracurriculars for the socializing and personal growth.<p>High school is fundamentally un-motivating, because it wasn't built for you. It's for people who want to be led down a reasonably certain and secure path and life. Stick with it if you don't have a better option, but if you do, go for it. With the growth of communication and freely accessible knowledge online, going outside the convention is more possible than ever. You will take hostility and abuse from people who don't understand you though, so be prepared for that. Everyone makes their own judgment calls, but it was definitely worth it for me in the end.",1255391536.0

14,877922,comment,877466.0,877466.0,0,0,bkovitz,,,"> \nI've been having issues lately trying to motivate myself to do mundane, or at the very least ""unappealing"", work (namely, [high]school work). It's not that I'm lazy — actually I'm afraid I'm a workaholic sometimes — but that I always find myself giving priority to another project or hobby I enjoy doing and find more worthwhile.\nI personally find I have one of two reactions to tasks I have to do: either I'm completely engrossed in my work and won't sleep, eat, etc. until it's finished, or it is the last thing I would ever possibly want to do with my time and I will do everything but that task<p>Amen, brother.  Same here.<p>Here are some things I've done about this, with some success:<p>1. ""Pair"" on it, even if it's not programming.  Just doing the job with someone else often makes it a lot easier.  Maybe it's theoretically not as efficient a use of time, but, bottom line, the unpleasant task gets done.<p>2. Find a way to not do it.  That is, instead of procrastinating, cancel the task.  This approach calls for creativity: you might redefine your goal so the icky task isn't necessary, or you might pay someone to do it (this is how my kitchen stays so clean), or you might abandon the larger goal that's driving the boring task (e.g. drop out of college), or who knows.<p>3. If the problem is simply lack of momentum rather than true revulsion toward the task, the 5M method ramps up momentum without too much pain.  <a href=""http://false-epiphany.com/2009/04/incompletion-causes-and-solutions/4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://false-epiphany.com/2009/04/incompletion-causes-and-so...</a> I usually find that it takes me about two to three days to ramp up momentum so I'm merrily humming along and don't need to play any more mind games with myself.  Kinda slow, but it does work.  A variation: Wait until the deadline, and rush; or do a rush job right now, with a fairly short time limit, after which you have a hard commitment to go do something fun with someone, somewhere else.<p>4. Pause and theorize about the task.  Why does it arise?  What social/physical/mathematical givens and relationships explain its existence?  Why these tools?  What other tools could do it?  What change in the broader world could make it obsolete, or change the way it's done?  What is the absolute minimum you could do and still get the benefits?  What is the most efficient way to do it?  Optimizing is ""bad"", but it's also fun, and it gets your mind immersed in the task.  Devise the most efficient method you can for doing it, and test your method/skill by measuring your results.<p>5. Just fucking do it.  Sometimes ya gotta suck it in and deal with it.  For inspiration, read what Paul Graham says about determination.  <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/determination.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/determination.html</a>  Take pride in your will of iron, and taste the sweet fruit at the end of a forced march, when your sweat has dried and the Sun hangs low in the sky.  However, if your whole life is sucking in and dealing with, it's time to make a systemic change.  Don't turn into G. Gordon Liddy or something.<p>I have found ",

An example that doesn't bring racism or sexism into this:  I joined a forum some years ago where the owner routinely lamented how he desperately wanted more international members.  He was probably one of the biggest offenders in terms of creating an exclusionary environment that made foreigners feel unwelcome.  One piece of the culture that was very obvious to me as an exclusionary practice was the on-going joke that if you were on the forum at certain times, you were a total loser with no personal life.  These were the same times that people in other time zones would be available to be online (ie people in other countries).<p>At the time, I happened to be frequently up all night.  I made it my goal to actively root out this piece of forum culture and ""set an example"" about how I was online all hours.

29,877907,comment,877466.0,877883.0,0,0,rnesh,,,"I agree with what you say about high school and heading to college. However, I am about a year or so away from finishing my undergrad in CS, and I have to disagree with the idea that college work is entirely interesting. It is true that most of the classes that directly involve your major are found to be more interesting to the individual. The problem is that colleges will require you to take classes that are not always directly related to your major.<p>For example, I am currently taking an upper division political science class, but only because it was required.\nI have no real interest in this course, but my motivation to do the work is to never have to look at it again. I figure if I can do it, and I can do well, then I will never have to sit in this type of class again.<p>The other issue with college is professors. I have had interesting subjects with the most uninteresting professors. This definitely makes the subject matter more difficult to find interesting. The opposite, however, is great. If I have a subject that I can't stand, but a professor that is very excited and interested in the subject, it will usually get me really motivated to do the work.<p>Obviously, these are my opinions, so this will vary from person to person.

What I mostly offer here is a few questions to ask in hopes of getting honest answers for yourself. These tend to turn into much deeper issues than they seem at the surface.  Not that deep issues are bad, but just take longer to work through.  To encourage the full reading of this comment, I have broken into three parts.  I should also note that I am not a certified psychologist, but will pretend to be one if the price is right.<p>PART 1 of 3<p>------------------------------------------------------------<p>I think the key is in what you said here: ""The main problem I have is the pervasive feeling in the back of my mind whenever I spend time doing something that I could be doing something else."" When you say, ""I could be doing something else"", I imagine its just not <i>anything</i> else. Instead it's something that internally drives you to become ""completely engrossed in my work and won't sleep, eat, etc. until it's finished"".<p>What is it about this other stuff that seems so appealing? Because it can be different for everyone, let's just say it's ""stuff that makes me feel X"".  For me, this was \n""stuff that makes me feel creative/unique"".  I found that anytime I was doing ""stuff that makes me feel creative/unique"" I became ""completely engrossed in my work and won't sleep, eat, etc. until it's finished"".<p>SUMMARY - Some tasks/activities/stuff can organically motivate you because it makes you feel a certain way<p>PART 2 of 3<p>------------------------------------------------------------<p>Now, there are some tasks that were towards the middle of the spectrum (""stuff that kind of relates to X or gives me some feeling of X every once in a while"").  But then, and this is the dangerous part, there were tasks that were the opposite of X. So let's say Y = -X and call it ""work that makes me feel like Y"".  Y work was <i>terrible</i>.  Y work made me question whether I should be in the industry and even made me feel depressed.  So, in order to avoid these bad feelings, I would ""procrastinate terribly [which in turn] accomplishes nothing but adding more stress to my life"".<p>This is where you start to go nuts.  You feel like its lose/lose (hate my life when doing it / stressed out when I don't).  Sounds like this is the point you may be at.  But as I eluded to before, the avoidance of these feelings makes sense.  Logically, if something feels bad, we will either put an end to it or try to not let it happen in the first place.  But let's dive into these feelings a little bit more.  If you are not sure what kind of feelings this Y work can cause.  Just ask yourself this question:<p>""What would happen to me if I had a job where I did nothing but Y work""?<p>Obviously, its much more effective if you fill in the Y.  Again, as an example, for me the question was: ""what would happen if I had a job where I did nothing but fix other people's bugs, uncreative maintenance work and writing a bunch of documentation?""  My answer was (and this is where is gets very 'psychological'): ""I would feel like I am not contributing anything special to the organization. Then I would feel I wasn't unique. Then I might be lost in the crowd, forgotten or abandoned"".  Everyone answers will be different, but in most cases it fits a model of ""I would initially feel _________, but that might lead to ___________, which just feels REALLY scary for some reason"".  The second 'blank' is usually one of the basic fears: unworthiness, abandonment, loss of safety, ill health, etc.  I found that being able to honestly and accurately complete that sentence exposed many subtle, but clearly driving forces in my everyday and long term decision making.<p>SUMMARY - Answer the question: ""What would happen to me if I had a job where I did nothing but Y work""?<p>PART 3 of 3<p>------------------------------------------------------------<p>Once you see that some work ""makes you feel Y"", and that Y feelings suck, its easy to understand why procrastination might happen.  But because some of these tasks seem necessary (I'm afraid it's going to cause me to fail school), you try to find a way to do them.  So let's address your specific question: ""How do I make otherwise un-motivating work intrinsically motivating"".<p>I would say you could accomplish this to two degrees:<p>* first degree - somehow believe that doing Y work will NOT result in something that seems terrible (answer to SUMMARY question above)<p>* second degree - figure out how Y work can let you feel traces or bits of X<p>Imagine, abstractly, that the first or second degree is possible. Do you think you would procrastinate less?  I imagine you would because you would not be avoiding what seems like the realization of something terrible.<p>Now, these two suggestions don't seem very actionable (i.e., 'okay now what?').  Things you can actually do or take action on usually results in a change of behaviors and patterns.  Unfortunately, behaviors and patterns become so specific to a given person that to give a general diagnoses would be a waste of your time. Thus, you have to find the change that works for you.  I will continue to provide a personal example, but be sure to read the summary at the end as it will give you a more specific question to be asking yourself and others.<p>My major catalyst turned out to be a ""positive vs. negative framing"" situation. I framed all of my Y work as ""negative.""  Anytime I would be assigned something in the Y work category I would have quick and subtle thoughts run through my mind, ""Great... now I have to put up with this crap again. This work is so meaningless and doesn't even make sense. What I really want to work on is X. But this Y work is holding me back... how dare you Y work!"".<p>Framing my current or future situation in this negative way didn't allow <i>me</i> to provide myself with any ""intrinsic motivation"".  Instead my motivation was thinking about all of the cool X work I could be doing.  By simply identifying the framing of my thinking, catching myself in the ""quick and subtle"" negative thought process and a bit of self-coaching, my stress level (and thus happiness) shifted dramatically!  Doing these tasks became much easier.  The reason this happened was because I was able to stop my ""quick and subtle negative thoughts"" and tell myself things more along the lines of ""okay, so it looks like we were assigned some Y work. Is Y work really <i>that</i> bad? It is going to kill me. Probably not. In fact, I can't believe they are paying me to do Y work.  Oh look it's sunny outside!"".  Again, this was a behavior or pattern that was specific to me.  Yours may not be the same, but your outcome should be.<p>SUMMARY - find out what behaviors or patterns are holding you back from achieving the ""first or second degree"" and change them<p>TIME TO START<p>------------------------------------------------------------<p>So, in summary, look into what about the Y work really makes you avoid it.  Then, determine if what you are avoiding is as bad as it seems.  It is at this point that honesty really pays off (Personally, I could have easily answered this question with more ""quick and subtle negative thoughts"", but that would defeat the purpose). Finally if it doesn't seem worth avoiding, change your pattern or your behavior to something that serves you better.  To provide some encouragement, I have been able to achieve the ""second degree"" with my job.  I literally went from despising it to enjoy it!  It seems impossible, but it's true. I could really have just responded with the comment ""Oh hey, that sucks. You should do more positive framing"".  But my guess is that would not have helped you that much.

That has to be your sole motivation, as for most intelligent people, high school work in itself is not interesting in the slightest (although I was lucky to take a Constitutional Law class senior year that I loved).<p>However, don't despair: college work IS interesting. Unlike high school, a college will let you take essentially whatever class you want. Interested in physics? Take a class on special relativity. Interested in philosophy? Take a class that applies the theories of the great philosophers to modern moral problems. Interested in spaceflight? Take intro to aerospace engineering. At a university, the possibilities are endless, especially freshman year when you don't have to worry in the slightest about your major.<p>So, to sum it up, this is my advice: high school work sucks, but college, at least from what I've found, is awesome. Not only are you encouraged to take classes in areas that interest you, the atmosphere and social life is also incomparably better than high school. Your motivation thus should be directly tied to college: if you do not do this paper tonight, you will not get a good grade in this class, and you will not be able to get into as good of a college, meaning you may not be able to take high-quality classes in the areas that really interest you. It may seem like negative motivation, but if you view college as something good for you (and not just good for your career), it really becomes positive motivation. Good luck.",1255389310.0
