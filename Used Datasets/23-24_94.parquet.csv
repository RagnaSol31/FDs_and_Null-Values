Amazing talent and helped us really move the ball forward.<p>Here's our strategy:<p>- Generally provide stand-alone projects that are not 'busy work' but things that really help us.  This is good for us (real work) and good for student (real bullet points for their resume).<p>- We don't use career services at schools with the exception of a couple that are startup friendly.  Most are bureacratic (go fill this out on this portal blah blah blah) and when we use their channels, we get hundreds of 'spray and pray' candidates applying.<p>- Instead, we target programs and maybe even specific professors who teach classes in areas we're interested in, i.e., ""Tell us the best student you have in X from your class.""  We try to seek interns who have options (they tend to be the best ones).  This is not a trivial effort so something to keep in mind.<p>- Back to bullet 1, since we give the students real work, they tend to have great summers with us (or at least that is what they tell us).  These students become our ambassadors on campus for next year.  And we've found that these students (1) know what we need/like and how we work and (2) tend to know other people like themselves (smart) and so they refer us really great folks.<p>- Finally, we use interns as a great recruitment vehicle for full-time (may not be applicable).

The island was politically fragmented. Record keeping was poor. The very exceptionality of Bede's history would be one reason for its incompleteness. And wikipedia, at the time, was notoriously unreliable.",1284073436.0

They are supposed to lead by example here. Rackspace has no business censoring any of their customers content just because the don't like what it says, and are scared others won't like it. And who the fuck cares about their TOS/AUS—more than half of it goes well outside the boundaries of what any court would allow to be legally binding. If I put in my TOS that ""I can revoke your account anytime because I don't like you"", I cannot legally get away with it. At least in circumstances and for business contracts that matter—perhaps not web hosting.<p>No laws were broken. No law enforcement or court orders were submitted requesting the site be taken offline. <i>Rackspace pulled the plug just because they didn't like their customer's content and feared backlash by association.</i><p>The entire reason this matters is because it leads to a slippery slope that becomes the exact opposite of the Constitutional principles upon which America was founded. Where does the slippery slope stop? Can the electric company shut off this pastor's account because they don't want to be known as ""his electricity provider""? Can his bank cancel his home loan too? Why stop there—can every entity he does business with in the public market do likewise, and turn this man into a true outcast and force him to live off the grid? Is that what the American constitution says can happen with freedom of speech? No, it doesn't.<p><i>First they came for the religious holy book burners, next they came for..., then they came for me</i> etc, etc.<p>So the line must be drawn somewhere, and online public speech is a pretty damned good and early enough spot to draw it.",1284073425.0
