That could have saved some friction here.<p>A ship has only one captain, if the VCs are on the board they are represented as guardians, but not in a decision making capacity, only an advisory role.<p>Board decision are not nearly always unanimous, and it could very well be that a decision like this is determined during a general shareholders meeting if the board can not find a resolution. 1 share, 1 vote.",1284681527.0

3,1699543,story,,,3,3,throwaway999,Ask HN: how to decently ditch a job,,"Longtime user here, you know the drill.<p>Long story short: I took on a project I thought I would like, for a client I've got to be friends with, and which am competent for. 4 weeks later I've barely scratched at it, which is going to cause problems for him (competitive entry deadline) and raise the expense. I am an asshole.<p>Why? I've been moving away from that area of work, I agreed to do it for too little money which I don't need anyway, and the project arrived to me months late and with stuff missing. I should have said no, but I'm not good at that.<p>Mitigating factors: I have had some medical and domestic problems, which are genuine concerens. But they are not big obstacles, more like this project was the obstacle to the momentum I had going to deal with the other issues. The more I felt it was a distraction from ym important goals, the less I wanted to work on it, the less I wanted to work the more time I spent perfecting irrelevant marginal aspects (ie sharpening my tools because I'm gonna start on this <i>any time now</i>...), the longer that has gone one the more embarrassed I felt to pick up the phone and beg off.<p>I am late, the work is not done, I have let someone down, I am largely to blame and have made the situation worse by failing to deal with it. Although it will be hideously unpleasant, I am going to just admit this was what happened rather than cook up an excuse...external problems exist, but the failure to cope is all mine.<p>My question is short: what should I say besides 'sorry'?<p>The obvious answer would be to commit to done and have daily checkins or something, but I already loathe even thinking about this project although that is no fault of the originator, it's because of how it makes me feel about myself. I feel strongly that I should terminate my involvement, for both our sakes. In past tight corners I have gritted my teeth and pulled through, and been mad with myself afterwards for limping over a finish line.",1284681462.0

I ran some campaigns for ForeverList.com on Facebook and Adwords without much luck, though I'm admittedly not a pro at online marketing.  My target market is people with high ticket items that typically take a long time to sell like classic cars, boats, real estate, etc...  I happened to hear about a local boat show and I scrambled to put together a booth in one night, signed up the next morning and was working the show the next day.<p>The experience was awesome.  Selling to people face to face is was so rewarding, I can hardly describe it.  It made me despise adwords and the like.  I know I still need to embrace online marketing, especially since my business is entirely dependent upon traffic, but right now I'm pretending like online ad networks don't exist.<p>I only picked up 3 customers from the boat show, but last weekend I went to an auto swap meet 3 hours away that had hundreds of cars for sale and picked up another 62 customers.  We had a much better booth this time around with custom T-shirts and excellent fliers etc...  I hit the ground running and was selling HARD all day.  It was so awesome.  There were people who would have spit in my face if no one was around and other people who were falling over themselves to buy a listing.  I had one guy chasing me down because he lost my card and wanted another one so he could send me a check.<p>My advice is sell in the real world if you can, don't let the haters bother you (because you WILL have haters) and go far beyond your customers expectations.",1284680484.0

Maybe my similar experience can help you.<p>In a previous life, I ran tag-board.com, which placed a little javascript widget on your website that let your users interact with each other much like an irc channel.  This was before ajax was even coined a term.  The site still exists, but it's run down and I don't have anything to do with it anymore.<p>When I first started it, I never thought more than 100 people would ever use it.  At it's peak, there were 600k accounts and tons of traffic that went along with that.  At first I didn't care to make money, I was just happy that people used something I created, but when I realized I would need more than a $5/month hosting account, I started looking into options.<p>The first plan was actually a premium model - hack up a bunch of new features that would only be available to paying users and sell accounts for $20/year.  It worked, and might for you as well.  At some point, I had over 1,000 paying users.<p>After awhile, the problem was that hosting costs of the free accounts were eating a good part of the profits on the paid accounts AND I was spending a ton of time on maintainance.  I felt responsible for pretty decent uptime/performance/bug-freeness since I had people paying money.  A friend of mine pointed out that the amount of time/stress I was putting into this wasn't worth the money.  This made a ton of sense to me.  At that point, I strongly considered just keeping paying users alive until their year ran out, and then axing the whole thing.  I then realized that if I was willing to get rid of all my free users anyway, I might as well try something aggressive - I found an ad network and ran popups on the non-premium accounts.  This was ~2002.  To my surprise, I got fairly minimal grief, more premium signups, no noticeable drop in usage, and enough income to make it worth my while to keep going.  This lasted awhile, but popup revenue slowly dried up - firefox and other browsers started killing the popups.  I had handed the whole thing off to someone else well before that happened though.<p>If I were to do it again, I think I'd do the obvious thing that nobody recommended and just charge everyone for the service, although a much smaller fee (maybe $5/yr).  I'd let people sign up for free, use the account for a month, and then switch it over to showing an ""ad"" of sorts on <i>the owner's</i> website where the widget otherwise would be.  Clicking through would let the user interact with the widget, but on the ""ad"" would also be an option for a user of the website to buy the site owner a subscription to this widget.  This would dramatically increase the number of potential customers and would essentially be like a tip jar for the website owner.  Users could buy the widget as a gift for a website they like to use.  At the same time, I wouldn't try to stop people from just creating a new account and getting another month of free usage, but I'd annoy them forcing them to do this every month.<p>I don't actually know if this would work, but I think it would.  I suspect there would be fewer users.  However, as a side benefit, you would know what this is worth to those users, which is a nice feeling.  The negative here that scares many people from going this route is that if you suddenly start charging, you really do have to provide a service.  You can't go down for 2 weeks.  And you have to do a little bit of customer service (emails, refunds, fix bugs) or find someone to do it for you.",1284679512.0
