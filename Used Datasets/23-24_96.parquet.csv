So if their only motivation was taxes, they'd have waited.<p>Furthermore, I'm not losing any sleep about the government taxing only the portion of the value of a health plan that exceeds $27,500/yr -- in other words, the first $27,500 remains tax-free -- when the average employer-sponsored health plan is valued at $13,375/yr (2009). And here's what a $20,400/yr plan looks like:<p><i>For the secretaries and environmental engineers, game wardens and van drivers who work for the state of New Hampshire, surgery is free, even at Boston’s top teaching hospitals if it’s necessary. So are MRIs, CT scans, and X-rays.</i><p><i>Pregnant women pay nothing for prenatal care; alcoholics aren’t billed for short stints in rehab. Seeing a therapist costs just $10, as many as 20 visits a year, and prescription drugs top out at $30 for a three-month mail-order supply. New Hampshire state employees get $450 annually toward gym memberships, if they go regularly, or $200 toward their own treadmill - and there’s a $150 annual reimbursement for yoga classes, diabetes clinics, and nutritional counseling.</i><p><a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/07/04/healthcare_overhaul_could_limit_tax_breaks_on_benefits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/0...</a><p>Yea, cry me a river if well-paid employees now have to buy their own treadmills or pay for their own rehab.",1286582243.0

Those are also the features that people cared about and a big part why they were choosing MySQL over psql. At some point early lead turned into crushing defeat in terms of market and mind share.<p>You can claim that some other features constitute ""best free rdbms"" but clearly PostgreSQL team does think that those are included in that definition since eventually they added all of them. The problem is that they did it long after MySQL had them. Too little, too late.<p>The sad part is that it wasn't always a matter of coding but a matter of bad priorities and bad marketing (where I include defining what the product is and isn't as a fundamental part of marketing).<p>For example, I believe psql had high-quality full-text search coded before MySQL did but the core team resisted shipping it by default. Instead for a long time a super valuable feature was part of ""contrib"" package i.e. you had to jump through hoops (like compiling it yourself) to get it to work.<p>The main reason why PostgreSQL failed to MySQL was that the project was driven by extremely bright coders but terrible marketers.",1286581960.0

Access to a commercial kitchen is a significant barrier to entry for a food business. Commercial kitchens are big, complicated, and expensive to run—monthly overhead for Logan Square Kitchen, with utilities, pest control, waste pickup, janitorial services, insurance, etc, is about $10,000. Shared-use kitchens allow small-food artisans and other entrepreneurs to ramp up legally with a minimum of risk. Also known as contract kitchens, they're fully equipped and licensed spaces available for rent on an hourly basis to caterers, bakers, confectioners, and others who either can't afford their own kitchen or simply don't need a full-time workspace.""",1286579014.0
