Sure to work at Google means I can take one of their shuttles, but it also means I would have to live a lifestyle I dread: being someone who lives in a great city and commutes to a soulless suburb.<p>My favorite was always the companies who try to convince you to work later by offering you some half-assed dinner. I worked at a ""Netscape startup"" (because in the valley we like to brag what failed company our founders come from), and every night for 6 months they ordered some awful thai food for dinner, in order to try and convince everybody to put in an extra 2 hours.<p>And then you need to ask existing employees if the benefits are real. I had lunch with three of my friends in Google's SRE when GOOG was trying to convince me to work with them. Their response on the benefits:<p>- Daycare: bullshit, 1-2 year waiting list\n- Shuttle: Only if you don't mind working a crazy schedule and being at the whim of the shuttle schedule\n- 20% time: too over-worked to take advantage of it\n- Google tech talks: So what, they're free on Google Video<p>Valuating an offer is a complicated process. That's where ""Show me the money"" or ""fuck you, pay me"" is an effective mentality when a future employer is trying to con you into taking less than market rate. It's a sale, you convince them why you're worth the number you write on the piece of paper, or they convince you why you're not.<p>Do you want to work for an employee who thinks your work is worth less than you believe it's value to be?",1265241515.0

The infrastructure in places like the U.S. can handle food distribution for a much larger population, but in third world countries there is obviously a problem even with the current population.  So what we really should be thinking about is how to get the food to the people who need it, not how to produce more food.",1265241507.0

Clean-slate thought experiments are useful to figure out whether you're doing something because it's the best way to do it, or just because of legacy. That goes for both code and law.<p>In particular, some of the other critics of the Citizens United decision,  including ones who are a little more serious and a little less playful than the OP, are talking about a long-term campaign for a constitutional amendment to address this issue (I'm in particular talking about Larry Lessig and Change Congress, but there are others).  Such efforts might be political longshots, but how do you engage in discussions with them if you don't want to consider all the ways the law could be radically different, or could have evolved entirely differently?",1265241502.0

Unfortunately, the second footnote lends no more actual factual basis to this argument either.  The wikipedia article linked to uses equally vague generalities and has a similar pessimism towards elected officials -- it cites two articles from the NRO and a pretty bad article from the LA Weekly.  This comment is a conjecture -- one that assumes the worst in our public servants, and which does not actually cite evidence that people behave that way.<p>In fact, to show the lack of rigor in the argument, the point he makes could apply equally well to a business: ""It's not unusual"" for a shafted department head to try to cripple his unit (on paper or in practice) to demonstrate the vital need to have his budget restored in the next year.

In the worst case, they go out of business and no longer provide any services at all.<p>If a city government loses half their revenue, though, they're still expected to provide exactly the same services to the same number of people as before, and everyone cries bloody murder when services are cut, assuming that there must be something else to cut instead.<p>Logically, the analogy doesn't add up.<p>I totally agree that the incentives for government to be capital-efficient are very difficult to align properly, but I just don't buy the comparison to how a business is run.",1265239931.0
