Sure, there are <i>theoretical</i> weaknesses in TOR, but you'd need to control quite a few exit nodes to even begin to have a chance of pinpointing the endpoints.  Combine that with a compromised wifi as a last resort (which you erase the logs of regularly), and you're pretty damned safe.  All of the people who were arrested for hacking the CIA or DoD were caught many years ago, when anonymization tools weren't nearly so well developed, and the need for anonymization wasn't so clearly recognized.

I also really like certain programs including iMovie, Logic (music production), Photoshop. I've tried switching to Gimp, for example, which just doesn't feel right to an old-time Photoshop user. On Ubuntu, I was pretty happy with overall experience, and if I was ONLY using it for development, it would be just fine.

It's acute in the sense that it makes you very, very, sick and puts you in unbelievable pain. It goes away if you stop drinking. If untreated, it can kill you. The only way to stop it is to stop drinking, and believe me no matter how much an alcoholic you are, a single round of that shit will scare you off the booze for a long, long time. I still can't look at wisky. It's really truly that bad.

Of course, this is just a guess based on little information, but the self-made rich people I know?  they do rather than talking about doing.<p>It's actually fairly rare for people to change from their parent's class.

First, going from middle class to upper class requires very different skills than going from abject poverty to the low end of working class and from there to middle class.<p>It's interesting, 'cause I've lived most of my life as an upper middle class person, but for the last few years I've been living on a working-class salary, as I'm trying to get my business of the ground.

When ""Bob's Plumbing and Heat"" run a promotion and say ""Win a Toyota Camry!"", no reasonable person would presume that Toyota endorses or is otherwise affiliated with Bob.<p>Now let's look at what the Loopt UI looked like:<p>1 - It's presented in a way that's <i>extremely</i> similar to what all of the other group-buying websites look like. Which is to say, a reasonable person can <i>easily</i> confuse this for a deal from an affiliate (Groupon-style)<p>2 - The bullet points do not do anything to dissuade this. In fact, nowhere on Mr. Agrawal's screenshot does the website mention that the merchant must approve the deal.<p>3 - In fact, there is nothing on the page that would indicate to a user that this <i>isn't</i> the standard group-buying affiliate-deal we're all used to seeing. There's not even messaging in the vein of ""Tell Bi-Rite you want to see this deal!"" that might defuse confusion.<p>So it really comes down to reasonable interpretations. When a reasonable internet user, who has heard of Groupon, LivingSocial, et al, sees this Loopt UI - would it be reasonable for him/her to perceive a affiliation or endorsement for Loopt from the merchant?<p>Personally, I'm leaning towards ""probably"". Had the user base of HN not been tipped to the business model prior to seeing the feature, I would expect much confusion even from our seasoned web-guru user base.",1309043065.0

That seems like a benefit to me.\n- Merchant getting perceived as a discount brand. For many merchants, that's a negative.\n- Merchant having to deal with customer inquiries about a deal they know nothing about. That's a negative.<p>It should also be noted that Loopt picked really high profile businesses like Bi-Rite and Ritual Coffee. These places usually have lines and don't have much need to run large discounts.<p>If Loopt had picked obscure businesses, it would make it easier to claim they weren't trying to benefit from the business's good name.",1309042886.0

First off, it's boring and damn near unreadable (it was one of the only assigned books I never made it through in college). But in a larger sense, the slaves are ""heroic"" and ""emotionally nuanced"" only in the sense that HBS makes them fulfill a racial type: sympathetic, penitent, long-suffering Christians. They're treated more as people than as property, but more as caricatures than as people.<p>The interesting contradiction of UTC, to me, is that it had this enormous significance to history despite being terribly written. As a modern reader, I couldn't get any emotion about the book other than it being terrible.
