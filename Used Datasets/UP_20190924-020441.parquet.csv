On the first day of Spring 2018, UpToken has been listed on Bittrex! The sun is shining at Coinme’s headquarters, and we hope to share some of that light with you.  UpToken is a crypto asset that will accelerate the establishment of a global network of crypto ATMs for widespread access to virtual currency. Coinme ATM users who hold UpToken will benefit from discounted ATM fees and 1% “cash back” in the form of UpToken as well as exclusive voting rights.  For those who are unfamiliar with Bittrex, they provide individuals and businesses a world-class experience to buy and sell cutting-edge cryptocurrencies and digital tokens. Headquartered and fully regulated in the USA, Bittrex is the go-to spot for traders who demand lightning-fast trade execution, stable wallets, and industry-best security practices.  While we are proud that Bittrex listed UpToken, and believes in the mission of Coinme to provide access to crypto, we are even more excited to be working with a fellow Seattle cryptocurrency company. While many view Seattle as the home to giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Starbucks, and Boeing, we are honored to be a part of the incredible and robust ecosystem of blockchain and crypto-companies that call the pacific northwest home.  https://medium.com/coinme/uptoken-has-been-listed-on-the-bittrex-exchange-757c0c66c9fa",False

I told everyone I knew that Bitcoin was going to be huge.  In 2012, I published a paper on this forum about how to raise funds to build a protocol layer on top of Bitcoin, an idea which later became known as the “Initial Coin Offering.” After 1.5 years, still no one had taken the action to develop the idea. To show that it could be done, I launched Mastercoin (now Omni), in 2013, also on this forum. Today, the Omni platform hosts assets worth half a billion dollars, including MaidSafe and Tether. Only Ethereum assets are worth more.  In 2014, I predicted other things like the hacks on overly complicated Ethereum contracts losing millions of dollars.  These predictions were largely ignored.  Now it’s 2017. For years I have been waiting for “the perfect token sale”, and I finally found it. It may sound bonkers, but I predict crypto ATMs are going to be a really big deal in the coming years, and I helped design a token, UpToken, which captures that opportunity. I’ve partnered with a crypto ATM company that I think is best positioned to make a big move in this space (Coinme), and helped them design a token for ATMs called UpToken (uptoken.org). The proceeds from the token sale will be used to deploy bitcoin ATMs all over the world. We want “a bitcoin ATM on every corner.”  Here’s why I think UpToken represents “The Perfect Token Sale”  UpToken helps us all. Cryptocurrencies are changing the world, and a lot of people are getting left behind. Crypto ATMs can change that. Developing countries and the non-technical aren’t being reached. As ATM infrastructure improves, everyone can have access to fair money and financial services. UpToken doesn’t care who wins. Will Bitcoin win? Ethereum? Something else that hasn’t been invented yet? UpToken doesn’t care. In a gold rush, you’d rather be selling shovels than digging, and I think crypto ATMs represent the ultimate example of picks and shovels for the crypto economy. UpToken can help your favorite coin. Coinme ATMs currently buy and sell Bitcoin, and ethereum will be added shortly, but the owners of UpToken get to choose which coins are added to the ATMs after that. With UpToken, you can ensure there will be an ATM selling your favorite coin “on every corner!” (This is the main reason I am personally buying UpToken - I want to see “An Omni ATM on Every Corner”). UpToken already has traction. Most token sales are just an idea. Coinme has existing, operational hardware. Coinme wrote all the software, from the ATM firmware up to the web wallet. UpToken takes an existing functional technology and scales it up! Coinme continually buys UpToken. 1% of Coinme ATM fees in perpetuity are devoted to buying UpToken, which will be given to ATM customers as a rewards program. This “cash back” is locked from sale or transfer until the customer has done $10,000 worth of transactions at Coinme ATMs. In the meantime, UpToken can be used to pay Coinme ATM fees at a 30% discount. See the whitepaper for details. UpToken is scalable. In the ICO world, an idea that is worth only one million dollars might attract a hundred million dollars, which is grossly inefficient and wasteful. The perfect token sale should scale with the funds raised. If UpToken attracted a billion dollars, we’d use it all to build out our ATM network, each of which would use UpToken. In fact, the more funds UpToken attracts, the better, thanks to economies of scale. UpToken has no pre-sale. Most token sales give the best prices on tokens to rich insiders. UpToken gives everyone access to the best prices available. You can see on our signup spreadsheet (check out the millions of dollars pledged already!) that I am signed up alongside the rest of you, and my purchase will be treated the same as yours.  Can you see why I am so excited about this? I am posting about UpToken in various places, even though history suggests only a few visionary people will listen. But, if you are among them, you can learn more and sign up for the token sale at uptoken.org.  You can read more about me and see videos about my “crazy” predictions on my LinkedIn profile.  Laura Shin has a nice article about my story and UpToken on Forbes.com: https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/09/21/heres-the-man-who-created-icos-and-this-is-the-new-token-hes-backing/  TL;DR: I predicted Bitcoin would be big in 2010, invented the “ICO” in 2012 and tried to get someone to do the first one, but no one did. So I did. Now I have a new prediction: “UpToken is the perfect token sale.”",False

You are spot-on that some older brands Bitcoin ATMs are notoriously bad at AML / KYC (not naming any brands here!) and yes, as such, identity had to be checked manually before allowing one to purchase bitcoin or even switch the ATM on. Of course, this is simply not doable and yes, those machines have been switched off as you would need a human to patrol the machine at all times... Hardly a profitable enterprise that way and yes, an administrative nightmare.  However..... You will find that other brands and models, like the BATM Bitcoin ATM range have extensive AML / KYC options built in and can even deny anonymous purchases altogether, forcing people to ID themselves at the ATM using phone, fingerprint, ID, email or any combination that satisfies local authorities. (Yes, even the French and US authorities!) Once a user has registered on an ATM, they will be able to use all the ATMs in that operator network in the future.  Many old ATMs just focussed on 'making it work' and ignored any legislation or AML / KYC issues. Nowadays, this really is no longer the case and having the BATM do the KYC / AML instead allows ATM operators to scale in places previously deemed off-limits. In my opinion this a far better approach to vending crypto and the settings are flexible so ATM operators can comply with any legislation in practically any jurisdiction.  so no matter how horrible oppressive the regime, you will be able to configure your BATM to comply with any ridiculous legislation they might come up with... (like checking no-fly lists, block burner phones or prevent sales to banned crypto addresses, all supported out of the box on the BATM platform) For a detailed configuration video have a look here: https://youtu.be/L3M1tvWESTY?t=1h16m15s  Hope this clears up the confusion a bit!",False

I have a few question regarding the actual Token sale:  Why not use a smart contract for the contribution process? What is the actual process for gathering funds? Are refunds to be handled in a manual fashion In the event you do not meet 10m?   Pretty intimidating Token-Sale-Terms paper:) Sounds like i might be signing my life away:)  Thank you,",False

My goal was to use the simplest ERC20 code possible.  We are using a signup form to identify match up cryptocurrencies coming in against where UpToken needs to go out.  Yeah, refunds would be manual, but signups indicate we should blow way past $10M hopefully. Hard to tell since the signup form isn't binding.  Terms were written by lawyers - sorry - there's probably a clause in there that gives up your firstborn child too!",False
