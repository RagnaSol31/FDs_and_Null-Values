672,Wellhead pressure,"The pressure exerted by the fluid at the wellhead or casinghead after the well has been shut off for a period of time, typically 24 hours"
673,Wind chill,The effect of wind on the temperature felt on human skin.
674,Wind direction,Wind direction
675,Wind gust direction,Direction of gusts of wind
676,Wind gust speed,Speed of gusts of wind
