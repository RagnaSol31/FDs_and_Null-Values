0,amazon,It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.
1,amazon,Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.
2,amazon,The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.
3,amazon,This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.
4,amazon,If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.
5,amazon,Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.
6,amazon,"What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea..."
7,amazon,"The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low."
8,amazon,I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!!

10,amazon,AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.
11,amazon,"My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!"
12,amazon,Poor Talk Time Performance.
13,amazon,I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.
14,amazon,Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.

20,amazon,"When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off."
21,amazon,Not as good as I had hoped.
22,amazon,Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.
23,amazon,Doesn't do the job.
24,amazon,I bought two of them and neither will charge.
25,amazon,The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.
26,amazon,Its reception is very very poor.
27,amazon,It's AGGRAVATING!
28,amazon,Don't buy this product.
29,amazon,You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.
30,amazon,Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.
31,amazon,I Was Hoping for More.
32,amazon,The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.
33,amazon,All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.
34,amazon,"It felt too light and ""tinny.""."
35,amazon,"None of it works, just don't buy it."

41,amazon,Don't buy this product - It fails!.
42,amazon,"I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with."
43,amazon,I wasted my little money with this earpiece.
44,amazon,The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.
45,amazon,They do not care about the consumer one bit.
46,amazon,I could not recommend these more.
47,amazon,"This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts."
48,amazon,This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.

54,amazon,That company is a joke.
55,amazon,Returned 8 hours later.
56,amazon,Poor sound quality.
57,amazon,Please dont waste your money.
58,amazon,It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.
59,amazon,I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.
60,amazon,So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.
61,amazon,"I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason."

69,amazon,1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.
70,amazon,Would not reccommend.
71,amazon,Freezes frequently4.
72,amazon,This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.
73,amazon,This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.
74,amazon,Never got it!!!!!
75,amazon,"A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died."
76,amazon,I am sorry I made this purchase.
77,amazon,Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!

82,amazon,"I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem."
83,amazon,"During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars."

93,amazon,its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.
94,amazon,"Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!"
95,amazon,Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.
96,amazon,I'd like to return it.

137,amazon,Great for using with your home stereo.
138,amazon,Perfect for the PS3.
139,amazon,This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.
140,amazon,This device is great in several situations:1.)
141,amazon,A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.
142,amazon,Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.
143,amazon,It was a great phone.
144,amazon,I am more than happy with this product.
145,amazon,Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is
146,amazon,"I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions."

148,amazon,Nice headphones for the price and they work great!
149,amazon,I highly recommend this device to everyone!
150,amazon,"It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality."

152,amazon,I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.
153,amazon,"I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it."
154,amazon,I am glad I purchased it.
155,amazon,Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.
156,amazon,"Good show, Samsung."
157,amazon,Nice docking station for home or work.
158,amazon,"The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high."
159,amazon,"It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!"

161,amazon,Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.
162,amazon,Easy to use.
163,amazon,I've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.
164,amazon,Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.
165,amazon,This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.
166,amazon,Nice design and quality.
167,amazon,I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.
168,amazon,The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).
169,amazon,"I've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it."
170,amazon,This fixes all the problems.
171,amazon,"Light weight, I hardly notice it is there."
172,amazon,This PDA rocks.
173,amazon,It was quite comfortable in the ear.
174,amazon,"But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product."
175,amazon,"I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality."
176,amazon,"It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time."
177,amazon,SWEETEST PHONE!!!
178,amazon,I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.
179,amazon,im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.
180,amazon,Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!
181,amazon,"They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried."
182,amazon,"Provides good protection and looks classy, too."
183,amazon,This is a great deal.
184,amazon,My sister has one also and she loves it.
185,amazon,The iGo chargers and tips are really great.
186,amazon,Excellent product.
187,amazon,I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.
188,amazon,I've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I've found that fits my ear comfortably.
189,amazon,Beautiful styling though.
190,amazon,Great charger.
191,amazon,It is very comfortable on the ear.
192,amazon,This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!
193,amazon,This phone works great.
194,amazon,"Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful."
195,amazon,"This is a good battery, and it got here really fast."
196,amazon,I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.
197,amazon,I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.
198,amazon,But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.
199,amazon,I am also very happy with the price.
200,imdb,The story line is just awful!  
201,imdb,"I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  "
202,imdb,"I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  "
203,imdb,"This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  "
204,imdb,"Avoid, avoid, avoid!  "
205,imdb,The result is a film that just don't look right.  
206,imdb,Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  
207,imdb,"Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  "
208,imdb,The problem was the script.  
209,imdb,"To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  "
210,imdb,There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  
211,imdb,If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  
212,imdb,Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  
213,imdb,What this film lacks is a convincing script.  
214,imdb,The film is way too long.  
215,imdb,The acting is beyond abysmal.  
216,imdb,Not even good for camp value!  
217,imdb,Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  
218,imdb,This movie totally grates on my nerves.  
219,imdb,"It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  "
220,imdb,"The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  "
221,imdb,Really awful.  
222,imdb,This short film certainly pulls no punches.  
223,imdb,"Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  "
224,imdb,"I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  "
225,imdb,"However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  "
226,imdb,"I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  "
227,imdb,"One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  "
228,imdb,Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  
229,imdb,And it was boring.  
230,imdb,"This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  "
231,imdb,"Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  "
232,imdb,The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  
233,imdb,"The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  "
234,imdb,The movie is terribly boring in places.  
235,imdb,Awful.  
236,imdb,The acting was bad.  
237,imdb,This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  
238,imdb,Everything is appalling.  
239,imdb,"Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  "
240,imdb,One of the worst shows of all time.  
241,imdb,Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  
242,imdb,"Just whatever you do, avoid ""Groove"" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  "
243,imdb,"The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  "
244,imdb,The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  
245,imdb,"I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  "
246,imdb,"God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  "
247,imdb,"However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  "
248,imdb,Avoid at all costs.  
249,imdb,"One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  "
250,imdb,You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  
251,imdb,"I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  "
252,imdb,"But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  "
253,imdb,No plot whatsoever!  
254,imdb,"I saw ""Mirrormask"" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  "
255,imdb,"And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  "
256,imdb,but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  
257,imdb,A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  
258,imdb,"This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  "
259,imdb,This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  
260,imdb,The kids are annoying.  
261,imdb,The acting sucked.  
262,imdb,I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  
263,imdb,"However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  "
264,imdb,The worst one of the series.  
265,imdb,Even worse than Ticker!  
266,imdb,"In short, don't bother with this movie.  "
267,imdb,"I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  "
268,imdb,"For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  "
269,imdb,"Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  "
270,imdb,"Yes, it's that bad.  "
271,imdb,No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  
272,imdb,This film has no redeeming features.  
273,imdb,there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  
274,imdb,"), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  "
275,imdb,It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  
276,imdb,"The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  "
277,imdb,And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  
278,imdb,I came out of it feeling angry.  
279,imdb,"The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  "
280,imdb,"The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  "
281,imdb,It's just lame.  
282,imdb,"The scenes with the ""oh-so-mature"" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  "
283,imdb,The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  
284,imdb,The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  
285,imdb,"Then, there's the plot holes.  "
286,imdb,It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  
287,imdb,"The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  "
288,imdb,"Either way, it sucks.  "
289,imdb,"Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  "
290,imdb,"Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  "
291,imdb,Generally; it just lacked imagination.  
292,imdb,And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  
293,imdb,"I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  "
294,imdb,"This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  "
295,imdb,Do not waste your time.  
296,imdb,"He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  "
297,imdb,It's just painful!  
298,imdb,"It isn't even an achievement as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" or ""so-bad-it's-memorable"" movie.  "
299,imdb,"The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  "
300,imdb,The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  
301,imdb,"Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  "
302,imdb,"If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  "
303,imdb,It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  
304,imdb,"The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  "
305,imdb,"Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  "
306,imdb,Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  
307,imdb,BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  
308,imdb,"Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  "
309,imdb,"I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  "
310,imdb,It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  
311,imdb,Ray Charles is legendary.  
312,imdb,I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  
313,imdb,"Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  "
314,imdb,"I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  "
315,imdb,"The best part about ""Nurse Betty"" is it's unpredictability.  "
316,imdb,"It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  "
317,imdb,It deserves strong love.  
318,imdb,"The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  "
319,imdb,I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  
320,imdb,"""You'll love it!  "
321,imdb,"I just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features!  "
322,imdb,I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  
323,imdb,Highly entertaining at all angles.  
324,imdb,That was funny.  
325,imdb,The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  
326,imdb,add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  
327,imdb,Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  
328,imdb,I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  
329,imdb,This is a stunning movie.  
330,imdb,"This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  "
331,imdb,I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  
332,imdb,"She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  "
333,imdb,"When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  "
334,imdb,"Overall, a delight!  "
335,imdb,"Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  "
336,imdb,This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  
337,imdb,"It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  "
338,imdb,Go watch it!  
339,imdb,The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  
340,imdb,"So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  "
341,imdb,"Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  "

344,imdb,This is just a great movie.  
345,imdb,Highly recommended A+  
346,imdb,But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  
347,imdb,I liked it.  
348,imdb,"It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  "
349,imdb,"The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  "
350,imdb,"John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  "

354,imdb,"I loved it, it was really scary.  "
355,imdb,If you want a real scare rent this one!  
356,imdb,This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  
357,imdb,Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  
358,imdb,the cast was great.  
359,imdb,"This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  "
360,imdb,Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  
361,imdb,"Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  "
362,imdb,"The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  "

364,imdb,It Was So Cool.  
365,imdb,"The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  "
366,imdb,"Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  "
367,imdb,This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  
368,imdb,Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  
369,imdb,"Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  "
370,imdb,"The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  "

386,imdb,It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  
387,imdb,A standout scene.  
388,imdb,But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  
389,imdb,"It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  "
390,imdb,All of the main players are mesmerising.  
391,imdb,My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  
392,imdb,Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!

394,imdb,"Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  "
395,imdb,Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  
396,imdb,MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.

399,imdb,"His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  "
400,yelp,Worst Thai ever.
401,yelp,I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.
402,yelp,"If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people."
403,yelp,I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.
404,yelp,The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.
405,yelp,This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!
406,yelp,The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.
407,yelp,"No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it."
408,yelp,"If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen."
409,yelp,This was like the final blow!
410,yelp,"Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick."
411,yelp,But the service was beyond bad.
412,yelp,"It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk."
413,yelp,Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.
414,yelp,When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.
415,yelp,After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.
416,yelp,What a mistake.
417,yelp,Food quality has been horrible.
418,yelp,I got food poisoning here at the buffet.
419,yelp,But I don't like it.
420,yelp,The only downside is the service.
421,yelp,The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.
422,yelp,What a mistake that was!
423,yelp,"No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts."
424,yelp,The food wasn't good.
425,yelp,"Needless to say, we will never be back here again."
426,yelp,I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
427,yelp,Left very frustrated.
428,yelp,I dont think I will be back for a very long time.
429,yelp,"What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us."
430,yelp,It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
431,yelp,I won't be back.
432,yelp,"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."
433,yelp,"Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee."
434,yelp,And then tragedy struck.
435,yelp,"I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!"
436,yelp,Everything was gross.
437,yelp,I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
438,yelp,The service was extremely slow.
439,yelp,Food was really boring.
440,yelp,Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
441,yelp,And it was way to expensive.
442,yelp,Went for lunch - service was slow.
443,yelp,Waitress was a little slow in service.
444,yelp,The manager was the worst.
445,yelp,"Anyway, I do not think i will go back there."
446,yelp,I've had better atmosphere.
447,yelp,"I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho."
448,yelp,There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.
449,yelp,"The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time."
450,yelp,Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)
451,yelp,There was hardly any meat.
452,yelp,Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.
453,yelp,It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.
454,yelp,"To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted."
455,yelp,Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.
456,yelp,"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop."
457,yelp,I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!
458,yelp,I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.
459,yelp,My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.
460,yelp,The food was terrible.
461,yelp,Awful service.
462,yelp,They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
463,yelp,This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.
464,yelp,"It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry."
465,yelp,"However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good."
466,yelp,Never again will I be dining at this place!
467,yelp,AN HOUR... seriously?
468,yelp,"A greasy, unhealthy meal."
469,yelp,"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best."
470,yelp,"The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy."
471,yelp,Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.
472,yelp,"When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way."
473,yelp,We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.
474,yelp,"This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas."
475,yelp,The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.
476,yelp,Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.
477,yelp,The desserts were a bit strange.
478,yelp,Very bad Experience!
479,yelp,I never come again.
480,yelp,"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you."
481,yelp,Once your food arrives it's meh.
482,yelp,I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.
483,yelp,At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.
484,yelp,We won't be returning.
485,yelp,"Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables."
486,yelp,"It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad."
487,yelp,Sauce was tasteless.
488,yelp,So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
489,yelp,I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.
490,yelp,"Unfortunately, it was not good."
491,yelp,"After 20 minutes wait, I got a table."
492,yelp,!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!
493,yelp,Crust is not good.
494,yelp,Food was average at best.
495,yelp,It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.
496,yelp,"I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food."
497,yelp,He was terrible!
498,yelp,My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.
499,yelp,"Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house."
500,yelp,The chefs were friendly and did a good job.
501,yelp,The waitresses are very friendly.
502,yelp,The Macarons here are insanely good.
503,yelp,"Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal."
504,yelp,Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.
505,yelp,"I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!"
506,yelp,Owner's are really great people.!
507,yelp,Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.
508,yelp,Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!
509,yelp,"Phenomenal food, service and ambiance."
510,yelp,Reasonably priced also!
511,yelp,I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.
512,yelp,"Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered."
513,yelp,"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas."
514,yelp,Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.
515,yelp,The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.

523,yelp,"The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price."
524,yelp,The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!
525,yelp,"The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!"
526,yelp,Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.

535,yelp,"OMG, the food was delicioso!"
536,yelp,"Overall, I like this place a lot."
537,yelp,If you haven't gone here GO NOW!
538,yelp,Those burgers were amazing.
539,yelp,The inside is really quite nice and very clean.
540,yelp,"One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that."
541,yelp,"I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing)."
542,yelp,"Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even."
543,yelp,This is a good joint.
